link persuasive art and bind in magic ties the willing heart she gives to view the tyrants naked breast what guilt disturbs him and what fears insest she with abhorrence marks the traitors name and clothes ambition in the robes of shame depresses cruelty and rears on high the standard of imperial liberty is innocence by rigor stern subdued she steels her soul with conscious fortitude bids her

vain will they withstand another  brithric no doubt they will in native courage bold the warlike sons of isca never will droop by sudden fear overcome to conquer them patience with ardent valor must be joined nor will they yield till closed within the net of extreme fate and dire necessity  volnir how do thou know their character so well i thought thou toldst me thou were born far off upon the banks of trent  brithric i told thee true but who within these confines is a stranger to the damnonian fame their worth in arms even their foes confess before these walls for two long tedious months did sweno mourn illustrious monarch and with shame and rage beheld his blasted laurels nor at length but by a norman traitor gained the place ignobly gained it why o illadvised would thou sit down before it  volnir brithric hold no more with thy illomend notes presume to infest my ear have thou forgot old man when first i saw thee in thy boarded ship the sad survivor of thy vanquished crew covered with wounds when i preserved thy life and made my foe my friend for volnir never after the rage of fight could plunge his sword in the unguarded bosom of the brave  brithric no volnir i can never forget that day  volnir thou have forgot it else why interpose these frigid cautions have thou ever with arm or counsels aided me since first i urged the tide of war against the anglian shore now by my sword i swear when i have gained some glorious victory these eyes have seen thy cheek bedewed with tears  brithric and say could thou view ruin with gigantic stride pass over thy denmarks breast unmoved no surely no in other realms thou have not seen these feet behind thee linger my victorious arm gothland has witnessed and the frank the scot often fled before the lightning of my spear these were my enemies as well as thine but can a private tie even gratitude strongest of all make me forget the love i owe my country perish then this arm may these white locks unseemly strew the dust when my advice shall prompt or hands dare execu a guilty deed against my native soil  volnir why has thy native soil never paid thy ransom for well i know thou art not of the race of common men  brithric why ask of me a question thou best can answer would thou have permitted a messenger from me to seek my friends long long ever now my ransom had been paid thou know though pleased the more enlightened manners and customs of wellregulated states by my instructions taught to exalt me high amid thy warriors conqueror as thou art thou know i have not willingly forsaken those i held dear i left my souls best portion a valued wife a young and growing daughter an infant son i left could i forget in splendid slavery these tender names for life i am thy debtor and have served in other wars

thou well explored the country toward the north  rodolph i have no foe dares stand against us terrorstruck they fly and leave to us their numerous herds and flocks i traced yon winding stream for many a mile through it is luxuriant vale fit haunt for gods unlike our blasted heaths here plenty dwells clad in her richest robes could we possess the city with this scene before our view here might we fix our home and each nerve strung with double vigor brave the utmost force of the whole adverse isle a region this worthy of none but denmarks valiant race bear off these prisoners to my tent conduct

gate and took her thence by force  volnir enough retire  exeunt editha etc rodolph it ill becomes a soldier in the clamorous field of war to sigh at beautys feet it is ours to teach the eager sword to bite the crested helm to call the hawks of heaven and bid them mark the joys of fight to drench the ground in blood nor till returned from war to take the maid or blooming widow to our wished embrace  rodolph fear not my chief guarded with sacred care she dwells secure till placed within my ship a matchless prize  volnir so shall thy chief applaud thee now hear what we have purposed be it thine to head a daring band by me selected and when the moon dips in the cave of night her silver brow to scale with silent step yon castle walls myself will on the city pour my whole force and with incessant storm facilitate thy enterprise  rodolph my thoughts accord with thine plan thou each arduous deed and let this heart the bold designs fulfill  exit scene iii volnir brithric volnir marked you the virgin  brithric i observed her well her modesty her air above the vulgar her unaffected silent look of woe with strange emotions filled my heart i pity her  volnir her fate is to be envied rodolphs valor deserves the fairest where can beauty feel true pleasure but when clasped in the embrace of the intrepid warrior  brithric tender mourner who knows her grief her sad anxiety torn from her friends perhaps an aged father now beats his breast and curses in despair the cruel hand of fate a frantic mother perhaps now breathes her last in anguish wild calling in vain upon her muchloved daughter  volnir i blush to hear this weakness glad am i none of my noble danes are witnesses to this thy folly but if thou regardst my anger dare not with inglorious wailings disgrace my camp war is no school of pity nor would i that the spirits of my followers rough and invincible be ever degraded to the soft failings of the silken crew over whom they triumph why is strength imparted why the heroic soul but from the base unmanly grasp of cowards those possessions they merit not to wrest riches and beauty the harvest of their labors  brithric is it then denied to feel for the afflicted  volnir no but rule thy feelings like a man support thy natures frailty feed on grief in secret  exit brithric o curse to bear a mind whence sweet humanity by barbarous custom is exiled to know no virtue but ferocious brutal courage yet is this chief superior to his race and education which has steeled his soul to gentle pity has not quite erased the native sense of rectitude he spared my life and loved a valor like his own  the thoughts of this poor virgin still distress me such is my daughters age  but she is far distant it cannot be  and yet her mothers features rose to my mind  it is but the sport of fancy  oh could i but once more behold my children i then could die in peace  but who can tell whether some other band of these invaders may not have slain or hurried them away to sad captivity perhaps i mourn the absence of the dead or dead to me who never must behold them doomed to waste my days in misery and die a slave  enter rodolph brithric have thou so soon left thy fair prisoner  rodolph new to misfortune is the maid her sorrow resists all arguments persuasion fails nor will she hear a word of soothing comfort she will be calm anon these warmer passions soonest abate yet twas a scene of terror from whence i snatched her for the foolish crew their gates had barricadoed which provoked my gallant band to deeds of vengeance all but she and one whom at a postern door a youth bore off upon his rapid steed fell victims to the keen relentless sword  brithric whence were the other captives  rodolph they were taken from neighboring villages the soldiers plunder to them by lot distributed  brithric would thou should i request it suffer me to visit this captive in thy tent  rodolph hah do thou know what it is thou askst  brithric i do thou would be willing to dry her tears  rodolph i would  brithric it is for that purpose i ask an interview i am her countryman and should i to her ear unfold thy worth thy excellence above the other chiefs make her of that good fortune sensible which mid her depth of woe to thy possession devoted her may not her mind be moved soothed by the cheering speech of honest age and cast anxiety aside  rodolph i will trust thee thy snowy head proclaims that in thy breast the flame of warm desires long since extinct go brithric i would bend her to my wishes but not reluctantly the sickly appetite of impotence may provocation need in cold resistance but my glowing soul seeks equal passion and the yielding fair to bless must covet blessing  hence away i wait on volnir he has now demanded once more a parley and the haughty albert exonias prefect to our camp draws nigh  exit brithric protect these towers kind heaven though for the sins of guilty nations for a time these robbers bear thy vindictive scourge yet teach mankind at length that sacrilege and cruelty will draw the terrors of thy justice down that mercy is thy darling attribute and thy arm bared to punish not destroy  act ii scene i volnirs tent volnir and his captains volnir once more my noble friends who chose me willingly your leader in this war i mean to try whether by mild persuasion or by threats this albert may be shaken for though frankly you rush amid the tempest of the fight to you not dreadful and pour forth your blood as well becomes the brave yet do ye know to relish life and all its genuine pleasures for this we leave our barren rocks to tear from the luxurious arms of battening sloth its wealth superfluous and its gorgeous robes rich gems and spur to every great design the loveexciting fair nor would i rashly when dire necessity impels not urge your feet to dangers fatal paths  should albert depending on its strength refuse to yield this wellgirt city he like other foes may buy our absence dearly and bring forth the boarded gold and precious movables which the affrighted citizens shall give with pleasure while we seek our native land with ships fullfraught bearing a treasure thither greater than denmark ever saw before  captain conscious of thy superior worth we trust to thee our interest in the sanguine field or mazy treaty steadfast to pursue the path where volnir or where wisdom leads  enter rodolph with albert rodolph the prefect albert  volnir he does well to obey our summons  albert welcome  albert think not dane though proud thy speech that alberts acts are governed but by his own free will it is true i come and by thy message prompted but expecting no lordly looks to see to hear no terms of insult from a foe we need not dread our bulwarks laugh to scorn thy utmost force guarded by men prepared as thou have found buried beneath their ruins to expire ever stain their souls with infamy i come urged by an impulse to thy breast unknown that of humanity to bid thee fly for vengeance is at hand to bid thee spare the streams of blood which fate prepares to pour over these verdant fields for though revenge inspires though to the ravages of war you join fell cruelty though smoking villages women and children murdered well might steel to dire retaliation all our hearts yet dear is every citizen to me these eyes have seen enough of death already this hour is thine retire the next is ours and thy retreat cut off one general ruin involves you all  volnir albert i love thy boldness a foe thou art worthy a son of denmark to cope withal but have thou marked our camp and warlike preparation think not vainly thou can escape destruction flushed with conquest in every country from the frozen sea to this delightful region naught avails thy bravery against us yonder walls already totter to their deepset base consult then this humanity of thine open the gates so shall thou save the lives of thy devoted citizens and taste our amplest clemency  albert whence have thou gained this confidence audacious man because so spiritless was our defense when lately we beat thee from our ramparts when thy bravest fell at our feet in death and the remainder to their intrenchments fled can this have taught thee to boast to threaten  by the inhabitants of this one town alone thus roughly treated when the collected force of devon bursts in thunder on thee as ever long it will thy ravens wing whose plumes already moult shall rise no more but in the dust be trod scorned by the meanest peasant of our isle  volnir so rashly warm  albert so reasonably bold  volnir to cease this idle play of language vain and foreign to our purpose should we quit these girded walls devoted to our will  your citizens are rich say with what sum will they their freedom and their lives redeem  albert perish the thought were our streets paved with gold expect not dane from us the shining treasure for thee we hoard up naught but steel to which thou art right welcome  volnir be it so  but albert when ruin enters over yon towers when horror and fell destruction riot in your streets accuse not us of cruelty the obstinate urge their own fate our consciences are free  albert we will acquit thee dane till then farewell  exit volnir prepare my friends from this determined man expect no common shock each to his post yet has our steady and unshaken valor met greater dangers than his utmost power can bring in opposition and with ease subdued them all only resolve to conquer and youre already conquerors  exeunt scene ii rodolphs tent editha o state of horror worse than death itself yes i would die with pleasure to the sword submit my neck or run to meet the blow but save me spotless heaven say who art thou  enter brithric brithric a friend a countryman by rodolph sent   editha rodolph detested name  brithric and why detested thou art a stranger to his worth his love   editha it is monstrous name it not said thou his love thou can not mean it  brithric calm these transports virgin and hear me plead his cause  editha i will not hear thee it is poison to mine ears dishonest englishman leave me hence to the robber who employed thee fittest society  brithric impassioned thus i will not leave thee bred up in prosperity thou have not tasted miserys sad cup and therefore viewst thy lot with double anguish but time with lenient hand will soothe thy grief and teach thee to repay with gratitude the care the love the warm desires of rodolph  editha have thou outlived thy feelings or art thou a willing slave a traitor to thy country or were thou forced upon this odious task thou know me not  i pity and forgive thee  brithric yet if resentment for thy countrys wrongs or thy own injuries if the esteem of honor and the innate love of virtue permit thee not to yield try what thou can to gain forbearance try dissimulation to feign for honest purposes is lawful he will submit and lucky opportunity perhaps will crown thy wisdom  editha base adviser close thy unhallowed lips when thee i violate o pure sincerity o holy truth when i shall cease thy mandates to adore may ignominy be my portion here and heaven refuse me happiness hereafter of all the vices which my soul abhors there is none whose dire communion i would shun like vile deceit to every other crime it forms a path till the whole breast becomes a storehouse of pollution  as for thee whose abject mind is suited to thy station hence from my sight and torture me no more for know i want no counsel but my own  brithric how i admire this warmth  aside o gentle maid whose anger in so just a cause delights the heart attuned in unison with thine excuse an old mans policy who looks with tenderest sympathy on thy affliction who wished to prove if thy interior graces equaled thy outward charms who knows thy danger and would pour forth his blood to give thee safety for thou art like  o heaven  editha can i believe this sudden change thy face indeed is honest and those white hairs of age claim reverence the tear too wets thy cheek  but why suspect me thy trial shows thou did can with integrity suspicion dwell so odious a companion  brithric twas not suspicion i disclaim its weakness twas chance twas curiosity desire to have thee higher rise in my esteem twas any thing but a design to injure thy purity of soul when first i saw thee methought my heart was linked to thine i vowed to do thee service but alas what service can i a wretched prisoner afford i may lament but cannot rescue thee  editha o edred where art thou o bertha bertha  brithric what said thou what  editha whence is this wild emotion why do thou fix thy eyes and gaze thus on me  brithric did thou not mention edred  editha what of him  brithric and bertha too  editha i did  brithric are they thy friends  editha my mother and my brother  brithric and thy name   editha is editha  brithric thy father   editha was earl sigebert  brithric i i am he o editha my child i am thy longlost father i am sigebert  editha my father is it possible my father  brithric i am indeed oh i am wild with joy  editha and shall i know the blessing of a father  brithric thou shall thou shall oh not the light itself not the warm blood which gives me motion sense shall be so dear to me i thought i saw the features of my bertha o my child my lovely editha  but in this place and in this rodolphs power ye angels stoop stoop on your wings of grace and save my child where is that best of women where is bertha and where thy brother are they not in mercia by what strange mystery art thou prisoner here  editha o my dear father to pronounce that name thrills my whole soul with pleasure edreds valor and youthful merit won the royal favor of our great master ethelred another possesses thy inheritance to him he gave domains which far exceeded thine here in the bounds of devon ample rights forests and large command thy sad misfortune was in this grateful bounty not forgotten for long we have thought thee dead unnumberd tears has bertha poured and still the painful sigh often swells her bosom when she heard thy ship was by a tempest severed from the rest she feared the greedy waves had swallowed it and mourned in bitterest woe her husbands death  brithric oh had it not been severed denmarks sons had not so long spread ruin over my country i had not yielded to this danish chief oppressed by numbers nor with him dragged out eighteen long years of tedious servitude nor had the father and the daughter thus met helpless captives but where is she now and where my son  editha this morn when last i saw them  oh thou recallst the dreadful scene of blood the horrid massacre within that sanctuary had bertha and myself retired for safety when at one gate the foe demanded entrance we heard the voice of edred at the other either by chance or fearing their intent he came but unattended strait he placed my mother on his courser and outstrippd the winds for her deliverance  brithric noble youth  editha by this no doubt he has regained the city where with his household train in deeds of danger he is the foremost and encourages the most remiss to action  brithric o my daughter grief mingles with my joy  preserve him heaven and lead him on to victory  for thee i weep my editha ah what avails it that thou were snatched from slaughter if thou now must be exposed to savage violation  editha let us not murmur that almighty power who saved me there as by a miracle can here support me  brithric in that power i trust but i must guard thee with a fathers love and dangerous is the path i shall pursue i will hence to volnir in whose breast i claim some share of confidence to him disclose rodolphs instructions his design on thee i will enlarge on his inglorious passion so strict his discipline he will i know divide you till they reembark meantime i may devise some other plan to save thee  editha to thee and heaven do i commit myself  brithric farewell my child i could almost persuade my old fond heart that innocence like thine might melt the most relentless son of denmark to soft humanity  farewell farewell  exit editha farewell may alloverwatching providence assist thy pious care and shield thy daughter  enter rodolph rodolph once more my beauteous captive ever i plunge amid the storm of war i come to hear more gentle accents from thy mouth to meet more gentle glances from thy eyes  has brithric my friend thy ancient countryman been with thee  editha he has  rodolph thou viewst me with the look of scorn and his persuasions have not overcome that stubborn heart  editha away i would reproach thee but sentiments like mine will prompt a language thou can not understand  rodolph hah do thou know my power over thee is absolute  editha i know it to wounds to accidents to violence this outward frame is subject but the mind enjoys her glorious freedom uncontrolled  rodolph nor have i hurt that mind though privileged by war and conquest  editha rather say by sacrilege rapine and cruelty all other nations respect the matron and the hoary sire melt at the virgins and the infants tear thy savage race intent on ruthless slaughter heeds none of these nor can the holiest places protect them from their fury like the tiger which loves to swim in blood and tears the flock though gorged with food in frantic wantonness  rodolph what treatment can a foe expect but death or slavery from a foe we have not yet enervated our minds by southern manners nursed in the arms of war i love the fight the whizzing arrow and the flying spear the clang of shields and tempest of the field to love my country and to hate my enemy be mine what virtue can exalt the soul of man but courage  editha mercy and compassion which bind a wreathe around the warriors helm and lead his footsteps in the paths of glory  rodolph and guard him doubtless in the day of battle by these your englishmen have fought so bravely and with resistless ardour stopped our course such virtues ever may my foes possess  editha o blind to truth uncivilized barbarian with what disdain the polished soul beholds the man who sinks himself beneath the brutes  rodolph no more thou will perchance repent this pride  editha no i despise thee from a nobler motive i soar above thee conscious of a dignity thy heart never felt the dignity of virtue  rodolph that be thy solace here i go to execute my chiefs commands the moon has left the heavens the clouds of night hang over the sleeping city and lull it to its fate though clothed with beauty excelling all my eyes have seen before yet think not i shall soothe and fawn and kneel for favors in my power  thou art my captive  editha but am thy captive only while i please think thou i prize my life beyond my honor  rodolph the words of many a fair who to enhance the boon would make it difficult to win so far i have been thy lover when i next return with victory expect thy master  exit editha a slave a master  yet i could submit to the most humble servile offices with innocence companion of my toil if my own heart reproached me not nor shame sat kindling on my cheek  and could i leave my native country leave my friends my brother a mother who her being wrapped in mine lives but in me o my dear longlost father so lately found save save me from the thought yet what can thou a slave to these barbarians a wretched slave  oh never shall i see my parents meet a witness to their joy i shall not tend their age and smooth its cares or drop the pious tear upon their grave  who knows my future fate  my soul shrinks back nor through the horrid gloom dares penetrate o thou supreme over all to whom i bend with humblest duty let thy power be shown confound tyrannic force support the weak and from afflictions soul remove despair  scene iii the city albert and citizens albert the time requires our strictest vigilance is the watch doubled have thou visited each quarter of the ramparts  citizen i have  albert protected by our walls and more by love of liberty by brave disdain and hatred tward our unrelenting foes we need not fear  this bold adventurer equal to swein in bravery and conduct whose fame in arms has called forth denmarks sons by choice to follow his unfolded standard shall with his numerous host or starve beneath our unscaled mounds or seek their ships with shame if as i trust you will with steady valor you guard your native city if your deeds answer in future to your last days actions and lo where comes our succor and support heroic edred  noble youth right welcome thou have succeeded in thy enterprise  edred in part and but in part  alas my friend what we this morning dreaded is complete the inhuman dane no holy place reveres the abbey is despoiled the virgin train murdered assisted by the hand of heaven bertha is saved  but oh my noble sister how cruel is her fate a prisoner to these barbarians seeing them retreat i turned my steps and sought among the slain she was not to be found  i have not time to tell thee all for as with stealthy pace skreend by the gloom of night through secret paths the careful foe i shunned methought i heard a sound confused of feet and murmuring voices and strait the glimpse of armor caught my eye some action is on foot they seemed to me as winding tward the castle  albert let them come they steal not on a sleeping enemy we are prepared and as a lofty rock beats back the furious waves which rage in vain so shall before our wellmannd battlements these ravagers retire  i see thy grief thou gallant youth and for thy hapless sister feel similar emotions to thy own the lovely editha all hearts confess unparagond in beauty and in virtue  edred oh witness heaven no common love i bore her no brother ever better loved a sister and she deserved my love  her active soul soaring above the weakness of her sex my younger spirit raised to glorious daring when but a boy she to my listening ear taught all the martial deeds of my great ancestors she set before my eye my fathers virtues whose early death my mother ever mourns and bade me tread like them the paths of fame if aught within this breast transcends the vulgar to her the debt is due the generous fire by her was kindled  albert twas unfortunate   edred oh it was greatly so that they should think the ties of faith would check those lawless robbers that i should suffer them to put in practice so idle a resolve exposed to danger when here with us they might have dwelt in safety for what is sacred to the danish race they spare not hoary age nor innocence within its mothers clasping arms inshrined nor even religion at the hallowed altar  albert would i could comfort thee  edred that wish is vain nor seek i any comfort but revenge join with me there my friend let us this instant pour forth the tide of fury on their camp my eager sword is thirsty for revenge the holy virgins weltering in their blood my ravished sisters wrongs now urge me on string all my nerves and fill my soul with ardour  albert thou have forgot thy tidings  but whatever shall happen all is ready for defense or vigorous onset by ech public motive and private sentiment impelled this arm shall join with thine in boldest enterprise and deep upon the danish crests inscribe in bloody characters the holy compact but much i wonder oswy with his powers is not as yet arrived this morn he sent a messenger who told me ever the sun set in the west we should behold his camp pitched on the neighbouringhills with hasty march he from the bounds of tamar to our aid approaches  edred never did my heart esteem that lord in words most fierce in action cold of crafty and designing nature he a slave to avarice and inherent baseness  albert he has a beauteous daughter  edred true he has gunhilda with an ample dower to me he would have given the maid but underneath the veil of fairest semblance i beheld a soul too like her fathers and refused her since which enraged they ever have pursued me with base insidious hate which i despise  a trumpet sounds albert the signal of alarm  enter a citizen citizen our scouts inform us a party of the foe in deepest silence is climbing the ascent toward the castle another party to the eastern gate with rapid haste advances  albert this my edred this is the wished for hour the hour of glory she holds her prize aloft and animates the chosen breast with tenfold intrepidity  the castle be thy care we guard the gate and now my friend the warriors courtesy one brief embrace  the rest belongs to heaven  edred and heaven is just  my keenedged sword i draw which shall not to its scabbard be restored till drenched and satiated with danish blood  exeunt act iii scene i the camp volnirs tent volnir rodolph and danish captains volnir again repulsed again with shame compelled to seek our camp the danish genius droops oh where was rodolphs matchless valor where that untamed spirit wont to rise superior to every obstacle the waves of chance to stem with steady breast and gain the shore to press against the hand of opposition and urge his way more swiftly for resistance but love fond love enslaved the warriors heart beautys soft chains had shackled his bold spirit and he was conquered ever he sought the fight now by my soul thou see the fair no more till we have laid those turrets in the dust and steer our course tward denmark  rodolph these reproaches no doubt become thee well injustice ever with weak excuses vindicates its actions scarce can i trust my ears these taunts from thee but i am perhaps a stranger and thou never beheldst my footsteps in the crimson field or sword destructive dealing slaughter round and did thou take my captive from my tent and do i live and bear this injury  volnir no more rash man learn thou thy duty better did i not charge thee not to woe the maid what shall our camp be changed into a school of wanton dalliance of inglorious love our deeds depend not on the breath of rodolph we judge we act from reasons firm resolves  rodolph oh would we were in denmark i should there meet thee thy equal see my friends the man who acts who judges as firm reason dictates he saw the beauteous prisoner he loved her and from his envied rival took the maid but love no doubt is glorious in the chief and base unmanly dalliance in the soldier  volnir what power withholds that now i rush not on thee and smite thee to the earth  the fixed soul which conscious of its rectitude despises a madmans calumny  but urge no farther it may be dangerous  yet hear me all and thou attend  in yonder tent enclosed she dwells to me as though she not existed or was not formed of mortal elements and subject to the passions of mankind no private end i seek the public good is all my care and from the warm emotion a bar of frost secures this settled bosom retire and in thy tent converse with shame the attendant of unguarded liberty and thoughtless youth i pardon thee begone  exit rodolph enter a soldier soldier as in our farthest limits tward the city i with my fellows held observant watch a damsel crossed our way with two attendants she bade us straitway lead her to our chief and begs to be admitted to thy presence  volnir bring her before us  enter gunhilda volnir mid the paths of death and throng of hostile arms say gentle maid what brings thee hither at this hour of night  gunhilda art thou the muchfamed leader of the danes  volnir my name is volnir  gunhilda hail illustrious chief my errand is to thee and my request the favor of thy private ear  volnir retire  to the attendants thy will is granted from a messenger so beauteous and so rare i may expect no common tidings whence and who art thou  gunhilda from devons west extreme i come a friend to thee and denmark  volnir how a friend proceed  gunhilda art thou ambitious over this town to triumph to gird the conquerors laurel round thy brow and all thy valiant host enrich with plunder a female tongue shall teach thee how to act  volnir whoever thou art whatever be thy counsel thou readst my wish aright  gunhilda i am the daughter of oswy powerful chief a name to thee wellknown my name gunhilda in our veins flows danish blood ever that inhuman massacre destroyed thy countrymen by holy union of marriage twas acquired  volnir say on fair damsel  gunhilda thus then my father with a mighty aid is near at hand prepared to raise this siege so albert credits so the citizens but if thy heart consents with his to terms which i shall now propose the town is thine  volnir what bond coercive answers for his faith  gunhilda i will remain with thee a willing hostage  volnir it is well the terms unfold  gunhilda on oswys part he promises when host with adverse host is mixed in fight to fly with all his troops then while the citizens confusedly urge their way toward the walls thy friends may enter with the affrighted crowd or ever two days are past when he is in the city posted he will the gate committed to his care to thee deliver at a certain hour from thee he asks in coin in plate or gems secretly given a third part of the spoil he wishes thee to curb impetuous rage nor shed unnecessary blood but one one odious life he at thy hands requires  volnir name the devoted victim  gunhilda edred he who every needy artizan inspires with pride and every vile mechanic breast with obstinacy he it is who checks thy course thy greatest enemy and ours  volnir i know the youth when first we for this siege prepared he came with albert and defied our power bold were his words and stately was his mien i saw him afterward like lightning pierce our thickest ranks his fury front to front rodolph opposed and desperate was the fight but rodolphs arm prevailed not on he rushed and havoc marked his way this night again his valor foiled us he our prisoners say the citadel defended we accept thy terms fair stranger to the noble oswy we swear the third part of the spoil to give and edreds forfeit life  gunhilda he asks no more the first he claims a debt of justice due from thee to his deserts the last a sacrifice to the diminished honor of his house and sullied name twere long nor need i tell the cause of his desired revenge enough that edred is beyond expression base vile contumelious and that we would see with pleasure see this island from its base torn by an earthquake and with all its rocks plunged in the main so he might sink beneath the ponderous ruins  volnir be it as thou will my generous hostage we will pay the debt of justice and of vengeance were he placed within our power had he a thousand lives he dies  gunhilda that thought gives comfort to my soul for

pierce through my inmost bosom and enkindle transports never felt till now  but how so long were thou concealed how in this hostile camp why in this danish dress  sigebert the tale is long i will tell thee all anon  but how my daughter have thou escaped in disappointed rage the barbarous rodolph said that he had slain thee for which he fell by my avenging sword in all the agony of frantic grief entering thy tent i thought i found thee there yet warm  though breathless in despair i clasped the bleeding corse and by the dusk deceived mourned over it for thine  edred me too the dane informed that thou were dead within thy tent and almost stained my hand with parricide but providence sent thee to save my soul from horror and remorse  say how my sister did thou escape and who is slain for thee  editha gunhilda was no doubt the fated victim  edred gunhilda  editha oswys daughter  edred treacherous maid i know her fathers baseness and her own the intercepted guides who led her hither discovered all  editha one tent confined us both i thought her too a captive and with pity returned her seeming pity she revealed my rank to volnir thence his threatening message my simple confidence betrayed my father by which when bravely thou defiedst his power we both had wellnigh fallen a sacrifice  sigebert had thou not stormed their trenches we ever now had with the dead been numbered  editha when i found that thy assault was prosperous and the foe fled headlong from our gallant countrymen i from my tent rushed forth if possible to find my father trembling in the entrance gunhilda stood fearful to stay or fly  edred and there no doubt my sister fell for thee by rodolphs blind and erring fury slain  editha through the deserted camp in vain i wandered i found not whom i sought till by the hand of heaven directed dubious of my way i measured back again the mazy path and found him here  sigebert found me indeed and never to part from thee again till natures hand stops my

country saved shall join its praise with mine  edred how far my friend was thy pursuit  albert to yonder heights they fled there were they rallied by their chief again who bravely fought all that a leader could to turn the desperate fortune of the day he did at length when all was lost he joined his flying bands who now in wild dismay haste to their ships our victorys complete but say my friend the treacherous gunhilda have thou not found her in the camp  sigebert she lies dead in this tent slain by mistake for her  albert for editha just heaven  sigebert now let us hence this accident shall

him  edred does he not merit punishment  sigebert he does and can he feel a greater than to view his murdered child could cunning cruelty devise one more severe  oh editha the tortures of the rack were light to this well know i what a father must endure to think too that she fell by his contrivance no gallant albert seek no other vengeance permit him to retreat oppressed with sorrow and stung with conscious guilt while we reflect with pleasure on the difference of our souls which bear no sordid stains while we rejoice raised from calamity and woe to bliss while we congratulate our ransomed country and as we offer up our thanks to heaven pray that she ever thus may stand secure from foreign arms and from domestic treason free glorious happy to remotest ages  finis epilogue no longer now in pomp of grief arrayed no longer editha the captive maid prepared to examine this same tragic story in my own person i advance before ye my critic art at least this once to try and scan our bards
