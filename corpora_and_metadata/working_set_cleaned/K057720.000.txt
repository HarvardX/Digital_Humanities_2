extreme succeeds beyond the patient mean if eminence in rank our bosoms fire if merit to preferment dare aspire follow the active not the formal part and snatch a grace beyond the rules of art bold strokes from bounding genius firmly struck attract success more than the turns of luck the bankrupt swindler though to pay unable often mends his fortune by the e o table or failing there he acts a braver part and takes a purse  a bold stroke for the cart the gamester too forgets each tender tie and ventures his last guinea on a die till ruined and repenting of the evil he hangs himself  a bold stroke for the devil the fortune hunter sports a suit of lace in this a count a lord in the other place success at length begins his married life at gretna green  a bold stroke for a wife but are bold strokes to vicious men confined does virtue lie inactive in the mind it cannot be while englands genius breathes and many a brow is decked with laurel wreaths bold strokes in war are englands greatest pride think how a hood has lived a manners died our play holds forth the conquest of a heart by one bold stroke of nature not of art a female pen calls female virtue forth and fairly shows to man her

yourself from that disgrace you prudently looked out in time for another lover   lau i can pardon your sneer because you are mortified   car mortified   lau yes mortified to the soul carlos i know your sex the vainest female in the hour of her exultation and power is still outdone by man in vanity  it is more your ruling passion than it is ours and it is wounded vanity that makes you thus

with all my sexs weakness i had knelt at your feet and reproached you only with my tears how composed would have been your feelings  scarcely would you have deigned to form a phrase of pity for me perhaps have bid me forget a man no longer worthy my attachment and recommended me to hartshorn and my women   car has any hour since i have first known you given you cause for such unjust    lau yes

of our connection of which i am not ashamed   car base woman you know twas not a voluntary gift  after having in vain practiced on my fondness whilst in a state of intoxication you prevailed on me to

florio her life her soul and complaining of a twelve hours absence as the bitterest misfortune   oliv ha ha ha most doughty don pray let us see you in your feather and doublet as a cavaleiro it seems you are formidable so suddenly to rob your husband of his charmers heart you must have used some witchery   vict yes powerful witchery  the knowledge of my sex oh did the men but know us as well as we do ourselves  but thank fate they do not twould be dangerous   oliv what i suppose you praised her understanding was captivated by her wit and absolutely struck dumb by the amazing beauties of  her mind   vict oh no  that is the mode prescribed by the essayists on the female heart  ha ha ha  not a woman breathing from fifteen to fifty but would rather have a compliment to the tip of her ear or the turn of her ancle than a volume in praise of her intellects   oliv so flattery then is your boasted pill   vict no that is only the occasional gilding but it is in vain to attempt a description of what changed its nature with every moment i was now attentive  now gay  then tender  then careless i strove rather to convince her that i was charming than that i myself was charmed and when i saw loves arrow quivering in her heart instead of falling at her feet sung a triumphant air and remembered a sudden engagement   oliv archly would you have done so had you been a man   vict assuredly  knowing what i now do as a woman   oliv but can all this be worth while merely to rival a sickle husband with one woman whilst he is setting his feather perhaps at half a score others   vict to rival him was not my first motive the portugueze robbed me of his heart i concluded she had fascinations which nature had denied to me it was impossible to visit her as a woman i therefore assumed the cavalier to study her that i might if possible be to my carlos all he found in her   oliv pretty humble creature   vict in this adventure i learnt more than i expected  my oh cruel my husband has given this woman an estate almost all that his dissipations had left us   oliv indeed   vict to make him more culpable it was my estate it was that fortune which my lavish love had made his without securing it to my children   oliv how could you be so improvident   vict alas i trusted him with my heart with my happiness without restriction should i have shown a greater solicitude for any thing than for these  weeps oliv the event proves that you should but how can you be thus passive in your sorrow since i had assumed the man i would make him feel a mans resentment for such injuries   vict oh olivia what resentment can i show to him i have vowed to honor and whom both my duty and my heart compel me yet to love   oliv why really now i think  positively there is no thinking about it it is among the arcana of the married life i suppose   vict you who know me can judge how i suffered in prosecuting my plan i have thrown off the delicacy of sex i have worn the mask of love to the destroyer of my peace  but the object is too great to be abandoned  nothing less than to save my husband from ruin and to restore him again a lover to my faithful bosom   oliv well i confess victoria i hardly know whether most to blame or praise you but with the rest of the world i suppose your success will determine me   enter gasper gasp pray madam are your wedding shoes ready  to olivia oliv insolence i can scarcely ever keep up the vixen to this fellow  apart to victoria gasp you will want them maam to morrow morning that is all  so i came to prepare ye   oliv i want wedding shoes

oliv immured in a convent then i will raise sedition in the sisterhood depose the abbess and turn the confessors chair to a gocart   gasp so the threat of the motherinlaw which i thought would be worse than that of the abbess does not frighten ye   oliv no because my father dares not give me one  marry without my consent no no he will never think of it depend on it however lest the fit should grow strong upon him i will go and administer my volatiles to keep it under   exit gasp administer em cautiously then  too strong a dose of your volatiles would make the fit stubborn whod think that

took particular notice that it was to be in private  sure says i mrs inis madam victoria has not taken a fancy to me and is going to break her mind   vict whimsical ha ha suppose i should gasper   gasp why then madam i should say fortune had used you devilish scurvily to give me a gray beard in a livery i know well enough that some young ladies have given themselves to gray beards in a gilded coach and others have run away with a handsome youth in worsted lace they each had their apology but if you run away with me  pardon me madam i could not stand the ridicule   vict oh very well but if you refuse to run away with me will you do me another favor   gasp any thing you will order madam except dancing a fandango   vict you have seen my rich old uncle in the country   gasp what don sancho who with twothirds of a century in his face affects the misdemeanors of youth hides his baldness with amber locks and complains of the toothache to make you believe that the two rows of ivory he
