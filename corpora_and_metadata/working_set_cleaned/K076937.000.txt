an account of the nature and excellent properties and virtues of the pyrmont waters dedicated to the royal society and college of physicians which are imported in flasks by mr burges at the blue anchor in fleetstreet druggist  london printed by j downing and sold by tim goodwin at the queens head against st dunstans church in fleetstreet       this account of pyrmont waters is dedicated to the most excellent sr isaac newton president of the royal society and to the excellent dr john bateman president of the college of physicians by frederick slare m d fellow of the college of physicians and of the royal society so great and so just is the fame and wisdom of sir isaac newton that his approbation of any subject in physic or philosophy suffices to recommend it to the world without the necessity of superadding arguments reasons or experiments to give it more credit or authority but we have also the concurring testimony of another person eminent for solid erudition president of the facultas medica or college of physicians it was in your presence sirs and not in yours alone but together with several fellows of both these illustrious societies before whom the pyrmont waters were brought and have been examined by several experiments and were tasted and by you were highly commended for their strength and grateful taste and promising virtue and granted that they did much exceed the spa waters with which they were compared  upon this approbation of yours together with my own experience of the good these waters had done to my self and also to several of my friends of late and formerly i thought i had reason enough to undertake this province of publishing this account of pyrmont waters  the design of this tract is not to depreciate or undervalue the spa waters for they have doubtless been of considerable benefit to mankind and will i hope continue to do much good but yet since a kind providence opens a richer or more salubrious treasure of waters shall we not thankfully embrace this gift of god the spa waters have had a great advantage above these they have been longer and more applied to than other waters of that kind much perhaps may be due to the happy situation and good accommodation of the place which invited and caused a more copious and numerous resort of rich and populous neighboring nations such as flanders germany france and holland the pyrmont waters lie more north have been most frequented by the northern inhabitants of germany and of late years persons of the highest birth and quality even princes of the illustrious houses of hanover and of saxony have graced these waters with their presence and have discerned their virtue and good effects and have given them a greater fame than formerly but england which has been so unfortunate as to have known nothing of them hitherto is now like to be supplied by wise methods taken to furnish this country with considerable quantity of these waters at whose arrival which is daily expected their own virtue will suffice to give them reputation  but that i may crown and give the finishing stroke to this recommendation of pyrmont waters we have the experience and example of our gracious sovereign a wise and judicious prince who has chosen and preferred these before any of that vast variety of steel waters which germany abounds with you have a lively evidence and attestation of the healthpreserving virtue of these waters visible in his majestys healthful countenance who not only the last year but in many preceding years drank these cordial and animating waters nor will it displease a prince endowed with so much bounty and benevolence to have been a happy occasion of recommending this salutiferous fountain or source of water to his english subjects it was a present made by one of his majestys family which enabled me to make the several trials and experiments mentioned in this little treatise but amongst the rest that which gave me the greatest satisfaction and comfort was this that they could be brought in so great a perfection as to contain and carry their virtue entirely good to us perhaps with less diminution than a bottle of burgundy or old rhenish do bring theirs and may our most clement and merciful king the glorious instrument of so much good and happiness to us himself enjoy a succession of many years in perfect health peace and prosperity is

mineral acids are creatures of the fire page          among other experiments our author proves the alkaly or anteacid nature of his waters that when fresh taken from the fountain they ferment with

this principle page    we correct his mistake about our sal catharricum amarum which he was informed to be only a chemical composition page    he prudently condemns toward the latter end of his book large quantities of water and much motion page    he has formerly conversed with our virtuosos and physicians in england learned our language reads english books and the transactions and gives us pledges and hopes of yet greater performances  an account of the nature and excellent properties and virtues of the pyrmont waters etc having procured a quantity of pyrmont waters i made some trials with them both internal and external by drinking them and by other experiments which are here related by the taste i manifestly discovered that they contained a rich chalybeat ingredient far exceeding that of the best spa water i ever tasted the spa waters have justly the preference not only to our english steel waters but to all the foreign waters that are brought over which made me compare these with the spa  the spa waters are then looked upon to be most excellent when they sparkle in the glass and give a brisk taste to the palate the pyrmont waters gave this proof of their briskness as soon as the cork was opened and the air was admitted did make a notable ebullition like bottled cider and gave a smart spirituous and pleasant taste and continued the brisk and high chalybeat relish to the last glass though we were some hours about the drinking off a bottle of two quarts  in reference to the internal use of these waters i prosecuted the following method i got some excellent good spa waters i drank them for   or   days a flask at a time i then drank the same quantity of pyrmont water for   days and afterward continued the use of both these waters alternately until i had drank about  0 days the result of this experiment was so plain and manifest to me that the pyrmont waters gave me more spirit and strength those days i drank them than when i used the others and i have good reason to hope that many persons will confirm this experience of mine when they shall be so happy as to obtain these waters  the pyrmont water is by the foreign physicians reckoned amongst the acidulae or sour wells or waters i take the more notice of this because i gave a glass of it to more than one of my friends who were surprised at the quickness of the taste and called it sharp or acid but when i made them drink another glass and consider it better they were forced to recant and confess that the smart and brisk taste had misled them to call it acid or sour thus cider and soft ale when bottled may give a smart and acute impression to the palate though very far from being sour and even spirits or volatile alkalies of sal ammoniac or of hartshorn when mixed with water do cause a smart and pungent affection on the tongue which is far from being acid  but to bring this to a yet further trial whether an acidity was prevalent or so much as to be found in these waters we dropped a good proportion of spirit of hartshorn and spirit of sal ammoniac into these waters and did not find the least luctation or motion appear as they usually do with an acid  i made a yet more critical and certain examen of the acidity said to be found in pyrmont waters by mixing them with milk in various measures and proportions and i also gave various degrees of heat to them some were tried in a tepid or lukewarm others in a boiling heat but did not curdle the milk at all on the contrary the waters preserved the milk for   or   days from curdling or being sour which strong alkalies will do in like manner these experiments do sufficiently prove that our pyrmont waters do not contain an acid  i often made these following experiments to prove the chalybeat properties or virtues of these waters in my own private room and showed them to some friends according to the common way of trying chalybeat waters i put a small quantity of powdered gall about half a grain or less to half a pint of pyrmont water and stirred it about so as to make a sudden mixture and it did in a moment give a deep purple color but if you drop the powder gently on the surface of the water it will make a very fine blue tincture more pleasant to the spectator but far from being so curious as the following tincture  we took   or   leaves of strong green tea placed them in the bottom of a glass holding a quarter of a pint and pouring on the pyrmont water and stirred it not at all we observed these leaves to unfold themselves and gradually tinge these waters with a fine caeruleous azure blue few vegetables do afford the like note that if these or any other stipticks which are the praecipitators do continue long in the water they give a deeper purple and even at length an atramentarius color  there is another property in these waters which makes them more useful to us than any foreign chalybeat waters we yet know that is they do carry better and keep their virtue longer are not so soon spoiled by any accidental insinuations of the air as spa and other iron or chalybeat waters are apt to be the mineral is here thoroughly well united and mixed with this water so that it does not easily precipitate or separate from the water it carries also a much greater quantity of the steel or as some call it vitriolic quality in it and for these reasons does the better pass the vasa lactea and communicate with the blood it self and work the more considerable effects  that these pyrmont waters do hold their virtue beyond any other we know of appeared to me because there was not one of those i opened some of which were kept the whole winter that diminished any thing of the strong iron or steel taste moreover i made this experiment i suffered a bottle or flask of spa waters being about half full to be unstoppd and exposed to the air for    hours i examined it and it did neither tinge nor taste of the mineral but was insipid but the pyrmont waters exposed just after the same manner did taste strong of the mineral nay they continued to do so and to give the tincture to galls for   days and perhaps might have done so longer but i thought that sufficed  in order to the making good or proving what has been asserted in the account of the pyrmont waters these experiments were made at a full meeting of the fellows of the royal society february the   th         sir isaac newton president being in the chair    that i might the better convince the worthy members of the royal society of the promising excellencies and virtues of these waters for very few had ever tasted them before i brought a bottle full of pyrmont waters that held above two quarts which i had kept since august last the weather being very cold i placed the bottle so near the fire as to give it a little warmth or to damask it as they do to wine the bottle being opened the water immediately made a visible ebullition but not so much as it did in summer and being poured out did sparkle in the glass i presented a glass of it to the president he said it was highly chalybeat and of a brisk and grateful taste most if not all the gentlemen present tasted the waters did all agree with the president that they were a strong chalybeat or steel water and of a pleasant taste but amongst the rest doctor douglas a learned physician declared that his glass of water which was a good large one did give a very kind and comfortable warmth to his stomach which made him infer that it would prove of great use and be a notable stomachick medicine i often found it to affect my stomach much as it did his but he proves a better judge because he has avoided drinking wine for many years past this being done    i opened a flask of the best spa waters i could get which being poured into the glass was presented also to the president but had a very small and low taste of the chalybeat and was judged so not only by him but the rest who tasted it when compared with the pyrmont waters    i also demonstrated in their presence the experiments abovementioned by putting   or   leaves of tea to a glass of these waters and about half a grain of galls to another which presented them with a curious blue or purple color that with tea exceeded in beauty the other  in reference to the experiment abovementioned as to the way of preserving these waters it is now performed to more advantage after this manner i filled a pint bottle of pyrmont waters out of my great bottle which being well stopped was put into the custody of the curator who brought it forth the next meeting being full   days and then was found to hold a strong chalybeat taste and did tinge with galls it will prove a hard matter to make the spa water hold   hours after this way of management so that on this account these waters have some considerable advantage because many persons cannot drink above half a flask at a time of the spa water by the next morning the remainder does lose all its virtue and will taste much like common water  the testimony of the president and some of the fellows of the college of physicians in the college of physicians at a meeting of the electors a bottle of pyrmont waters was opened and tasted and much commended for its promising virtue and was allowed much to excel the spa water being examined at the same time both as to a more vigorous and medicinal taste and other experiments made before them  this was attested by the most learned dr bateman president and by several of the electors then present march            at the reading my first account which i gave of the virtue of the pymour waters it was discoursed and argued that they contained a purging quality in them which is not only asserted by authors but even by those that have actually drank them who have positively assured me that they did purge them for my part i much questioned this general effect of any chalybeat water and so soon as i drank them my self i found the contrary which was more agreeable to the several sorts of steel waters whose nature and properties i have examined and are printed by sir hans sloan in the transactions see vol    p       now to bring this to a fair trial whether any purging ingredient can be found in these waters i made this experiment  i evaporated a quart of these waters ad siccitatem and then poured upon this remainder some rain water enough to dissolve and take up the salts and then having filtered this solution i then by a moderate heat exhaled the water which contained about   grains of a brackish salt more like sea salt than that of the purging waters we may safely conclude that so small a quantity of salt in a quart of water can by no means be imagined to cause the least purgation no not in an infant for since we have separated the salts out of the purging waters and brought them into common practice we do find by experience that   drams or   0 grains dissolved in a quart of common water purges very little and that a whole ounce of the true genuine salts is but a usual dose  i have made it more than probable in a former examen of steel waters  for      p     that chalybeat waters do contain stiptic and restringent qualities in them and that they are derived from iron minerals and more particularly the pyrites which doctor lister suggests not without reason to be the parent of all iron oar i have often examined at deptford the solution of the pyrites by rain water out of which copperas or vitriol is made and found it to be a very strong chalybeat water from this mineral of iron we have our strong stiptic powders and waters to stop bleedings etc for external and internal use a judicious use of tunbridge and spa waters has cured obstinate and inveterate diarraeas which did not yield to the force of all other medicines  but notwithstanding our arguing to the contrary it will de retorted upon us that there is matter of fact and experience against us that they really do purge at pyrmont where they are drank this effect i soon conjectured to be due to some irregular or immoderate use of these waters for i found above thirty years past the same effect at tunbridge on those that drank the waters hastily and in profuse quantities they caused giddiness sickness vomitings and purgings but since our physicians have corrected these irregularities we hear of no such complaint for all agree that these waters are binding and often require opening medicines now i am well informed at pyrmont that they are ordered to drink large quantities often three or four quarts or more of our english measure and that pretty hastily which makes it no wonder that their weight presses and forces them thorough the bowels because a much less quantity of rain pump or spring water do purge of themselves as i have experienced in my self a few days past for the cure of a cardialgia two quarts being drank hastily gave me about six dejections whereas if you drink these or any chalybeat waters leisurely and in just quantities they will pass off as they should by urine only and herein lies the intention and great use of these altering waters which is to temper and meliorate the state of the blood for they ought to prove a cordial and give strength to the weak and depressed spirits but if they chance to purge the patient will soon complain that he loses ground and must use means to check any diarraea and to make the waters go the right way by urine which he then finds will do him good and produce the desired effect  i am informed by a learned physician an english archiater to our sovereign that it seemed strange to several of the pyrmont water drinkers of his acquaintance at court that any one should doubt of the purging quality of those waters i have my self also been told by more than one physician that have been there upon the place that if they do not purge with us here hey must have lost that quality by carriage but this i can further prove o be a mistake from manifest arguents  only let me first premise that engand abounds with purging waters more han other countries for there is scarce county that has not some of them and i am confident that within tweny miles of london we have at least a dozen i could name and there may e twice as many for ought i know  do also premise that since the happy oundation of the royal society whose motto is nullius in verba all sorts of waters have been more carefully exerimented and their properties discovered and this has been done so icely by dr lister a great virtuoso that he has found the purging salts o differ from all other species of salts and to be the same in all purging waers to have their own proper and eculiar figure to be a sal sui generis doctor grew by its bitter taste calls it al catharticum amarum and it plainly ppears to be the only purging salt f our english springs the last named dr grew an ancient and early fellow of the royal society has ushered this medicine into the world by bringing it into a dry salt and recommending it into the materia media which is now of great use to mankind is carried into remote countries even to the east and west indies is the cheapest and most general purge of this kingdom  this premised i have hinted above that a quart of pyrmont water has very little real salt of any kind not enough to purge a sparrow and has little or none at all of the purging cathartick salt to be found in it so that it cannot purge no not even when drawn fresh out of the well and drank rationally that is moderately nor is the argument of any validity that it loses its purging faculty by carriage because the purging salt is a fixed salt and will carry as far as the indies as well as salt petre or our common kitchen salt will do nay will carry all the world over and lose nothing of its virtue though it be exposed to the open air or dissolved in water being dried up it recovers again  if i may be any tolerable judge my self who am easily wrought upon by any lenitives i do vouch that the pyrmont waters have no laxative operation at all on me the same account i have from a learned divine who assured me that he found no purging quality in the use of them we both drank them the last year i do farther venture to prognostic and to my great satisfaction of their greater virtue that they will not purge them who shall drink a flask of these waters containing the quantity of a spa flask nay i may venture to say two of those flasks if not drank hastily nor with too much motion  since i am upon the topic of purging and we are mighty apt amongst us i mean the ignorant to talk much of carrying off some relics of diseases perhaps of fevers which i fear are often done precipitantly and do bring on relapses this brings to my mind the practice at tunbridge for about  0 years past when i frequented those waters that they did not only prepare the patient by purges for his course of drinking which was very convenient but they did give strong purges at the conclusion of their drinking that sagacious and considering physician dr sydenham in whose favor i had some interest charged me to have a care of being misled into that error assuring me that this practice would destroy and carry off all the strength and virtue the patient gained in a months drinking he gave me a parallel instance in the peruvian bark which sustained the same damage by purging and it is disallowed of every where by the skilful and yet we have in both these cases some very ignorant but confident pretenders to physic who aver that the bark as well as steel waters do leave behind them malignant and dangerous qualities if not carried off by purging medicines which practice is generally laid aside by the learned physicians in england and i hope in other countries  there is one method also has been made use of at pyrmont and other of the mineral waters which to me seems erroneous and dangerous and ought to be considered and examined whether it does not cause some very bad effects and that is as i am told the physicians do order their patients with their bellies full of water to walk up and down hastily and to bestir themselves very nimbly and i am also told from very good authority that it is common to forbid such the use of the waters who through lameness or other impediments are disabled from action or nimble motion but in england we often find the contrary method necessary especially in tender and infirm constitutions in whom the operations of medicines are most conspicuous and distinguished for these do feel the good effects of being very still and sedate of being quiet both in body and mind of this the late queen anne was an eminent instance who could never drink tunbridge bath or any other diuretic waters but in her bed which has been the case of many others of my own friends with whom they would not agree nor pass off if they walked with them or took them in any other posture than lying i am far from prescribing this way promiscuously and to all sorts of people doubtless moderate walking may agree with many i have known where riding after the waters have been pretty well gone off has done no harm but i found in my self when young and strong very ill effects in riding too soon after i had drank a quantity of mineral waters that my legs swelled and an erysipelas attended that swelling  an anatomist who well considers that the waters must circulate through the heart with the blood and from thence up and down through an abundance of ascending as well as descending windings and turnings he will say that the upright or erect posture will appear less likely to facilitate the circulation of the blood now loaded with water than the horizontal posture of lying on a couch or a bed does experience it self confirms the truth of this not only of my own but of many other waterdrinkers of tunbridge as well as of the bath etc whose waters have not passed to any degree in the daytime but these have gone off very plentifully at night in their beds i have for many years past recommended a large glass of bath waters to my friends to be constantly taken in their beds every night for which draught i have had the thanks of many but never heard of any harm received  as a farther argument against much morion when we drink the chalybeat waters especially since they are generally used in hot weather we must avoid all methods that provoke sweat or dispose us to a quick perspiration through the cutaneous glands which we plainly feel and observe to be caused by much agitation or walking and by that means the current of the waters is diverted from its natural and proper channel and hindered from passing by urine which ought to be encouraged  i now appeal to the judgment of the most wise and learned persons of this honorable society who have been the authors of so much good to mankind whether these arguments for regulating the use of these noble medical waters have not some weight and may not deserve to be considered and not condemned untried this i am sure that this method is no wise hazardous to the lives of men whereas the great weight and load of water in the blood for all persons cannot throw them off per sedem must needs produce some ill effects the great quantity may too much extend and spoil the stomach may cause diseases of the head vertigos apoplexies break down the lymphaeducts and make an ascitis the worst of dropsies and cause those very diseases which a moderate use would certainly cure  it may perhaps be looked upon as an omission for having taken no mow notice of the fixed parts or of the ingredients which are to be found in all chalybeat waters and therefore in the pyrmont for i mention only a small quantity of water evaporated ad siccitatem and i have made use only of the watery element to dissolve the salts and examine their figure and taste that i might reduce them to their proper species of salts as to the salts i never failed of a sal marine but found it in all sorts of mineral waters though in some in very small quantity which is not to be wondered at since it is very probable that our fountains and wells may owe their original to the sea and so may not altogether strain off all and clear themselves by transcolation through the earth of every saline particle moreover the earth it self does not only furnish whole hills or rocks of salt but has smaller veins and even grains of salt scattered up and down which are again absorbed by small rivulets or currents of water and do in more or less quantity impregnate stagnating wells or flowing fountains  i have indeed formerly examined the remains or fixed parts of many of our ferruginous waters i have generally found them much the same for all of them do contain iron particles but those that abounded most with sediment held a crude gross ocre and would give the deepest and blackest tincture to the water and had the least virtue in them the chemist having collected a good deal of this substance makes it pass through many a fiery trial by calcination reverberation etc at length he brings forth a powder of a reddish or deep yellow and shall adorn it with a fine name perhaps he will call it a crocus martis or a saffron of steel this name he borrows from one of our most excellent vegetables saffron or else his fancy shall run upon another notion and shall call it a sulphur of mars and not rest here but endeavor to make up the three chemical principles namely salt sulphur and mercury he will call it sulphur though it be incombustible it must be a salt though it be undissolvable and a mercury although it look like a gravel stone to what purpose all this labor and pains whereas    the very taste tells us that the spa waters are impregnated with chalybeat or iron particles    our eyes will tell us that we may see iron in these waters to a demonstration if you put a little powder or solution of galls to these waters it gives a black color and will make ink now since we have in england not any one thing that gives a black color or is dyed black but what comes from iron none will doubt at first sight of this experiment whether the waters do belong to the iron original or no in england we abound much with the pyrites or copperas stone out of this we make great quantity of this copperas which is almost all iron the dyers make use of it to give the black to woollen linen silks etc by boiling it in water with galls and without it we cannot give a good black to one yard of cloth  to me these two easy and sensible experiments made with little cost and trouble do as plainly exhibit the iron quality as if i had evaporated some gallons of these waters and had passed the recrements through chemical fires and had with a loadstone as i have done formerly in the like case taken up the very substance of iron  but after all these pompous and elaborate experiments by which we pretend to examine and analize these excellent waters we must return to the waters themselves whose virtue lies in their synthesi or natural constitution in the form of waters as such let us endeavor to make them as useful as possible for without all doubt they do contain medicines adapted to the cure of many diseases which will succeed more effectually if the physicians especially he that practices at the fountain head do abound in piety and charity    let him not disparage the munificent author of this great medicine for its not being made by the hands of proud or weak man let him not say as some wretches have done that these waters are only a good vehicle for his own wiser and better compositions but rather let him ascribe to the great founder of these noble medicines the due tribute of thanks and praise    let his charity be expressed to his neighbor by applying these waters with the utmost care and skill he can by giving them after a due manner in just proportion and quantity and not pour into the stomach whole deluges of water to break down natures boundaries but setting aside all prejudices and self ends let him regard what symptoms they best relieve and what stubborn diseases they most effectually cure let him not from a vain and ambitious conceit pretend to improve these waters by adding some chemical drops or fancies of his own for these often give a nauseous taste to the grateful waters and may not only defraud the drinker of his pleasant draught but also of the superior virtue inherent in the waters themselves this method is too much practiced amongst us and often injuriously and deserves to be censured  a list of some of those diseases which chalybeat waters are prescribed to cure   they are a proper remedy for most diseases of the stomach as want of appetite or defects of digestion from weakness or relaxation of the fibers of the stomach also canine and excessive appetites sour and bitter vomitings heartburning or cardialgia and many other stomach distempers    diseases of the bowels such as painful and griping colicks proceeding from corrosive or fretting salts contained in the bilious or other glandulous juices of the bowels these are diluted altered or sweetened by the chalybeat virtue of these healing waters and the chyle it self is better prepared and elaborated in the region of the bowels and being freed from distempered qualities is conveyed into the blood better adapted for sanguification in hypocondriack diseases where pent up vapors and flatulent humors rack and lacerate the tender fibers and membranes of the stomach and bowels these salutiferous waters are esteemed specific    their virtue is not confined to those parts called the primae viae or first apparatus of the chyle but extends farther even penetrates the mass of blood and is of manifest use to cure the jaundice and even dropsies if not too far gone it dilutes and washes the scorbutic salts out of the blood and at the same time washes off the gravel and smaller stones collected in the kidneys ureters and bladder and prevents their concretions in those parts again by them the latent seeds of many diseases fixed in the organisk parts such as the most sagacious physician cannot perceive are carried off or obliterated in their original sickly and squalid countenances visible indications of a depraved state of health shall after a convenient use of these waters look healthful and sanguine by these the very texture of the blood is mended drooping spirits are cheered exhilirated and enabled to do the various offices of nature more strenuously and they affect our spirits with a much more ind and benign influence without eating ruffling or inflaming them which wine and artificial spirits are apt to do i should rather trust to these for the cure of a diabetes by what i have seen in my self than to the insipid and scarce tepid waters of bristol  i have now given a short hint only of some few of those diseases for which these waters are proper time would fail me to enumerate them all  this gives a great reputation unto the excellency of these waters that when physicians have in vain applied their own preparations to obtain a cure they are forced to fly to these divine remedies and do very often find their account here  since it is agreed by the general consent and experience of nations to ascribe extraordinary virtues to these sorts of fountains that are impregnated with chalybeat particles and therefore are called steel waters i hope i have done this my native country not only a piece of justice but an acceptable service in these my endeavors to recommend to them these particular waters of pyrmont especially since it appears that they do in many degrees surpass any of our own waters in their medicinal properties or any others that are brought to us from foreign parts  there are some particular advantages and privileged which belong to this chalybeat fountain for this spring abounds with a vast quantity of water it is more portable carries and holds its virtue better than any other i have kept it a summer and winter without decay it is situated as near the sea side as any foreign water and requires less land carriage and i doubt not in time so soon as a trade is settled it will be brought over much cheaper than any sort of foreign water from abroad  it can be no objection to me against these pyrmont waters which i find some have complained of beyond the sea that these are too heavy and too strong of the mineral i do allow them to contain a very great proportion of that ingredient in them as a proof of their excellency for the mineral here is not a gross and heavy ocre but finely rectified and exalted a vitriol not to be matched by humane art well dissolved in its watery vehicle for want of instruments i could not make the experiment so very nice but yet i found that he waters of this spring were not at ll more but rather less pondeous han common rain water as to the specific gravity  we may allow that these waters may e too strong for some weak stomachs his is easily remedied by mixing a just proportion of good fair water with it we must not condemn good strong wine because some constitutions cannot ear it by its self but when mixed with water it proves a great cordial  it was a great satisfaction to me to have this notion confirmed by the most learned archiater to king george dr steigerthall a fellow of the royal society and of the college of physician who cured a tender lady laboring under seeral desperate distempers when she could not bear the water of the well y mixing equal parts of simple water with the pyrmontane he further recommends this method to be made use of by others if they have any reason to uspect these waters to disagree with them as being too strong for my part  think it a great benefit to us in engand that we are directed to a water of a strength superior to any in use amongst us which i hope and am persuaded will rejoice the hearts and animate the drooping spirits of many a sad and hypocondriack soul for whom most of our chalybeats are found too weak  it is a strong argument that chalybeat waters particularly the spa have given great satisfaction and done much good because they have been much more prescribed and used amongst us of late years than formerly and they would still be in greater vogue if they were not adulterated or if the true waters from the spa could be brought to us in perfection with their original strength which i am sorry to say can rarely be brought to pass on the other hand those of pyrmont with but a very moderate care in stopping can scarce fail of being delivered to us in their full strength i am fully persuaded that experience will soon evince and demonstrate the truth of this assertion  it is another misfortune that the chalybeat fountains of water such as tunbridge etc can be only applied to in the warm weather for four or five months in the year but since these waters which were brought before the royal society in winter after they were a little warmed by the fire did then give very good proof of their admirable virtue we may hence be secured of their being like to be brought into use even in the severest winters  i cannot pass by a proposition of the abovenamed learned physician dr steigerthall my worthy friend who in a curious tract of his gives an account of great variety of waters in germany and other places and particularly mentions this that at swalbach when the weather is cold they bring the waters to the fire and warm them before they drink them he proposes the making these waters warm by an ignited rod or gad of iron the doctor confesses with great modesty that he never made the experiment but to me it seems so rational that it ought to be taken notice of and that it may be made practical give me leave to add these directions take a small bar or rod of iron about a foot long fit a wooden handle to one end to be put on or off at discretion pour off half a pint of water out of the flask into a convenient vessel of silver or china not of glass plunge the ignited iron into the water bring the water to a very low degree of heat when you pour off more out of the flask get your heaters always ready in this experiment you lose none of the chalybeat virtue of the waters but rather receive an addition from the heated iron you obviate another inconvenience when a whole flask is warmed in boiling water as we use the bath waters it will be apt to despirit and make the whole bottle flat and lifeless but this way may these pyrmont waters in the coldest seasons of the year be drank with the same virtue and therefore with as much benefit as in summer nay perhaps with many people to better advantage the waters being more likely to pass off by urine in cold weather than in the hot summer  whereas i have animadverted above upon the great quantity of waters that are drank at the sour brunns or acidulae so called abroad it seemed to me incredible that any person should drink for several days successively such an extravagant quantity as that of six or seven quarts of our english measure which i now no more doubt of having read it in dr steigerthalls ingenious treatise though i am very well assured that it was never done with his advice nor with his approbation it is the more surprising to us because we do see very good effects of a single flask of spa waters when they are good that is brisk and vigorous in recovering health provided they are continued for near a month more or less one of these flasks does not fully contain a quart and half of english measure it must be allowed that there may be now and then a case extraordinary which will require greater quantities than what is usual but rarely any thing so excessive as what is here mentioned amongst our bath patients the quantity of two of our quarts is esteemed a large proportion and most abide at one or three pints and two quarts of the chalybeat are reckoned a large dose and to be allowed to only very strong persons  an examen of the chalybeat or spa waters called by the germans acidulae or sour brunns or wells are proved to be of a contrary nature that is alkalies by dr fred slare this was printed in the transactions of the royal society vol    for the year      now at the request of some friends is placed here  i have for many years past had more than a bare suspicion that physicians and learned persons had imposed upon themselves and others erroneous notions about the nature and properties of those mineral waters which are of the chalybeat or iro species germany abounds much with these waters and they bestow one general name upon them and call them sour brunns that is sour wells o springs of water the learned germans when they name them or writ of them do call them acidulae ex gr spadenses swalbaccenses vel pyrmontanae etc henricus ab heers agrees with vitruvius fallopius and the sagacious helmont and other men of great fame in justifying the acidity of several sorts of spa and chalybeat waters but not being satisfied with their reasons assigns others and after a tedious and obscure harangue concludes that they owe their birth and great virtues to vitriol and sulphur he observes that vitriol and sulphur are found in the glebe or earth from whence these waters do spring but yet does not give us one proof or experiment of his having found any real vitriol or true sulphur or any acidity in those waters he fills his book with imaginations and quotations exposing other mens ignorance whilst he himself is plunged in the same common vulgar error  doctor jordis an eminent physician at francford and a fellow of the royal society did formerly visit the famous well or sour brunn at swalbach in summer time and practiced there during the season i was my self then examining the nature of all sorts of waters cathartick and chalybeat or steel waters and the other which contain the bitter purging salts my request to this very learned physician was that he would give me an account of the contents of the said water numbered amongst the acidulae particularly whether by distillation he could obtain any thing sour or acid as vinegar and juice of oranges will do this way but he could not satisfy me that the least drop of acid did rise or distill over he also evaporated a great quantity of this water ad siccitatem and thought that he found some sulphurous parts in it but sulphur it self is far from being an acid but the contrary he also found ocre and other ferrugineous particles contained in it but these we find in all chalybeat waters which do truly belong to the nature of alkalis and not of acids  that which gave me the first suspicion that the chalybeat waters did not contain any rough or acid salts in them proceeded from an accidental use of a very strong iron water which happened to me above thirty years ago in such a place where i could get no other in this water i dissolved my soap washed my hands and found it to lather beyond my expectation i also shaved with it i afterward tried some other chalybeat waters which did the same that is much better than pump water did  i i consulted my palate and tried whether i could discover any sharpness or acidity in our english steel waters at tunbridge at the blackboy in the parish of franfield in sussex at hampstead sunninghill in berkshire and other places but i was so far from discovering any such thing that these waters seemed rather to leave a sweetish flavor or farewell behind thus many alkaly salts if nicely examined of the fixed kind have affected my taste  ii i made experiments with several sorts of such spirits as are apt to ferment with acids such as spirit of hartshorn of sal ammoniac etc but these made no ferment nor any motion or effervescence in these waters  iii i considered the diseases in humane bodies which those waters were prescribed by physicians to cure that they were often such as proceeded from sharp acid or acrimonious causes as cardialgia or heart burnings sour vomitings corrosive diarraeas colicks from scurvies and stranguries and that for these distempers sweetning and alkalisate remedies are made use of  iv i considered these waters as containing in them the properties of iron and i find by experience that it is most opposite to acids being one of their great correctors and therefore rather to be esteemed an alkaly    take some filings of iron perhaps a dram and pour on them about an ounce of the milder acids such as vinegar verjuice or the juice of limons and it will destroy the sharpness of these juices or if you pour on these filings mineral acids as the very corrosive spirit of nitre or of salt or what is called oil of vitriol they will immediately lose their acidity be disarmed of their sharp points and by evaporation give a salt that will taste sweetish and is by chemists called saccharum martis if duly prepared which is safely given inwardly and is esteemed a good altering medicine    steel beaten to a fine powder is without any farther preparation given inwardly with great success for stomachick diseases as in the green sickness hypocondriack and various other acid and acrimonious disaffections  v i considered milk to be a very proper and obvious subject to bring this controversy to a plain and unquestionable decision i made this experiment with all possible exactness i first proved the chalybeat waters more particularly the spa waters by trying whether they tinged with galls these being very good i put part of the waters to cold milk some i only made lukewarm and some i boiled together in equal proportions but they were so far from affording any curd or coagulation that they continued several days without being sour since mineral waters especially those that are chalybeat are of such important use in physic and have gained amongst us so just a reputation for their excellent virtues and are the greatest refuge in very potent and obstinate diseases this has made me judge it a work not unacceptable to virtuosos especially those of the faculty of physic to have this medicine fairly examined its genuine properties asserted and what was called an acid to be demonstrated an alkaly is it not a sort of justice due to the world that the germans who sent us over these waters with this false character of sour waters should banish this misguiding term from their spas  it is from this mistake that their physicians do prohibit the use of all manner of lacticinia as if they were as noxious as deadly poisons whilst they are in a course of their medicinal waters unjustly called sour brunns  since this prejudice has prevailed very much amongst most of our water drinkers in england i do attest that i have frequently advised in some cases milk to be given daily in the evening through a whole course of steel waters with good effect nay i do affirm that some others could not bear these waters without having a third part of milk or more mixed with them and have continued them so for many weeks with good advantage nor do i find the least reason to prohibit the use of milk in a course of bath waters having been there above a year and half making the best scrutiny i could into the properties virtues and vices if they have any of those waters here we use asses milk morning and afternoon in the use of bath waters nor did i ever forbid cows milk where it agreed with that person at any other time  vi since our experiments discover that those things which are of a sweetning alkalisate nature do so very well agree with these mineral waters it will appear by the following experiment that acids do very much disagree    i put but one drop of oil of vitriol to a large glass full of strong spa waters which before the addition of this acid did give a deep purple to the solution of galls but now would not give the least tincture though i put in four times as much of the galls from hence i conclude that the virtues of the chalybeat ingredients which i take to be the life and soul of these waters were so far bound up or destroyed as to have lost their cordial or corroborating faculty and that the bile or gall in the humane bowels could not be able to separate the chalybeat which are the only medical particles and mix them with the chyle in order to answer any end in physic  let this be a caution to those that design to make these waters pass better by urine that they do not make use of any acids it being a common practice to use spirit of vitriol spiritus nitri dulcis etc as a diuretic unless it should so happen that they have a design to take off and divest them of their warm cordial or altering power and so to bring them near to common water which i must confess we are forced to do especially in the use of bath waters in some hot inflammatory cases    i shall conclude with one short experiment in favor of our alkalies that if you put any alkaly salt volatile or fixed such as volatile salt of hartshorn or of sal ammoniac or fixed salt of tartar of wormwood or any other true alkaly you will then destroy the abovenamed acid spirit which was dropped into the water and will recover the virtue of the waters and dispose them to give their tincture as they used to do in their natural state  postscript after many fruitless attempts to get a book from germany which treated of these waters ex professo at length i obtained these two of which i shall give a short account they did not come to my hand until my little tract was finished and my papers were actually with the printer  the first i shall take notice of is one dr cunaeus whose book was printed about seven years since of whom i shall have occasion to say very little because he treats of many niceties and impertinencies to the cure of diseases he enumerates an abundance of his arcanums and nostrums and imputes such extraordinary virtues to them which make these sanative waters and all other materia medica needless as to the nature of the waters he had not the least imagination of their being any thing else but an acidula or sour brunn but this mistaken notion will do less harm than his practice did who page    directs the patient at his first drinking to begin with two quarts of the waters in another place he gives a great charge to the waterdrinker to have a great care of meddling with that dangerous thing milk and remarks that several children having drank these waters upon eating milk did fall into convulsions and other diseases he also observes that several persons who did put sugar into these sour waters and others who drank a glass of wine betwixt their draughts of waters did by this means fall into dangerous distempers as to milk not only my own experience of many years standing discharges it from causing any bad effects if used the same day wherein the patient drinks chalybeat waters but i have the concurring testimony of the best of our physicians now alive as well as of many that are lately dead that they have put their patients into a course of joining milk with our steel waters at tunbridge and other places and have had the good success of making the waters agree better with the patient and have cured that disease this way which they could not do by by the waters alone his judging and censuring sugar for having had malignant influences on those that dissolve it in these waters is absolutely intolerable is it possible that so innocent and pleasant a balsam can do any harm i have several times caused my patients at the bath to mix fine white sugar candy with their waters with very good success i little suspected to have a glass of wine forbid by a german which i have found a necessary diuretic for some the prohibition of mixing wine with chalybeat waters to be drank at meals will never take place in england because both strong and weak the healthy and sickly do conspire with us here to drink it mixed at meals and declare it to be both pleasant and beneficial but it is high time to pass over such trifles and to look into the following author  doctor seippius appointed by prince waldeck the proprietor of these watess to be the only physician to practice at pyrmont has published his book this year       this ingenious and very industrious person has taken much pains to examine and enquire into the principles and operations of these waters he has made many curious and useful experiments which have led him nearer the standard of truth than any of his predecessors for those contents or ingredients which he found in the sediment of the water he is forced to coness that they are all alkalies and that hey cannot exert the least acid effect in the waters but rather owns them to have a healing and balsamic quality so that in reality he ought to declare himself a proselyte to my new notion that even this pyrmont sour brunn is a sweet dulcifying water and a true alkaly  but yet such is the prejudice of custom and common opinion that even this candid author cannot altogether in the first part of his tract clear himself of this wrong notion of these waters having an acid or sour taste which does ot appear to me nor to any of my friends who attentively consider it he also thinks that there is a latent acid concealed in these waters and that it comes from the sulphur of the pyrites from which these medicated waters are derived but still he confesses that this acid can exert no manner of effect being quite subject to those alkalies contained in the water  the contents of these waters he says are a sweet subtle alkaly earth have the selenites or somewhat like a transparent crystal a small quantity of salt iron and sulphur we do even in our mineral waters especially in that of the bath find a sort of a cretaceous substance which we say is from the lapis calcarius with which our earth in england does much abound and seems to be that very transparent substance which he calls selenites and the sweet alkaly earth iron is indeed a very great alkaly absorbs and corrects all acids as we have proved to a demonstration in this tract see page  0    it is from the sulphur or brimstone which he discovers in those waters that an acidity or sourness is thought to be derived to these waters which still is only imaginary because the contrary quality appears to be there  i must own that i formerly never so much as doubted sulphur to be other than an acid having always heard so much talk of the very sharp oil of sulphur and gas of sulphur besides the very suffocating and acrimonious vapor of brimstone when kindled or made to flame might easily impose such a false opinion upon the unwary but experiment will prove just the contrary and we shall find it rather to belong to the alkalies and not to have the least show or footstep of an acid in it no not to have so much of the acid in it as the pleasant and sweetest wine of italy or the canaries contain in them for these when boiled with milk make a strong curd which sulphur will not do  the experiment we took a dram of flowers of brimstone and a quarter of a pint of milk and boiled them together they did not in the least curdle the milk but made it taste more soft and balsamic than it did before if you taste sulphur it lies soft upon the tongue does not give the least subacid relish on the contrary from hence are our healing and pectoral balsams made and many cutaneous and itching distempers of the skin where the humors do tare and lacerate the superficial parts sulphur is made use of as a vulnerary and cures beyond most other applications it is true it has a strong offensive smell but not the least of an acid smell taste or quality unless you reduce it to flame and then it is no longer sulphur but what proceeds from it is actually a creature of the fire let me give one common instance to show the difference between a substance in its natural state and when brought to an actual flame viz good oil of olives may be swallowed for a healing pleasant inward medicine and is outwardly applied to ease an inflammation or heal a sore in like manner the tallow of a candle may be applied to a sore part but if you touch the flame of either of these you will be made sensible that they have lost all their properties and that what was a vulnerary is become now of a corrosive and devouring nature  i perceive that this sedulous author has by strong fires distilled some acid spirits out of great quantities of the sediment of the pyrmont waters which may well be obtained from those salts and sulphurs he says are contained in them but whatever they are i do positively assert these acid spirits to be creatures of the fire and not to have been originally in the water thus oil of vitriol which our author truly asserts to be the same with oil of sulphur is only fire wrapped up or incorporated in a little moist vehicle will burn your flesh raise blisters heat water and give many other proofs of its fiery nature which it may well do having been perhaps    hours a constant ignited body of fire  having proved sulphur to be an alkaly this will furnish our author with one argument more and a very strong one to establish the opinion that our chalybeat waters are alkalies not acidulae for what refuge can the acidist fly to in order to the supporting the notion of these waters being an acidula or a sour brunn since even brimstone it self contained in these waters and judged an unquestionable acid proves to be the reverse or just contrary  i must acknowledge my self very much indebted to him for this following experiment which alone would suffice to put a finishing decisive stroke to all this controversy in page  0  he says that these waters do make a pretty strong effervescence with all sorts of sours as with vinegar wine spirit of nitre of salt of vitriol this experiment outdoes all i ever met with for none of our waters though some of them seem full of iron do in the least pretend to such an alkaly as in the least to ferment with acids but if this should fail as i can scarce think it will because it is so positively asserted that when fresh taken up at the fountain head it does ferment yet the following experiment exhibits as certain though not so sudden a demonstration he makes use of milk and boils it with his waters and declares that they will not curdle but rather that they do preserve the milk from coagulating see page         of this author he makes the same experiment and observation with mine printed in the transaction above   years since and since reprinted here page    and infers as we do that this is a strong argument of the alkalies contained in these waters  our author takes notice of a quantity of salt he finds in these waters at the utmost    grains in a quart to which he would ascribe the same purging virtue that our purging salts have but having had a desire to satisfy my self in this matter i caused a very ingenious chemist to make an accurate examen of these waters new brought over and he obtained about ten grains of salt which one quart afforded this salt consisted of a considerable proportion of sea salt mixed with a bitter salt but had the water held ten times the quantity of that compound salt it could not have caused one purge especially since these waters are in themselves restringent and guarded with stiptick ingredients  now we are giving due praises to the pyrmont waters we may also expect that justice be done to our english purging salts which are deservedly introduced and received in our materia medica this author wrong represents them as a chemical composition of some alkaly or other joined with an acid to my certain knowledge many centners of pounds have been made out of our purging waters but now indeed they have found out another sort of a minera which produces this very particular salt and is of the very same figure taste and operation but after this way it can be made at less expense which still contributes more good to mankind there is no more art used in making this admirable salt than in making our common sea salt there is nothing added to it only other mixtures are separated from it our sea salt may more pertinently be styled an artificial chemical composition than this purging salt because there are more things added to make that granulat than are required for this though they are both hewn from off the same rock or dug out of the same mine i do not think it the worst action of my life for having been an early instrument in preparing and bringing this purging salt into practice having made and used it before doctor grew that excellent physician published it to the world it was once at  0 s the pound he brought it to   s i rejoice to see it for the good of the poor at    d the pound so that now they may have    purges for one shilling  i have remarked above that of late our practice condemns the giving large quantities of our ferruginous waters our author here goes on somewhat fast in advancing so high as to direct three quarts of water to be given to the drinker the third day but he makes a stand at four quarts i know it is a hard matter where the practice of drinking great quantities has been continued so long not to be born down with the torrent of ancient custom but yet i must say in his commendation that though he be yet a young man he sees the error and will doubtless shake off the prejudice of custom and education for in page  0  he confesses that it were safer and better to drink the waters more moderately and as he says not to offer violence to nature but to allow more time for a cure  this very method would prevent another inconvenience of purging so much as they do for if they did not overcharge the drinker with such abundance of water there would generally speaking be no need of catharticks to discharge that burden  both later and former drinkers of the mentioned waters at pmont have related to me that they were advised by the learned and compelled by the example of most drinkers to use much motion to make their waters pass the better but surely in the heat of summer it must necessarily make them sweat and hinder the right evacuation by urine this is censured above and i am pleased to find this physician prudently recommend a less violent motion to his patient such as shall create no sweat i am in good hopes that the discreet conduct of so worthy a person will correct and cure some of those errors which length of time has fixed and rooted and that he will make these waters still more beneficial to those that drink them there  i will conclude with a quotation he has furnished me with from professo hoffmans dissertation upon whose testimony i set a great value because he is a most excellent and consummate physician and a curious chemist he says optimi qui virtute omnes nostro quidem judicio antecellunt sunt fontes pyrmontani and farther that upon a examen he had made of many waters the pyrmont excelled all in the subtilt and plenty of spirits i have now obtained a parcel of these waters which are come to my hands and are ver good and do answer the character given of them  a short examen of a treatise of iron waters but especially of ipswich spa dedicated to the college of physicians      the unknown or concealed author will doubtless be found out at ipswich especially at this fountain head with a vast train of patients daily crouding about these allhealing waters to which he ascribes such superlative virtues as far exceed all other waters but especially german spa waters we are very severely chid and censured for our great vanity and folly in buying and cheats in selling these waters and that we may be sure not to overlook this censure it is put in the title page of this book  the characters or encomiums he gives or attributes to these newfound waters are very great that they do excel other waters in their pleasant and brisk or spirituous taste in the property of keeping many months without loss of strength in their volatility and doing great cures and in many other superexcellent qualities he assigns them sufficient to make any credulous person forthwith to take the flying coach and to hasten to this well to consult the doctor which he directs p    to be very necessary  for my part i am persuaded that he would soon have numbers of patrons and advocates to join with him in extolling and recommending his waters provided they could be assured of the truth of their assumed virtue nor would he have cause to be jealous of the faculty it self of being such fools and asses as he seems to describe them page    stiff zealots adhering to their own opinions like asses being once led to water will drink at the same place if possible  there are several hard censures denounced somewhat hastily if not unmannerly too he might have waited some months and have seen whether the world would not have been proselyted by fair means good words or his strong arguments which he says he has laid down to demonstration before he used such a satirical and harsh method nor do i think thi anonymous author to be ignorant tha we live in an inquisitive age and that the faculty will not admit into their materials of physic such new medicines of which they have no experience wherefore the author must expect some queries or remarks or postulata will be proposed i ask leave only for some very few having no room for many  q   let me heartily expostulate with our author whether be has taken the best way to convince us of the pretended excellency of his waters by depreciating others and so dogmatically asserting the value of his own why did he not send a hamper of his waters to the president and electors of the college and that in time before his book had been delivered to them this was easy for him to do because his waters may be dipped in the morning and be delivered at london in the even this was done by me before i presumed to give my account of prmont water i obtained the approbation of the two famous societies having brought a quantity of these waters for them to taste and to examine by other experiments this water is often kept back by contrary winds and so came not to my hands before it had been dipped at least two months and at least   months before either of the societies had it presented to them  q   does he think that an upstart spring of water which he says page     is lately discovered at ipswich and that has but six weeks obtained its full perfection should so suddenly gain such authority and power as to prohibit or proscribe the use of those celebrated german waters which physicians of the preceding as well as the present age have successfully prescribed to their patients  q   is it not more likely that he aims at his own interest more than at the good of mankind what is the meaning of his taking care to have an arcanum of his to be also mixed with these waters he gives it the name of tinctura basilica which it seems is sold up and down the town of ipswich as daphys elixir or stoughtons drops altogether considered it makes one shrewdly suspect that the doctor and proprietor have a great regard to self and byends when convinced of the contrary i shall soon retract  in the title page we are told that he has made several curious experiments and nice observations such as were never before made give me leave to challenge   or   of these nice things    he endeavors to prove an acidity in these waters and is led into the old german error of the acidulae in page     he says having taken about a quarter of a pint of milk and caused it to be heated i poured into it whilst it was warm about four spoonfuls of the ipswich spa and it immediately turned it to curds as if beer or some mild acid had been poured in for my part i should much less esteem his water if it were so as he says that it would turn milk and proved it self an acid for acids cause many diseases and we fly to alkalies for the cure but i stand amazed at this assertion of his when i am morally certain of the contrary and that there is no chalybeat water in england that is acid or produces this effect on milk  but to give my self more satisfaction i procured some bottles from the ipswich fountain which came to my hands full well corkd and carefully sealed i made the experiment as above directed but could not make any curd to rise i made farther experiments in favor of the water i doubled and trebled the quantity of the water to see if by any means i could curdle the milk but nothing succeeded have a care that you use new milk and do not mistake a few creamy or oily particks that will stick to the side of any glass and call that curd interest and prejudice can discover what they have a mind to    he runs much upon a volatile acid as if it were one of the grand principles of his own and even all martial waters see page    and in many other places is it not strange that the promiser of such curious experiments in the title page should not put it upon this most natural and easy experiment in the world which a very ordinary chemist may perform why did he not since he lives near the spring put a quart or two of this water into a glass limbec called head and body or any other still and by a very gentle fire receive the liquor that came over and so taste and try it whether it held any acidity or no does not this omission put a man justly upon the question whether this author has really a mind to find out truth or no for my part i can tell him the fate of this experiment that he will certainly distill over an insipid water even from the first to the last drop in the still because i have tried many such waters as his this way and none of them ever gave the least drop of an acid    he also asserts and takes it for granted that the fixed salts that remain after evaporation are acid it is strange that this must also be suppposed and not tried i found in his waters which is the condition of most of our english chalybeat waters that they contain very little salt out of his ipswich water i could only get two grains from a pint i tried it with milk but it would not curdle half a spoonful of milk after several days standing in a window i gained five grains out of a pint of pyrmont waters which waters do hold more salt than any other of the true chalybeat waters i have seen or heard of i put these grains to one spoonful of milk which did keep the milk from curdling full seven days in september    he says he has experimented this that his waters have not only    days but as many weeks kept their entire virtue i wish he had tried them whether they would carry to london as far as the college of physicians because those which i sent for did not carry four days so as to hold their virtue and truly by the course ocra i found at the bottom they seem to me to resemble islington waters which will lose their virtue in    hours  what i have said in the high praise of the pyrmont waters being a foreign german water must certainly expose me to the displeasure of this author especially since i have also in some lower degree justified the virtue of the spa when brought to us in a good condition and this i must acknowledge that this last year they have been brought us better than formerly though i am sure it is not in their nature to preserve their virtue as the pyrmont will do  now i conclude with my hearty wishes that this endeavor of mine to serve my neighbor may have some good effect i can assure the reader that a sincere love of truth divested of all manner of private interest has been the only motive of this undertaking  i pretend not to infallibility some errors and mistakes and some unjust censures will attend every writer he that heartily convinces me of the former shall always have the thanks of  his humble srvant f s  advertisement experiments which prove bezoar to have no use in physic gascoigns powder examined and censured dedicated to the royal
