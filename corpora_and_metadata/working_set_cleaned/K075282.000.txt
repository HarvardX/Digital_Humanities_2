fame j t to mem of gray london printed and embellished under the direction of c cook  the life of thomas gray thomas gray was born in cornhill in the city of london on the   th of december      his father philip gray was a moneyscrivener but being of an indolent and profuse disposition he rather diminished than improved his paternal fortune our author received his classical education at eton school under mr antrobus his mothers brother a man of sound learning and refined taste who directed his nephew to those pursuits which laid the foundation of his future literary fame  during his continuance at eton he contracted a friendship with mr horace walpole well known for his knowledge in the fine arts and mr richard west son of the lord chancellor of ireland a youth of very promising talents  when he left eton school in      he went to cambridge and entered a pensioner at peterhouse at the recommendation of his uncle antrobus who had been a fellow of that college it is said that from his effeminacy and fair complexion he acquired among his fellow students the appellation of miss gray to which the delicacy of his manners seems not a little to have contributed mr walpole was at that time a fellowcommoner of kings college in the same university a fortunate circumstance which afforded gray frequent opportunities of intercourse with his honorable friend  mr west went from eton to christ church oxford and in this state of separation these two votaries of the muses whose dispositions were congenial commenced an epistolary correspondence part of which is published by mr mason a gentleman whose character stands high in the republic of letters  gray having imbibed a taste for poetry did not relish those abstruse studies which generally occupy the minds of students at college and therefore as he found very little gratification from academical pursuits he left cambridge in      and returned to london intending to apply himself to the study of the law but this intention was soon laid aside upon an invitation given him by mr walpole to accompany him in his travels abroad a situation highly preferable in grays opinion to the dry study of the law  they set out together for france and visited most of the places worthy of notice in that country from thence they proceeded to italy where an unfortunate dispute taking place between them a separation ensued upon their arrival at florence mr walpole afterward with great candor and liberality took upon himself the blame of the quarrel though if we consider the matter coolly and impartially we may be induced to conclude that gray from a conscious superiority of ability might have claimed a deference to his opinion and judgment which his honorable friend was not at that time disposed to admit the rupture however was very unpleasant to both parties  gray pursued his journey to venice on an economic plan suitable to the circumscribed state of his finances and having continued there some weeks returned to england in september      he appears from his letters published by mr mason to have paid the minutest attention to every object worthy of notice throughout the course of his travels his descriptions are lively and picturesque and bear particular marks of his genius and disposition we admire the sublimity of his ideas when he ascends the stupendous heights of the alps and are charmed with his display of nature decked in all the beauties of vegetation indeed abundant information as well as entertainment may be derived from his casual letters  in about two months after his arrival in england he lost his father who by an indiscreet profusion had so impaired his fortune as not to admit of his sons prosecuting the study of the law with that degree of respectability which the nature of the profession requires without becoming burdensome to his mother and aunt to obviate therefore their importunities on the subject he went to cambridge and took his bachelors degree in civil law  but the inconveniences and distress attached to a scanty fortune were not the only ills our poet had to encounter at this time he had not only lost the friendship of mr walpole abroad but poor west the partner of his heart fell a victim to complicated maladies brought on by family misfortunes on the  st of june      at popes a village in hertfordshire where he went for the benefit of the air  the excessive degree in which his mind was agitated for the loss of his friend will best appear from the following beautiful little sonnet  in vain to me the smiling mornings shine  and reddning poebus lifts his goden fire  the birds in ain their amorous descant join  or cheerful fields resume their green attire  these ears alas for other notes repine  a different object do these eyes require  my lonely anguish melts no heart but mine  and in my breast the imperfect joys expire  yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer  and newborn pleasure brings to happier men  the fields to all their wonted tribute bear  to warn their little loves the birds compain  i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear  and weep the more because i weep in vain   mr gray now seems to have applied his mind very sedulously to poetical composition his ode to spring was written early in june to his friend mr west before he received the melancholy news of his death how our poets susceptible mind was affected by that melancholy incident is evidently demonstrated by the lines quoted above the impression indeed appears to have been too deep to be soon effaced and the tenor of the subjects which called for the exertions of his poetical talents subsequent to the production of this ode corroborates that observation these were his prospect of eton and his ode to adversity it is also supposed and with great probability that he began his elegy in a country church yard about the same time he passed some weeks at stoke near windsor where his mother and aunt resided and in that pleasing retirement finished several of his most celebrated poems  from thence he returned to cambridge which from this period was his chief residence during the remainder of his life the conveniences with which a college life was attended to a person of his narrow fortune and studious turn of mind were more than a compensation for the dislike which for several reasons he bore to the place but he was perfectly reconciled to his situation on mr masons being elected a fellow of pembrokehall a circumstance which brought him a companion who during life retained for him the highest degree of friendship and esteem  in      he was admittted to the degree of bachelor in the civil law as appears from a letter written to his particular friend dr wharton of old park near durham formerly fellow of pembroke hall cambridge in which he ridicules with much point and humor the lies and foibles and the dullness and formality which prevailed in the university  in order to enrich his mind with the ideas of others he devoted a considerable portion of his time to the study of the best greek authors so that in the course or six years there were hardly any writers of eminence in that language whose works he had not only read but thoroughly digested  his attention however to the greek classics did not wholly engross his time for he found leisure to advert in a new sarcastical manner to the ignorance and dullness with which he was surrounded though situated in the center of learning there is only a fragment remaining of what he had written on this subject from which it may be inferred that it was intended as an hymn to ignorance the fragment is wholly introductory yet many of the lines are so pointed in signification and harmonious in versification that they will be admitted by the admirers of verse to display his poetical talents with more brilliancy than appears in many of his lyric productions  hail horrors hail ye ever gloomy bowers ye gothic fanes and antiquated towers where rushy camus slowlywinding flood perpetual draws his humid train of mud glad i revisit thy neglected reign oh take me to thy peaceful shade again but chiefly thee whose influence breathed from high augments the native darkness of the sky ah ignorance soft salutary power prostrate with filial reverence i adore thrice has hyperion rolled his annual race since weeping i forsook thy fond embrace oh say successful do thou still oppose thy leaden aegis against our ancient foes still stretch tenacious of thy right divine the massy scepter over thy slumbering line and dews lethean through the land dispense to steep in slumbers each benighted sense if any spark of wits delusive ray break out and flash a momentary day with damp cold touch forbid it to aspire and huddle up in fogs the dangerous fire oh say  she hears me not but careless grown lethargic nods upon her ebon throne goddess awake arise alas my fears can powers immortal feel the force of years not thus of old with ensigns wide unfurled she rode triumphant over the vanquished world fierce nations owned her unresisted might and all was ignorance and all was night oh sacred age oh times for ever lost the schoolmans glory and the churchmans boast for ever gone  yet still to fancy new her rapid wings the transient scene pursue and bring the buried ages back to view high on her car behold the grandam ride like old sefostris with barbaric pride  a team of harnessed monarchs bend  in      he seems to have given up his attention to the muses mr walpole desirous of preserving what he had already written as well as perpetuating the merit of their deceased friend west endeavored to prevail with gray to whom he had previously become reconciled to publish his own poems together with those of west but gray declined it conceiving their productions united would not suffice to fill even a small volume  in      gray became acquainted with mr mason then a scholar of st johns college and afterward fellow of pembroke hall mr mason who was a man of great learning and ingenuity had written the year before his monody on the death of pope and his ii bellicoso and il pacifico and gray revised these pieces at the request of a friend this laid the foundation of a friendship that terminated but with life and mr mason after the death of gray testified his regard for him by superintending the publication of his works  the same year he wrote a little ode on the death of a favorite cat of mr walpoles in which humor and instruction are happily blended but the following year he produced an effort of much more importance the fragment of an essay on the alliance of education and government its tendency was to demonstrate the necessary concurrence of both to form great and useful men it opens with the two following similies the exordium is rather uncommon but he seems to have adopted it as a kind of clue to the subject he meant to pursue in the subsequent part of the poem  as sickly plants betray a niggard earth whose barren bosom starves her generous birth nor genial warmth nor genial juice retains their roots to feed and fill their verdant veins and as in climes where winter holds his reign the soil though fertile will not teem in vain forbids her gems to swell her shades to rise nor trusts her blossoms to the charlish skies so draw mankind in vain the vital airs unformed unfriended by those kindly cares that health and vigor to the soul impart spread the young thought and warm the opening heart so fond instruction on the growing powers of nature idly lavishes her stores if equal justice with unclouded face smile not indulgent on the rising race and scatter with a free though frugal hand light golden showers of plenty over the land but tyranny has fixed her empire there to check their tender hopes with chilling fear and blast the blooming promise of the year this spacious animated scene survey from where the rolling orb that gives the day his sable sons with nearer course surrounds to either pole and lifes remotest bounds how rude soever the exterior form we find however opinion tinge the varied mind alike to all the kind impartial heaven the sparks of truth and happiness has given with sense to feel with memory to retain they follow pleasure and they fly from pain their judgment mends the plan their fancy draws the event presages and explores the cause the soft returns of gratitude they know by fraud elude by force repel the foe while mutual wishes mutual woes endear the social smile and sympathetic tear say then through ages by what fate confined to different climes seem different souls assigned here measured laws and philosophic ease fix and improve the polished arts of peace there industry and gain their vigils keep command the winds and tame the unwilling deep here force and hardy deeds of blood prevail there languid pleasure sighs in every gale often over the trembling nations from afar has scythia breathed the living cloud of war and where the deluge burst with sweepy sway their arms their kings their gods were rolled away as often have issued host impelling host the blueeyd myriads from the baltic coast the prostrate south to the destroyer yields her boasted titles and her golden fields with grim delight the brood of winter view a brighter day and heavens of azure hue scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose and quaff the pendent vintage as it grows proud of the yoke and pliant to the rod why yet does asia dread a monarchs nod while european freedom still withstands the encreaching tide that drowns her lessening lands and sees far off with an indignant groan her native plains and empires once her own can opner skies and sons of fiercer flame oerpower the fire that animates our frame as lamps that shed at eve a cheerful ray fade and expire beneath the eye of day need we the influence of the northern star to string our nerves and steel our hearts to war and where the face of nature laughs around must sickening virtue fly the tainted ground unmanly thought what seasons can control what fancied zone can circumscribe the soul who conscious of the source from whence she springs by reasons light on resolutions wings spite of her frail companion dauntless goes over lybias deserts and through zemblas snows she bids each slumbering energy awake another touch another temper take suspends the inferior laws that rule our clay the stubborn elements confess her sway their little wants their low desires refine and raise the mortal to a height divine not but the human fabric from the birth imbibes a flavor of its parent earth as various tracts enforce a various toil the manners speak the idiom of their soil an iron race the mountaincliffs maintain foes to the gentler genius of the plain for where unwearied sinews must be found with sidelong plough to quell the flinty ground to turn the torrents swiftdescending flood to brave the savage rushing from the wood what wonder if to patient valor trained they guard with spirit what by strength they gained and while their rocky ramparts round they see the rough abode of want and liberty as lawless force from confidence will grow insult the plenty of the vales below what wonder in the sultry climes that spread where nile redundant over his summerbed from his broad bosom life and verdure flings and broods over egypt with his watery wings if with adventurous oar and ready sail the dusky people drive before the gale or on frail floats to neighboring cities ride that rise and glitter over the ambient tide it is much to be lamented that our author did not finish what was so successfully begun as the fragment is deemed superior to every thing in the same style of writing which our language can boast  in    0 he put his finishing stroke to his elegy written in a country churchyard which was communicated first to his friend mr walpole and by him to many persons of rank and distinction this beautiful production introduced the author to the favor of lady cobham and gave occasion to a singular composition called a long story in which various effusions of wit and humor are very happily interspersed  the elegy having found its way into the magazine of magazines the author wrote to mr walpole requesting he would put it into the hands of mr dodsley and order him to print it immediately in order to rescue it from the disgrace it might have incurred by its appearance in a magazine the elegy was the most popular of all our authors productions it ran through eleven editions and was translated into latin by anstey and roberts and in the same year a version of it was published by lloyd mr bentley an eminent artist of that time wishing to decorate this elegant composition with every ornament of which it is so highly deserving drew for it a set of designs as he also did for the rest of grays productions for which the artist was liberally repaid by the author in some beautiful stanzas but unfortunately no perfect copy of them remains the following however are given as a specimen  in silent gaze the tuneful choir among  half pleased half blushing let the muse admire  while bentley leads her sister art along  and bids the pencil answer to the lyre  see in their course each transitory thought  fixed by his touch a lasting essence take  each dream in fancys airy coloring wrought  to local symmetry and life awake  the tardy rhymes that used to linger on  to censure cold and negligent or fame  in swifter measures animated run  and catch a luster from his genuine flame  ah could they catch his strength his easy grace  his quick creation his unerring line  the energy of pope they might efface  and drydens harmony submit to mine  but not to one in this benighted age  is that diviner inspiration given  that burns in shakesocars or in miltons page  the pomp and prodgality of heaven  as when conspiring in the dimonds blaze  the meaner gems that singly charm the sight  together dart their intermingled rays  and dazzle with a luxury of light  enough for me if to some feeling breast  my lines a secret sympathy impart  and as their pleasing influence flows confessed  a sigh of soft reflection heave the heart   it appears by a letter to dr wharton that gray finished his ode on the progress of poetry early in      the bard also was begun about the same time and the following beautiful fragment on the pleasure arising from vicissitude the next year the merit of the two former pieces was not immediately perceived nor generally acknowledged garrick wrote a few lines in their praise lloyd and colman wrote in concert two odes to oblivion and obscurity in which they were ridiculed with much ingenuity   now the golden morn aloft  waves her dewbespangled wing  with vermil cheek and whisper soft  she wooes the tardy spring  till april starts and calls around  the sleeping fragrance from the ground  and lightly over the living scene  scatters his freshest tenderest green  new born flocks in rustic dance  frisking ply their feeble feet  forgetful of their wintry trance  the birds his presence greet  but chief the skylark warbes high  his trembling thrilling extacy  and lessening from the dazzled sight  melts into air and liquid light  yesterday the sullen year  saw the snowy whirlwind fly  mute was the music of the air  the herd stood drooping by  their raptures now that wildly flow  no yesterday nor morrow know  it is man alone that joy descries  with forward and reverted eyes  smiles on past misfortunes brow  soft reflections hand can trace  and over the check of sorrow throw  a melancholy grace  while hope prolongs our happier hour  or deepest shades that dimly lower  and blacken round our weary way  gilds with a gleam of distant day  still where rosy pleasure leads  see a kindred grief pursue  behind the steps that misery treads  approaching comfort view  the hues of bliss more brightly glow  chastised by sabler tints of woe  and blended form with artfl strife  the strength and harmony of life  see the wretch that long has tossed  on the thorny bed of pain  at length repair his vigor lost  and breathe and walk again  the meanest flowret of the vale  the simplest note that swells the gale  the common sun the air the skies  to him are opening paradise our authors reputation as a poet was so high that on the death of colley cibber in      he had the honor of refusing the office of poetlaureat to which he was probably induced by the disgrace brought upon it through the inability of some who had filled it  his curiosity some time after drew him away from cambridge to a lodging near the british museum where he resided near three years reading and transcribing  in      on the death of mr turner professor of modern languages and history at cambridge he was according to his own expression cockered and spirited up to apply to lord bute for the succession his lordship refused him with all the politeness of a courtier the office having been previously promised to mr brocket the tutor of sir james lowther  his health being on the decline in      he undertook a journey to scotland conceiving he should derive benefit from exercise and change of situation his account of that country as far as it extends is curious and elegant for as his mind was comprehensive it was employed in the contemplation of all the works of art all the appearances of nature and all the monuments of past events  during his stay in scotland he contracted a friendship with dr beattie in whom he found as he himself expresses it a poet a philosopher and a good man through the intervention of his friend the doctor the marischal college at aberdeen offered him the degree of doctor of laws which he thought it decent to decline having omitted to take it at cambridge  in december      dr beattie still desirous that his country should leave a memento of its regard to the merit of our poet solicited his permission to print at the university of glasgow an elegant edition of his works gray could not comply with his friends request as he had given his promise to mr dodsley however as a compliment to them both he presented them with a copy containing a few notes and the imitations of the old norwegian poetry intended to supplant the long story which was printed at first to illustrate mr bentleys designs  in      our author obtained that office without solicitation for which he had before applied without effect the professorship of languages and history again became vacant and he received an offer of it from the duke of grafton who had succeeded lord bute in office the place was valuable in itself the salary being  00l a year but it was rendered peculiarly acceptable to mr gray as he obtained it without solicitation  soon after he succeeded to this office the impaired state of his health rendered another journey necessary and he visited in      the counties of westmoreland and cumberland his remarks on the wonderful scenery which these northern regions display he transmitted in epistolary journals to his friend dr wharton which abound according to mr masons elegant diction with all the wildness of salvator and the softness of claude  he appears to have been much affected by the anxiety he felt at holding a place without discharging the duties annexed to it he had always designed reading lectures but never put it in practice and a consciousness of this neglect contributed not a little to increase the malady under which he had long labored nay the office at length became so irksome that he seriously proposed to resign it  toward the close of may      he removed from cambridge to london after having suffered violent attacks of an hereditary gout to which he had long been subject notwithstanding he had observed the most rigid abstemiousness throughout the whole course of his life by the advice of his physicians he removed from london to kensington the air of which place proved so salutary that he was soon enabled to return to cambridge whence he designed to make a visit to his friend dr wharton at old park near durham indulging a fond hope that the excursion would tend to the reestablishment of his health but alas that hope proved delusive on the   th of july he was seized while at dinner in the college hall with a sudden nausea which obliged him to retire to his chamber the gout had fixed on his stomach in such a degree as to resist all the powers of medicine on the   th he was attacked with a strong convulsion which returned with increased violence the ensuing day and on the evening of the st of may     he departed this life in the   th year of his age  from the narrative of his friend mr mason it appears that gray was actuated by motives of self improvement and self gratification in his application to the muses rather than any view to pecuniary emolument his pursuits were in general disinterested and as he was free from avarice on the one hand so was he from extravagance on the other being one of those few characters in the annals of literature especially in the poetical class who are devoid of self interest and at the same time attentive to economy but mr mason adds that he was induced to decline taking any advantage of his literary productions by a degree of pride which influenced him to disdain the idea of being thought an author by profession  it appears from the same narrative that gray made considerable progress in the study of architecture particularly the gothic he endeavored to trace this branch of the science from the period of its commencement through its various changes till it arrived at its perfection in the time of henry viii he applied himself also to the study of heraldry of which he obtained a very competent knowledge as appears from his remarks on saxon churches in the introduction to mr benthams history of ely  but the favorite study of gray for the last two years of his life was natural history which he rather resumed than began as he had acquired some knowledge of botany in early life while he was under the tuition of his uncle antrobus he wrote copious marginal notes to the works of linnaeus and other writers in the three kingdoms of nature and mr mason further observes that excepting pure mathematics and the studies dependent on that science there was hardly any part of human learning in which he had not acquired a competent skill in most of them a consummate mastery  mr mason has declined drawing any formal character of him but has adopted one from a letter to james boswell esquire by the rev mr temple rector of st gluvias in cornwall first printed anonymously in the london magazine which as we conceive authentic from the sanction of mr mason we shall therefore transcribe  perhaps he was the most learned man in europe he was equally acquainted with the elegant and profound parts of science and that not superficially but thoroughly he knew every branch of history both natural and civil had read all the original historians of england france and italy and was a great antiquarian criticism metaphysics morals and politics made a principal part of his study voyages and travels of all sorts were his favorite amusements and he had a fine taste in painting prints architecture and gardening with such a fund of knowledge his conversation must have been equally instructive and entertaining but he was also a good man a man of virtue and humanity there is no character without some speck some imperfection and i think the greatest defect in his was an affectation in delicacy or rather effeminacy and a visible fastidiousness or contempt and disdain of his inferiors in science he also had in some degree that weakness which disgusted voltaire so much in mr congreve though he seemed to value others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge yet he could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters and though without birth or fortune or station his desire was to be looked upon as a private independent gentleman who read for his amusement perhaps it may be said what signifies so much knowledge when it produced so little is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few poems but let it be considered that mr gray was to others at least innocently employed to himself certainly beneficially his time passed agreeably he was every day making some new acquisition in science his mind was enlarged his heart softened his virtue strengthened the world and mankind were shown to him without a mask and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling and unworthy of the attention of a wise man except the pursuit of knowledge and practice of virtue in that state wherein god has placed us  in addition to this character mr mason has remarked that grays effeminacy was affected most before those whom he did not wish to please and that he is unjustly charged with making knowledge his sole reason of preference as he paid his esteem to none whom he did not likewise believe to be good  dr johnson makes the following observations  what has occurred to me from the slight inspection of his letters in which my undertaking has engaged me is that his mind had a large grasp that his curiosity was unlimited and his judgment cultivated that he was a man likely to love much where he loved at all but that he was fastidious and hard to please his contempt however is often employed where i hope it will be approved upon skepticism and insidelity his short account of shaftesbury i will insert  you say you cannot conceive how lord shastesbury came to be a philosopher in vogue i will tell you first he was a lord secondly he was as vain as any of his readers thirdly men are very prone to believe what they do not understand fourthly they will believe any thing at all provided they are under no obligation to believe it fifthly they love to take a new road even when that road leads no where sixthly he was reckoned a fine writer and seems always to mean more than he said would you have any more reasons an interval of above forty years has pretty well destroyed the charm a dead lord ranks with commoners vanity is no longer interested in the matter for a new road is become an old one  as a writer he had this peculiarity that he did not write his pieces first rudely and then correct them but labored every line as it arose in the train of composition and he had a notion not very peculiar that he could not write but at certain times or at happy moments a fantastic foppery to which our kindness for a man of learning and of virtue wishes him to have been superior  as a poet he stands high in the estimation of the candid and judicious his works are not numerous but they bear the marks of intense application and careful revision the elegy in the churchyard is deemed his masterpiece the subject is interesting the sentiment simple and pathetic and the versification charmingly melodious this beautiful composition has been often selected by orators for the display of their rhetorical talents but as the most finished productions of the human mind have not escaped censure the works of our author have undergone illiberal comments his elegy has been supposed defective in want of plan dr knox in his essays has observed that it is thought by some to be no more than a confused heap of splendid ideas thrown together without order and without proportion some passages have been censured by kelly in the babbler and imitations of different authors have been pointed out by other critics but these imitations cannot be ascertained as there are numberless instances of coincidence of ideas so that it is difficult to say with precision what is or is not a designed or accidental imitation  gray in his elegy in the churchyard has great merit in adverting to the most interesting passions of the human mind yet his genius is not marked alone by the tender sensibility so conspicuous in that elegant piece but there is a sublimity which gives it an equal claim to universal admiration  his odes on the progress of poetry and of the bard according to mr masons account breathe the high spirit of lyric enthusiasm the transitions are sudden and impetuous the language full of fire and force and the imagery carried without impropriety to the most daring height they have been accused of obscurity but the one can be obscure to those only who have not read pindar and the other only to those who are unacquainted with the history of our own nation  of his other lyric pieces mr wakefield a learned and ingenious commentator observes that though like all other human productions they are not without their defects yet the spirit of poetry and exquisite charms of the verse are more then a compensation for those defects the ode on eton college abounds with sentiments natural and consonant to the feelings of humanity exhibited with perspicuity of method and in elegant intelligible and expressive language the sonnet on the death of west and the epitaph on sir william williams are as perfect compositions of the kind as any in our language  dr johnson was confessedly a man of great genius but the partial and uncandid mode of criticism he has adopted in his remarks on the writings of gray has given to liberal minds great and just offense according to mr masons account he has subjected grays poetry to the most rigorous examination declining all consideration of the general plan and conduct of the pieces he has confined himself solely to strictures on words and forms of expression and mr mason very pertinently adds that verbal criticism is an ordeal which the most perfect composition cannot pass without injury  he has also fallen under mr wakefields severest censure this commentator affirms that he thinks a refutation of his strictures upon gray a necessary service to the public without which they might operate with a malignant influence upon the national taste his censure however is too general and expressed with too much vehemence and his remarks betray upon the whole an unreasonable fastidiousness of taste and an unbecoming illiberality of spirit he appears to have turned an unwilling eye upon the beauties of gray because his jealousy would not suffer him to see such superlative merit in a cotemporary these remarks of mr wakefield appear to be well founded and it has been observed by another writer that dr johnson being strongly influenced by his political and religious principles was inclined to treat with the utmost severity some of the productions of our best writers to which may be imputed that severity with which he censures the lyric performances of gray it is highly probable that no one poetical reader will universally subscribe to his decisions though all may admire his vast intuitive knowledge and power of discrimination  in the first copy of this exquisite poem mr mason observes the conclusion was different from that which the author afterward composed and though his afterthought was unquestionably the best yet there is a pathetic melancholy in the four stanzas that were rejected following with incense kindled at the muses flame which highly claim preservation  the thoughtless word to majesty may bow exalt the brave and idolize success but more to innocence their safety owe than power or genius ever conspired to bless and thou who mindful of the unhonourd dead dust in thee notes their artless tale relate by night and lonely contemplation led to wander in the gloomy walks of fate hark how the sacred calm that breathes around bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease in still small accents whispering from the ground a grateful earnest of eternal peace no more with reason and thyself at strife give axious cares and endless wishes room but throuh the cool sequestered vale of life pursue the silent tenor or thy doom in one instance the doctors inconsistency and deviation from his general character does him honor after having commented with the most rigid severity on the poetical works of gray as it conscious of the injustice done him he seems to apologize by the following declaration which concludes his criticism and shall conclude the memoirs of our author  in the character of his elegy says johnson i rejoice and concur with the common reader for by the common sense of readers uncorrupted with literary prejudices after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learning must be finally decided all claim to poetical honors the churchyard abounds with images which find a mirror in every mind and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo the four stanzas beginning yet even these bones are to me original i have never seen the notions in any other place yet he that reads them here persuades himself that he has always felt them had gray written often thus it had been vain to blame and useless to praise him  the tears of genius an ode to the memory of mr gray by j t     on chams fair banks where learnings hallowed fane majestic rises on the astonished sight where often the muse has led the favorite swain and warmed his foul with heavens inspiring sight beneath the covert of the sylvan shade where deadly cypress mixed with mournful yew far over the vale a gloomy stillness spread celestial genius burst upon the view the bloom of youth the majesty of years the softened aspect innocent and kind the sigh of sorrow and the streaming tears resistless all their various power combined in her fair hand a silver harp she bore whose magic notes soft warbling from the string give tranquil joys the breast never knew before or raise the soul on raptures airy wing by grief impelled i heard her heave a sigh while thus the rapid strain resoanded through the sky haste ye sister powers of song hasten from the shady grove where the river ro along sweetly to the voice of love where indulging mirthful pleasures light you press the flowery green and from floras blooming treasures call the wreath for fancys queen where your gentlyflowing numbers floating on the fragrant breeze sink the soul in pleasing slumbers on the downy bed  for graver strains prepare the plaintive lyre that wakes the softest feelings of the soul let lonely grief the melting verse inspire let deepning sorrows solemn accents roll racked by the hand of rude disease behold our favorite poet lies while every object formed to please far from his couch ungrateful flies the blissful muse whose favoring smile so lately warmed his peaceful breast diffusing heavenly joys the while in transports radiant garments dressed with darksome grandeur and

story advertisement mr grays elegy previous to its publication was handed about in ms and had amongst other admirers the lady cobham who resided in the mansionhouse at stokepogeis the performance inducing her to with far the author acquaintance lady schaub and miss speed then at her house undertook to introduce her to it these two ladies waited upon the author at his aunts solitary habitation where he at that time resided and not finding him at home they left a card behind them mr gray surprised at such a compliment returned the visit and as the beginning of this intercourse bore some appearance of romance he gave the humorous and lively account of it which the long story contains  in britains isle no matter where an ancient pile of building stands the mansion house at stokepogeis then in the possession of vifcountess cobham the style of building which we now call queen elizabeths is here admirably described both with regard to its beauties and defects and the third and fourth stanzas delineate the fantastic manners of her time with equal truth and humor the house formerly belonged to the earls of huntingdon and the family of hatton  the huntingdons and hattons there employed the power of fairy hands to raise the ceilings fretted height each panel in achievements clothing rich windows that exclude the light and passages that lead to nothing full often within the spacious walls when he had fifty winters over him my grave lord keeper sir christopher hatton promoted by queen elizabeth for his graceful person and fine dancing  brawls were a sort of a figuredance then in vogue and probably deemed as elegant as our modern cotillons or still more modern quadrilles led the brawls the seal and maces danced before him his bushy beard and shoestrings green his highcrownd hat and satin doublet moved the stout heart of englands queen though pope and spaniard could not trouble it what in the very first beginning shame of the versifying tribe your history whither are you spinning can you do nothing but describe a house there is and that is enough from whence one fatal morning issues a brace of warriors the reader is already apprized who these ladies were the two descriptions are prettily contrasted and nothing can be more happily turned than the compliment to lady cobham in the eighth stanza not in buff but rustling in their silks and tissues the first came capapee from france her conquering destiny fulfilling whom meaner beauties eye askance and vainly ape her art of killing the other amazon kind heaven had armed with spirit wit and satire but cobham had the polish given and tippd her arrows with goodnature to celebrate her eyes her air  coarse panegyrics would but tease her melissa is her nom de guerre alas who would not wish to please her with bonnet blue and capuchine and aprons long they hid their armor and veiled their weapons bright and keen in pity to the country farmer fame in the shape of mr pt i have been told that this gentleman a neighbor and acquaintance of mr grays in he country was much displeased at the liberty here taken with his name yet surely without any great reason  by this time all the parish know it had told that thereabouts there lurked a wicked imp they call a poet who prowld the country far and near bewitched the children of the peasants dried up the cows and lamed the deer and sucked the eggs and kill the pheasants my lady heard their joint petition swore by her coronet and ermine she would issue out her high commission to rid the manor of such vermin the heroines undertook the task through lanes unknown over styles they ventured rappd at the door nor stayed to ask but bounce into the parlour entered the trembling family they daunt they flirt they sing they laugh they tattle rummage his mother pinch his aunt and up stairs in a whirlwind rattle each hole and cupboard they explore each creek and cranny of his chamber run hurry scurry round the floor and over the bed and tester clamber into the drawers and china pry papers and books a huge imbroglio under a teacup he might lie or creasd like dogsears in a folio on the first marching of the troops the muses hopeless of his pardon conveyed him underneath their hoops to a small closet in the garden so rumor says who will believe but that they lest the door a jar where safe and laughing in his sleeve he heard the distant din of war short was his joy he little knew the power of magic was no fable out of the window wisk they flew but left a spell upon the table the words too eager to unriddle the poet felt a strange disorder transparent birdlime formed the middle and chains invisible the border so cunning was the apparatus the powerful pothooks did so move him that willhe nillhe to the great house he went as if the devil drove him yet on his way no sign of grace for folks in fear are apt to pray to phoebus he preferred his case and begged his aid that dreadful day the godhead would have backed his quarrel but with a blush on recollection owned that his quiver and his laurel against four such eyes were no protection the court was sat the culprit there forth from their gloomy mansions creeping the lady janes and joans repair and from the gallery stand peeping such as in silence of the night come sweep along some winding entry styack the housekeeoer has often seen the sight or at the chapeldoor stand sentry in

in a country churchyard the curfew tolls  iquilla di lontano che paial giorno pianger che si muore dante pur at     the knell of parting day the lowing herd wind slowly over the lea the ploughman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivymantled tower the moping owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy

hearth shall burn or busy housewife ply her evening care no children run to lisp their sires return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share often did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow

inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory over their tomb no trophies raise where through the longdrawn aisle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honors voice provoke the silent dust or flattery sooth the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have swayed or waked to ecstacy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did never unroll chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some villagehampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood the applause of listening senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty over a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates

madding crowds ignoble strife this part of the elegy differs from the first copy the following stanza was excluded with the other alterations hark how the sacred calm that breathes around bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease in still small accents whispering from the ground a grateful earnest of eternal peace   their sober wishes never learned to stray along the cool sequestered vale of life they kept the noiseless tenor of their way yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked implores the
