a brief deduction of the original progress and immense greatness of the british woollen manufacture with an enquiry whether it be not at present in a very declining condition the reasons of its decay and the only means of its recovery  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane and a dodd at the peacock without temple bar      price one shilling  the preface as all evils are to be discovered before we can expect their remedy this work proceeds in that order  we shall never attempt the restoring our manufactures if we do not first enquire into the causes of their decay  the following work does not complain of the evil with reproach and to expose the indolence of the age whatever room there might have been for such a satyr  but seriously represents the grievance and earnestly moves our superiors to apply the proper remedies  it is not the war it is not the ingratitude of this power or the inveteracy of that which can hurt the british manufactures at least not fatally  our mischiefs are at home and the remedy is at home we may cure the evil with the utmost ease  but if we will be felo de se in trade if we will cut the throat of our own manufactures if we will pull them down with our own hands we should have our trade buried at a crossway with a stake driven through it and an inscription here lies buried the english trade having destroyed it self  this tract regards no faction or parties no complaint against public or private persons or management but it is a complaint of an unhappy humor among us all that we will discourage and destroy our own manufactures and ruin our selves  may the national wisdom restrain this folly may the poor obtain such help and trade such relief as the distress of our commerce and people call for and the end of this work and the authors wish will be fully answered  an account of the present condition of the manufactures of great britain the introduction before i enter into the substance of the question now before me and that i may make as little preamble as possible in a thing of such importance it is necessary to lay down in plain and direct terms so as may admit of no cavils or disputes what i mean and how i would be understood by the words the manufactures of great britain  by the manufactures of great britain and of which i suggest that they are now in a declining and decaying condition i mean the woollen manufactures such as broad and narrow cloths serges kersies druggets bays says perpets stuffs stockings hats flannels and all those woollen goods generally used for wearingapparel furniture of houses and suchlike necessary purposes and as are made by the labor of our people for use or sale at home that is to say in great britain or for exportation abroad of whatever kind and by whatever names for they bear so great a variety of names especially the norwich and spittlefields goods that it would be as endless as it is needless to enter into the particulars  that this manufacture is a thing of great importance of a vast magnitude and a value beyond all possible calculation i suppose i need not spend time to prove it is described in the best manner to be understood by taking notice that it not only uses and works up all the wool which grows in england but a very great quantity both from spain and ireland barbary turkey and other places wherever it can be had and of which i shall have occasion to take notice again in its place  that this manufacture was once in a flourishing condition vastly extended abroad and prodigiously consumed at home was carried on to the employment and enriching of innumerable multitudes of people and families of people till it had made england where its center is fixed the most opulent populous wealthy and powerful nation in the world all this i not acknowledge only but if it should be disputed am ready to make appear at large upon all occasions  it is likewise evident that this flourishing manufacture has risen from small beginnings and was at first rescued as it were out of captivity in a strange land where like israel in egypt it suffered bondage and was engrossed by foreigners who had no title to it having none of its principles no materials for carrying it on de jure in their own right no nor de facto in their possession but serchd them from us and then arbitrarily sold back the goods made of them to us at their own price enriching their people with the profits of the manufacture while  spaniardlike we starved with the mines of gold in our own keeping  from this captivestate this miserable abandoned condition it was rescued by the policy and wisdom of our government and the impolitick and foolish management of the spaniards who by their religious tyranny and their civil fury drove their own people over to us to seek bread and liberty in return for which they gave us wealth and trade taught our women to spin and our men to weave ever since this we have made the manufacture our own and are now able to teach our teachers having infinitely improved the kinds as well as increased the quantity have made not only innumerable newinvented sorts but have also made those sorts or kinds of goods much better than ever the flemmings were able to make them before especially the broad cloths which are improved to such a degree and brought to such perfection as they were never capable of before or so much as to believe possible  that by this very article england though not an inch of land larger either in length or breadth the soil not an ounce richer than it was capable of being made before the climate not one degree warmer and without any one advantage of nature more than it had before yet by a moderate and i believe a just and reasonable calculation between the year    0 in the beginning of king hen vii when we began to manufacture our own wool and the year      has increased her people from under two millions to above seven millions raised the value of lands so that what was then worth  0l per annum is now worth  000l per annum as may be seen by the rate of subsidies and by other rules of calculation and which has raised the value of personal wealth to such a degree as admits no comparison no calculation and hardly any imagination insomuch that some are of opinion that taking the wealth of this nation at the medium of time between the conquest and the reign of queen elizabeth that is to say about the reign of edward ii and excepting only the wealth of churches and monasterys which indeed was great there is now more silver in england than there was then block tin more gold than they had copper and more diamonds and pearl than they had bristol stones  this increase of people and of the real and personal wealth of england may be said to be all owing to the woollen manufacture and to bring it all to the point viz that this woollen manufacture has gone on increasing ever since even to this time or as i may more properly say to our time till its magnitude is such that we may say it is too great and that not too great for the country only but too great for the whole world  it is a strange advance made in this argument and at the beginning of it too to say the manufacture of england is too great for the world but i cannot go back from it and upon a serious reflection on its real magnitude as it now is and yet how much greater it is possible to make it that is to say how many countries and as i may say millions of people are yet unconcerned in it and unemployed by it i do insist that were the wool of great britain and ireland kept entirely at home the quantity increased as it might be and all that quantity manufactured at home as it also might be if those other countries were set to work the people of great britain and ireland are able to make more woollen manufactures than all the known inhabitants of the world would wear to such a perfection of working are the people arrived to such an immense quantity is the wool brought to amount to such a prodigious number are the people multiplied and the last article indeed is the most essential of all the rest for not withstanding the increase of the wool which is a prodigy in it self yet to such a degree are the people also increased that all the wool of england however as i say increased and all the wool of ireland from whence no wool was had in those days and all the wool of scotland which was not used at all in england in those times is now manufactured in england by less than one quarter part of our people  this may seem strange at first view and especially when we see how many thousands nay how many millions of people are employed in this one manufacture but let me be allowed a short digression and i shall soon prove it by giving you a view of the several countries in england where the woollen manufactures are made and where not  nb before i begin i must observe that when i say such counties make no woollen manufactures i do not mean that many of the people might not knit their own stockings spin and weave woollens for their own use and wearing as in some places they do linen where yet we do not say the linen is carried on as a manufacture but it is to be understood that they make no particular or general manufacture for sale and for trade to be carried out of the bounds of the towns or counties where they are so made    the county of cornwall is not known to have any manufacture devonshire indeed the next county immediately on this side is full of manufacture but we see nothing in cornwall but miners and diggers in the earth for lead copper and block tin as for the poor women they are employed in washing the oar and the men who are not at work in the mines are refiners smelters and melters of the oar and metals or else are husbandmen fishermen and sailers but no woollen manufacture    the four large counties of kent sussex surry and southampton have very little apparent manufacture in former times there were some cloathings about guildford godlaming darking and farnham in surrey and likewise at tenterden cranbrook goudburst and in the wild of kent in both which counties they made a very good though lowprizd medley cloth for the middling peoples wear but it is all gone extinct except a little not worth naming    the great city of london is now eminent for the woollen manufacture of stuffs chamlets and several goods such as were formerly made at norwich but as this is in a manner confined to spittlefields and a few adjacent streets and to a very little in southwark it may be truly said that not one twentieth part of the city and county of middlesex are concerned at all in it    the inland counties of bucks hertsord cambridge bedford and huntingdon these have none of them any woollen manufactures except that of late years the spittlefields manufacturers have employed some particular places in those counties for spinning worsted yarn but it is sent up to london to be manufactured    even lincolnshire it self though it is the inexhaustible fund of wool for all the east and southeast part of england and is the chief support of their manufacture yet has no manufacture of its own nor do we so much as see the women and children employed or any spinning among them though it is also an exceeding large and populous county but they are generally employed in trade or husbandry at home or upon the seas abroad    the county of stafford and of chester and darby being wholly taken up in making cheese breeding horses and cows digging lead and making crockery ware have very little or no woollen manufacture except about tamworth    northumberland cumberland durham and the east and north riding of yorkshire are the same and have no woollen manufacture except a small quantity of yarn stockings made at richmond and barnard castle and a ccarse stripped stuff for hangings at darlington    all the counties of wales put together produce no manufacture for sale or that come out of their own bounds except flannel with a very few and very coarse yarn stockings    nor do the two large counties of monmouth and hereford and two thirds of shropshire so much as pretend to any woollen manufacture but are taken up with planting orchards making syder etc  so that notwithstanding the exceeding greatness and extent of the woollen manufacture and that as i have said it seems to be too great even for the whole world yet it employs by far the least part of england and even the least part of the people in many of those counties where it is made  nay even in those counties where great branches of the woollen manufacture are established yet there are other manufactures which employ greater numbers of their people for example  the four capital districts where the woollen manufacture of england is seated are thus divided    the west riding of yorkshire including the east side of lancashire the county of westmorland and richmondshire and part of cumberland  yet in this very west riding is the great iron manufacture of sheffield and the county round it which is called hallamshire is said to employ at least an hundred thousand people    the west side of wilts and the whole counties of gloucester warwicksbire and worcester and part of shropshire and yet in the two counties of warwick and worcester are carried on the great hardware manufacture of iron brass steel etc at birmingham and the nailors which it is known to employ are a prodigious number of people many more than at sheffield as also the manufacture of glass at sturbridge besides several other smaller manufactures also of different kinds add to which the multitude of dairies and cheesemakers in those particular counties    the great and populous counties of devon and somerset the most intent perhaps upon the woollen manufacture of any in all britain yet how is the first diverted by the fishing trade upon both its shores its cider trade in the southhams and also in their seaaffairs as well the shipping as the merchandise and the other in grazing and digging of lead and coal which employs many thousands of their people    the counties of essex norfolk and suffolk carry on the fourth but not the least branch of the woollen manufacture and yet they tell us there are above thirty thousand men employed out of those three counties always at sea suffolk is two thirds of it both land and people employed in dairies and feeding cattle and fowls for london and they tell us that the two counties of essex and suffolk only send every year to london fifty thousand head of fat black cattle two hundred thousand fat sheep and lambs fifty thousand firkins of butter and twenty thousand barrels of oysters an hundred thousand fatted calves with two millions of geese and turkeys how many of the people all that may keep employed let others judge for me however it will be granted that even in these three counties where such prodigious manufactures are produced as norwich stuffs the sudbury says and the colchester bays yet not one half of the people are employed in any  add to this the multitudes of people in lancashire employed in making the cotton manufactures about which alone they say there are two hundred thousand people employed in the town of manchester and within twelve miles round it  add to this also the multitudes now employed in the same county in the linen manufacture which is so increased of late years there as to employ near as many as the cotton only that it extends over a greater compass of land  add to them all that even in those manufacturing counties where the greatest part of the woollen work is carried on and where the most people are employed by it not the lawyers not the physicians not the gentry not the clergy not the citizens or townspeople that is to say not the shopkeepers not all the handicrafts such as smiths carpenters masous bricklayers shoemakers and of the last not their wives or children so much as set a hand no not a finger to any part of this great manufacture except it be to wear it out and consume it  in a word except the weaving part and the managing part the main stress of the manufacture depends upon and is performed by the women and children and that of those few counties only  the conclusion from all this is directly to the case proposed thus  if the manufacture of england is so prodigious great and yet employs but so small a part of the people what might it not be brought to and how would it be as i said too great for the whole world if all the inhabitants i mean all the looser inhabitants such as are fit to work and who would gladly work if they could be employed were set in upon it what an infinite quantity of goods would they make and how would they use up not only all the wool that england scotland and ireland could produce but even more wool than they could produce though the said quantity was to be increased to twice or three times as much as it is and that none was clandestinely carried away to other parts  but as i said this part should be treated as a digression i will not run it out too long it comes of course next to consider the present state of this great manufacture how it stands and then bring it all to these great and necessary enquiries   whether it is under a declining and sinking condition or no   what effect this decay of the manufacture may have and what it naturally tends to   what are the occasions of its decay and wherein it consists   what may yet be done to revive it with some other observations which may fall in as we go   and this is the business in the following sheets  chap i of the original state of the woollen manufacture of great britain with some just deductions from what it has been in former times to what it is now as i have observed in the introduction that the woollen manufacture was like the children of israel rescued from a state of captivity and from a strange land we must make that out a little plainer the case was thus  in the reign of edward iii of glorious fame though england was thought to be at that time in the most flourishing condition that history gives us any account of the glory of her arms the vigor of the monarch and of his eldest son the gaiety and splendour of the court were such as never were known before the last was the resort of all the nobility youth and gentry of europe the second was the admiration and wonder of the world the greatest princes made their court to them and kings were captives in their possession england was the terror of the world the battles of cressy and poictiers and the reinstating the king of spain deposed by his rival were actions that brought all the powers of europe to stand at gaze and as it were to dread the turning of the arms of england so much as toward their dominions history will confirm all the particulars i have no room for long quotations  yet all this while trade shared no advantages among the conquests of the day nor do we find the least concern in any of the councils of that glorious prince or of his ministers of state for the propagation of commerce at home or abroad  building public and sumptuous edifices great churches and monasterys making feasts balls tournaments adorning windsorcastle instituting the famous order of knighthood making league and alliances expensive enterviews with foreign princes such as the emperor and the duke of burgundy and keeping a magnificent english court at cologne for almost a year and a half at a time these things took up the court and turned the eyes i had almost said turned the heads of the nation during that whole reign things which tended to the glory of the kingdom and the honor of the majesty of the king as nebuchadnezzar said of his great babel that he had built but as we may add these glorious things gutted england of its wealth made the monarch powerful and his people poor  in all his parliaments we see not one act for the encouragement of trade for the enlarging commerce for employment of the poor for setting up manufactures to speak the truth i question if the word manufacture or manufacturer were known in the country and for ought i see as the tailors were the only merchants so the shoemakers were the greatest manufacturers in the kingdom  the bountiful hand of heaven had then and from the beginning given england the greatest gift of nature that the whole world could be said to enjoy viz the wool the diligent and sensible nations round us understood it and how to value it and which was more understood how to improve it and for that end thronged to the very outmost bounds of the continent of europe this way to be near it and that they might bring it over as cheap as possible  by this i mean the netherlands where the industrious people by the help of the wool from england fell to work in such a manner as that there they made then as we have since done in england clothes for all the known parts of the world  this brought the many thousands and millions of people to inhabit those drowned overflowed bogs and marshes which before that were scarce thought fit for human creatures to dwell in and which were dwelt in only as retreats and fastnesses to secure the fugitive nations from the incursions of the gauls and afterward of the romans  this very trade brought people and built cities and castles even where the sea allowed no footing and the land no foundation from hence i say the numberless throngs of people came to dwell in that country and by degrees by the increase of their wealth and by their indefatigable industry all the effects of trade and manufacture have brought it to be the richest soil the fullest of people and of great cities and towns of any country in the world  all this while england lay neglected to the last degree her sons knocking their heads against stonewalls and ranging the field of war in foreign countries pursued their own poverty and sought misery for the glory of their monarch  but at home it was all a miscellany of sorrow villainage and vassalage comprised the poor knighthood and esquireship took up the middle gentry and glory dwelt only among the barons and princes  all the trade we read of was carrying their wool abroad to give employment to the poor of foreign countries viz the dutch and the flemings and this wool we may say was the grand fund of the wealth both of king and people  if the king made any wars and demanded subsidies of his parliament as was too frequently the case in the time of edw iii the grand article of ways and means was to grant the king ten shillings a pack upon wool or twenty shillings a pack upon wool like our two shillings and four shillings per pound upon land and once they came to such a height god forbid we should see the like of our lands that the parliament gave the king one half part of all the wool it self for his wars in france by the same token that as king charles ii did too often all the money was spent and no war with france begun neither nor did the war break out till three years after so that when it came they were sain to give the king new subsidies again that is to say another tax upon the exportation of wool and so over and over again several times  in this state of indolence or rather horrid ignorance and blindness was this whole nation as it were philtred and bewitched notwithstanding all the glory the wisdom the policy and good government which king edward iii was so famed for  like people buried alive in sloth and idleness they sat still ploughed and sowed as much corn as served just to feed them sheerd their sheep every year and as it may be said threw away their wool went to the wars were knocked on the head for the honor of old england and the glory of their great kings and this was the round of life even from the nobleman to the meanest vassal peasant or labourer in the nation  as to the poor women and children they sat at home fared hard lived poor and idle the women drudgd at the husbandry and the children sar still blowed their fingers picked straws and both might be said not to live but to slarve out a wretched time then die and go where  who knows  as to manufacture or employment we do not see room so much as to believe that they knew any thing of it any farther than it may be to make some very ordinary things which nature  necessity put them upon for their own covering and hardly that  in this miserable condition lay the ancestry of this diligent nation who being but once let into the method of working the wool and some authority supporting as well as encouraging them by stopping the stream of its exportation soon tasted the sweets of it soon fell heartily upon it presently became masters of the performance and in time supplanted the encroachers engrossed the wool for it was their own before redeemed the captives and at last brought not only the manufactures but the manufacturers too over to england for thousands of the people followed the manufacture for bread and that they might get employment and this began the multiplying of the people too as well as of their wealth for as trade brings wealth so work brings the workmen together  it is just thus still in england wherever we see the manufactures seated there we see multitudes of people collected the labor gathers the hands and this was the first occasion of making those strict exclusive laws for parish settlements that the particular parishes where such manufactures were set up might not be oppressed with the numbers of poor flocking in from other parishes  where the first manufacturers settled or set up the unemployed people presently thronged about them for business and wages and we find it to this day that where the manufactures are the country is always exceeding populous this it is evident the manufactures did not find but made it so it is true the manufacture in most places pitched its situation in great towns or cities such as norwich colchester canterbury exeter and the like but it is also certain that those cities and especially the adjacent countries are grown infinitely more populous by the settling of those manufactures among them than they were before  this is farther proved by a general view of those parts of england where the people are not thus employed for where the inhabitants of a country consist only or chiefly of landlord and tenant gentry and shopkeepers you see the country much less thronged it is true that the multitudes which live together in those places where the manufactures are established as above do influence all the rest of the nation by causing a greater cultivation of the lands and greater improvement of estates for provisions which the other consume the corn and the cattle being brought from the remotest parts for their subsistence and by consequence the people are increased there also  yet we see the country is inhabited in a more even manner the people live more at large and dispersed as the farms and the lands which they cultivate call them they are spread as it were over the whole sace of the land  we see no such villages there as leeds or hallifax sheffield or birmingham manchester or froom taunton or troubridge in most of which or on very little ground near them twenty to forty thousand people are said severally to inhabit and in three or four of them as in hallifax manchester birmingham and froom many more  but to go back to the introduction of this change it was in the reign of k hen vii and not before when the english began the bold adventure of manufacturing their own wool i mean began it in quantity there had some attempt been made before and we are told of some adventurers in trade who having been over in flanders and learned the manner of it but especially having seen the advantage of it had brought over with them so much knowledge as to learn the people to spin so many of them at least as their stocks could compass to employ and others to comb and card the wool and so on through all the other parts of the work which went a little way and was promising to go farther in time  but it is to be observed that from the first part of the reign of henry vi and through all that long reign and through the reign of edward iv and richard iii the whole nation was miserably embroiled in the civil confusions such as the wars between the white rose and the red the houses of lancaster and york and the several insurrections and revolutions of affairs which naturally attended those quarrels  every one knows that war is no friend to trade arts and improvements much less manufacture and the employment of the poor never plant or at least never thrive in the flame and heat of war especially too the worst of the kind an intestine civil or to speak justly of it an unnatural war  times of feud and faction rebellion insurrection killing and plundering are no times for improvement and this may be a just reason why the beginnings of the manufacture which i have mentioned as above took no considerable root during the confusions of war both civil and foreign wars but especially civil wars which for sixty years almost without intermission vexed this nation  perhaps a manufacturer did or suppose he had seated himself at any particular town or place in the country had brought together some people and had instructed them in the work viz some women to spin some men to comb to weave to dress the cloth and had built a fulling mill to thicken the cloths and the like then come the two armies into the field and they march over the country where the poor manufacturer is settled if it be a friendly army and they are of the same side then the kindest thing that could be expected was to call all the poor workmen away especially the young ablebodied fellows with their bows and arrows to increase the army if it were the enemy then they all run away for fear of being forced as for the women and children they are no body without the men for they cannot spin the wool till the men comb it and when they have spun the yarn it is of no use when the men are gone that should weave it and perhaps the loom which it should be wrought in burnt by the plunderings and ravagings of the soldiers  by this means and i cannot doubt but this was often the case the beginning of the manufacture was checked and put back the poor undertaker ruined and undone and so you heard no more of the attempt for some years  this is as good an account as i believe can be given why the woollen manufacture began among us no sooner why it had no encouragement in england at least no considerable encouragement till the time of king henry vii and about the year    0 to    0  the reign of king henry was the first halcyon season which england had selt not for some years only but for some ages as will appear at large in the histories of those times either wars abroad or wars at home had vexed the nation from the unfortunate reign of richard ii to that time all the circumstances of those reigns will confirm it i need not quote the particulars which are too many the nation was always in a hurry and a fright here the oppressions of tyrants there the rebellions of people here the kings deposed and murdered there the people ravaged and plundered now one king runs away then another hen vi was upon the throne and in prison alternately five or six times edward iv upon the throne and fled out of the country twice at least and so among the rest  but henry vii took new measures and managed the public affairs with the utmost dexterity he first humbled the too powerful nobility so to prevent caballing and rebellion brought them to be all dependent upon him and gradually impoverished them while he hoarded up immense sums of money himself in a word his reign was a whole scene of intrigue and design among the great ones the king ever talking of war and blustering at his neighbors as if he would quarrel with every body and got great sums of money from his parliament to begin a war especially against france but put the money in his pocket and never made any war at all and as some say never intended it  but in the mean time as these cabals and politics at court concerned no body but themselves his reign as to the people was all pacifick and quiet and the consequence was visible for now industry began to hold up its head trade began to spread the merchants began to set up and navigation to be encouraged the people of england began to look abroad and about them and colonies and factories began in this very reign to be planted foreign countries to be discovered and new worlds looked into and some tell us that christopber columbus having now discovered america came over hither and made the first offer for a farther discovery to king henry and particularly to take possession of it for him but that the king by the mere narrowness of his soul declined the expense of it  also it is affirmed that several voyages were made in this kings reign to the western shoars of africa and to the gold coast and great advantages made by it to the merchants bringing pure gold back for the most worthless trifles but this is not to the present purpose only thus far that this being a reign of prosound peace arts and commerce began to relish with the people and they began to turn their hands to several kinds of improvement  among the rest this of the woollen manufacture came principally into play the king who had lived abroad as well in flanders as in france and brittany had seen with regret how not the flemings only but the french grew rich at the expense of england and how even they could not refrain mocking the sloth and weakness of the english that should let their wool be carried out of the kingdom to be worked up into cloths and stuffs and in a word be manufactured abroad and then buy even the cloths they wore of their own wool so manufactured abroad  it must be consessd it deserved reproach and when we come to look back upon it at this distance we cannot help wondering at the madness of the people but there are so many other examples of the unaccountable stupidity of those ages especially of the common people that if they were all to be brought upon the stage we should cease to wonder at any thing of this kind as particularly how they were blindly given up to the absolute tyranny of the nobility in civil matters and to the absolute government of the ignorant priests on the side of religion  but not to dwell upon the folly of those ages i proceed to take a view of the advances our ancestors made in the recovering this glorious trade and even in that i shall not enlarge upon the little beginnings and unsuccessful attempts which as above were made by private purses and on private experiments before the reign of king henry vii for if we may believe fame there were several private essays made for the engaging in and carrying on a manufacture of woollen cloth before that time some of which began to promise success too and the people began to relish the thing and taste the profit of it before  had it not been so we can hardly think that king henry could all at once bring the people of england to a general manufacturing so as effectually to stop the exportation of the wool as he certainly did in the eighteenth year of his reign or thereabout  but several people having attempted it before some without success and some with and the thing beginning gradually to increase and get ground in the reign of edward iv the king who as above having seen the innumerable numbers of people working at it abroad and being thereby fully sensible of the advantage it would be to his own subjects if they could be brought to engage in it at home first set heartily about it among his own subjects encouraging those that were engaged in it and promising encouragement to others to go about it so that he brought several men of interest among his nobility and others to espouse it and the manufacture was set on foot in that manner in several parts of england and that with apparent success as particularly if we may credit private accounts the first appearance of the woollen manufacture of cloth was at wakefield in the west riding of yorkshire being encouraged by an ancient knight and favorite of king henry of the name of savil and some other persons of rank who had estates in that country and who encouraged their tenants and vassals to the work this savil i suppose to be some of the ancestors of the late marquis of hallifax one of whose titles is taken from the town of eland in the same part of the country and upon the banks of the calder not far from wakefield of whom the posterity are lords eland to this day  the next place to which the manufacture spread was the town of okingham in berkshire where it did not continue long or at least was not contained in the narrow bounds of that small place but spread it self to the larger towns of basingstoke and andover in hampshire and wiltshire and to reading and newberry in which four last towns it continued even till within these few years to an extraordinary magnitude but it is now removed farther west into wiltshire gloucestershire etc then the countess of richmond mother to king henry vii encouraged some moneyed men to set it up again in the villages about woking on the river wey where or near which she lived with a great and noble hospitality doing good to all the poor people round about her and particularly by thus settling them to work and that from thence began the clothing about guildford godlaming darking etc all towns in surrey and in other places thereabouts and which continues there though decayed to this day  it was some time after these private persons undertook the manufacturing of wool that king henry finding his subjects begin to improve and that the goods they made were able to supply the ordinary demand or near it caused the exportation of wool to be prohibited and foreignmade manufactures also to be excluded encouraging his people thereby to make larger quantities of those goods at home  nor did there need any greater encouragement to the manufacture than thus shutting out the foreign manufactures for this increasing the demand at home the price increased of course which sufficiently rewarded the labors of the workmen and increased their wages  i need not bring any vouchers to prove that this increase of wages improved the manufacture or increased the number of the workmen for now not only the english fell into the trade with courage and with multitudes but as above multitudes followed the manufacture out of flanders encouraged by the gain and wanting employment at home  nor were these of the laboring poor only but abundance of the master manufacturers and of those the most skilful in the workmanship by whom the people here were soon instructed and perfected in the knowledge not of the art only in general such as in the sorting combing carding and otherwise managing the wool in spinning weaving knitting etc but also in the several kinds of goods fitted for the markets and demanded as well abroad as at home  thus the english secured the trade to themselves and became first masters of the woollen manufacture and the very flemings themselves who had for so many ages eat the bread out of their mouths were now their assistants and instructors in completing them in the knowledge of dressing sheering perfecting and finishing the working part thousands of the said flemings and their families coming over hither for work and settling among them and whose posterity became english immediately after them scarcely reserving their foreign names or changing them to conceal their original  for it is to be observed that it was not so easy a matter for foreigners to be naturalized among the english in those times as it is now which made those that found means to settle here and turn their hands to the manufacture take what care they could to conceal themselves and so to change their sirnames or at least shorten and abridge them into differing sounds that they might be made to speak english as much as possible that is to say to sound like english for example jean de somteres would be called john summers guillaume de tournay william turner esticnne danvers stephen danvers jaques de franquemont james franks and so of the rest by which all the flemish dutch and walloon names were presently turned into english and thus of those who had two or three christian names as is common among foreigners they turned the second christian name into a surname and from thence it is said we have so many families of such sirnames among us to this day for example jean jaques de buromeir leaving out the surname was called john james guillaume jacob van platten william jacobs guillaume henry de villangen william henry and many more of this kind as we find the french refugees of the last age are doing at this very time jean de morlaix is now john morley and but the other day jaques de guilote called himself james gill and the like is done every day so that the families are no more known to be foreign but this is a digression  we find very little upon record relating to the wool being carried into flanders after this or of the flemings making broad cloth and stuffs nor indeed are our laws much concerned about those affairs except that king henry vii toward the end of his reign had some laws made to regulate the lengths and breadths of the cloths made here in order to bring the clothiers into a regularity of working and that the several sorts of goods should be all alike equal to one another and as near as possible of an equal goodness and value so to establish the price of every kind at market and prevent frauds  hence came the fixing of marks and seals to the cloths at first every maker striving to add a reputation to his own manufacture and pretending it to be superior in its fineness or goodness to his neighbors set his mark at the end wrought into the cloth in some different color or as afer some time was practiced leaden seals with the makers name and the weight of the cloth stamped upon them and hence after some time the several towns and corporations denominating the manufacture from the place obtained privileges and immunities powers and authority to regulate the length and breadth and goodness of the several manufactures made in those towns respectively stamping the leaden seals with the town marks or arms as at colchester at norwich at leeds and several other places  it is true that in this interval between stopping the wool from being exported and bringing the manufacture at home to a perfection two inconveniences happened    the kings revenue was greatly impaired and even the parliament were put to difficulties for ways and means upon extraordinary occasions to raise money for the kings business for the usual fund for raising money when the ordinary subsidies tenths and fifteenths were not sufficient was by granting the king twenty shillings or forty shillings as the public occasion called for it upon each pack of wool whereas now the wool being detained at home the clothiers paying no duty upon that which they bought at home nor any tax upon the cloths when made the revenue to the crown was stopped at once and this perhaps might be the reason that notwithstanding the prohibition in henry viis time which perhaps was temporary and so might be expired we find the wool was exported again to flanders in the reign of king henry viii and in the fourth of king edward vi we find mention made of a wool fleet of sixty sail bound to antwerp which i take to be partly also occasioned by this next article viz    that the clothing being yet young in england though greatly improved considering the time it had been set up in the manufacturers were not able to work up the whole quantity of wool which grew in england and so the government was obliged either to allow or wink at its being carried abroad as it certainly was all the reign of henry viii and of edward vi also though in the said fourth year of ed vi they consulted much upon erecting a mart for the english cloth and block tin to be established at southampton so that none of those goods should be sold at any other place for the southwest parts of england and at hull for the north parts this last to accommodate the merchants of the eastseas called the hans and also for the ease and advantage of the northern clothiers in england for that it was observed even then that the clothing trade flourished in those early times in the west riding of yorkshire viz at wakefield halifax leeds etc more than in any other part of england  however as i have said that the clothiers were not yet able to work up all the growth of the wool in england so there seemed to be a necessity to let some part of it be sent abroad yet it was resolved in king edwards council it seems to stop the fleet which was just then going for antwerp and to have the wool kept at home to encourage the mart intended to be erected at southampton but the fleet was sailed out of dover harbor and out of the river of thames before the order of council was passed and could reach them and so the wool went away and the kings death following soon after those resolves came to nothing for that time  in the next reign philip ii king of spain marrying queen mary of england it was not to be expected that a prohibition so much to the prejudice of the trade of the netherlands which were king philips proper dominion should pass in england so that we have reason to believe the prohibition of sending wool over the seas was at least suspended for that reign and what happened in the next we shall have frequent occasion to mention as we go on  thus you see the infant state of the woollen manufacture from what rational measures it received its first encouragement in england and how gradually it came on for we must also observe that as it was a thing of vast magnitude as well as of the utmost importance to this nation so it was not easily much less suddenly brought to perfection the stream or channel of so great a commerce was not soon changed though our people came into it with cheerfulness and made wonderful progress for the time yet this rome was not built in a day it was many years nay ages before it came to perfection  the first beginnings of it i take to have been in the reign of edward iv that is to say of its being attempted by private hands the first public countenance it received was at nearest about the year    0 in the time of henry vii and it was from thence to the year    0 viz under queen elizabeth before it came to its perfection so that it was above an hundred and twenty years as we may call it in its state of nonage though all the while increasing and growing and in a promising view of a prosperous magnitude the same which we have since seen it arrive to  it had indeed a most glorious patron or patroness and protector in queen elizabeth who not only promoted and encouraged it at home but also extended the trade for the consumption of it abroad for in her time the several branches of the english commerce were extended into almost all parts of the known world the turkey trade and the muscovy trade established the colonies in america discovered and planted by all which the woollen manufacture obtained a vent in foreign markets and those great branches of its consumption which have since been so large and are still the most considerable were first established in her time particularly i say that of turkey and muscovy  but nothing contributed so effectually to the prosperity of the woollen manufacture in this nation and which may be said under the wise conduct of that glorious queen to complete the whole fabric giving the mortal stroke to unhinging the whole trade in and shutting it for ever out from the low countries as the long and bloody war between the king of spain and his subjects in those countries on account of the liberties and religion of the people  by this the people were distracted and separated the nobility murdered the towns ruined the country plundered the united provinces now called the states general entirely broken off from the king of spains government thousands of the people fled over to england where they were kindly received hospitably relieved courteously entertained and which was above all the rest encouraged to set up their manufactures in the towns and corporations wherever they pleased and this increased and completed the manufacturing trade in england and thus we have brought it within view at least of its present state  chap ii of the flourishing circumstances of the english manufactures in the ages past both abroad and at home with a summary account of its gradations it was not to be reckoned a small part of the increase of the woollen manufacture in england considering its original was from abroad that it was made capable of supplying the demands of the home trade and was considerable enough to cloth its own people nor was it under above an hundred years improvement from its beginning that this could be attained to as is noted above  the manufacturers abroad not only outworkd us but underworkd us they made their goods both better and cheaper the english had great advantages but no experience so that still some of the nicer and better manufactures were made in flanders and holland nor was there any avoiding it at first  but when the flemings persecuted and terrified by the cruelty and persecution of the duke dalva fled over hither and queen elizabeth gave them protection and encouragement here the english then became absolute masters of the manufactures and from thence we may date the perfection of their skill then all foreign importation might be said to cease and the carrying abroad of the wool was made criminal  but let us see how its consumption went on    at home the whole country was clothed poor and rich nothing so fine but it was to be had in gloucestershire and wiltshire worcestershire and barkshire jack of newbury was a clothier superior to any that are to be found among us at this time by many thousands as money went then and mr kenricks will of st christophers who was originally a clothier and then a cloth merchant dealing to dort testifies how considerable the trade was by that time  viz king james   when he left above  0000l in gifts and charities besides the bulk of his estate    but let us also take a view of its increase abroad from queen elizabeths time besides its being able fully to supply all the people at home    that queen established a flourishing company called the levant merchants the same we now call the turkey company by which she extended the trade of the english for their fine broad cloths into the several courts of persia turkey and egypt for either the queen or the turkey company i am not sure which making some presents to the grand seignior of fine english cloth of such exquisite workmanship for the fineness of the cloth and of such beautiful colors being dyed scarlet and crimson the said grand seignior and the grand vizier caused fine robes or gowns to be made of the said cloths and also fine vests after their manner which being surred with sables and rich furrs presented them much about the same time from the great duke so the russian emperor was then called of muscovy made a most magnificent appearance the grand seignior and his courtiers were so pleased with them that they soon became the mode or wear of all the great officers and of the grand seignior himself and so again of the viziers or viceroys of their remotest provinces and the same at the court of persia  thus in a few years the fine english cloth became the robes of majesty and as it were the badge of greatness and glory at constantinople and at ispahan at alexandria in egypt and at aleppo in asia and every where else among the mahometans where they had money sufficient to purchase them and thus it continues to this day which is still more strange than all the rest    the same levant company included the trade to alexandria in the mouth of the great river nile by which all the country of egypt was supplied and not only the great court of the vzier of grand cairo who though a subject or slave of the grand seignior yet keeps a court almost as great and as magnificent as the emperor his master but also the same coths were convoyed to suez a seaport of the turks in the red sea and thence by water to judde or ieddo the sea port to the city of medina the great center of the mohammedan superstition where the riches and magnificence of their priests is not to be described and where they are still clothed in the same manner especially on their days of ceremony    the same levant company extended the trade for english cloth to the city of venice at the bottom of the adriatic gulf where they drove a very great and advantageous trade for i suppose that the trade of smyrna and scanderoon and the caravans by aleppo to persia were not at that time found out by the english but were carried on if at all by the merchants of venice who at that time engrossed indeed all the commerce of the east imported the spices and all the rich goods of the indies by the gulf of persia and by the caravans of bassora and bagdat to aleppo and sent back by the same conveyance such european goods as those countries demanded among which the fine broad cloths of england soon after that time began to be the most acceptable and were indeed of the greatest value of any thing of that kind in the world    likewise in this queens reign the passage to archangel or the white sea being discovered the english merchants found means to carry on a trade from that port by watercarriage to the great city of muscow a little way excepted where their goods were carried by land about sixty miles only  here they also found a market for their rich cloths in the great dukes court and upon this a new society for commerce was erected and were called the muscovy company who brought back a very gainful return in sables ermins and other rich furrs the produce of the wild and barren deserts of siberia and the north  nb these muscovy merchants found the way some time after this to pass by the great river wolga to astracan and thence into the caspian sea an inland navigation  reckoning from jerowslaw where they first embarked their goods of very near  000 miles on one river viz the wolga hence  unwearted in their search after new worlds of trade they passed the caspian landed in gerogia passed over the mountains of armenia and reached into the heart of the kingdom of persia where they found an extraordinary reception sold their fine cloths at an extravagant price such as was even surprising to themselves and brought back bales of raw silk to a very great advantage also so that notwithstanding the extraordinary charges of so exceeding long a travel they made a very profitable voyage  these two new trades gave a very great encouragement to the english merchants and particularly to the manufacture of english cloth which now obtained such a reputation over the whole trading world that nothing was equally valuable in any or perhaps in all the courts of europe and asia    in the latter end of this queens reign the same manufactures were demanded in an exceeding manner in the northern parts of the empire and the countries bordering on the baltic and this trade naturally fell into the hands of the hans that is to say the society of merchants who called themselves the hans a word signifying a brotherhood or an united company and because there were so many for there was once no less than seventy two cities of them they were called the hans towns these carried on the trade of the north as the venetians did that of the south and east mentioned above  by these towns the english manufacture was indeed wonderfully extended that is to say into all the countries in the baltic the kingdoms of denmark and norway the coasts of mecklemberg both the pomerens prussia courland livonia easthonia etc and up the great rivers of those countries into the very heart of the empire and of all the northern countries for example    by the city of bremen one of the chief of the hans towns the english manufacture passed up the weser into all the circle of westphalia into the countries of lunenberg hessia and some part of the lower saxony    by the city of hamburgh another of the hans towns they had the like passage into the heart of the dominions of the empire and even to the hereditary countries of the house of austria for the elb carries its navigation by it self and other navigable rivers into and through the electorates of saxony and brandeburgh up to the great city of prague the capital of bohemia    by the city of lubeck the capital and first of the hans towns to all the kingdom of sweden that city having at that time the possession and government of all schonen and the whole commerce of the kingdom of sweden whose power in shipping was at that time very low and the hans were masters of the sea in all that part of the world    by the city of stetin another hans town situate on the great river oder and by which the stetiners carried on the like trade into silesia lusatia austria and into poland    by the city of dantzick another hans and by the trade of that city upon the great river vistula the english manufactures were spread into the heart of poland and even to the frontiers of hungaria    by all the seaports of koningsburg riga revel and narva and the several rivers called the duina the nicmen the pregel and the narve by all which the english merchants found an exceeding vent for the consumption of the english cloths especially the northern clothing of leeds wakefield and halifax called in general yorkshire cloth which being not so fine or dyed in such costly colors as that which was sold into persia muscovy and the levant yet suiting best with those northern climates the merchants found the quantities which sold there exceeding great and the price sold for very encouraging    france and spain also though the last was generally embroiled with england almost all that reign were yet during the rising prosperity of the english manufacture glad to come into the trade of it and especially the former took off great quantities every year for france had not yet set their hands to work to imitate much less to rival the english in this particular piece of improvement as for the spaniards the peace or truce between spain and the states general which was first settled for twelve years only by which the spaniards were obliged to acknowledge the dutch or united provinces to be a free state as it brought on with it a peace or a good correspondence at least between england and spain so it wonderfully increased the british commerce and especially the consumption of the english manufactures in all the provinces of europe where they had been obstructed if not prohibited before  particularly the dutch by the navigation of the rhine and the maes two great rivers and one of them without comparison the greatest river for trade and inland navigation in europe carried those goods up into the middle of the southern countries of the empire for now the english woollen cloth was become the general favorite of europe and the manufactures of england were the chief article at the great fairs of ausburg nuremberg francksort and leipsick the greatest marts of europe at that time if not in the world and which continue in a flourishing condition to this day though sensibly declining in that particular article which was their first rise and foundation i mean that of the english woollen manufacture as i shall show in its place  by this means the english manufacture which the dutch at that time gladly promoted extended it self not only into the several countries adjoining to those rivers but into other countries by the additional help of other navigable rivers running into them or running through other provinces not far from them such as    the moselle falling into the rhine at coblents and taking into it the saar by which the trade was supplied into lorrain the country of tryer the northeast parts of france the three bishoprics of metz toul and verdun and into all that rich and fruitful country between the saar and the rhine    the main a river navigable almost  00 miles into the circle of franconia and to the countries of wurtzburgh bamberg baden and many other of the most populous parts of germany passing then by francfort au main and falling into the rhine at mentz    the neckar a navigable river also running through the fruitful rich country of the count palatine of the rhine and passing by the cities of heidleberg hailbron and the mountains of the black forest and within a few miles of the city of ulm upon the danube where that great river begins to be navigable and by which the said trade had a communication with all the great cities and rivers of suabia and bavaria and even down to passau lintz and vienna    the aar a large river of swisserland also navigable which rising out of the same mountains of the grisons from whence the rhine it self proceeded passes through the city of bern near that of zurick and other considerable parts of the swiss cantons and falling into the rbine a little above basle carried the english woollen manufacture into the cantons of swisserland as it does now serve to our great mortification to bring the like manufactures now made in swisserland down into germany and to the great fairs of nuremberg and francksort where they undersell and supplant us as shall be seen in its place  in this flourishing condition queen elizabeth left the woollen manufacture of england being at that time not the greatest manufacture in europe only for so it may be called still though sinking and declining apace but the most increasing thriving and rising trade at that time in the world  as the woollen manufacture had thus been about an hundred and fifty years in its growing and increasing condition like a young oak in the woods so now being grown major or as we say of age and out of its nonage we may allow it to have continued above another century in its flourishing and prosperous state that is to say it held its own and continued in its full glory extended to an infinite length and breadth triumphing over the whole world of commerce not rivaled not imitated i will not say not envyed but really not rivaled by any people or in any country in the world no not so much as pretended to be rivaled any where and this last hundred years which i reckon to be the state of its full glory and perfection i take to be from the middle of queen elizabeths reign to the end of the reign of king charles ii that is to say near the end of it viz from the year    0 twenty years before queen elizabeth died to the year    0 being the latter end of the reign of king charles ii  during this time the manufactures were so far from receiving any blow any mortal wound or sensible disaster either from abroad or at home that the several circumstances relating to the vent and consumption of them concurred to enlarge them and render their condition yet more flourishing and prosperous if that could be than they were before for example  first during that interval of time many flourishing and now famous colonies of english had been settled in america and in other remote parts of the world the discoveries of the indefatigable adventurers of that age such as sir francis drake sir walter raleigh the famous earl of cumberland captain smith and others too many to name by whom the commerce of the english was extended in a prodigious manner and their dominions also as in the following countries in particular   virginia   barbados   new egland   bermudas   newfoundland   nevis   hudsonsbay   antegoa   new york   montserrat   new jersey   st christophers   pensilvania   jamaica etc   carolina  in all these the succeeding generations have so improved the plantations have been so spread so well managed and the numbers of people are so surprisingly increased that whereas in the beginning of king jamess reign it is creditably affirmed there were not five thousand people in all of them negroes excepted and not abundance of them it is now as creditably insisted upon that there are not less than a million of british subjects slaves included which monstrous increase is not only an addition to the greatness and glory of the british dominion and to their commerce by the immense return of their product to england such as from the continent in tobacco rice pitch tar turpentine trainoil fish whalefins furs drugs etc and to the other colonies on the islands in corn meal peace pork beer horses etc and from the islands to england in sugar rum melasses ginger cotton indico piemento cocoa and many other valuable things i say this increase of people is not only an increase of commerce in the returns abovenamed but it adds to the consumption of the british manufactures in an extraordinary manner not only all that million of people being to be clothed from hence but that they have in all places upon the said continent taught the natives of the country to go clothed also and who are supplied with manufactures from england all which is a mere addition to the trade as well as to the navigation of england since the time abovenamed nothing of those countries being then known much less any trade to them  it may be objected and has been pretended that the first planters or inhabitants of those colonies coming from england is no addition for that the same increase would have been from them at home if they had not gone abroad  but as this requires a long and full answer such a full answer may be given to it hereafter and particularly this that those inhabitants generally going over thither in mean circumstances and growing rich there by their industry have quite altered the case and that the increase of the same people if it had happened had probably been an increase both of unprofitable hands and mouths whereas here they have been just the contrary and their posterity being rich and industrious have thereby increased the public wealth as well as the numbers of people but this is not to the present purpose  it is certain that since queen elizabeths time not our colonies only but the whole kingdom of england is increased in people in a wonderful manner and that notwithstanding the prodigious numbers who we can account for as destroyed out of the ordinary course of nature such as by war abroad and at home plague shipwreck peopling of ireland and other cases by which some millions may have been destroyed and no doubt have been  all this increase of people has been an addition to the consumption of the manufactures and consequently an increase of it and to say that the manufacture was increased by its being sufficient to clothe the inhabitants in edward the sixths reign was to say little or nothing compared to what the importance of the same article would be now seeing we cannot doubt but that there are at least four millions of people in the kingdom of england at this time more than there were at the end of the year   00  the first foundation of this increase was without doubt said in the fixing the manufactures at home which were before settled in flanders as i have said and the next step was the persecution of the spaniards in flanders mentioned also above  the last of those articles as some are of opinion brought over at least one hundred thousand flemings into england where queen elizabeth far from being ignorant of the benefit that numbers of people would be to her dominions where she knew well there was business enough to employ them gave them all imaginable encouragement appointed them churches admitted them to set up in corporations exempted them from taxes and the like and we see their posterity here to this day distinguished by name in many of our manufacturing towns as the rebows at colchester the de vinks at norwich the papilons at canterbury and the like  i might give examples of the casual increase of the english manufactures both abroad and at home within the compass of an hundred and twenty years now passed from the death of queen elizabeth as limited above to this time all which may serve further to prove the then flourishing condition of that trade such as the several factories of the english in other parts of the world and the increase of the spanish and portugueze colonies in america which have still added to the increase of the manufactures of great britain the consumption being so very great among those nations  hitherto then we have seen the bright side of the subject and have brought the manufacture to its meridian height it is only to be observed as an addition to what has been said that as the consumption of the manufacture increased abroad so the quantity made increased at home the manufactures increasing the manufacturers increased also the trade spread at home in proportion as it spread abroad and that which was at first the work of a few counties and cities became now the employment of whole provinces or divisions of the country being a kind of district consisting of several counties or parts of counties together  thus the manufacture first erected at norwich spread in a little after the said time over the whole counties of norfolk and suffolk as the bay trade of colchester first confined to that town and the adjacent country is now extended through the whole county one of the largest and most populous in england the clothing trade erected first at the towns of oakingham reading newbery and andover in the countries of wiltshire and berkshire is now spread farther into wiltshire and somersetshire extending along a vast tract of ground from the edge of gloucestershire to the side of dorsetshire for near an hundred miles through the richest and most fruitful vale in all the west part of england called the vale of whitehorse and including the populous towns of malmsbury tedbury cirencester stroud marshfield caln chipenham devizes bradford trowbridge froom warminster westbury and many more with innumerable populous villages  the like in the clothing of worcestershire extended into the counties of salop hereford gloucester and the counties adjacent  thus i say the manufacture flourishing abroad spread in proportion at home till at length it arrived  the magnitude which we see it in at this time when its body is said to be too big for its legs and the multitudes employed in it are such that at the same time that the markets are decayed abroad the extent of it not being limited at home the laws of proportion have been broken and though the sale has been lessened the people have still gone on making till according to some the quantity has been superior to what the whole world could or at least in the ordinary course of trade would consume and this brings us to the present state of the manufacture as it stands aborad just now with respect to the sale and as it stands at home with respect to the production by which it will be easily seen whether the manufacture as a trade or as a business is in a thriving or a declining condition  chap iii of the present state of the british manufacture as well abroad as at home with a just deduction from the prospect of it to the question in hand viz whether it is in a declining condition or no we have seen something of the past state of the woollen manufacture queen elizabeth brought it into a flourishing condition in which it continued with several large additions to its prosperity and a continual increase of its magnitude and of its consumption to the time of the late restoration in which time if it sunk in one article it rose in another so that we might say it was always flourishing and was rather greater than less at the end of the next hundred years than at the beginning that is to say at the year   00 than at the year   0  when queen elizabeth died  certain it is that the consumption was infinitely increased the trade abroad perfectly good experience as well as history confirms that even in the height of the confusions of the civil wars in england the trade of the woollen manufacture was flourishing and prodigious great even during the time of the siege of colchester when that town was as it was called then in open rebellion the necessity of trade obliged the besiegers to give the townspeople leave to bring out their bays to lexden heath and to sell them to the london merchants who came thither to buy and the sellers were allowed to carry back their money unmolested by the soldiers who besieged them the reason was plain the demand from abroad made it necessary the merchants should be supplied and the trade ought not to be obstructed  nay such was the consumption of the woollen manufacture abroad that all the increase of it at home was not sufficient but the irish encouraged by the merchants and having plenty of wool feel into the making part and in a few years peace being restored in that kingdom and the english inhabitants multiplying the woollen manufacture came by the industry of people to be as great there in proportion as it was here  france about this time increased in people and flourishing in peace under the prosperous reign of lewis xiii and the exquisite administration of the great richlieu began to extend their trade and the demand they made of our manufacture in that reign was prodigious great  but here we must make a full point and look a little into the trade as in a state of full perfection and standing for some time at a stay  that great britain grew immensly rich in those ages of trade is not to be denied or indeed disputed we might give a long account of the increase of her wealth and riches her greatness and glory and how it was all raised by and the effect of her increased commerce but it is too long for a tract of this nature it will be seen in its consequences and in nothing more than in the prodigions efforts made by the whole nation in the late double war from the revolution to the peace of utrecht in which let but the immense sums of money which were raised upon trade only be taken account of and they will give us a fair sketch of the improvement it self  nay let the vast sums raised annually to this day by the customs upon trade speak something of the increase of it since those days i need not enter into the detail of those productions such as the duties on wines tobacco brandies east india and italian and turkey importations the excises on beer ale malt spirits coffee tea etc which at this time raise such sums as no nation in the world can show the like of and as this nation never came up to before  i shall close the abstract of it with this short return of the late king lewis xiv to the account of the last years state of the war in england when he saw the establishment of the south sea company and the provision made by the parliament for the old unprovidedfor debts and for the service of the growing year both which amounted to near eleven millions sterling a sum so frightful put into french money that the king upon sight of it spread out his hands and said i see it is time to put an end to the war i never believed that england could have made such efforts as these let us make peace upon the best terms we can  but i come in the next place to the declining part of our trade and to enquire where it began  chap iv how and when the british manufactures began to receive some impression from the influence of other nations and how they began to suffer any lessening or loss from those impressions the first impression which the british commerce felt upon the greatness of her trade and especially upon her manufacture was from ireland  it was in the latter end of the reign of king charles ii that england driving such an encouraging commerce in the export of her woollen manufactures the gain of it animated the irish merchants not only to export the like from ireland but to encourage the people of ireland as well the natives as the english irish so they call the families risen up there from the english race to push into it and to set up the working all manner of woollen goods made in england after the same manner and under the same denominations as in england with this addition that they soon found themselves able not only to do it as well as in england the wool and the workmanship being as it were the same but that they were able to make finish export and consequently sell at market the same goods as good and much cheaper than the english  the first discovery of this in england seemed to be from france and from spain where our merchants to their great mortification first sound themselves undersold in the markets goods of the same fabric of the like weight goodness value and color being afforded much cheaper than from england  this was an affliction in trade and a very great disappointment to the merchants and in its turn to the factors and to the manufacturers in the country for first our goods at the several markets in france lay unsold expected orders were stopped and interrupted the merchants in france wrote to ireland for the goods the markets were supplied and our trade in a word decayed  it was not long so here but we began to find the same in portugal and at cadiz in spain and at other markets as at leghorn messina and the principal ports of italy and thus it was going on to be in all other parts of the world  but this was not all misfortunes seldom come alone one evil generally follows in the neck of another about this time monsieur colbert that great and successful manager of the french commerce after having with a most happy and wonderful advantage put all the southern provinces of france upon the planting mulberry trees and raising of silk obliging every town and village in the great provinces of languedock provence dauphine and the adjacent countries to plant a proportioned number of mulberry trees for the nourishing silkworms and by that means to establish a fund for the silk he contrived the like as far as in him lay for the wool  but finding it impossible to form a production of wool in france though he got over sheep from england from ireland and from scotland and that he could not make the wools come on or grow there as they did at home he then applied himself to the settling methods for getting wool from england and especially from ireland by this he immediately set up large manufactures in france as at rouen at caen in poictou guienne nismes and other places too many to enumerate with this and the spanish wool and such other supplies as he got from remoter places he soon advanced in his new attempt and made several sorts of woollen manufactures and this in such quantities and so well performed that we saw france in a few years able to supply themselves with clothing of their own making though not of their own wool and even to transport the manufactures they wrought to other places where they were sold in the same markets with the english to our great mortification as well as loss  nor was this all but so far the french proceeded that in a few years they set up for prohibitions excluded our merchandises all over france and pretended to shut us out from their markets so that we should not be allowed to import our goods any more into france  this was a terrible blow to england and had we not soon after made our selves amends upon france by prohibiting their whole commerce with us particularly their wines brandies linen and wrought silks four articles in which it was said we took near two millions sterling from them per annum more than all the goods that they took from us amounted to i say had we not done this it must have ruined our whole stock by draining away such immense sums in cash as must have been called off for the balance  here began the breach between england and france in point of commerce and as it came with a war it lasted so long that it is not yet returned nor is ever likely to be the humor of the english ran off from the french trade neither their wines or their brandies or their wrought silks have ever come into use again here and perhaps would never do so again though the trade were to be opened at least it would not as it did before our taste is changed as to their wines our fashions and modes are changed as to their silks and the whole vein of their trade is turned here in england so as never to return into the old channel again no though the trade should be laid open which yet it is not  but still this was a blow to our manufactures and lessened the consumption of them abroad and consequently the exportation of them at home the effect of which was that unless some new vent of the said manufactures was found out abroad there would of necessity be a stop and some hands must be taken off at home the quantity must abate as the consumption abated or else the markets abroad would be glutted with goods and the makers at home not be able to put them off these must leave off making or be undone and if they left off making the poor at least so far would be undone for all abatement or declining of the manufacture is a degree of ruin to the people  to remedy this prudent heads found out one immediate help though it was in its kind what we may call a desperate cure namely a cure by amputation it was indeed cutting off a member a vast and important member of our manufacture viz ireland the case was thus  it was found that ireland began to encroach in a very dangerous manner on our manufacture by running into every branch of it making every sort of goods there which the english made at home and that in so great a quantity that they not only supplied their own nation and sent over great quantities hither but that as before they filled foreign markets with them and even undersold us abroad  upon this and considering the abatement of the consumption by prohibitions abroad two acts were passed in england for the encouragement of the english manufactures    an act to take off the duty of tonnage and poundage paid here upon the exportation of the woollen manufacture which being about   per cent upon the value was considerable and was done in order to bring down our manufactures at foreign markets so as not to be undersold by the french or dutch which act continues in force and all our manufactures are exported free to this day    an act to prohibit the irish woollen manufactures being exported to any parts or places beyond the seas this was indeed a terrible blow to the irish merchants and to the manufacturers in that kingdom but there was no remedy it was apparent that if the irish were suffered to go on they would reduce the manufacture of england to nothing as well by their cheapness as by their irregular working being bound to no laws or rules to no lengths or breadths or other such limitations as the english are bound by  it is not my business not have i room here to enter into the reasons or arguments made use of on one side or other at that time it is enough to my present purpose that so it was and that england found her self under a necessity of taking that step with ireland however hard or severe it might seem to be  nor can i enter into an account of the linen trade established on this occasion in ireland by the english with the several encouragements given to it in the late king williams reign being as a kind of equivalent to the irish for the heavy article above and which is since that grown up to an unexpected height there and by particular encouragements in england is become much more of an equivalent than was even at first hoped for but that is not our present enquiry i return to the case before me  this stop of the exportation of the woollen manufacture in ireland was a sensible relief to the english trade and for a while the manufactures flourished again and though the french encroachd in a surprising manner upon us in some foreign markets yet there were some particular articles which increased our consumption too very considerably and these ought to be mentioned because i must do justice as i go and let it be fairly seen where our manufacture found some helps as well as where it felt its decay where it was relieved as well as where it was wounded and hurt  besides this violent step for the relief of the manufacture it had had three additions or increases in the ordinary way of commerce which were exceeding great and which in their turn greatly encouraged the people and supported the thing as a manufacture or employment    the trade to portugal the increase of which has been so surprising great and began to be so about the beginning of the first war that it was apparent in the second war the export of british manufactures to portugal from england was greater than the whole export to portugal and spain together was before    the trade to muscovy which by the conquests of the late czar in the baltic his building the port of petersburgh his altering the habits and clothes of all his people and several other encouragements given by him to trade in general and to the english commerce in particular opened a new door to the consumption of the british manufacture where there was none before    the extraordinary trade to jamaica by what ways and means our merchants found it practicable to establish such a commerce it is not my business to describe but this is certain that during that war our trade to jamaica was such that the number of ships using that trade was increased to more than four times what they were in a few years before the war and that this trade has continued to this time or till within a very little while viz till the spanish guard de costas or cruising ships of war took upon them to keep a better lockout than formerly and interrupt it whether this trade was justifiable by the terms of the treaties subsisting between great britain and spain or not is not to the purpose in this place i may perhaps grant it was not but it is the fact not the legality of it that i am now enquiring about and in that part i am sure of being right  these three articles of commerce may be allowed to make a great addition to the consumption of the woollen manufacture of england and by these helps the loss of the french trade was for some years the less felt if perhaps at all  and that i may give a full latitude to this part of our discourse i may add for the take of the argument only that several other branches of our exportation seemed to have been increased in the same space viz the last thirty or forty years and that not in a trifling manner but very considerably particularly to legborn the trade of that port being exceedingly advanced during the various turns among the neighboring powers and particularly occasioned by the late convulsions in spain naples sicily and that were in piemont and milan and other parts of lombardy also by some improvements among the italians which we are not particularly judges of be it which way it will it is evident the exportations of british manufactures to leghorn are more than double to what they formerly were  i might instance like wise in the end case of our own colonies which is very considerable in the last thirty or forty years as may be proved in many particular circumstances in their trade and especially by the export of british manufactures thither which is the point i am upon and which is manifestly increased as well to new england and to virginia as to carolina in particular and to other places  but i need not enlarge upon these things for were the increase of these foreign consumptions much greater than it is and were the places where that increase has been five times larger than they are the declining state of the manufacture would still be made out from other opposite circumstances too evident to be denied and too strong to be balanced by those advances  first the unreasonable increase of the quantity made is to be considered the growing condition of the manufacture it self in which we may venture to say there are some circumstances that not only will not be equaled by any addition of commerce either abroad or at home but to speak boldly to it would not be equaled if all the nations to whom our manufacture is exported were to increase the consumption of it in proportion to that of portugal or legborn as above  it is evident our manufacture is increased to a degree almost inexplicable insomuch that it is in itself too great for the consumption of all europe now it seems a little of a paradox that i should bring the increase of the quantity as an argument to prove the declining of the manufacture that is increased but a little reflection will set that part to rights in your thoughts and the difficulty will immediately vanish  in speaking of the manufactures as declined we are not speaking of the quantity made but of the quantity sold or it you will we must change the terms and distinguish betwixt the woollen manufacture as a work or fabricature and as a trade there may be as many gods made in england as ever but if there are not as many told as ever the trade will be allowed to decline nay the more there is made the more the manufacture is declined if they cannot be sold because the quantity becomes a grievance to it self  if it be apparent that the quantity made increases faster than the quantity sold off or that there is more made than can be sold the manufacture is under evident discouragement on the other hand if there are more made and less sold that discouragement increases to a distraction the manufacture languishes and is in a kind of dropsy where the repletion exceeding the evacuation the body swells in bulk but declines in strength and dies of the worst kind of consumption  there is no question but that upon the apparent increase of the manufactures in england during those many years mentioned in particular as above the great advantage made by that trade and the vast estates acquired even by the manufacturers themselves in their ordinary business encouraged others to fall into it and even encouraged those that were in it to enlarge their business to launch out as their stocks increased farther and farther into that trade  this humor continues to this day and is now become the great grievance of the manufacture in general and will if not timely prevented be ruinous to the trade in the end as i shall make appear in its place  while the manufacture was in its full extent abroad while it was the mistress of the world in trade had no rivals and no attempts were made to mimick it or imitate it but that it had an uninterrupted sale abroad the increase of the quantity at home was far from being a grievance either to the country or to the trade and during the happy years of its thus currently going off vast additions to the quantity were made at home such as if you will give credit to some people would in a few years have glutted the whole world with our goods though there had been no check given to the vent of it abroad  i could give a long history of the increase of the manufacture in england i mean as a work or fabric even whole towns nay parts of counties have within the memory of some still alive been employed in it who were never employed before  i could likewise enter into the detail of the changes and turns which the manufacture itself has suffered by changing the kinds as particularly the changing the clothing or clothmaking into the making narrow and lighter kinds of cloth such as we call druggets and ketsies instead of broadcloth in the western parts of england such as the counties of wilts berks and devon and sagathies and duroys a thin and light sort of stuff instead of thick clothserges at taunton in somersetshire and other parts adjoining by which exchange of kinds it is the opinion of many men of judgment the english manufacture in general has suffered extremely and a door opened to the attempts of foreigners who encroached upon us by those imitutions and delusions but were not able to come up to us in the essential part of the manufacture viz the clothing part the case was thus  the french were the first who as i have said set up to rival our manufactures and having gotten workmen as well as materials from england they set up a clothing manufacture as well at rouen and caen and other places in normandy as at nismes and the adjacent cities in languedock and provence  but the french according to the known superficial humor of that nation contenting themselves with keeping up to the standard of broad cloth in languedoc only because they were obliged to follow the pattern of the english there for the turkey trade in other places made it light loose and spongy thinner in substance and slighter in workmanship and this not being able to carry the breadth of the broad cloth they altered to the usual stuff breadth of half ell or half yard as their ordinary stuffs were made  these they called cloths at first but seeing they would not keep up the credit of that name as the english cloth did they gave them several names from the towns or counties where they were made such as drap de normandy drap de berry drap de lorrain and so of the rest  had we let the french go on their own way and kept up at home to the old english manufacture of broad cloth the french to this day had been distancd in their new attempt but with a weakness never to be defended while they with difficulty followed us we faced about and simply followed them  they brought their silk stuffs and spanish druggets and light thin french serges into wear and into fashion and they were in the right because they could make no better we to ape them in their mode fall into the same sorts of stuffs and so made that which was their necessity be our mischief  by this means not only we wore their sorry slight manufactures and even brought them privately from france it self but fond of our own mischiefs we quit the broad cloth the ancient glory of england as to manufacture and fall into the making of light stuffs for mens wear to the ruin of our own manufactures as much as in us lay for these new foolish things neither employed an equal number of hands or consumed an equal quantity of the wool in both which they accommodated the french who neither had at first a number of skilful workmen to make them or a quantity of wool to make them with but in both we weakened our own country for this at once caused the wool to lie on hand unwrought and thousands of poor to go unemployd  the great promoter of this debauchery in trade for such it might be called was one doyly a warehousekeeper in london who valuing himself upon that for which he ought according to the laws of persia to have his name be made infamous and his house be made a dunghill boasted of his merit and called his new french mimickry of a manufacture doylys stuffs and such was the vanity of the day that we saw the whole town nay we might say the whole nation run into them and the ancient manufacture of broad cloth lay by the walls the substantial woollendrapers had nothing to do no trade at their shops and the new stuffmerchant doyly had his great warehouse near exeterexchange in the strand thronged with buyers from morning to night and the man got an estate in one summers trade  it is true god and a hard winter should have the thanks of the poor manufacturers while they live the severity of the great frost falling in immediately upon it brought the good warm clothing trade into mode again and set the poor at work in some tolerable degree so at least as to relieve them for that time  but this unhappy humor revived so far as brought our manufacturers into the way of making a middle kind between cloth and stuff so as on one side to suit the climate and yet as near as might be on the other to follow the french folly also and this introduced the making druggets sagathies chamlets duroys and the several kinds of mens stuffs with which we have as it were made war with our own manufacture and jostled the broad cloth as much as we could out of the world so that in short if those light things which the french made because they could make no better did not become the universal mode of our country and the better and more important clothing on which the whole nation depended go quite out of use it was none of our fault  the truth is though the first madness wore off and the doyly stuffs in a little time did sicken and glut the town yet this is certain that the wearing of drugget and stuffs chamlets and duroys and suchlike slight things was a terrible blow to the ancient clothing manufacture to this day it has not recovered it and perhaps never will  thus far the manufacture declined by our own folly it is true indeed that these slight thin stuffs though they did not consume so much wool or employ so many hands as the clothing yet as they sent the people oftener to market the quantity made seemed to be some amends to the manufacture and to the poor but then they opened a door to the french to sell their slight halfmade goods at foreign markets for the fashion also took root whereas if the manufacture of broadcloth had been kept up the french would never have been able to have hurt us at home or abroad  but this is not all i shall give you a farther account of the declining of the manufacture in its sale abroad and of the reasons of it in particular more ruinous than this but here i must take notice too as i have said above how the making increased whether the sale increased or no and this we shall give you some unanswerable evidence of in a few examples  first upon this unhappy falling into the french fashion of wearing stuffs instead of broadcloth i mean for the mens wear a strange and sudden metamorphosis in trade followed here in london  spittlefields had been eminent for many years for the silk manufacture encouraged and greatly increased by the coming over of the french refugees in      to      and the numbers of people increasing there the buildings likewise increased so that what with ribbandweavers and broadweavers it was generally said there was an hundred thousand weavers in spittlefields and the adjacent streets  but the trade was not equal to the numbers of the people the streets began to be desolate the houses empty and the people shifted about to other places and to other employments as occasion supplied them when all on a sudden we were surprised to find woolcombers and staplers setting up in spittlefields and shops began to open there for worsted yarn and for combed wool and abundance of the french women especially went spinning about the streets this was employed at first among the stockingweavers or frameworkknitters which manufacture about that time took a new turn all over england from knitting to weaving or framemaking to the great loss of the poor in the countries where those goods were usually made where many thousands were formerly employed in knitting but now were quite struck out of the work by the gross of the stockings being wrought in the frame  this began the woollen trade in spittlefields but when the doyly stuffs had as i have said above spread the town and the humor continued for some time spittlefields took another new turn and in one year more we saw it as full of stuff and worsted as before of silk the silkweavers turned their hands to the narrow woollen manufactures and the quantity of those manufactures now made there of almost all kinds especially such as were formerly made at norwich and the parts adjacent is such that in a word spittlefields is become the principal seat or center of those manufactures in england and yet the city of norwich as above is supposed to be in as full employ as ever or at least as usual so that this whole manufacture of spittlefields is an increase upon the manufacture in general and must be answered for by a proportioned sale somewhere or other abroad or at home or else so far the increase is too great for the consumption and is not a benefit but a loss to the manufacture and adds in the worst manner to its declining circumstances  i could give you a like account of large manufactures of druggets and other goods erected in several towns and places in england within these few years where no such or other woollen manufactures worth naming in this case were wrog before a particularly at the city of bristol for example but this of spttlefields is so flagrant an instance where such a prodigious work is now carried o and where within the memoy  the writer hereof no woollen manufactures were made that i need enquire no farther into it i shall add but one other capital article of increase and this is that of the bay trade in essex  it is evident  trade was contained within the particular towns of colcestr and bcking in essex where the making f bays was first begun and was at least principally established the trade flourished the goods were current abroad commanded ready money at home and were seldom or never without a market nor was there a manufacture in europe which better maintained the credit of its make insomuch that a merchant at cadiz or lisbon coming to an english merchants warehouse to  bays has no more to do but to open one corner of the bae and look upon the seals of the town of colchester and by that they were sure to know of what value the goods were and were certain to find them answer both in lengths and goodness  but the neighboring towns finding the colchester and bocking baymakers grow rich thrust themselves into that trade and now the bays are made at coggeshal at witham at kelvedon at braintre at halsted and in a word at almost all the most considerable towns in essex beyond cbelmsford  nor is this all but even the baymakers themselves upon the least start of the trade and upon any sudden quick demand from abroad push in with such eagerness and increase their quantity to such a degree that they bring more to the market than all the world can take off  this has i may say ruined the trade and the consequence is that as soon as ever that small run is over and the demand from abroad ceases the market is immediately thronged with goods they are pawned and pledged to every monied man in the place till they can be put off the price sinks the labor of the poor stops and the baymakers are often broke and undone  nor is the credit or real value of the goods supported for the baymakers being now extended over the whole country and working out of the jurisdiction of the bayhall at colchester they put what goods they please upon the market and what marks or seals they please upon the goods so that the credit of the manufacture is sunk and no man trusts to the seals of the goods any more but takes care to look into the goods himself and see with his own eyes that he is not cheated  i cannot but esteem this last to be one eminent degree of the declining of that manufacture for if once a manufacture declines in its credit i shall always conclude it is declined in its sale or will soon be so but that by the way the present article i am upon and which i lay the whole stress of the question now upon is the increase of the quantity beyond the demand that more are made than are or can be consumed which i think is apparent in many other particulars  i sum the whole observation up in this one head viz that this very increase is a grievance which in the end may be ruinous to the whole woollen manufacture of england if some new doors of commerce are not opened abroad to raise a consumption equal to that increase or some method be not taken to put a stop to the farther increase of the fabric at home so as not to make the manufacture be too great for the sale whether it be at home or abroad  chap v of the real causes of the decay of our manufacture arising partly from prohibitions abroad but chiefly from our refusing the wear of it at home and something offered for the remedy but it is needful now to enquire into the state of our manufacture abroad as to the consumption of the several species in those countries where our trade used to be settled if we find the sale or demand increasing abroad the increasing of the quantity at home would certainly be so far from a grievance that it would be the glory and prosperity of our commerce and of our country and if every county in england were as fully employed in manufacturing as wiltshire devonshire norfolk and essex every city as norwich and exeter and every market town as froom taunton leeds or colchester it would be the wealth of the whole and the greatest felicity that this world ever produced to a nation  but the case is not so but far otherwise instead of the consumption increasing abroad instead of a larger demand we see all parts of the world envying us most parts endeavoring to imitate us and as many as can encouraging their own upstart manufactures in the room of the british and too many totally prohibiting the sale or the wearing our manufactures that their own however mean and ordinary may take place  and not to dwell upon some late prohibitions of the english woollen goods in spain and in the island of sicily at lintz passau vienna and other places in the emperors dominions done rather by way of insult to our nation at this crisis of their affairs than that they are able to carry on any equivalent manufactures of their own i say not to lay any stress upon these yet it must be said that other places have of late years attempted our manufacture and some but with too much success and prohibitions rather natural and consequential than political increase upon us every day  it is the general opinion and i have joined with it in part in the beginning of this discourse that there is no wool to be found in any part of the world or at least not in europe capable of working into such manufactures and of making such several sorts of goods as we at present furnish the world with and upon this very principle we carry our boasts of the british manufacture so high now in some particular things we are right i mean right in our judgment namely that the world has not the wool that is has not any wool capable of working into such manufactures as we make though as to boasting as we do i shall never come into that part because boasting of our superiority is but firing the rest of the world with an unwearyed application to supply the defect  but let us distinguish here with a little more temper than we usually do there is a manifest difference between having no wool fit for any manufacture at all and not having the best and the finest wool of the longest staple the firmest body and the finest and softest quality there is a manifest difference between the wool being good for nothing and being not so good as the english or irish wool to descend to particulars  it is true europe take it by and large as we express it from end to end does not produce a wool capable of making our fine broad cloths of warminster trowbridge bradford and froom or our fine gloucester and worcester whites no nor perhaps such as our wakefield and leeds cloth though what we call coarse yet of substance and weight inimitable nor of many several manufactures of other kinds such as devonshire kersies exeter and taunton serges devizes and bristol druggets andover and newberry shaloons and the like  but to say therefore that there are no other of our manufactures that can be made abroad and that even where they have no english wool that i cannot and must not grant because experience teaches us the contrary every day to our great disadvantage in trade  saxony a large and fertile country in germany notwithstanding the severity of the winters which are sometimes such as gives a check to the production of wool yet not only has a very good kind of wool but a very large quantity of it and the saxons an industrious people are already advanced so far in the manufacturing the wool that they make two particular manufactures which are very useful in those cold countries and which they formerly bought from england either brought thither to their fair at leipsick by way  hburgh or bought at the great mart at frankfort and carried over land to the elb at magdeburgb these were colchester bays and welsh flannels  every one knows that as these goods are soft and warm and are suited very particularly for preserving the bodies of those who wear them in thse northern parts of the world from the severity of the cold so they are not made of the coarsest and harshest of the wool on the contrary they are made thick and downy well milled and the nap raised which would not be if the wool was not fine and soft and the workmanship close and thick  yet these they now make in saxony not only in sufficient quantities to supply themselves and their own markets but we see the flannels and bays of saxony sold every year at frankfort at nurembergh and most of the other fairs of note in the upper germany and what is the consequence of this not any prohibition of the english bays and flannels no we may send ours thither also and may sell them there too if we can but nature forbids it the thing is a prohibition of it self ours are not sold there because their own are sufficient and we need not say are cheaper for it would be very hard if they can be made at all that they should not be made cheaper than the english which pass through so many hands so many countries pay so many embarkations assurances commissions and other charges and are carried so far as well by land as watercarriage  it is true the wool of saxony is of a brown or a kind of russet color occasioned by the climate or the particular breed of the sheep or from whatsoever other incident in nature we cannot account for but as the bays are generally dyed and many of the flannels also it is not distinguished for that the wool however russet or of a greyish color at first and as it grows on the sheeps back yet it is not at all the worse to take any color in the dyingfat but as some think is rather the better  i need go no farther for the proof of this than to appeal to those merchants who trading to those countries usually had commissions from thence to buy great quantities of those goods here and let them tell us how many bays or flannels they now have orders for for the fair at leipsick or the mart at frankfurt or rather whether any english bays and flannels are sent thither or no  but this is not all let us look in the next place into the king of prussias dominions i mean that part of his country which was formerly called the electorate of brandenburgh the country about magdeburgh the country upon the havel and the sprhee there they have wool which though coarse and harsh yet the government of prussia careful to improve the country to the utmost and to employ their own poor for their own work causes all those coarser manufactures which their own wool is capable of making to be made among themselves and though these manufactures are not equal to the british yet as they are sufficient to the demands of their own poor and serve to cloth the boors and pesants that is to say the country people and plowmen and laboring poor they think it reasonable to prohibit all foreign manufactures which usually were imported for those uses such were our yorkshire kersies double and single dosens the coarse goods made in lancashire such as halfthicks pennistones duffiels blanketting and other woollen manufactures made for the clothing and covering of the poor  these were formerly shipped off in great quantities for hamburgh and for stetin and straelsond and other ports on the south coast of the baltic but now the general consumption of such goods has been stopped for some years the people making all those things at home  it is the like in sweden where though their wool is still coarser and the manufactures they make the poorest and roughest that can be imagined yet the setting their own poor to work to make their own clothing however mean serves to employ them keeps their money at home and all still shortens us in our exportations of those goods to that country  it is true our finer cloths gain still an admittance into those countries because the wool even of saxony is not fine enough for such a manufacture and this may show us that we have certainly been in the wrong of it and have weakened the interest of our manufactures abroad exceedingly by leaving our clothing trade to sink upon our hands and turn our workmen to the lighter manufactures which other countries with their coarse wool are so much easier able to supply but to go on  so many of our woollen manufactures being thus excluded from sweden from brandenburgh from saxony and from so many parts of germany let us look next toward the south and here we find the swiss of zurick making chamlets shalloons and several other sorts of manufactures as well for mens wearing as womens the same as are made in spittlefields norwich andover and several other places in england the swiss perform these works now with much accuracy and it is hard to know them from the like sorts of goods made in england the workmen also who set them up being fetched from spittlefields where they learned the art and how to manage both the wool the yarn the loom the dressing and in a word the whole finishing after the english manner and without flattering our selves as well performed  did the zurickers only supply their own city or their own canton with these goods the loss to our manufacture would be no more than the mere negative upon their consumption but i should not be just to the matter in hand if i did not tell you that to the irreparable loss of the english manufactures these goods are brought from zurick by the river rhine to the city of basle and from thence down the rhine to mentz and then still by water up the main to the mart at frankfort au main where they go too far in supplanting the english goods of the same denomination and to such a degree are they arrived that i am told there are very few english goods of these sorts now sold there the zurickers supplying the fair with them as good as the english and considerably cheaper  thus we see our manufacture cut short on every side by the envy or industry of the several nations of germany and sweden totally prohibited in france and very much supplanted in several other places  the emperor has for some time encouraged manufactures in bohemia in austria and in all the hereditary countries and the consequence of this it is expected will be a general prohibition of all the english woollen manufactures it has been attempted lately by way of pique and resentment between the imperial court and great britain but that part may be esteemed a jest compared with other countries  however it may be well worth considering whether if this general humor of manufacturing should spread far in europe as we are just now told it begins to do in poland and in muscovy and is threatened in spain what the impression it may make upon our manufactures in england may be in a few years  as these invasions are increasing so our manufacture must be declining in proportion unless it could be said that some yet farther branch of foreign commerce can be found out for the consumption of our manufacture which it is time enough to speak of when we see it in prospect and which i should be glad to say was probable  i must acknowledge if the present war should proceed to extremities so as to lay open the trade from england to the spanish west indies directly i should venture to say it would give our manufactures a new turn and they would feel a spring of prosperity for some time and that considerably too especially if some bounds were set to the manufacturers at home else if they launched out in quantity according to custom as is mentioned above they would glut the market though they were to have a new america opened to them for the trade once in every five years  however i see no room to argue upon this remote prospect they that are sanguine enough upon the war to run on making and lay up a stock of goods in expectation of a market the next fair at portobelo or when la vera cruz shall be turned english may go on their own way i am for sharing no bear skins  but i must come nearer home still and must take the freedom to insist that our manufacture is in a state of decay too from our conduct at home much more than from all prohibitions and interruptions abroad i am not disposed to make this work a satyr upon my own country but certainly we are the first if not the only nation in the world who having the best and most profitable product and the best and most agreeable manufacture of our own of any nation in europe if not in the world are the most backward to our own improvement  a manufacture valuable in it self infinitely profitable to the poor unexceptionably pleasant to the rich not too hot for the summer not too cold for the winter light enough for july warm enough for december beautiful as the finest silks suiting with laces embroidery and all manner of ornaments better than even silk it self and yet ornamental and rich in its own luster  a manufacture receptive of the brightest and deepest colors gay enough for the bridegroom solemn enough for the widow rich enough for a coronation grave enough for the deepest mourning  a manufacture that has not one exception to be made against it or one reason to be given for disliking it except the weakest of all reasons the love of change and variety or that wicked reason which a man gave why he did not love his beautiful and agreeable wife viz only because she was his own  a manufacture that all the world covets envies us for strives to imitate nay are vain of but thinking they can imitate it  a manufacture which those other nations when they have faintly imitated it are obliged to prohibit by the severest laws or else all their people would run into them and which they do strive to come at and purchase notwithstanding the strictest prohibitions  a manufacture which is apparently declining for want of a consumption equal to its bulk and because of the too successful attempts of other people to set it up among themselves and because of the improvements that the industry of strangers and the indolence of the british manufacturers assists them in  and yet with such a manufacture as this we cannot persuade our selves to wear our own produce to propagate our own industry or employ our own people but we are no sooner prohibited the use of one foreign bauble but we fly to another first we turned our backs upon our own wrought silks and run to india and china for all the slightest and foolishest trash in the world such as their chints slight silks painted cottons herba silk and no silks as if any thing but our own was to be thought beautiful and any thing but what was best for us was to be encouraged by us  when this extravagance was also checked by a law we run then into another extreme and still turning our fancy against our own manufactures on a sudden we saw all our women rich and poor clothed in callico printed and painted the gayer and the more tawdry the better and though ordinary mean lowprizd and soon in rags the gayest ladies appeared in them on the greatest occasions  thus the ancient manufactures of great britain were despised by our own people and the bread taken out of the mouths of the poor the hands that would have labored could get no work the trade sunk the manufacturers slarved and the wool lay by in heaps unwrought and unfold to the general impoverishing of the people and the ruin of the manufacture it self  we are now by another law of prohibition restrained from the wearing of painted callicoes and what follows the temper is not at all reclaimed nor do they so much as incline to return to the use of their own manufactures which is the main and best end of the prohibition but as if we were resolved to run down our whole country and ruin our poor with our own hands we run to the remotest corners for some shift or other to cheat our selves and now we see the general clothing of the meaner peoplespecially runs into the meanest tawdriest colors stamped upon the most ordinary linen fetched from scotland ireland or indeed any where as if any thing but our own was to be our choice and as if we had forsworn our own manufactures and were ashamed to be dressed in our own cloths  how shall we expect our own manufactures should grow and increase while this is the case and if we will not encourage our own growth and the labor of our own people how should we expect foreigners should do it  in short as i said of the woollen manufactures of saxony that they are an effectual prohibition of the english so i may say of our peoples running into the wear of printed linnens callicoes etc they are a tacit prohibition of the manufactures for what is a rejecting the manufacture by a kind of general consent but a prohibition in effect and how should the manufacture be supported when our own people turn their backs upon it and when even the people that make it will hardly be persuaded to wear it  i believe no man will ask me after this how i will prove the manufacture to be in a declining state or what is the reason of it no more can they ask what remedy is proper to apply to this evil it is an unaccountable thing in a manufacturing nation like this that men should ask what will restore the trade when they see so evidently what has been the ruin of it  the answer is short and according to my title the only way to restore our manufactures is to wear them the consumption at home is infinitely great if our whole populous nation were obliged to cloth only in their own manufacture we should neither complain of our selves or value the prohibition of others  if you will not do this and the next direction is as short as that you must abate the quantity and as you consume less make less what will increasing the work do for us while we decrease the consumption it will in the end not only ruin the trading people but ruin the trade it self but i have not room to enlarge upon that part here  finis
