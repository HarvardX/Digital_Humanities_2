olympus reigns  sandane s reign the mighty monarchs of the east and such imperial power i thought belonged to spartas king else i had never been queen young and deceived i left my fathers court for lacedaemons miserable scepter i did endeavor to extend its sway and to ambition roused my spartan lord but the vain pupil of the grecian schools unprincely agis marred the brave design chief of the

to hide its hatred or its scorn exit sandane amphares yet they who mean to gratify these passions must conceal them this day decides my fate so let it be such brief conclusion have i ever loved assist

he seems to wait us at this hour amphares i think that thou of all men should have shunned me  amphares my motive in attending here your presence merits a less injurious salutation  agis i know thy merits and i will reward them art thou not author of the woes of sparta prime mover and inflamer of sedition have thou not bent the power of thy high office to the subversion of the state thou servst at thee this day my indignation burns i am dishonored   amphares what has dishonored thee  agis thou and thy practices they have compelled me to leave the noblest station of a prince in time of war where should a king be found but at his armys head there agis stood when you and your presumptuous ephori required my presence here ungrateful spartans had you allowed me but one other day then had i fought this battle for my country and died or conquered with her bravest sons  agesistrata peril my son dwells not in camps alone in cities palaces and courts of justice with treachery and treason she inhabits peril attended thus thou must encounter more hideous sure than in the ranks of war  amphares i know my actions have incensed the king but i imagined not that such suspicions found entertainment in your royal breasts  agis have thou not joined the enemies of agis thou who wast once his friend inconstant man  amphares i have opposed the counsel of a foe whose arts deprived me of my princes favor  agis thou have opposed lycurgus and the laws which raised the name of sparta to the skies the delphic god inspired the deep design for more than human was that power of thought which joined the public to the private good with such perfection that each selfish passion flowed in the channel of the common welfare and like one family of sons and sires and dearest brothers a great people lived in peace they lived without or strife or scorn in war they fought to conquer or to die equal and free our happy fathers knew no interest but the interest of the state no gain but spartas glory proud they bore that palm aloft and shared the high respect the admiration which consenting greece paid to the imperial virtue of their country  amphares revolving time that system overthrew and changed the manners and the laws of sparta  agis the laws have been neglected not annulled and corrupt rulers have corrupted manners authority will soon revive the laws and great example yet restore the manners in spite of those who have oppressed their country deprived the people of their ancient rights and while the nation sunk beneath their sway still strove for power in a declining kingdom still sought for wealth in an impoverished land even at this hour rapacious they persist and like some wretches in a stranded vessel plunder and riot in the midst of ruin  amphares moved by the present perils of the state this signal hour i chose unknown as yet the fortune of the field to change my conduct and make an offer of my aid to agis  agis if i should judge the future by the past thou must forgive me though i doubt thy faith  agesistrata yet hear him agis in an hour like this he who assistance offers is a friend  agis this hour may yet deceive their countrys foes i know the base foundation of that hope which makes my baffled enemies presume lysanders army in its ranks contains the best and bravest of laconias sons the faction wish and hope defeat to them that spartas generous youth may never return to guard that freedom which has made them brave  amphares the boldness of their hopes their deeds will prove in the assembly if achaia conquer  agesistrata amphares say what is their utmost aim  amphares the old dependants of the exiled king and all the venal members of the state won by sandanes arts and foreign gold aim to restore leonidas who comes with hostile armies to enslave his country therefore sandanes proffers i rejected have warned the king and would have served him too but since resentment and distrust prevent me neutral i stand and will not seek that welcome which his more artful enemies would give  agis thou speak more boldly than becomes amphares add that to the offenses i forgive it is the sacred maxim of my reign that in a princes consecrated breast revenge and anger should not long remain these passions in a king afflict the state by driving rash offenders to despair this day decides your character with me now let your actions prove your words sincere  amphares no other terms i ask and sure i am never shall amphares need again forgiveness exit amphares manent agis and agesistrata agis well has he judged the season of submission he will assist us if lysander conquers  agesistrata may jove avert the evils which i fear i dread the ruin of the spartan state and fear the downfall of our ancient house the blackest fury of the stygian realm the most destructive is infernal discord bathed in the blood of kings she walks this world and tumbles states and empires to the ground  agis nations often perish by their princes crime but now if spartas ancient state must fall gods and good men shall witness for its king that he with fate contended for his people and on the ruins of their virtue sell  agesistrata think not i mean to blame your high design age has not changed the tenor of my mind nor palled my admiration of true glory sprung like thy father from alcides blood i feel the spirit of the spartan line only let me adjure thee to beware and walk with caution through surrounding perils though thou despisest every form of danger think what a helpless train attends on thee an aged mother and an infant son  agis divine alcides will protect his race  agesistrata i will invoke the god in times like these prayers are the arms of our defenseless sex a spotless choir of matrons and of virgins who over their country mourn myself will lead to the high temple of the son of jove he yet may hear the voice of supplication and stretch his arm to save the spartan state exit agesistrata agis alone without the enemy within the faction what should i think i have a thousand thoughts that rise and fall like waves upon the shore i need thee now lysander o my friend i lean on thee and thou perhaps art fallen ye everliving gods who know my heart i trust in you for righteous are my thoughts all bent on raising up longprostrate sparta with sparta too i would be proud to rise and gain such glory as my fathers gained when persias tyrant trembled at their arms if in this just ambition i should perish my name shall go to nations yet unborn but i must change my strain euanthe comes alas lysander led by love and thee she left her athens for this land of broils enter euanthe euanthe no tidings from the camp  agis none fair euanthe if we had lost the field the flying rout ere this had reached our gates  euanthe oh many a dame matron and virgin tremble at this hour but who has cause like mine the most forlorn and desolate of women is euanthe if   agis small the chance of what euanthe fears in the long wars of stillcontending greece leaders of armies have but rarely fallen  euanthe one thing i know and with prophetic tongue i speak it prince if sparta triumph not never shall your eyes again behold lysander disdain in him is fatal as despair  agis when he returns victorious from the field then shall he hear who best has spoke his praise but i must leave you now the senate waits me hereafter we shall speak of this and smile like mariners who on the peaceful shore sit and with pleasure talk of tempests past exit agis euanthe alone this steadfast ease is all assumed i see he staggers at the imminent event how dreadful is this interval to me who am bereft and destitute of all those aids that stay affliction and must bear the weight of woe that is heavier every hour the queen and generous agis too discharge the dues of kindred with unfeigned love but our acquaintance is not old enough to yield a ripened sympathy whose taste alone can comfort such a mind as mine yet i repent me not in this extreme that i forsook my country and my friends they would have forced me to a loathed bed and torn me from the noblest of mankind if he should fall my love my only love shall i survive thee and return to athens be humbled there before my haughty kindred and hear them blame the ashes of lysander forbid it fearless love forbid it shame forbid it honor and my natures pride death shall forbid it for i dare to die enter rhesus euanthe rhesus great gods oh say how fares lysander  rhesus as well as glorious victory can make him  euanthe forgive my rash despair my thanks accept ye gracious powers who guard his daring breast where is he now  rhesus with agis in the senate  euanthe already here blessed be the gods of greece  rhesus soon as the trumpet from pursuit recalled our conquering spartans in the field arrived a weary messenger by agis sent lysander strait bespoke the royal band with all the speed of men to sparta haste chastise bold treason and defend your king he said and called to me with a few horse i followed him and when he sought the king by his command to you i brought these tidings  euanthe most welcome rhesus but has sparta lost none of her noble youth  rhesus no man of note fell in the field but one whose loss you will mourn lysanders friend athenian polydorus  euanthe alas alas my joy is mixed with woe unhappy youth on my illomend head the blame of thy untimely death will fall conducting me thou came to distant sparta fatal the honors spartas king bestowed upon the generous guardian of euanthe  rhesus lady the people of my native land the warlike thracians hold it vain to mourn for men who fall in battle such they deem the favorites of mars our countrys god those they bewail who die by dire disease of youth and vigor full but most of all lament old men who drink the bitter dregs of life and woe and in decrepit age extremity of dotage wish to live  euanthe who are those men who near the temple stand uncouth to me their garb and strange their arms  rhesus they are thracians lady  euanthe what seek they here  rhesus i will accost the herald and learn his business  euanthe to the palace rhesus i go the willing messenger of joy this victory will free the anxious queen from many fears i pray thee do not tarry but come and tell me what yon herald bears and what affairs still occupy the senate  rhesus depend on the unwearied zeal of rhesus exit rhesus manet euanthe agis and sparta and the public cares detain lysander from my longing eyes i see the happy change of my condition and share the triumphs of the man i love but yet the slightest circumstance creates new fears to me why lingers thus lysander my mind is not at rest the winds are hushed but still my bosom quivers from the storm exit euanthe end of the first act act ii scene i euanthe their tedious council now is at an end and surely he will hasten to euanthe what means this clamor shout of the people behind the scenes ha he comes he comes loud acclamations and the voice of joy proclaim the hero enter lysander lysander o my life my love to meet thee here is happiness complete the gods have blessed me to my utmost wish and brought me full of glory to euanthe  euanthe thanks to the gods who have preserved lysander athenian pallas sure has heard my prayers  lysander and mine for mutual is the lovers prayer another deity i now invoke whose rites the god of war has long delayed with peace wellpleased shall golden hymen come and crown at last our long eventful love  euanthe speak not of hymen now his torch for me he shall not light whilst cruel discord waves her horrid brand and whilst unburied lies thy friend and mine the generous polydorus  lysander though love and glory both my breast inspire and fortune smiles on both yet sorrow finds a place to sit in but it is tempered sorrow for never grecian hero greater died  euanthe he fell the victim of his love to thee he followed thee when thou forsookst euanthe left me the day i touched the spartan shore though royal agis begged thee to remain  lysander unjust euanthe thus to blame lysander who sought the field the soldier of his love as of his sacred country fought to gain with liberty a rank and place of honor such as becomes the husband of euanthe that tender name and names that wait upon it awake emotions as implacable to tyranny as generous and great as ever selfrenouncing hero owned when the chief aim is right all passions else of noble kind impell the selfsame way the lover and the husband rouse and fire the spartan and the man of common clay and in one common mould mankind are made but the celestial fire that gives them life and soul is liberty and i prometheus like to gain that fire for spartas sons would brave the bolt of jove  euanthe to me you need not vaunt your daring mind alas lysander i am still afraid of perils lurking in this troubled state o leave me not again to grief and fear and to ampharis  lysander leave thee to amphares  euanthe yes in thy absence he did talk of love boasted his wealth his clients and his power mentioned the ruin of thy fathers fortunes and spoke contemptuous of thy rash designs  lysander immortal gods did i not hate this man enough enter a helot whence helot  helot lord from celimene delivers a letter lysander reads let agis stand upon his guard to day this to lysander from a faithful friend  helot return and tell the noble dame that the remembrance of her generous mind shall live for ever in my grateful breast  euanthe who is this faithful friend  lysander a spartan dame a gentle one though wedded to a foe of royal agis in her virgin state she was the constant and the loved companion of fair deidamia agis shortlived queen through all our various strife the generous dame preserves the friendships of her early days this scroll the king must see farewell euanthe  euanthe its threatening strain awakes my former fears would you had been like me content with love and never left illyssus flowery banks a fairer garland there you might have won than ever war bestowed the immortal wreath of pallas queen of arts as well as arms but you forsook the vale and left the shade to climb ambitions bare and rocky height to stand the storms and tempests of the world  lysander your words like melancholy music take my listening ear and cause delusive sadness for vain the malice of our baffled foes and impotent will prove their last endeavors past are the storms and tempests of our fortune let not euanthe heed the rack of clouds nor dread the murmurs of the falling main  euanthe elate with victory you scorn your foes i wish that rhesus would return again before you go to agis  lysander where is rhesus  euanthe i saw some warriors clad in horrid arms near yonder temple stand strait rhesus knew the garb and arms of his own native thrace and wondering at the sight went forth to learn who and from whence they were  lysander that should be known in yonder temple sit the ephori those factious magistrates who love not agis if rhesus come to you detain him not our resolutions may on him depend  euanthe lysander stay you go again to agis perhaps to plan new perils to thy life if so by all that is sacred i conjure thee to let me know your purpose speak with me before you execute what you resolve the image of the stern amphares haunts me need i entreat thee to defend me from him  lysander no by the gods o urge me not euanthe nor rouse those thoughts a lover cannot bear defend thee from amphares o my fair when thou art wronged lysander lives no more but see the king  euanthe let caution show your love lysander goes off toward that side of the stage where agis appears manet euanthe if nature teaches me aright to read the mind of man this is a powerful spell to charm the daring spirit of lysander and make him think of me as well as sparta exit euanthe enter agis lysander regard o king the warnings of a friend instructed in the counsels of thy foes behold the steadfast faith of celimene gives the letter agis i cannot think so basely of the people for them i have unplumd the regal power and decked their freedom with the spoils of kings if they betray me of all creatures man is most ungrateful to his benefactor the generous courser and the faithful dog with true affection love their gentle master nay even the heavy ox the stubborn mule dullest of beasts they know the hand that feeds them  lysander humanity lives in thy breast o king and dictates confidence unlimited virtue approves the generous extreme and magnanimity this error loves let private men indulge the glorious fault and set their lives and fortunes on the faith and gratitude of those they have obliged but let severer prudence guard the heart of him whose brows are circled with a crown enter an officer officer o king the captain of amyclas gate informs you that he has this hour descried a band of men who halted near his post a thousand thracians they report themselves hired by amphares for seleucus service  agis a thousand thracians  officer on their march to sardis  lysander by whose permission do they march this way  officer before the troops arrived a herald came who to the ephori a message bore  agis your diligence in duty i commend exit officer lysander the veils withdrawn and treason stands revealed never shall amphares need again forgiveness with what a double tongue the traitor spoke allseeing gods how little do we know the greatness of those blessings you confer had we not fought to day had we not conquered agis and sparta had been lost for ever  agis this victory came like the bolt of jove and levelled their designs  lysander yet if they dare the worst of crimes their treason may succeed your troops your conquering troops are not arrived the assembly meets unguarded there you stand what keeps the traitors from your noble life  agis my life lysander no i fear not that the ancient annals of this land record that barbarous foes revere the race divine and turn in battle from a spartan king  lysander the multitude may still revere their lord who from the blood of great alcides springs and yet some impious hand may strike the prince although of virtue as of race divine  agis i will change the guards and place at every gate some men of trust  lysander mount your thessalian steed and meet the troops that hasten to your aid with eager steps the royal band advance and wish for nothing but their king to lead them then if the furies in their wrath provoke your foes to rise in arms let arms decide never were the good and bad winnowd so well and severed from each other such the hosts and such will be their fate as when the rage of earthborn giants dared the sons of heaven  agis thou reasonst like an anxious friend lysander thy fears are all for me mine for my people enter rhesus hail gallant rhesus know thou ought of those thy countrymen who thus unlookdfor come and in a doubtful hour perplex our councils  rhesus the thracians are a thousand men complete from snowy hemus and the northern hills of wild odrysus the fierce warriors come rhinalces leads them of illustrious birth but stern imperious and grown old in arms he knows no umpire but the sword no law except obedience to the prince he serves  agis such often are those that quit a needy home to serve as hirelings in a tyrants host  rhesus next in command my brother euxus stands a youth to mars devoted for he loves danger itself not dangers rich reward  lysander have thou yet seen him  rhesus no  lysander has he yet heard that thou art here in sparta  rhesus he believes that i am still in athens from the herald i kept my name and quality concealed for i suspected that these thracian troops though hired for asia were for sparta meant if it prove so i may be useful here my valiant brother bears a generous mind and though of arms enamored justice loves  agis haste to your valiant brother and explain with an impartial tongue the state of sparta show him where justice and where honor stand if these are facred as thou say they are to gallant euxus he may prove a friend  lysander exert the strong persuasion of a brother and tell him rhesus if he loves bright arms and that immortal glory valor gains no more to wield a mercenary sword but plant himself with thee in spartas soil where agis will his noble nature cherish and rear his courage to such lofty deeds as ancient story tells of spartas chiefs exit rhesus agis i hope that rhesus will divide the thracians this favors well the biass of my mind averse to leave the city on suspicion and drive the wavering faction to extremes  lysander o generous prince whom i admire and blame the greatest foe the foe lysander dreads is the unequalled gentleness of agis review the story of the grecian states and mark how freedom fell in every land the brave asserters of the public cause have ever been too mild in evil times have like indulgent parents spared the rod and let the vices of their children live to kill the virtues hence let agis learn the only lesson that his nature needs  agis uncertain is the peril if i stay but certain is the evil if i fly i will remain but to assure my safety you must lysander to the troops return  lysander and leave my prince alone amidst his foes  revoke the hard command if youre resolved to brave the peril then my place i claim next to your person by your side i stand perhaps some noble service i may render receive the mortal wound aimed at my prince and with my life redeem the life of agis  agis your great imaginations up in arms but hear me and let calmer reason judge i am determined not to quit the city the guilt of civil war shall not be mine lysanders presence here without the troops would but embolden and excite my foes who may be tempted by this fair occasion this mighty vantage to surprise us both without delay once more lysander arm and ostentatiously pass through the gate this victory and the approaching host will hush the threatened storm  lysander so may it prove but there is something in my heart rebels against this counsel oh i cannot leave you  nor ought i now to stay let never man say in the morning that the days his own things past belong to memory alone things future are the property of hope the narrow line the isthmus of these seas the instant scarce divisible is all that mortals have to stand on o my prince lysander leaves you with a heavy heart  agis farewell thou spartan of the ancient mould dear as the brother of his blood to agis they embrace and part lysander  lysander ha may heaven your purpose change  agis my will is fixed but though my judgment too confirms the secret counsel of my heart yet i may be deceived perhaps my friend we part this moment never to meet again  lysander let us not part at all it is inspiration the guardian god the demon of the mind thus often presses on the human breast  agis mistake me not i feel no new impression nor if i did should i by that be altered for such presages be they sad or joyful i deem them but the meteors of the mind bred by the inward elemental strife when great events perplex and shake the soul my thoughts regard the state if i should fall to thee lysander i commit my son the only pledge of my deidamias love train up the boy to walk in the same path which we have trod together the straight path of virtue and true glory if he proves of noble nature and i hope no less he will not shun the lofty path of honor though fate should mark it with his fathers blood  lysander hear this immortal gods who rule the world and guard a prince the image of yourselves o never never may his royal race lysanders aid require exit lysander agis alone affection choaks his words his generous heart bursts at this solemn parting in times like these of a declining state baseness infects the general race of men but yet these trying times rear up a few more excellent refined and conscious spirits more principled and fit for all events than any in the good but equal mass of a far better age such is lysander the hour draws near enter senators senators assembled sparta waits  agis i come my friends i will address the people proclaim aloud mine actions which upbraid and soon shall silence my despiteful foes my heart shall speak this scepter of my fathers by long descent hereditary mine i would disdain to hold did i not hope that by its sway i might recall those days when

 lysander the strife of tongues i shun as thou did shun the strife of arms  amphares yet let thy haughtiness grant one request tell me what brought the great lysander hither some stratagem profound which none but he could have contrived to hasten his destruction and add disgrace and ridicule to ruin  lysander had thou not fled thou coward from my sword and shrieked for help this arm this single arm had baffled all the craft of false amphares  amphares this pride becomes thee and thy lost condition  lysander in this condition it becomes me best to brave amphares had he been a captive i should have pitied him  amphares pleadst thou for pity  lysander for none that thou can give hear me then judge if what i speak is meant to win thy favor i should have pitied thee by fate subdued oppressed with crimes thy spirit would have shrunk under calamity and guilt have marred the noble vigor and the port of manhood amidst thy triumph does it not confound thee to think thou owst it to excess of baseness thou have prevailed because the generous agis would not believe there could be such a traitor  amphares often have i heard and often seen thy folly but now to rail is madness with one word i could impose on thee eternal silence  lysander and would  i know thee  if thou thought it wise even then as now i should contemn thy power but know i fear thee not the king is safe and his victorious troops at break of day will thunder in thine ears thou and thy band will ill sustain the shock of such an host my life is in thy hands but yet beware thy fate depends on mine in lacedaemon a prince

our love rejoice forgive me still i must not cannot speak  euanthe but i will speak and earth and heaven shall hear me amphares too shall hear for it will gaul him to hear euanthe now avow her love and faith to her lysander powerful words emblems and figures of firm constancy such as fond lovers lavishly employ to sooth the pangs of parting and of absence such music vows accord not with our state our dreadful state yet do not grieve thy heart thy noble heart too full of other sorrows with thoughts of what may happen to euanthe nothing shall happen to debase euanthe the bondage and the shame that women suffer who live the slave of those who slew their lords i never shall know i never will endure if cruel destiny decrees thy fall unspotted to the shades i will follow thee for whom

vaulted dungeon ever yet contained two more unhappy or more helpless captives exeunt guarded amphares lysanders fierce demeanor and his threats proud as he is spring not from pride alone i must stretch forth my arms to sheltered agis if i accomplish not this night his ruin tomorrows rising sun may see my fall cursed be the temples cursed the priests of sparta now i am like a man who has

hail to the queen of sparta  sandane yes amphares now fortune seems to smile upon sandane i saw the sullen captive led along his gloomy eye balls fixed upon the earth  amphares this night o queen must see the bold conclusion of a design thus far so bravely borne on hollow and deceitful ground we tread whilst agis lives  sandane thou speakst my very thoughts seasons there are amphares which suspend all sanctimonious reverence and respect  amphares temples and priests and altars shall not save him if fate should drive us to the last extreme meanwhile i will employ more gentle means to gain our ends for sacrilege would rouse the zealous multitude to rage and arms the temple is begirt with thracian bands who all access forbid and agis knows not what has befallen lysander i will send a subtle spartan in lysanders name who may by specious arguments persuade him to quit the sanctuary and then o queen with all solemnity of pomp and form the assembled ephori shall pass his doom and in the same decree include lysander  sandane think thou the ephori will give the sanction of their authority to agis death  amphares they will at midnight the stern judges meet in terrors temple they have charged a herald with orders to the troops not to advance on pain of treason the astonished people will crouch and tremble at that awful power which draws the sword of justice on a king then shall your lords authority revive and like the sun when bursting from a cloud with greater power and brighter splendour shine exeunt end of the third act act iv scene i lysander as a prisoner the thracian guards at a distance lysander musing advances and speaks has virtue no prerogative on earth and can the gods permit the fall of agis they can it is mans own arrogance arrays him in gorgeous titles of excelling nature care of the gods and center of creation i fear i fear mans life is but a dream his soul a subtle essence of the blood a rainbow beauty made to shine a space then melt and vanish into air ye mighty minds of sages and of heroes epaminondas plato great lycurgus who once with such transcendent glory shone brighter than all the stars that deck the heavens is your celestial fire for ever quenched and naught but ashes left the sport of chance which veering winds still blow about the world i will not think so yet alas the while i see and feel presages that alarm if they prove true if man is like the leaf which falling from the tree revives no more i shall be shortly dust that will not hear euanthe weep nor see the shame of sparta now i am a living man my mind is free and whilst i live and breathe by heaven i will act as if i were immortal enter rhesus and euxus rhesus see where he stands behold him  o my brother the bravest and the best of human kind  oppressed with grief and

faithful rhesus come thou to share the ruin the lysander has brought upon himself his prince his country  rhesus i come more eager and more proud to share thy present fortune than thy former glory alas my lord twoud make a stranger weep to see the chief whom conquest crowned to day a captive  lysander rhesus thou have named the least of my calamities i could endure with spartan fortitude my own disasters bear to be hurled from meridian glory and like a falling star be seen no more but oh the king  and desolate euanthe   rhesus do not despair  lysander thou art my only hope this day thy generous brother saved my life at his request i yielded up my sword eise had lysander like a soldier fallen thou art my friend in noble perils proved my fate the fate of sparta and of agis is in the hands of euxus   rhesus ah my brother  euxus o chief of sparta euxus is distressed on every side thy virtue thy misfortunes have touched my heart but here in trust i stand would i had never seen the walls of sparta  lysander the gods the guardian gods of lacedaemon have brought you hither to preserve a people and save from traitors hands the best of kings although at first you rashly drew the sword in blind obedience to a leaders will the gallant euxus will not sure persist in error known in manifest injustice thy trade is war brave soldier this is not an office for thy sword  euxus true are thy words i was indeed deceived and came not here to mix in spartas strife but honor now   rhesus i will not hear thee plead so bad a cause is there a bond in nature like the tie which binds the hearts of brothers and will euxus from vain ideas of fidelity to that detested traitor false amphares his brother murder  euxus no  rhesus then let thy arms defend lysander by our countrys gods i swear and by our warlike fathers soul whose wellbeloved son thou ever were that with the spartan chief thy brother dies  lysander might you not favor the escape of agis the guards are thracians  euxus i might favor thine my power extends not to the guards of agis  rhesus and will thou not  euxus command thyself my brother  rhesus how can thou hesitate  euxus i must beware inferior in command to bold rhinalces and ever viewed by him with jealous eyes whilst i deliberate no time is lost the light of day suits not with your designs before the night comes on i will determine  lysander it is almost night the sun has left the heavens and doubtful twilight ushers in the gloom perhaps the enemies of agis wait the darkness of the night to cover deeds they dare not act by day this night i dread   rhesus the ephori have sent a herald forth charged with some solemn menace and command to stop the armys march  lysander if they obey the fane of juno guards the king no more eternal gods how wretched is lysander from me that herald should have heard his answer cannot my rhesus find one gallant spartan to bear my orders to the royal band to storm the city  rhesus i myself will bear these orders to the camp  lysander another task more difficult and dangerous is thine assume the arms and vesture of thy country and through the thracians win thy way to agis rhesus the generous spirit of that prince is of a nature that excludes all fear consideration and respect of self on earth he acts as if he were a god immortal and incapable of harm think how the artful falsehood of amphares may operate on such a royal mind enter a thracian thracian the spartan lord draws near  euxus amphares comes retire my lord whilst i advance to meet him our intercourse might lead him to suspicion  lysander nor vigilance nor care i recommend to thee my rhesus but let caution rule thy forward zeal  rhesus it shall my noble lord my heart beats high with hope to see thee rise once more like mars in arms  lysander eternal gods in thracian breasts the spartan virtue lives lysander enters into the tower exit rhesus manet euxus enter amphares how does the haughty captive brook confinement  euxus full of inquietude he seems and sadness now in some pensive posture sits awhile then smites his breast and starting from his seat walks to and fro with a disordered pace  amphares admit no spartan of whatever sex or whatsoever affinity they claim  euxus that strict command has been already given  amphares it is needful euxus for his furious mind in this extreme will snatch at slight occasions to make incredible and wild attempts renew the charge then go and search lysander for secret weapons on his breast he wears a curious gorget rich with precious stones and a small portrait of surpassing beauty the image of the fair athenian maid drawn by an artist who has vied with nature in sweet expression of her matchless charms that i must have  euxus you shall without delay exit euxus monet amphares let other men deprive themselves of pleasure and toil for bare ambition i will provide a more luxurious banquet to my taste what though as yet euanthe loves me not it is the nature of her sex to change with wondrous ease the female kind submit to destiny and soon are reconciled to persons and conditions once abhorred like birds new caught who flutter for a time and struggle with captivity in vain but byand by they rest they smooth their plumes and to new masters sing their former notes this facile temper of the beauteous sex great agamemnon brave pelides proved they sacked the cities and they slew the sires the brothers and the lovers of the fair who weepd awhile then wiped their watery eyes and lost their sorrows in the heros arms enter sandane the herald is returned the royal band inflamed with rage and scorn the mandate tore and to the city bend their rapid march  amphares let them advance they hasten to their fate a secret stratagem i have devised to check these warriors in their bold career  sandane the ephori in resolution faint   amphares their courage i will restore for agis yields to the fallacious counselor i sent demochares in sacerdotal robes as if disguised to elude the thracian guards past in by my permission and conjured agis to quit the fanes uncertain shelter and seek the sure protection of the camp himself he offered as his faithful guide this in lysanders name agis at first irresolute and doubtful balanced much at last this thought sprung up and turned the scale that his escape would force us to submission and end the strife without the shock of arms demochares at midnight is appointed to come again and goes with an addition that will give certain credence to his words the gorget of lysander  sandane now amphares i see the snares of death are wrapped around him our hated foe stands on the verge of fate he who despised sandane and permitted with most insulting courtesy my stay i would not have remained one day in sparta but for the hope i had to work his ruin he is the root with him the branches fall  amphares although his son is safe in orchomenos yet there in hopeless exile he must live but agesistrata   sandane shall not survive
