occasioned by enthusiasm i might have drawn many signal instances from that inexhaustible mine the greek and roman story but it appeared to me more eligible to work upon materials hewn from the modern quarry only the subject thus treated i conceived would come more home to the feelings of the reader with regard to the execution that rests entirely on the judgment of the public into whose presence i now enter impressed with a mingled sensation of hope and apprehension  enthusiasm part the first beyond the exalted suns meridian site beyond the glimmering stars ethereal height a brighter realm immortal spring displays mid the soft breathing of unclouded days where sacred minds to virtue high allied aerial beings orient forms abide seraphic people ministers of grace prompt to defend and

blast of satire dimmed the rays whose soft effulgence played around her praise the throne encircling frequent murmurs flew and busy charges trimmed in motley hue yet then confiding in her godlike plan which warms invigorates and hallows man she dares her foes she dares the hostile train to shake the pillars of her steadfast reign urged by her innate energy to meet the gathering war she quits her lofty seat at reasons bar presents her holy form provokes the thundrers and demands the storm a living crescent the bright powers display rank above rank in terrible array while trembling silence breathes upon the train and expectation throbs in every vein amid this scene the accusing angel rose on his stern brow bold indignation glows some troubling vision with disaster fraught employs detains alarms his wondering thought  what rising structure rushes on my sight of bulk enormous of aspiring height the alexandrian library consisting of four hundred thousand manuscripts was burnt in the sixth century by the order of omar whose enthusiastic zeal for his religion forced from him this memorable saying if the books contain only what is in the coran they are useless and dangerous if they contain any thing else  the enthusiast hastening through the regal porch waves in the eye of day a raging torch see impious spectacle she fires the pile and hails the sparkles with a greedy smile wide and more wide the imparted flame extends and now in dreadful victory ascends not sumptuous palaces not awful fanes nor of old time the proud august remains not airy villas nor majestic towers high massive bulwarks nor gay pleasures bowers but to the unhallowed blaze i see consigned the splendid temple of the poets mind ah loved tyrtaeus tyrtaeus reanimated the dejected minds of the

farewell for ever lost the spartan song which roused to conquest the dejected throng did not despondence like a gathering shower hang over thy countrymen in evil hour say did she not her fenny pinions

deluge rolls with threatening roar and sweeps away the longcollected store alluring apologues addressed to youth pure maxims molded in the breast of truth which from the holy lips of sages breathed rich moral legacies to man bequeathed celestial thoughts which like the favoring gales whose gentle pressure swells the gladsome sails waft the dejected mind with toil oerspent to the gaywinding harbor of content now history with a heartfelt sigh surveys her themes her annals midst the sounding blaze fame smiles no more but with an altered mien stands trembling at destructions growing scene and now methinks she views through fancys eye her burnished battlements that kissed the sky her glittering pinnacles her golden towers that vaunting dared old times devasting powers ascending obelisks that point to heaven triumphal arches to the conqror given she views these honors of her gorgeous state dismantled torn and bending to their fate ah now they yield they fall with deafning sound and in tumultuous havoc spread around at length descending like a lowhung cloud oblivion over the waste expands her shroud beneath whose darkning canopy is cast the fond remembrance of transactions past of youthful warriors who by glory led bold in the clamorous van of danger bled who midst the storms of state and homeborn wars gleamd through the thickning shade like morning stars till flung untimely from their radiant height down down they hurried to eternal night of patriots who to honor close allied in times disastrous stood their countrys pride how these sublime statecolumns tempestproof

length their kindred race felt the warm transport of a first embrace now the same age a different scene presents and the bold vision labors with events methinks i see extending wide around a towering wood with crowding leaves imbrownd beneath whose vast display of deadly shade her listless length lethargic europe laid there superstition her deep plan designed against the awful sanctuary of the mind there the wan sorceress haggard fiend of hell midst her dim orgies muttered the dread spell the sun abhors to pour his radiant flood over the dumb horror of the slumbering wood yet through the gloom of sacerdotal night one peerless star reveals a cheerful light ah why in mystic strains eclipse his name demand o luther thine unbounded fame advance advance thou elder son of truth sublime

the gates of day prompt apprehension sends her view around while her bold thoughts oerleap their former bound and joy proclaims throughout the applauding earth the hallowed festival of reasons birth now the couched mind reveals its spotless eye weak to sustain the splendour of the sky till strengthening at the irradiating gleam it meets unblenching truths refulgent beam so when the keenlyglittring darts of light pierce the loose film that dims the eaglets sight first with an ignorant and coy survey the dazzled bird admires the stranger day then glancing on the sun with towering gaze kindles his vision at the noontide blaze now science hears a voice unknown before  haste pilot pilot quit the drowsy shore the favoring winds thy destined hour proclaim display thy sails and launch into thy fame meek toleration heavndescending maid a vernal rainbow glittering over her head smooths the rough path destructive feet have traced adorns and peoples persecutions waste she like

thunder clothed her threatening arm but withering at the heart she rues the hour that harshly severs her diminished power thus as the serpent sleeping on the plain feels the rude pressure of the loaded wain with apt revenge and indignation stung she rears her crest and darts her fiery tongue but impotent of rage her trailing wound she languishingly sweeps along the ground here closed the seraph his illustrious theme which on his audience flashed convictions beam  and now the enthusiast with her hand highreard expressed a look demanding to be heard the circling hierarchy with one acclaim urge her to vindicate her injured fame she to their judgment fearlessly consigned thus poured the effusion of her glowing mind  bold on a towering rock with soul elate i saw britannia sit in
