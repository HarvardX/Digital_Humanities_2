the fifteen comforts of a scotchman written by daniel d foe in scotland  london printed in the year mdccvii  the fifteen comforts etc the first comfort be dumb ye beggars of the rhiming trade geld the ose wits and let the muse be splaid charge not the parish with the bastard phrase of balm elixar both the indias of shrine saint sacrilege and such as these expressions common as their mistresses of her i write no pen can reach her worth nor find an epithet to set her forth i mean heroic anne our gracious queen in war victorious and in pomp serene the circle of whose reign contains all bliss and daily studies scotlands happiness the second comfort now sacred anne does wear the british crown the church does flourish and is lofty grown the laws are risen from a long long trance and our uniting is a check to france which union even would make our foes baptize themselves all converts in our watery eyes which we for very joy do weep to see how anne designs to make posterity or ever happy whilst she is on the throne n making scots and english both as one the third comfort among the numerous throng we scots do come to wish the grand support of christendom health that is the joy of life and soul of mirth bane of  and comfort of our birth mayt with your years as clearly last and rise as twas ever winds had blasted paradise wealth the support of pleasure and the crown the only prop of glory and renown may the same virtuous temper the same fire that never flags too low nor does mount higher inflame your breast and to it by heaven be sent that which all seek but find not true content may all your aims atchieve their purposed end then loyal scotland never will want a friend to be the guardian of their church and state whilst the rose and thistle do incorporate the fourth comfort poor lousie beggared france and halfstarvd spain durst not presume to appear upon the main for now st andrew and st george do join upon the ocean they will in glory shine whose unioncolours on the rolling sea will show the force of british heraldry thus on that element the scots too fame will get and to tho encient scottish name will honor add by having such a fleet that durst our foe upon the ocean meet and make them lower their topsails too at sea as owning that the only sovereignty thereof is sacred annas lawful right for which her loyal subjects too will fight the fifth comfort in a protestant succession now the crown is fixed and none must mount the british throne but what will the reformed faith defend and to the church of england be a friend for by her grandeur we supported be whilst conscience does enjoy its liberty and that which also gives our hearts content as that two nations has one parliament the sixth comfort as to our comforts what can more be said freedom we have and intercourse of trade to any port or place the kingdom round besides all scottish ships that shall be found at signing of this treaty on the sea of any sort of foreign built shall be as ships of the built of great britain deemed so much is scotland by the queen esteemed that her indulgence makes us all conspire to act and to comply with her desire the seventh comfort now now old scotland is for ever made since with the english in the way of trade we have the same allowances restitutions lawful encouragements and prohibitions no article the loyal scots do blame for excise with us as you is all the same for seven years we shall be dutyfree in making salt and farthermore we see the land tax will be very easy here the yoke is light for any one to bear the eighth comfort duties on paper stamped we shall not pay nor duties which they do on velome lay and farther to confirm us in our rights we shall no duty pay for windowlights nay royal favors still are more enlarged for coals consumed at home we shall not be charged nor charged with any duty laid on malt so if we will not unite it is all our fault both nations will be one and we shall be to all intents as englishmen sir free all animosities being laid aside in love and unity we shall take pride and in eternal friendship so dispose our selves as to be dreadful to our foes the ninth comfort one british parliament will now be made and we have an equivalent in trade the coin of the united kingdoms too be all alike that all may have their due our weights and measures too must be the same that people may not different measures b lame the tenth comfort the laws concerning regulating trade in favor of our constitutions made the court of sessions must the same remain as formerly in this the present reign all misdemeanors done upon the sea to be subject to the british admiralty nay further to increase our happiness men offices for life may still possess and yet to make us happy over again the queen is pleased that all the rights remain of royal scottish buroughs as they now at present are what more can she allow or we from royal bounty still require since we have all as subjects can desire the eleventh comfort we shall have lords and commons too to sit in parliament wherere the queen thinks fit who will have all the privileges too that is really to their noble peerage due the same as english peers they will enjoy which treaty will the hopes of france destroy and that in time we may our breaches heal great britain must but use one only seal quartered with those arms as best may sure this union which makes anna absolute empress imperial over the blessed realm of which she does so wisely rule the helm the twelfth comfort all laws and statutes in each realm so far as to the union they contrary are from and after it they cease and shall be void that liberty by us may be enjoyed what can we then of england ask for more no greater blessings they can have in store than what are granted so let us all sit down and drink the health of anne who wears the crown and wish her long to reign that she may be a terror to the gallick monarchy the thirteenth comfort the scottish parliament has done their best that these two kingdoms may be doubly blessed upon the english parliament we wait with low submission for to know our fate hoping kind heaven will cause them to agree to this long wished and hoped for unity which surely will prove of such consequence that it will be a thorn in the side of france and make them rue the day that ever we came to be a people of one crown and name for our uniting makes the frenchmen fear some dreadful storms to them approaching near the fourteenth comfort now now the scots with england do unite lewis and maintenon are in a fright ye spaniards too your drooping kingdom drench till tears the flames of purgatory quench but you that cannot cry yet would seem to weep your hankerchiefs in holy water steep then virgin mary and the saints invoke to keep your kingdom from the frenchmen yoke but if yell still be fools and will not own king charles by force well put on him a crown the fifteenth comfort glory and honor crown great annas n and let her greatness shine with endless fam for making such an union that shall shake proud france and make its haughty mon qua so whilst we praises to our sovereign give let us pray that anne a nestors age may live finis
