lines are sacred to the memory of one who not satisfied with the attainment of every female excellence and every human virtue soared on adventurous wing into the regions of science and philosophy she successfully rivalled those who have long been accustomed to behold with indifference if not with contempt the efforts of feminine genius when either classical learning or philosophical disquisition have been the objects of pursuit  alike distinguished by elegance of manners by brilliancy of imagination and soundness of judgment it is almost needless to observe that whilst living she commanded the esteem and admiration of all who were so fortunate as to rank in the number of her friends and who now join in sincerely regretting that heaven has for ever veiled from their eyes one whose beauty wit and virtue adorned a sex that has seldom if ever produced her superior  it is with just diffidence that these lines are now submitted to the public inspection the author had withheld them from the

favoring the world with a fresh specimen of his poetical talents the author will have the satisfaction of knowing that however little his own performance may have merited the indulgence of the public it will have given birth to one that will challenge universal applause and perpetuate the virtues of his amiable and accomplished friend  to whom alas he now bids a reluctant adieu in the words of

sorrow show in slow procession over the gloomy plain see the sad father lead the wretched train who now in solemn silence homeward turn and quit reluctant quit their harriets urn but mark though changed the spot not changed the scene nor yet their bosoms know a grief serene for lo the sight of yonder dreary walls her loved idea and their grief recals their grief may heaven in pity soon bid cease soon may their tortured souls be hushed to peace may heavenborn hope direct their streaming eyes to those blessed realms beyond the azure skies where harriets virtues meet a bright reward from
