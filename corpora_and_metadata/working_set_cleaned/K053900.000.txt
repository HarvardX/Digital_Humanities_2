a journey through holland etc made in the summer of       a journey made in the summer of      through holland and the western frontier of germany with a return down the rhine to which are added observations during a tour to the lakes of lancashire westmoreland and cumberland  by ann radcliffe  london printed for g g and j robinson paternosterrow mdccxcv  the author begs leave to observe in explanation of the use made of the plural term in the following pages that her journey having been performed in the company of her nearest relative and friend the account of it has been written so much from their mutual observation that there would be a deception in permitting the book to appear without some acknowledgment which may distinguish it from works entirely her own the title page would therefore have contained the joint names of her husband and herself if this mode of appearing before the public besides being thought by that relative a greater acknowledgement than was due to his share of the work had not seemed liable to the imputation of a design to attract attention by extraordinary novelty it is however necessary to her own satisfaction that some notice should be taken of this assistance she may therefore be permitted to intrude a few more words as to this subject by saying that where the oeconomical and political conditions of countries are touched upon in the following work the remarks are less her own than elsewhere  with respect to the book itself it is of course impossible and would be degrading if it were not so to prevent just censure by apologies and unjust censure she has no reason from her experience to fear  but she will venture to defend a practice adopted in the following pages that has been sometimes blamed for its apparent nationality by writers of the most respectable authority the references to england which frequently occur during the foreign part of the tour are made because it has seemed that one of the best modes of describing to any class of readers what they may not know is by comparing it with what they do  may  0      table of contents amsterdam approach to it page    the streets and canals    the stadthouse    the port

the lowspread and barren coast of gorce we reached this place which is seated on one of many inlets that carry the waters of the german ocean through the southern part of the province of holland goree rendered an island by these encroachments of the sea is always the first land expected by the seamen or rather they look out for the lofty tower of its church which though several miles more distant than the shore is visible when that cannot be discerned the entrance of the water between the land in a channel probably three leagues wide soon after commences and helvoetsluys is then presently seen with the masts of vessels rising above its low houses amidst green embankments and pastures that there begin to reward the care of excluding the sea  the names of dutch towns are in themselves expressive of the objects most interesting to a people who for opportunities of commerce have increased their original and natural dangers by admitting the water in some parts while for their homes and their lives they must prevent it from encroaching upon others dam sluice or dyke occur in almost all their compounded titles the sluice which gives this town part of its name is also its harbor affording perhaps an outlet to the overflowings of the country behind but filled at the entrance to the depth of more than eighty feet by the sea with which it communicates  upon the banks of this sluice which are partly artificial the town is built in one short street of small houses inhabited chiefly by tradesmen and innkeepers the dockyard bounds the sluice and the town communicating with the former by gates over which a small pivot bridge connects the two sides of the street each head of the pier or harbor has been extended beyond the land for several yards by pile work filled with earth and large stones over which there is no pavement that its condition may be constantly known we stepped from the packet upon one of these and walking along the beams that pass between the immense piles saw how closely the interstices were filled and how the earth and stones were again compacted by a strong kind of basketwork  the arrival of a packet is the chief incident known at helvoetsluys and as ours entered the harbor about noon and in fine weather perhaps a fourth part of the inhabitants were collected as spectators their appearance did not surprise us with all the novelty which we had expected from the first sight of a foreign people the dutch seamen every where retain the national dress but the other men of helvoetsluys differ from englishmen in their appearance chiefly by wearing coarser clothes and by bringing their pipes with them into the street further on several women were collected about their baskets of herbs and their dress had some of the novelty for which we were looking they had hats of the size of a small chinese umbrella and almost as gaudily lined within close white jackets with long flaps short colored petticoats in the shape of a divingbell yellow slippers without quarters at the heel and caps that exactly fitted the head and concealed the hair but which were ornamented at the temples by gold filiagree clasps twirling like vine tendrils over the cheeks of the wearer  our inn was kept by english people but the furniture was entirely dutch two beds like cribs in a ship were let into the wainscot and we were told that in all the inns on our journey we should seldom or never be shown into a room which had not a bed  helvoetsluys it sufficiently appears is a very inconsiderable place as to its size and inhabitants but it is not so in naval or military estimation it is distant about ten or twelve miles from the open sea yet is nearly secure from attack on this side because that part of the approach which is deep enough for large vessels is commanded by batteries on shore it stands in the middle of an immense bay large enough to contain all the navy of holland and has a dockyard and arsenal in the center of the fortifications when we passed through it six ships of the line and two frigates were lying in the dockyard and two ships of the line and three frigates under the command of an admiral in the bay  the fortifications we were assured upon good military authority were in such repair that not a sod was out of its place and are strong enough to be defended by five thousand men against an hundred thousand for five weeks the sea water rises to a considerable height in a wide ditch which surrounds them we omitted to copy an inscription placed on one of the walls which told the date of their completion but this was probably about the year      when the harbor was perfected though the dockyard can be only one of the dependencies upon that of rotterdam the largest ships of that jurisdiction are preserved here on account of the convenient communication between the port and the sea  near this place may be observed what we examined with more leisure upon our return the ingenuity utility and vastness of the embankments opposed by the dutch to the sea from helvoetsluys eastward for many miles the land is preserved from the sea only by an artificial mound of earth against which the water heavily and often impetuously strives for admission into the sheltered plains below the sea at high water is so much above the level of the ground from which it is thus boldly separated that one who stands on the land side of the embankment hears the water foaming as if over his head yet the mound itself which has stood for two centuries at least without repair though with many renewals of the means that protect it is still unhurt and undiminished and may yet see generations of those whom it defends rising and passing away on one side like the fluctuations of the tides which assail and retire from it on the other  it is better however to describe than to praise the mound which appears to be throughout of the same height as to the sea is sometimes more and sometimes less raised above the fields for where the natural level of the land assists in resistance to the water the hollanders have of course availed themselves of it to exert the less of their art and their labor it is perhaps for the most part thirty feet above the adjoining land the width at top is enough to permit the passage of two carriages and there is a sort of imperfect road along it in its descent the breadth increases so much that it is not very difficult to walk down either side we could not measure it and may therefore be excused for relating how its size may be guessed  on the land side it is said to be strengthened by stone and timber which we did not see but which may be there covered by earth and grass toward the sea somewhat above and considerably below high water mark a strong matting of flags prevents the surge from carrying away the surface of the mound and this is the defense which has so long preserved it the matting is held to the shore by bandages of twisted flags running horizontally at the distance of three or four yards from each other and staked to the ground by strong wooden pins as this matting is worn by every tide a survey of it is frequently made and many parts appear to have been just repaired further in the sea it is held down by stones above there are posts at every forty yards which are numbered that the spot may be exactly described where repairs are necessary the impost for the maintenance of these banks amounts to nearly as much as the land tax and as the land could not be possessed without it this tax has the valuable character of being occasioned by no mismanagement and of producing no discontent  rotterdam from helvoetsluys to this place the usual way is by the brill and maesland sluice with several changes of carriages and boats but on the days of the arrival of mails a rotterdam skipper whose vessel has been left at a hamlet on the maese takes his party in carriages across the island of voorn on which helvoetsluys stands to his schuyt and from thence by the maese to rotterdam we paid two ducats or about seventeen shillings for the whole and found this the highest price given for traveling in holland our carriage was a sort of small coach of the fashion exhibited in paintings of the sixteenth century but open before and so illfurnished with springs that the dutch name a covered wagon was not an improper description of it a bad road led us through some meadows of meagre grass and through fields in which corn was higher though thinner than in england the prospect was over an entire level to the horizon except that the spires of distant villages some small clusters of trees and now and then a windmill varied it as we approached any of these clusters we found usually a neat farmhouse sheltered within and included together with its garden and orchard in a perfect green fence the fields were elsewhere separated from each other and from the road neither by hedges or walls but by deep ditches filled with water over which are laid small bridges that may be opened in the middle by a sort of trapdoor raised and locked to a post to prevent the intrusion of strangers  on the way we passed now and then a wagon filled with large brass jugs bright as new gold in these vessels which have short narrow necks covered with a wooden stopper milk is brought from the field throughout holland it is always carried to the towns in light wagons or carts drawn frequently by horses as sleek and wellconditioned as those in our best coaches  the hamlet at which we were to embark was busied in celebrating some holiday at the only cottage that had a sign we applied for refreshment partly for the purpose of seeing its inside by which we were not a little gratified thirty or forty peasants were seated upon benches about a circle in which children were dancing to the scraping of a french fiddler the women wore their large hats set up in the air like a spread fan and lined with damask or flowered linen children of seven years old as well as women of seventy were in this preposterous disguise all had necklaces earrings and ornamental clasps for the temples of solid gold some wore large black patches of the size of a shilling the old woman of the house had a valuable necklace and headdress among the group were many of teniers beauties and over the countenances of the whole assemblage was an air of modesty decorum and tranquillity the children left their dancing to see us and we had almost lost our tide to rotterdam by staying to see them  our sail up the maese was very delightful the river flows here with great dignity and is animated with vessels of all countries passing to and from rotterdam the huge archangelman the lighter american the smart swift englishman and the bulky dutchman exhibit a various scene of shipping upon a noble surface of water winding between green pastures and rich villages spread along the low shores where pointed roofs trees and masts of fishingboats are seen mingled in striking confusion small trading schuyts as stout and as round as their masters glided by us with crews reposing under their deep orange sails and frequently exchanging some salute with our captain on our left we passed the little town of flaarding celebrated for its share of the herringfishery on our coasts and schiedam a larger port where what is called the rotterdam geneva is made and where several english vessels were visible in the chief street of the place after a sail of two hours we distinguished rotterdam surrounded by more wood than had yet appeared and overtopped by the heavy round tower of the great church of st lawrence the flatness of its situation did not allow us here to judge of its extent but we soon perceived the grandeur of an ample city extending along the north shore of the maese that now spreading into a noble bay along the margin of which rotterdam rises sweeps toward the southeast  the part of the city first seen from the river is said to be among the finest in europe for magnificence and convenience of situation it is called the boom quay i e the quay with trees having rows of lofty elms upon the broad terrace that supports many noble houses but which is called a quay because ships of considerable burden may moor against it and deliver their cargoes the merchants accordingly who have residences here have their warehouses adjoining their houses and frequently build them in the form of domestic offices the quay is said to be a mile in length but appears to be somewhat less there are houses upon it as handsome as any in the squares of london  at the top of the boom quay is one of the heads or entrances by water into the city through which the greater part of its numerous canals receive their supplies on the approach to it the view further up the maese detains attention to the bank of this noble river a vast building erected for the admiralty is made by a bend of the maese almost to face you and the interval of more than a quarter of a mile is filled by a line of houses that open directly and without a terrace upon the water the fronts of these are in another street but they all exhibit even on this side what is the distinction of dutch houses and towns a nicety and a perfectness of preservation which give them an air of gaiety without and present you with an idea of comfort within what in england would be thought a symptom of extraordinary wealth or extravagance is here universal the outside of every house however old or humble is as clean as water and paint can make it the windowshutters are usually colored green and whatever wood appears whether in cornices or worse ornaments is so frequently cleaned as well as painted that it has always the gloss of newness grotesque ornaments are sometimes by these means rendered conspicuous and a street acquires the air of a town in a toyshop but in general there is not in this respect such a want of taste as can much diminish the value of their care  our skipper reached his birth which is constantly in the same place soon after passing the head and entering by a canal into one of the principal streets of the city between the broad terraces of this street which are edged with thick elms the innumerable masts of dutch schuyts with gay pendants and gilded tops the hulls of larger vessels from all parts of the world the white drawbridges covered with passengers the boats continually moving without noise or apparent difficulty all this did somewhat surprise us who had supposed that a city so familiarly known and yet so little mentioned as rotterdam could have nothing so remarkable as its wealth and trade  in our way from the boat to the inn other fine canals opened upon us on each side and we looked at them till we had lost the man whom we should have followed with our baggage we had no fear that it would be stolen knowing the infrequency of robberies in holland and the first person of whom we could enquire our way in broken dutch acknowledged his country people by answering in very good english there are many hundreds of british residents in this place and our language and commerce have greatly the sway here over those of all other foreign nations the dutch inscriptions over warehouses and shops have frequently english translations underneath them of large vessels there are nearly as many english as dutch in the harbor and if you speak to any dutchman in the street it is more probable that he can answer in english than in french on a sunday the english fill two churches one of which we attended on our return it is an oblong brick building permitted by the states to be within the jurisdiction of the bishop of london parliament having given   00 l toward its completion in the beginning of the present century there are also many protestant dissenters here who are said to have their offices of worship performed with the ability simplicity and zeal which are usually to be observed in the devotions of that class of christians  rotterdam is the second city for size and perhaps the first for beauty in the united provinces yet when we walked through it the next day and expected to find the magnificence of the approach equalled in its interior we were compelled to withdraw a little of the premature admiration that had begun to extend to the whole place the street where there is most trade and the greatest passage the hoogstraat is little wider though it is abundantly cleaner than a london lane the stadthouse is in this street and is an old brick building with a peaked roof not entirely free from fantastic ornament it has been built too early to have the advantages of modern elegance and too late for the sanction of ancient dignity the marketplace has only one wide access and the communication between the street from the principal head and that in which the exchange is placed is partly through a very narrow though a short passage the exchange itself is a plain stone building well designed for its purpose and completed about fifty years ago the happiest circumstance relating to it is that the merchants are numerous enough to fill the colonnades on the four sides of its interior commerce which cannot now be long discouraged in any part of europe because without it the interest of public debts cannot be paid is the permanent defender of freedom and knowledge against military glory and politics  from the exchange there is an excellent walk to the marketplace where the wellknown statue of erasmus is raised being represented in his doctors dress the figure can display little of the artists skill but the countenance has strong lines and a physiognomist would not deny them to be expressive of the discernment and shrewdness of the original  the marketplace is really a large bridge for a canal passes under it but its size and the easiness of ascent from the sides prevent this from being immediately observed some of the surrounding houses have their dates marked upon glazed tiles they were built during the long war that rescued the provinces from the spanish dominion a time when it might be supposed that nothing would have been attended to except the business of providing daily food and the duty of resisting the enemy but in which the dutch enlarged and beautified their cities prepared their country to become a medium of commerce and began nearly all the measures which have led to their present extensive prosperity  near this place is the great church of st lawrence which we entered but did not find to be remarkable except for a magnificent brass balustrade that crosses it at the upper end a profusion of achievements which cover the walls almost to the top contribute to its solemnity in addition to the arms of the deceased they contain the dates of their birth and death and are used instead of inscriptions though no names are expressed upon them under the pulpit was an hourglass which limits the discourse of the preacher on one side a wand having at the end a velvet bag and a small bell this is carried about during an interval in the service and every body puts something into it for the poor the old beadle who showed us the church laid his hands upon us with pleasure when he heard that we were english and protestants there are three ministers to this church with salaries of nearly two hundred pounds sterling each  we went to our inn through the hoogstraat which was filled with people and carriages but has no raised pavement to separate the one from the other in all the towns which we saw the footpath is distinguished from the road only by being paved with a sort of light colored brick the dutch shops are in the shape which those of london are described to have had fifty years since with small high windows and blocks between them and the street silversmiths expose their goods in small glass cupboards upon the blocks and nearly all the trades make upon them what little show is customary almost every tenth house displays the inscription tabak te koop tobacco to be sold this street having no canal is occupied entirely by retail traders we bought in it the antwerp gazette for two doights or one farthing strawberries large and well colored at a lower price than they could be had six weeks later in england but without flavor and went into several booksellers shops expecting to have found something in latin or french but could see only dutch books in another street a bookseller had several english volumes and there are no doubt well filled shops but not so numerous as that we could find any  over the canals that flow through almost every street of rotterdam are great numbers of large drawbridges which contribute much to the neat and gay appearance of the city but when these are raised the obstruction to the passage occasions crowds on each side and therefore in some of the most frequented parts the bridges are entire and permanent except for the breadth of three feet in the center where there is a plank which opens upon hinges almost as easily as the lid of a trunk through this opening the masts of the small dutch schuyts are easily conducted but ships can pass only where there are drawbridges the number of the former is immense for throughout the provinces every village if it is near a canal has several schuyts which carry away the superfluous produce of the country and return with the manufactures or stores of the towns but neither their number nor their neatness is so remarkable as the ease and stillness with which they traverse the city and indeed ease and stillness are much the characteristics of all the efforts of dutch industry the noise and agitation usual whenever many persons are employed together in other countries are unknown here ships are brought to their moorings schuyts pass each other in crowded canals heavy burdens are raised and cargoes removed almost without a word that can be heard at twenty yards distance  another circumstance rendering dutch towns freer from noise than others of equal traffic is the little use which is made of wagons and carts even where some sort of land carriage must be employed heavy commodities are usually carried about the streets on sledges and almost the greatest noise is when the driver of one of these after having delivered his load meaning to render himself a prodigy of frolicsomeness stands upon the hinder edges of his sledge and then preventing himself from falling backward by his hold of the reins is drawn rapidly through the admiring crowd  we were long enough at rotterdam during three visits to see how well it is provided with avenues toward the country and along the banks of the maese to one of these the way is over the two heads or chief canals each of which you cross for a doight or half a farthing in boats that are continually passing between the two sides this little voyage saves a walk of about three hundred yards to the nearest bridge the boats will hold twenty or thirty persons and the profit of them is very considerable to the city government which applies the money to public purposes each boat is worked by one man who pulls it over by a rope in a about two minutes  many of the inhabitants have what they call gardenhouses upon these walks and upon a semicircular road which passes on the land side of the city but the most wealthy have seats at greater distances where they can be surrounded with grounds and make the display of independent residences  upon the whole rotterdam has from its situation many conveniences and delights and from its structure some magnificence together with a general neatness but is for the most part desicient in elegance and its beauties have too much the air of prettinesses the canals are indisputably fine crowned with lofty terraces and deep enough to carry large vessels into the center of the city  delft between rotterdam and this place we commenced our traveling in trechtschuyts which are too well known to need description the fare is at the rate of about a penny per mile and a trifle more hires the roof which is a small separate chamber nearest to the stern of the vessel lighted by windows on each side in engaging this you have an instance of the accuracy of the dutch in their minutest transactions a formal printed receipt or ticket is given for the few pence which it costs by a commissary who has no other business than to regulate the affairs of the trechtschuyts at his gate of the city we could never learn what proportion of the fare is paid as a tax to the state but it is said to be a considerable part and not only these schuyts but the ferries the post wagons and the pilotage throughout the united states are made contributory to the public funds  the punctuality of the departure and arrival of the trechtschuyts is well known and justifies the dutch method of reckoning distances which is by hours and not by leagues or miles the canals being generally full to the brim the top of the vessel is above the level of the adjoining country and the view over it is of course extensive but the houses and gardens which are best worth seeing are almost always upon the banks of the canal we passed several such in the way to delft toward which the rotterdam merchants have their favorite seats but dutch gardens are rather to be noticed by an englishman as curiosities than as luxuries it is not only by the known ill taste of their ornaments but by the effects of climate and the soil that gardens are deprived of value in a country where the moisture is so disproportioned to the heat that the verdure though bright has no fragrance and the fruit at its utmost size scarcely any flavor  a passage of two hours brought us to delft which we had expected to find a small and illinhabited place knowing it to be not now occupied by any considerable trade our inn we supposed must be within a few minutes walk we proceeded however through one street for half a mile and after some turnings did not reach our inn though we were led by the nearest way in less than twenty minutes during all this time we were upon the terraces of clear canals amongst excellent houses with a small intermixture of shops and some public buildings the mingled admiration and weariness which we felt here for the first time have been however often repeated for if there is a necessity for saying what is the next distinction of dutch towns after their neatness their size must be insisted upon there are dutch villages scarcely marked in a map which exceed in size some of the county towns in england maesland sluice a place opposite to the brill is one and here is delft a place with scarcely any other trade than consists in the circulation of commodities from rotterdam through some neighboring villages which is not the seat of any considerable part of the national government and is inferior in point of situation to all the surrounding towns delft thus undistinguished fills a large circumference with streets so intricately thick that we never went from our inn without losing our way  the doolen one of the best inns in holland is a large building of the sixteenth century raised by the spaniards and first intended to be a convent but having been used by the burghers of delft for public purposes during the struggle of the provinces against spain it is now venerable as the scene of their councils and preparations in the suite of large apartments which were used by them some of the city business is still transacted and in these strangers are never entertained behind is a bowlinggreen in which the burghers to this day perform their military exercises they were so employed when we came in and it was pleasing to consider that their inferiority to their ancestors in point of martial appearance was the result of the long internal peace secured by the exertions of the latter  over two arches of the building is the date of its erection      the year in which the destruction of all families professing the protestant religion either in france or spain is supposed to have been agreed upon at bayonne between the sovereigns of the two countries and one year preceding the first measures of confederate resistance in the low countries which that and other efforts of persecution produced one of these arches communicates with the rooms so long used by the burghers and our hostess an intelligent woman accompanied us through them the first is ornamented with three large pictures representing several of the early burghers of the commonwealth either in arms or council a portrait of barneveldt is marked with the date and the painters name michael miereveld delineavit ac perfunctorie pinxit      one year before the flagitious arrest of barneveldt in defiance of the constitution of the provinces by maurice of orange a piece exhibiting some of the burghers in arms men of an handsome and heroic appearance is also dated by having      painted on a drum that which shows them in council has a portrait of grotius painted when he was seventeen his face is the seventh from the right hand in the second row  beyond this room are others containing several score of small cupboards on the doors of each of which are two or three blazonries of arms here are deposited some parts of the dress and arms of an association of arquesbusiers usual in all the dutch towns the members of which society assemble annually in october to shoot at a target placed in a pavilion of the old convent garden the marksman takes his aim from the farthest room and between him and the mark are two walls perforated two feet and a half in length and eight inches in breadth to permit the passage of the shot a man stands in the pavilion to tell where the ball has struck and every marksman before he shoots rings a bell to warn this person out of the way he that first hits a white spot in the target has his liquor for the ensuing year free of excise duty but to render this more difficult a stork is suspended by the legs from a string which passing down the whole length of the target is kept in continual motion by the agitation of the bird it did not appear whether the stork has any other share in this ancient ceremony which is represented in prints of considerable date it is held near the ground out of the way of the shot and is certainly not intended to be hurt for the dutch have no taste for cruelty in their amusements the stork it is also known is esteemed by them a fort of tutelary bird as it once was in rome where asellus sempronius rufus who first had them served at an entertainment is said to have lost the praetorship for his sacrilegious gluttony in these trivial enquiries we passed our first evening at delft  early the next morning a battalion of regular troops was reviewed upon a small plain within the walls of the town the uniform is blue and red in which the dutch officers have not quite the smart appearance of ours one of these who gave the word to a company was a boy certainly not more than fifteen whose shrill voice was ludicrously heard between the earnest shouts of the others the firing was very exact which is all that we can tell of the qualities of a review  delft was a place of early importance in the united provinces being one of the six original cities that sent deputies to the states of the province a privilege which at the instance of their glorious william the first of orange was afterward properly extended to twelve others including rotterdam and the brill yet it is little celebrated for military events being unfortified and having probably always obeyed the fortune of the neighboring places the circumstance which gives it a melancholy place in history is the murder of the wise and beneficent prince who founded the republic his palace a plain brick building is still in good repair where strangers are always shown the staircase on which he fell and the holes made in the wall by the shot that killed him the old man who keeps the house told the story with as much agitation and interest as if it had happened yesterday the prince and princess came out of that chamber  here stood the prince here stood the murderer when the prince stepped here to speak to him about the passport the villain fired and the prince fell all along here and died yes so it was  there are the holes the balls made over one of these which is large enough to admit two fingers is this inscription   hier onder staen de teykenen der kooglen daar meede prins willem van orange is doorschootten op  0 july a       to this detestable action the assassin acknowledged himself to have been instigated by the proclamation of philip the second offering a reward for its perpetration the princess who had the wretchedness to witness it had lost her father and her former husband in the massacre of st bartholomew in france which though contrived by catherine and charles the ninth of that country is believed to have been the consequence of their interview at bayonne with isabella the wife of the same philip  the melancholy excited on this spot is continued by passing from it to the tomb of william in the great church called the nieuwe kerk there the gloomy pageantry of the black escutcheons above a choir silent empty and vast and the withering remains of colors won by hands long since gone to their decay prolong the consideration of the transientness of human worth and happiness which can so easily be destroyed by the command or the hand of human villainy  this tomb is thought to be not exceeded by any piece of sepulchral grandeur in europe standing alone in a wide choir it is much more conspicuous and striking than a monumental fabric raised against a wall at the same time that its sides are so varied as to present each a new spectacle it was begun in   0  by order of the states general and completed in      the artist hendrik de keyzer receiving   000 florins as its price and  000 more as a present the length is  0 feet the breadth    and height    a bronze statue of the prince sitting in full armor with his sword scarf and commanders staff renders one side the chief on the other is his effigy in white marble lying at full length and at his feet in the same marble the figure of the dog which is said to have refused food from the moment of its masters death round the tomb twentytwo columns of veined or black italian marble of the doric order and with bases and capitals of white marble support a roof or canopy ornamented with many emblems and with the achievements of the prince  at the corners are the statues of religion liberty justice and fortitude of which the first rests upon a piece of black marble on which is inscribed in golden letters the name of christ and the second holds a cap with the inscription aurea libertas on the four sides of the canopy are the devices of the prince with the inscriptions jehovah  je maintiendrai piete et justice  te vindice tuta libertas  and soevis tranquillus in undis  there are many other ornaments which give dignity or elegance to the structure but cannot be described without tediousness the wellknown epitaph is certainly worth transcribing  d o m et eternae memoriae

family who chiefly at his own expense twice levied and introduced a powerful army under the sanction of the states repelled the tyranny of spain recovered and restored the service of true religion and the ancient laws of the country and finally left the liberty which he had himself asserted to be established by his son prince maurice the heir of his fathers virtues the confederated belgic provinces have erected this monument in perpetual memory of this truly pious prudent and unconquered hero whom philip ii king of spain the dread of europe dreaded never overcame never terrified but with wicked treachery carried off by means of an hired assassin  the tomb of grotius is in the same church which is a stately building of brick and stone but has nothing of the dim religious light that sooths the mind in gothic structures upon the steeple are many small bells the chimes rung upon which are particularly esteemed both for tone and tune  on the opposite side of a very large marketplace is the townhouse an old building but so fresh and so fantastic with paint as to have some resemblance to a chinese temple the body is colored with a light or yellowish brown and is two stories high to the roof in which there are two tier of peaked windows each under its ornament of gilded wood carved into an awkward resemblance of shells upon the front is inscribed  delphensium curia reparata and immediately over the door  reparata       the oude kerk or old church is in another part of the town and is not remarkable except for the tombs of leuwenhoek peter heine and van tromp that of leuwenhoek has a short inscription in latin almost as bad as that of a verse epitaph upon grotius in the other church he was born it appears in october      and died in august      the tombs of heine and van tromp are very handsome there are the effigies of both in white marble and one of the victories gained by the latter is represented in alto relievo on account of the tombs both churches are open during certain hours in the day and a beadle or perhaps an almsman is placed in each who presents a padlocked box into which money may be put for the poor  in this town is the chief arsenal of the province of holland except that the magazine of powder is at the distance of about a mile from it near the canal to rotterdam in      when the dissensions between the states general and the prince of orange were at their height a provincial free corpse seized this arsenal and held it for the states till the return of the prince of orange to the hague a few weeks afterward  having seen what was pointed out to our notice at delft and learned that its extensiveness was owing to the residence of a great number of retired merchants from rotterdam we left it in a trechtschuyt for the hague having little other notion of it in our minds than that it is very dull and very rich and of a size for which there is no recompense to a stranger except in considering that its dullness is the rest of those who have once been busy and that its riches are at least not employed in aggravating the miseries of poverty by ostentation  the hague a voyage of an hour and a half brought us here over a canal well bordered by country houses and gardens all of which as in other parts of holland have some inscription upon their gates to say that they are pleasant or are intended for pleasure fine sight pleasant rest high delight or some similar inscription is to be seen over the door of every country house in gold letters on our way we looked for ryswick where the treaty of      was signed and saw the village but not the palace which being of free stone is mentioned as a sort of curiosity in the country it is this palace which is said to contain proofs of an extraordinary dispute upon questions of ceremony the ambassadors sent to prepare the treaty are related to have contended so long concerning their rights of precedence that the only mode of reconciling them was to make separate entrances and to allow the mediating minister alone admission by the principal gate  from the trechtschuyt we had a long walk to our inn an handsome house standing almost in the midst of palaces and looking over a noble sheet of water called the vyver which extends behind the court for its whole length flowing nearly to the level of the lower windows the court itself a large brick building irregular but light and pleasant was entirely within our view on the left on the right a row of magnificent houses separated from the vyver by a large mall and in front beyond the vyver a broad place bordered by several public buildings in this court all the superior colleges of government have their chambers and the prince of orange his suite of apartments the fosse which surrounds it three drawbridges and as many gates are the only fortifications of the hague which has been several times threatened with the entrance of an enemy but has not been taken since      when the magistrates of the then infant republic and all the superior inhabitants retired to delft leaving the streets to be overrun with grass and the place to become a desert under the eyes of its oppressors during the invasion of louis the fourteenth it escaped the ravages of the duke of luxembourgs column by the sudden dissolution of the ice on which he had placed  000 foot and  000 cavalry yet the advice of william the third who probably thought money better expended in strengthening the frontier than the interior of the country counteracted a plan of fortification which was then proposed for the third or fourth time  the court consists of two squares in the inner of which are the apartments of the stadtholder and none but himself and his family can enter this in carriages or on horseback on the northern side in the first floor are the apartments of the states general which we saw the principal one is spacious as a room but has not the air of a hall of debate twentysix chairs for the deputies are placed on two sides of a long table the president whose chair is in the center has on his right hand first a deputy of his own province then three deputies of friesland and two of groningen on his left six deputies of holland opposite to him nearest to the head of the table six deputies of guelderland then three of zealand then two of utrecht and two of overyssel the stadtholder who has a place but not a vote has a raised chair at the upper end of the table the secretary is seated opposite to him and is allowed to wear his hat like the deputies during their deliberations but must stand uncovered behind the president when he reads letters or other papers the number of deputies is known to be indefinite about fifty are generally returned and those who are present from each province more than the number allowed at the table place themselves below it the walls of this room are covered with tapestry not representing historical events but rural scenery the backs and seats of the chairs are of green velvet and all the furniture though stately and in the best condition is without the least approach to show these apartments and the whole of this side of the court were the residence of charles the fifth when he visited the hague and of the earl of leicester when he commanded the troops lent to the republic by elizabeth  the government of the united provinces is too well known to permit a detailed description here but some notice may reasonably be expected of it  the chief depositaries of the sovereignty are not the states general but the provincial states of whose deputies the former body is composed and without whose consent they never vote upon important measures in the states general each province has one vote which with the reasons for it may be delivered by an unlimited number of deputies and the first deputy of each province presides in the states by rotation for a week in questions relative to peace or war alliances taxes coinages and to the privileges of provinces no measures can be taken but by unanimous consent upon other occasions a majority is sufficient no persons holding military offices can be deputies to the states general which appoints and receives all ambassadors declares war makes peace and names the greffier or secretary of state and all staff officers  the provincial states are variously composed and the interior governments of the provinces variously formed in the province of holland which contains the most prosperous part of the republic there are eighteen deputies to the provincial states for as many towns and one for the nobility the grand pensionary presides in this assembly and is always one of the deputies from it to the states general  the council of deputies is composed of ten members nine from the towns and one from the nobility this council in which the grand pensionary also presides regulates the finances of the province and takes cognizance of the distribution of troops within it  the council called the council of state is composed like the states general of deputies returned from the provinces and appears to be to that body in a great measure what the council of deputies is to the provincial states having the direction of the army and the finances  as provincial affairs are directed by the provincial states so the affairs of each town are governed by its own senate which also returns the members if the town is entitled to send one to the states of the province and directs the vote which that member shall give the burgomasters in each town are the magistrates charged with the police and the finances and are usually elected annually by the old council that is by those who have been burgomasters or echevins these latter officers have the administration of civil and criminal affairs and are in some places appointed by the stadtholder from a double number nominated to him in others are accepted from the recommendation of the stadholder the bailiffs preside in the council of burgomasters and echevins and in their name prosecutions are instituted  of the deputies to the states general some are for life and some for one or more years  such is the nicely complicated frame of this government in which the senates of the towns elect the provincial states and the provincial states the states general the latter body being incapable of deciding in certain cases except with unanimity and with the express consent of their constituents the provincial states who again cannot give that consent except with unanimity and with the consent of their constituents the senates  the stadtholder it is seen has not directly and in consequence of that office any share of the legislative power but being a noble of four provinces he of course participates in that part of the sovereignty which the nobility enjoy when they send deputies to the provincial states of zealand he is the only noble all the other titled families having been destroyed in the original contest with spain and there are no renewals or creations of titles in the united provinces in guelderland holland and utrecht he is president of the nobles he is commander of all the forces of the republic by sea and land and the council of state of which he is a member is in military affairs almost entirely under his direction he names all subaltern officers and recommends those for higher appointments to the states general in guelderland utrecht and overyssel which are called provinces aux reglemens because having submitted to louis the fourteenth in      they were not readmitted to the union but with some sacrifice of their privileges he appoints to offices without the nomination of the cities he is governor general of the east and west indian companies and names all the directors from a treble number of candidates offered by the proprietors his name presides in all the courts of law and his heart it may be hoped dictates in the noble right of pardoning  this is the essential form of a government which for two centuries has protected as great a share of civil and religious liberty as has been enjoyed in any other part of europe resisting equally the chances of dissolution contained within itself and the less dangerous schemes for its destruction dictated by the jealousy of arbitrary interests without  its intricacy and delicacy are easily seen yet of the objections made to it on this account more are founded on some maxims assumed to be universal than upon the separate considerations due to the condition of a separate people how much the means of political happiness depend for their effect upon the civil characters of those for whom they are designed has been very little seen or insisted upon it has been unnoticed because such enquiries have not the brilliancy or the facility of general speculations nor can command equal attention nor equally reward systems with those parts of their importance that consist in the immensity of the sphere to which they pretend to extend their arms is the flagitious ambition of warriors to enlarge their systems is the ambition of writers especially of political writers a juster effort of understanding would aim at rendering the application of principles more exact rather than more extensive and would produce enquiries into the circumstances of national character and condition that should regulate that application a more modest estimate of human means of doing good would show the gradations through which all human advances must be made a more severe integrity of views would stipulate that the means should be as honest as the end and would strive to ascertain from the moral and intellectual character of a people the degree of political happiness of which they are capable a process without which projected advances become obstructions and the philosopher begins his experiment for the amelioration of society as prematurely as the sculptor would polish his statue before he had delineated the features  whether the constitution of the united provinces is exactly as good an one as the people are capable of enjoying can be determined only after a much longer and abler enquiry than we could make but it seemed proper to observe that in judging this question it is not enough to discover better forms of government without finding also some reason to believe that the intellectual and moral condition of the people would secure the existence of those better forms in the mean time they who make the enquiry may be assured that under the present june      government there is a considerable degree of political liberty though political happiness is not permitted by the present circumstances of europe that the general adoption of the stadtholders measures by the states has been unduly mentioned to show an immoderate influence for that in point of fact his measures are often rejected that this rejection produces no public agitation nor can those who differ from him in opinion be successfully represented as enemies to their country that there are very few offices which enable private persons to become rich at the expense of the public so as to have a different interest from them that the sober industry and plain manners of the people prevent them from looking to political conduct of any sort as a means of improving their fortunes that for these reasons the intricate connections between the parts of their government are less inconvenient than may be supposed since good measures will not be obstructed or bad ones supported for corrupt purposes though misconceptions may sometimes produce nearly the same effect that conversation is perfectly free and that the habit of watching the strength of parties for the purpose of joining the strongest and persecuting the weakest does not occupy the minds of any numerous classes amongst them  we saw no other apartments than those of the states general the prince of orange being then in his own the princess was at a seat in guelderland with her daughterinlaw the wife of the hereditary prince who had been indisposed since the surprise of the dutch troops at menin on the   th of september      in which affair her husband was engaged when the officer who brought the first accounts which were not written to the hague had related that the younger prince was wounded the hereditary princess enquired with great eagerness concerning his brother the officer indiscreetly replied that he knew nothing of him which the princess supposed to imply that he was dead and she has since been somewhat an invalid  though the salaries enjoyed by the prince of orange in consequence of his offices are by no means considerable he is enabled by his patrimonial estates to maintain some modest splendor the court is composed of a grand master a marshal a grand equerry ten chamberlains five ladies of honor and six gentlemen of the chamber ten young men with the title of pages are educated at the expense of the prince in a house adjoining his manege as captain general he is allowed eight adjutants and as admiral three  we could not learn the amount of the income enjoyed by the prince of orange which must indeed be very variable arising chiefly from his own estates the greater part of these are in the province of zealand where seventeen villages and part of the town of breda are his property the fortifications of several places there are said to have been chiefly erected at the expense of the orange family his farms in that neighborhood suffered greatly in the campaign of      and this part of his income has since been much diminished the management of his revenues derived from possessions in germany affords employment to four or five persons at an office separate from his ordinary treasury and he had estates in the low countries all this is but the wreck of a fortune honorably diminished by william the first of orange in the contest with spain the remembrance of whom may perhaps involuntarily influence ones opinion of his successors  during may the western gate of the palace is ornamented according to ancient custom with garlands for each person of the orange family chaplets with the initials of each in flowers are placed under large coronets upon green flagstaffs we passed by when they were taking these down and perceived that all the ornaments could scarcely have cost five shillings so humble are the dutch notions of pageantry  among the offices included within the walls of the court is a printing house in which the states general and the states of holland employ only persons sworn to secrecy as to the papers committed to them it may seem strange to require secrecy from those whose art is chiefly useful in conferring publicity but the truth is that many papers are printed here which are never communicated to the public the states employing the press for the sake of its cheapness and considering that any of their members who would show a printed paper would do the same with a written one  in a large square near the court is the cabinet of natural history of which we have not the knowledge necessary for giving a description it is arranged in small rooms which are opened at twelve oclock to those who have applied the day before one article said to be very rare and certainly very beautiful was an animal of the deer species about fourteen inches high exquisitely shaped and marked and believed to be at its full growth it was brought from the coast of africa  the stadtholders library was accidentally shut owing to the illness of the librarian the picture gallery was open but of paintings we have resolved to exempt our readers from any mention the former is said to contain eight thousand volumes and fourteen thousand prints in portfolios among the illuminated m ss in vellum is one used by the sanguinary catherine de medicis and her children and another which belonged to isabella of castille the grandmother of charles the fifth what must be oddly placed in a library is a suit of armor of francis the first which was once in the cabinet of christina of sweden though this collection is the private property of the prince the librarian is permitted to lend books to persons known to him and likely to use them advantageously for science  we passed a long morning in walking through the streets of this place which contain probably more magnificent houses than can be found in the same space in any city of northern europe the grand voorhout is rather indeed two series of palaces than a street between two broad carriageways which pass immediately along the sides are several alleys of tall lime trees canopying walks first laid out by charles the fifth in      and ordered to be carefully preserved the placard being still extant which directs the punishment of offenders against them it would be tedious to mention the many splendid buildings in this and the neighboring streets among the most conspicuous is the present residence of the british ambassadors built by huguetan the celebrated banker of louis the fourteenth and that of the russian minister which was erected by the pensionary barneveldt but the building which was intended to exceed all others at the hague is the hotel of the prince of nassau weilbourg who having married the sister of the prince of orange bought at an immense expense eight good houses facing the voorhout in order to erect upon their site a magnificent palace what has been already built of this is extremely fine in the crescent form but a german arriving to the expenditure of a dutch fortune probably did not estimate it by dutch prices it was begun eighteen years since and for the last twelve has not proceeded  superb public buildings occur at almost every step through the hague at one end of the terrace on which we were lodged is the doelen a spacious mansion opening partly upon the tournois veld or place of tournaments the burgesses here keep their colors and what is remarkable still preserve the insignia of the toison dor given to them by charles the fifth our william the third being admitted at ten years of age to the right of a burgess here was invested with this order by the burgomaster at the other end of the terrace is the palace built for prince maurice of nassau upon his return from the government of brazil by kampfen lord of rambroek architect of the stadthouse at amsterdam the interior of this building was destroyed by fire in the commencement of the present century but the stately walls of stone and brick being uninjured the rooms were restored by the proprietors assisted by a lottery it is an instance of the abundance of buildings here that this palace is now chiefly used as a place of meeting for the oeconomical branch of the society of haerlem and for a society instituted here for the encouragement of dutch poetry  the number of public buildings is much increased by the houses which the eighteen towns provide for their deputies sent to the states of the province these are called the logements of the several towns and there has been a great deal of emulation as to their magnificence amsterdam and rotterdam have the finest  the churches are not remarkable for antiquity or grandeur a congregation of english protestants have their worship performed in the manner of the dissenters in a small chapel near the vyver where we had the satisfaction to hear their venerable pastor the rev dr mclean  the residence of a court at the hague renders the appearance of the inhabitants less national and characteristic than elsewhere there are few persons in the streets who without their orange cockades might not be mistaken for english but ribbons of this color are almost universal which some wear in their hats and some upon a buttonhole of the coat the poorest persons and there are more poor here than elsewhere find something orangecoloured to show children have it placed upon their caps so that the practice is carried to an extent as ridiculous as the prohibition was in      when the magistrates ordered that nothing orangecoloured should be worn or shown not even fruits or flowers and that carrots should not be exposed to sale with the ends outward  the distinctions between political classes are very strongly marked and preserved in holland we were informed that there are some villages in which the wearing of a cockade and others in which the want of one would expose a passenger especially a native to insults in the cities where those of both parties must transact business together the distinction is not much observed in amsterdam the friends of the stadtholder do not wear cockades for the most part the seamen farmers and laboring classes in the towns are attached to the orange family whose opponents are chiefly composed of the opulent merchants and tradesmen  a history or even a description of the two parties if we were enabled to give it would occupy too much space here but it may be shortly mentioned that the original or chief cause of the dissension was as might be expected entirely of a commercial nature the english interest had an unanimous popularity in holland about the year    0 in the war of      the french having sustained a great loss of shipping employed dutch vessels to bring the produce of their american islands to europe and thus established a considerable connection with the merchants of amsterdam and rotterdam the court of versailles took care that the stream of french wealth which they saw setting into the united provinces should carry with it some french politics while the wealth itself effected more than all their contrivance and gradually produced a kindness for france especially in the province of holland through which it chiefly circulated the english ministers took all dutch ships having french property on board and the popularity of england was for a time destroyed several maritime towns probably with some instigation from france demanded a war against england the friends of the stadtholder prevented this and from that time the prince began to share whatever unpopularity the measures of the english ministers or the industry of the english traders could excite in a rival and a commercial country  the capture of the french west india islands soon after removed the cause of the dispute but the effects of it survived in the jealousy of the great cities toward the stadtholder and were much aggravated by the losses of their merchants at the commencement of hostilities between england and the united provinces in    0 the dutch fleet being then unprepared to sail and every thing which could float having been sent out of the harbors of yorkshire and lincolnshire to intercept their trading ships the fortunes of many of the most opulent houses in holland were severely shook and all their members became the enemies of the stadtholder  if to these circumstances it is added that the province of holland which pays fiftyeight parts of every hundred levied by taxes has an ambition for acquiring greater influence in the general government than is bestowed by its single vote we have probably all the original causes of the party distinctions in holland though others may have been incorporated with others during a long series of events and many violent struggles of the passions  the stadtholder who has had the misfortune to attract so much attention by his difficulties is said to be a man of plain manners and sound understanding neither capable of political intrigue nor inclined to it his office requires especially during a war a great deal of substantial personal labor to which he devotes himself earnestly and continually but which he has not the vigor to bear without an evident oppression of spirits we saw him at a parade of the guards and it is not necessary to be told of his labors to perceive how much he is affected by them it is scarcely possible to conceive a countenance more expressive of a mind always urged always pressed upon and not often receiving the relief of complete confidence in its efforts his person is short and extremely corpulent his air in conversation modest and mild this attendance upon the parade is his chief exercise or relaxation at the hague where he frequently passes ten of the hours between five in a morning and nine at night in his cabinet he comes accompanied by one or two officers and his presence produces no crowd when we had viewed the parade and returned home we saw him walking under our windows toward the voorhout accompanied by an officer but not followed by a single person  conversation does not turn so much upon the family of the stadtholder as that we could acquire any distinct opinions of the other parts of it of his humanity and temper there was sufficient proof in      when he returned to the hague and was master of the persons of those who had lately banished him indeed the conduct of both parties with respect to the personal safety of their adversaries was honorable to the character of the nation the states of holland during the prevalence of their authority did not pretend according to the injustice of similar cases to any right of destroying the friends of the stadtholder who were in their hands the stadtholder when he returned and when the public detestation of his adversaries was at an height which would have permitted any measures against them demanded no other retribution than that seventeen named in a lift should be declared incapable of holding offices under the republic  one of the best excursions from the hague is made to the maison du bois a small palace of the prince of orange in a wood which commences almost at the northern gate of the town this wood is called a park but it is open to the public roads from leyden haerlem and amsterdam which pass through its noble alleys of oak and beech it is remarkable for having so much attracted the regard of philip the second that in the campaign of      he ordered his officers not to destroy it and is probably the only thing not destined for himself of which this ample destroyer of human kind and of his own family ever directed the preservation louis the fourteenth probably having heard the praises of this care left the mall of utrecht to be a monument of similar tenderness during an unprovoked invasion which cost ten thousand lives  the apartments of the maison du bois are very variously furnished the best are fitted up with a light gray satin imbossed with chinese birds and plants in silk and feathers of the most beautiful tints the window curtains screens and coverings of the sophas and chairs are the same and the frames of the latter are also of chinese workmanship nothing more delicate and tasteful can be conceived but that you may not be quite distracted with admiration the carpets are such as an english merchant would scarcely receive into a parlour the furniture of the state bedchamber is valuable and has once been splendid a light balustrade of curious japan work about three feet high runs across the room and divides that part in which the bed stands from the remainder the princesss drawing room in which card parties are sometimes held is well embellished with paintings and may be called a superb apartment but here again there is an instance of the incompleteness said to be observable in the furniture of all rooms out of england of four card tables two are odd ones and literally would be despised in a brokers shop in london the great glory of the house is the salle dorange an oblong saloon of noble height with pannels painted by nine celebrated painters of the flemish and dutch schools among whom van tulden a pupil of rubens has observed his manner so much in a workshop of vulcan and in a figure of venus forming a trophy that they have been usually attributed to his master the subjects on the pannels and ceiling are all allegorical and complimentary for the most part to the princes of the house of orange especially to frederic henry the son of the first william and the grandson of the admiral coligny it was at the expense of his widow that the house was built and the saloon thus ornamented  almost all the rooms are decorated with family portraits of which some have just been contributed by the pencil of the hereditary princess a large piece represents herself taking a likeness of the princess her motherinlaw and includes what is said to be an admirable portrait of her husband on the six doors of the grand cabinet are six whole lengths of ladies of the house of orange exhibited in allegorical characters the doors being covered by the paintings when that by which you have entered is shut you cannot tell the way back again a portrait of louisa de coligny the widow of william the first is enriched with a painters pun she is presented by hope with a branch of an orange tree containing only one orange from which the spectator is to learn that her son was her only hope  the most delightful outlet from the hague is toward schevening a village on the seashore nearly two miles distant the road to which has been often and properly celebrated as a noble monument of tasteful grandeur commencing at the canal which surrounds the hague it proceeds to the village through a vista so exactly straight that the steeple of schevening the central object at the end of it is visible at the first entrance four rows of lofty elms are planted along the road of which the two central lines form this perfect and most picturesque vista the others shelter paths on each side of it for foot passengers  the village itself containing two or three hundred houses of fishermen and peasants would be a spectacle for its neatness any where but in holland there is no square or street of the most magnificent houses in london that can equal it for an universal appearance of freshness it is positively bright with cleanliness though its only street opens upon the sea and is the resort of hundreds of fishermen we passed a most delightful day at a little inn upon the beach sometimes looking into the history of the village which is very ancient then enquiring into its present condition and then enjoying the prospect of the ocean boundless to our view on one side and appearing to be but feebly restrained by a long tract of low white coast on the other  the sea beats furiously upon the beach here which has no doubt been much raised by art for the defense of the village there is at least no other way of accounting for its security since      between which year and the latter end of the preceding century it sustained six inundations the first in    0 demolished a church the last washed away an hundred and twenty houses notwithstanding which the inhabitants built again upon their stormy shore and their industry that at length protected them from the sea enabled them to endure also the more inveterate ravages of the spaniards on this beach lie occasionally great numbers of herring busses too stoutly built to be injured by touching it we suspect our information to have been exaggerated but we heard on the spot that no less than one hundred and five belong to this village of little more than two hundred houses or are managed by agents in it about forty were set on float by the tide in the afternoon and being hauled by means of anchors beyond a very heavy surf were out of sight before we left the place  it was amusing to see the persevering effectual but not very active exertions of the seamen in this business which could not often be more difficult than it then was when a strong wind blew directly upon the shore we here first perceived what we had many other opportunities of observing that notwithstanding the general admiration of dutch industry it is of a nature which would scarcely acquire that name in england a dutchman of the laboring class is indeed seldom seen unemployed but we never observed one man working hard according to the english notion of the term perseverance carefulness and steadiness are theirs beyond any rivalship the vehemence force activity and impatience of an english sailor or workman are unknown to them you will never see a dutchman enduring the fatigue or enjoying the rest of a london porter heavy burdens indeed they do not carry at amsterdam where carriages are even somewhat obnoxious a cask holding four or five gallons of liquor is removed by a horse and a sledge  on our way from schevening where a dinner costs more than at an hotel in the hague we turned a little to the right to see portland gardens once the favorite resort of william and mary and said to be laid out in the english taste they are now a bad specimen even of dutch gardens the situation is unusually low having on one hand the raised bank of the schevening road and on another the sand hills of the coast between these the moisture of the sea air is held for a long time and finally drawn down upon the earth the artificial ornaments are stained and decaying and the grass and weeds of the neglected plots are capable only of a putrid green over walks of a black mould you are led to the orangery where there is more decay and may look through the windows of the greenhouse to perceive how every thing is declining there some pavilions provided with water spouts are then to be seen and if you have the patience to wait the conclusion of an operation intended to surprise you you may count how many of the pipes refuse to perform their office  nearer to the hague we were stopped to pay a toll of a few doights a circumstance which was attended with this proof of civility having passed in the morning without the demand we enquired why it should be made now the gatherer replied that he had seen us pass but knowing that we must return by the same way had avoided giving more trouble than was necessary this tax is paid for the support of the bank or digue over which the road passes a work begun on the  st of may      and finished on the  th of december      by the assistance of a loan granted for the enterprise the breadth of the road is thirtytwo yards  the next day after seeing the relief of the stadtholders guard du corpse the privates of which wear feathered hats with uniforms of scarlet and gold we left the hague with much admiration of its pleasantness and quiet grandeur and took the roof of the trechtschuyt for leyden  leyden three hours pleasant floating along a canal adorned with frequent country houses gardens summerhouses and square balconies or rather platforms projecting over the water within an hands breadth of its level brought us to this city which was esteemed the second in holland before rotterdam gained its present extent leyden is however so large that a traveller is likely to have a walk of half a league to his inn and those who arrive as we did at the time of the fair may find the procession not very pleasant we increased our difficulties by turning away from the dirt and incivility of what was called the best inn and did not afterward find a better though such it seems might have been had  having at length become contented with the worst we went toward the fair of which we had as yet seen only the crowd the booths being disposed under trees and along the borders of canals made the whole appearance differ from that of an english fair though not quite so much as we had expected the stock of the shopkeepers makes a greater distinction there were several booths filled with silversmiths and jewellers wares to the amount of probably some thousand pounds each large french clocks in or moulu and porcelain were among their stores all the trades displayed the most valuable articles that could be asked for in similar shops in large cities we had the pleasure to see great quantities of english goods and there were english names over three or four of the booths  the dutch dresses were now become so familiar to us that the crowd seemed as remarkable for the number of other persons in it as for the abundance of peasants in their holiday finery which it is pleasant to know displays the ornamental relics of several generations fashion having very little influence in holland the fair occupied about a fourth part of the town which we soon left to see the remainder two streets parallel to each other run through its whole length and include the few public halls of an university which would scarcely be known to exist if it had no more conspicuous objects than its buildings the dutch universities contain no endowed foundations so that the professors who have their salaries from the states live in private houses and the students in lodgings the academical dress is worn only in the schools and by the professors the library to which joseph scaliger was a benefactor is open only once in a week and then for no more than two hours it is the constant policy of the dutch government to make strangers leave as much money as possible behind them and leyden was once so greatly the resort of foreigners that it was thought important not to let them read for nothing what they must otherwise be obliged to buy the university is of course declining much under this commercial wisdom of the magistrates  there are students however of many nations and religions no oaths being imposed except upon the professors physic and botany especially are said to be cultivated here with much success and there is a garden to which not only individuals but the east india company industriously contribute foreign plants the salaries of the professors who receive besides fees from the students are nearly two hundred pounds a year the government of the university is in the rector who is chosen out of three persons returned by the senate to the states the senate consists of the professors and on extraordinary occasions the senate and rector are directed by curators who are the agents for the states  the chief street in the town is of the crescent form so that with more public buildings it would be a miniature resemblance of highstreet oxford the townhouse is built with many spires and with almost chinese lightness we did not see the interior of this or indeed of any other public buildings for in the morning when curiosity was to be indulged our fastidiousness as to the inns returned and induced us to take a passage for haerlem the mss of the dutch version of the bible which are known to be deposited here could not have been shown being opened only once in three years when the deputies of the synod and states attend but we might have seen in the townhouse some curious testimonies of the hardships and perseverance of the inhabitants during the celebrated blockade of five months in      in consideration of which the university was founded  after viewing some wellfilled booksellers shops and one wide street of magnificent houses we again made half the circuit of this extensive city in the way to the trechtschuyt for  haerlem the canal between leyden and this place is nearly the pleasantest of the great number which connect all the towns of the province with each other and render them to the traveller a series of spectacles almost as easily visited as the amusements of one large metropolis though this is said to be one of the lowest parts of holland the country does not appear to have suffered more than the rest by water the many country seats which border the canals are also proofs that it is thought to be well secured yet this is the district which has been proved by indisputable observations to be lower than the neighboring sea even in the profoundest calm during the voyage which was of four hours we passed under several bridges and saw numbers of smaller canals crossing the country in various directions but the passage of a trechtschuyt is not delayed for an instant by a bridge the towrope being loosened from the boat on one side and immediately caught again on the other if it should not be delivered by some person purposely stationed on the arch it is not often that a canal makes any bend in its course when it does so there are small high posts at the point round which the towrope is drawn and that the cord may not be destroyed by the friction the posts support perpendicular rollers which are turned by its motion such posts and rollers might be advantageously brought into use in england on most of the canals are halfway villages where passengers may stop about five minutes for refreshment but they will be left behind without any ceremony if they exceed the limited time which the boatman employs in exchanging letters for such of the neighboring country houses as have not packet boxes placed on the banks  haerlem like leyden is fortisied by brick walls but both seem to be without the solid earthern works that constitute the strength of modern fortresses a few pieces of cannon are planted near the gate in order to command the bridge of a wide fosse and the gate house itself is a stout building deep enough to render the passage underneath somewhat dark there is otherwise very little appearance of the strength that resisted the duke of alva for twelve months and exasperated his desire of vengeance so far that the murder of the inhabitants who at last surrendered to his promises of protection could alone appease it  a narrow street leads from the gate to the marketplace where two pieces of cannon are planted before the guardhouse the first precaution against internal commotion which we had seen in the country haerlem had a great share in the disputes of      and is said to adhere more fully than any other city to the antistadtholderian politics of that period  the marketplace is very spacious and surrounds the great church perhaps the largest sacred building in the province of holland the lofty oak roof is marked with dates of the early part of the sixteenth century the organ sometimes said to be the best in europe is of unusual size but has more power of sound than sweetness the pipes are silvered and the body carefully painted for organs are the only objects in dutch churches which are permitted to be shewy they are now building in the great church at rotterdam a rival to this instrument and need not despair of surpassing it  a great part of the congregation sit upon chairs in the large aisle which does not seem to be thought a much inferior place to the other parts during an evening service at which we were present this was nearly filled and while every person took a separate seat women carried chauffepieds or little wooden boxes with pans of burning peat in them to the ladies this was on the  th of june the men enter the church with their hats on and some wear them during the whole service with the most disgusting and arrogant hardihood  we passed a night at haerlem which is scarcely worth so long a stay though one street formed upon the banks of a canal consists of houses more uniformly grand than any out of the hague and surprises you with its extensive magnificence at a place where there is little other appearance of wealth and none of splendor but the quietness of the great in holland is daily astonishing to a stranger who sometimes passes through rows of palaces without meeting a carriage or a servant the inhabitants of those palaces have however not less earnest views than they who are more agitated the difference between them is that the views of the former are only such as their situation enables them to gratify without the agitation of the latter they can sit still and wait for the conclusion of every year at which they are to be richer or rather are to have much more money than in the preceding one they know that every day the silent progress of interest adds so much to their principal and they are content to watch the course of time for it is time alone that varies their wealth the single object of their attention there can be no motive but its truth for repeating the trite opinion of the influence of avarice in holland we expected perhaps with some vanity to have found an opportunity for contradicting it but are able only to add another testimony of its truth the infatuation of loving money not as a means but as an end is paramount in the mind of almost every dutchman whatever may be his other dispositions and qualities the addiction to it is fervent inveterate invincible and universal from youth to the feeblest old age  haerlem has little trade its communication with the sea being through amsterdam which latter place has always been able to obstruct the reasonable scheme of cutting a canal through the four miles of land that separate the former from the ocean its manufactures of silk and thread are much less prosperous than formerly yet there are no symptoms of decay or poverty and the environs are well covered with gardens especially on the banks of the sparen of which one branch flows through the town and the other passes under the walls some charitable institutions for the instruction and employment of children should be mentioned also to assuage the general censure of a too great fondness for money  the house of laurance coster who is opposed to faust gottenburgh and scheffer for the honor of having invented the art of printing is near the great church and is still inhabited by a bookseller an inscription not worth copying asserts him to be the inventor the house which is small and stands in a row with others must have received its present brick front in some time subsequent to that of coster  amsterdam the voyage between haerlem and this place is less pleasant with respect to the country than many of the other trips but more gratifying to curiosity for great part of the way the canal passes between the lake called haerlemer maer and a large branch of the zuyder zee called the river y in one place the neck of land which separates these two waters is so thin that a canal cannot be drawn through it and near this there is a village where passengers leave their first boat another waiting for them at the renewal of the canal within a quarter of a mile here as upon other occasions of the same sort nearly as much is paid for the carriage of two or three trunks between the boats as for the whole voyage and there is an ordonnatie to authorize the price for the magistrates have considered that those who have much baggage are probably foreigners and may be thus made to support many of the natives the dutch themselves put their linen into a velvet bag called a rysack and for this accordingly no charge is made  the half wegen sluice is the name of this separation between two vast waters both of which have gained considerably upon their shores and if united would be irresistible at the narrowest part it consists of pilework and masonry to the thickness of probably forty feet on this spot the spectator has on his left hand the y which though called a river is an immense inundation of the zuyder zee and would probably carry a small vessel without interruption into the german ocean on the other hand is the haerlem lake about twelve miles long and nine broad on which during the siege of haerlem the dutch and spaniards maintained fleets and fought battles extending as far as leyden there is a passage upon it from that city to amsterdam much shorter than by the canal but held to be dangerous before the year      there was however no other way and it was probably the loss of the prince of bohemia and the danger of his dethroned father upon the lake that instigated the making of the canal  this sluice is one of several valuable posts by which amsterdam may be defended against a powerful army and was an important station during the approach of the duke of brunswick in      when this city was the last which surrendered all the roads being formed upon dikes or embankments may be defended by batteries which can be attacked only by narrow columns and in front the half wegen sluice was however easily taken by the duke of brunswick his opponents having neglected to place gunboats on the haerlem lake over which he carried eight hundred men in thirty boats and surprised the dutch before daybreak on the morning of the first of october this was one of his real assaults but there were all together eleven made on that day and on the next the city proposed to surrender  beyond the sluice the canal passes several breaches made by inundations of the y and not capable of being drained or repaired in these places the canal is separated from the inundations either by piles or floating planks none of the breaches were made within the memory of the present generation yet the boatmen have learned to speak of them with horror  there is nothing magnificent or grand in the approach to amsterdam or the prospect of the city the sails of above an hundred windmills moving on all sides seem more conspicuous than the public buildings of this celebrated capital  the trechtschuyt having stopped on the outside of the gate we waited for one of the public coaches which are always to be had by sending to a livery stable but do not stand in the street for fares it cost halfacrown for a drive of about two miles into the city the regulated price is a guilder or twentypence our direction was to the doolen but the driver chose to take us to another inn in the same street which we did not discover to be otherwise called till we had become satisfied with it  nearly all the chief thoroughfares of amsterdam are narrow but the carriages are neither so numerous as in other places of the same size nor suffered to be driven with the same speed so that though there is no raised pavement foot passengers are as safe as elsewhere there are broad terraces to the streets over the two chief canals but these are sometimes encumbered by workshops placed immediately over the water between which and the houses the owners maintain an intercourse of packages and planks with very little care about the freedom of the passage this indeed may be constantly observed of the dutch they will never either in their societies or their business employ their time for a moment in gratifying the little malice or showing the little envy or assuming the little triumphs which fill so much of life with unnecessary miseries but they will seldom step one inch out of their way or surrender one moment of their time to save those whom they do not know from any inconvenience a dutchman throwing cheeses into his warehouse or drawing iron along the pathway will not stop while a lady or an infirm person passes unless he perceives somebody inclined to protect them a warehouseman trundling a cask or a woman in the favorite occupation of throwing water upon her windows will leave it entirely to the passengers to take care of their limbs or their clothes  the canals themselves which are the ornaments of other dutch cities are for the most part the nuisances of amsterdam many of them are entirely stagnant and though deep are so laden with filth that on a hot day the feculence seems pestilential our windows opened upon two but the scent very soon made us willing to relinquish the prospect the bottoms are so muddy that a boathook drawn up perhaps through twelve feet of water leaves a circle of slime at the top which is not lost for many minutes it is not unusual to see boats laden with this mud passing during midday under the windows of the most opulent traders and the fetid cargoes never disturb the intense studies of the countinghouses within  after this distaste of the streets and canals of amsterdam it was a sort of duty to see what is the glory of the city the interior of the stadthouse but we lost this spectacle by a negligence of that severe punctuality in which the dutch might be usefully imitated throughout the world our friends had obtained for us a ticket of admission at ten we called upon them about half an hour afterward but as the ride from their house would have required ten minutes more the time of this ticket was thought to be elapsed we would not accept one which was offered to be obtained for another day being unwilling to render it possible that those who were loading us with the sincerest civilities should witness another apparent instance of inattention  the stadthouse as to its exterior is a plain stone building attracting attention chiefly from its length solidity and height the front is an hundred and eight paces long it has no large gate but several small ones and few statues that would be observed except one of atlas on the top the tales as to the expense of the building are inexhaustible the foundation alone which is entirely of piles is said to have cost a million of guilders or nearly ninety thousand pounds and the whole edifice treble that sum its contents the stock of the celebrated bank are estimated at various amounts of which we will not repeat the lowest  the exchange is an humble building and not convenient of access the post office is well situated upon a broad terrace near the stadthouse and seems to be properly laid out for its use  none of the churches are conspicuous for their structure but the regulation with respect to their ministers should be more known two are assigned to each and all throughout the city have equal and respectable salaries  at a distance from the exchange are some magnificent streets raised on the banks of canals nearly equalling those of the hague for the grandeur of houses and much exceeding in length the best of leyden and haerlem these are the streets which must give a stranger an opinion of the wealth of the city while the port and that alone can display the extensiveness of its commerce the shops and the preparations for traffic in the interior have a mean appearance to those who try them by the standard of london conveniences and elegance  the best method of seeing the port is to pass down it in a boat to some of the many towns that skirt the zuyder zee one convenience easy to be had every where is immediately visible from the quays small platforms of planks supported by piles project from the shore between the vessels which are disposed with their heads toward the sides of these little bridges the furthest has thus a communication with the quay and if the cargo is not of very heavy articles may be unladen at the same time with the others the port is so wide that though both sides are thronged with shipping the channel in the middle is at least as broad as the thames at london bridge but the harbor does not extend to more than half the length of the pool at london and seems to contain about half the number of vessels the form of the port is however much more advantageous for a display of shipping which may be here seen nearly at one glance in a fine bay of the zuyder  after a sail of about an hour we landed at saardam a village celebrated for the dockyards which supply amsterdam with nearly all its fleets a short channel carries vessels of the greatest burden from saardam to the zuyder zee which the founders of the place took care not to approach too nearly and the terrace at the end of this channel is prepared for the reception of cannon that must easily defend it from any attack by sea though the neighborhood of a dockyard might be supposed a sufficient antidote to cleanliness the neatness of this little town renders it a spectacle even to the dutch themselves the streets are so carefully swept that a piece of orange peel would be noticed upon the pavement and the houses are washed and painted to the highest polish of nicety those who are here in a morning or at night may probably see how many dirty operations are endured for the sake of this excessive cleanliness  we were shown nearly round the place and of course to the cottage in which the indefatigable peter the first of russia resided when he was a workman in the dockyard it is a tenement of two rooms standing in a part of the village so very mean that the alleys near it are not cleaner than those of other places an old woman lives in the cottage and subsists chiefly by showing it to visitors amongst whom have been the present grand duke and duchess of russia for the court of petersburgh acknowledge it to have been the residence of peter and have struck a medal in commemoration of so truly honorable a palace the old woman has received one of these medals from the present empress together with a grant of a small annuity to encourage her care of the cottage  we passed an agreeable afternoon at an inn on the terrace from whence pleasure vessels and passage boats were continually departing for amsterdam and had a smart sail on our return during a cloudy and somewhat a stormy sunset the approach to amsterdam on this side is as grand as that from haerlem is mean half the circuit of the city and all its spires being visible at once over the crowded harbor the great church of haerlem is also seen at a small distance on the right  the amstel a wide river which flows through the city into the harbor fills nearly all the canals and is itself capable of receiving ships of considerable burden one of the bridges over it and a terrace beyond are among the few pleasant walks enjoyed by the inhabitants the admiralty an immense building in the interior of which is the dockyard stands on this terrace or quay and the east india company have their magazine here instead of the interior of the city where it would be benevolence to let its perfume counteract the noxiousness of the canals  the government of amsterdam is said to collect by taxes rents and dues of various sorts more than an english million and a half annually and though a great part of this sum is afterward paid to the use of the whole republic the power of collecting and distributing it must give considerable consequence to the magistrates the senate which has this power consists of thirtysix members who retain their seats during life and were formerly chosen by the whole body of burghers but about two centuries ago this privilege was surrendered to the senate itself who have ever since filled up the vacancies in their number by a majority of their own voices the echevins who form the court of justice are here chosen by the burghers out of a double number nominated by the senate in the other cities the stadtholder and not the burghers makes this choice  it is obvious that when the city senates which return the provincial states and through them the states general were themselves elected by the burghers the legislature of the united provinces had a character entirely representative and at present a respect for public opinion is said to have considerable influence in directing the choice of the senates  the province of holland of which this city is the most important part is supposed to contain  00000 persons who pay taxes to the amount of twentyfour millions of guilders or two millions sterling forming an average of two pounds ten shillings per person in estimating the real taxation of a people it is however necessary to consider the proportion of their consumption to their imports for the duties advanced upon imported articles are not ultimately and finally paid till these are consumed the frugal habits of the dutch permit them to retain but a small part of the expensive commodities which they collect and the foreigners to whom they are resold pay therefore a large share of the taxation which would be so enormous if it was confined to the inhabitants among the taxes really paid by themselves are the following  a land tax of about four shillings and nine pence per acre a saletax of eight per cent upon horses one and a quarter per cent upon other movables and two and an half per cent upon land and buildings a tax upon inheritances out of the direct line varying from two and an half to eleven per cent two per cent upon every mans income an excise of three pounds per hogshead upon wine and a charge of two per cent upon all public offices the latter tax is not quite so popular here as in other countries because many of these offices are actually purchased the holders being compelled to buy stock to a certain amount and to destroy the obligations the excise upon coffee tea and salt is paid annually by each family according to the number of their servants  the inhabitants of amsterdam and some other cities pay also a tax in proportion to their property for the maintenance of companies of cityguards which are under the orders of their own magistrates in amsterdam indeed taxation is somewhat higher than in other places sir william temple was assured that no less than thirty duties might be reckoned to have been paid there before a certain dish could be placed upon a table at a tavern  the exact sums paid by the several provinces toward every hundred thousand guilders raised for the general use have been often printed the share of holland is    0  guilders and a fraction that of overssel which is the smallest      guilders and a fraction  of five colleges of admiralty established within the united provinces three are in holland and contribute of course to point out the preeminence of that province it is remarkable that neither of these supply their ships with provisions they allow the captains to deduct about fourpence halfpenny per day from the pay of each sailor for that purpose a regulation which is never made injurious to the seamen by any improper parsimony and is sometimes useful to the public in a country where pressing is not permitted a captain who has acquired a character for generosity amongst the sailors can muster a crew in a few days which without such a temptation could not be raised in as many weeks  we cannot speak with exactness of the prices of provisions in this province but they are generally said to be as high as in england the charges at inns are the same as on the roads within an hundred miles of london or perhaps something more port wine is not so common as a wine which they call claret but which is compounded of a strong red wine from valencia mixed with some from bourdeaux the general price for this is twenty pence english a bottle three and four pence is the price for a much better sort about halfacrown per day is charged for each apartment and logement is always the first article in a bill  private families buy good claret at the rate of about eighteen pence per bottle and chocolate for two shillings per pound beef is sold for much less than in england but is so poor that the dutch use it chiefly for soup and salt even that which they roast good white sugar is eighteen pence per pound bread is dearer than in england and there is a sort called milk bread of uncommon whiteness which costs nearly twice as much as our ordinary loaves herbs and fruits are much lower priced and worse in flavor but their color and size are not inferior fish is cheaper than in our maritime counties those excepted which are at a great distance from the metropolis coffee is very cheap and is more used than tea no kind of meat is so good as in england but veal is not much inferior and is often dressed as plainly and as well as with us the innkeepers have a notion of mutton and lamb chops but then it is a la maintenon and the rank oil of the paper is not a very delightful sauce butter is usually brought to table clarified that is purposely melted into an oil and it is difficult to make them understand that it may be otherwise  the dutch have much more respect for english than for other travelers but there is a jealousy with respect to our commerce which is avowed by those who have been tutored to calm discussion and may be perceived in the conversation of others whenever the state of the two countries is noticed this jealousy is greater in the maritime than in the other provinces and in amsterdam than in some of the other cities rotterdam has so much direct intercourse with england as to feel in some degree a share in its interests  some of our excursions round amsterdam were made in a curious vehicle the body of a coach placed upon a sledge and drawn by one horse the driver walks by the side with the reins in one hand and in the other a wetted rope which he sometimes throws under the sledge to prevent it from taking fire and to fill up the little gaps in the pavement the appearance of these things was so whimsical that curiosity tempted us to embark in one and finding them laughed at by none but ourselves the convenience of being upon a level with the shops and with the faces that seemed to contain the history of the shops induced us to use them again there are great numbers of them being encouraged by the magistrates in preference to wheel carriages and as is said in tenderness to the piled foundations of the city the only one in holland in which they are used the price is eight pence for any distance within the city and eight pence an hour for attendance  near amsterdam is the small village of ouderkirk a place of some importance in the short campaign of      being accessible by four roads all of which were then fortified it consists chiefly of the country houses of amsterdam merchants at one of which we passed a pleasant day having been but slightly defended after the loss of the posts of half wegen and amstelreen it was not much injured by the prussians but there are many traces of balls thrown into it the ride to it from amsterdam is upon the cheerful banks of the amstel which is bordered for more than five miles with gardens of better verdure and richer groves than had hitherto appeared the village was spread with booths for a fair though it was sunday and we were somewhat surprised to observe that a people in general so gravely decorous as the dutch should not pay a stricter deference to the sabbath we here took leave of some friends whose frank manners and obliging dispositions are remembered with much more delight than any other circumstances relative to amsterdam  utrecht the passage from amsterdam hither is of eight hours and notwithstanding the pleasantness of trechtschuyt conveyance seemed somewhat tedious after the habit of passing from city to city in half that time the canal is however justly preferred to others on account of the richness of its surrounding scenery and it is pleasing to observe how gradually the country improves as the distance from the province of holland and from the sea increases toward utrecht the gardens rise from the banks of the canal instead of spreading below its level and the grounds maintain avenues and plantations of lofty trees vegetation is stronger and more copious shrubs rise to a greater height meadows display a livelier green and the latticework of the bowery avenues which occur so frequently ceases to be more conspicuous than the foliage  it was whitsuntide and the banks of the canal were gay with holiday people riding in wagons and carts the latter frequently carrying a woman wearing a painted hat as large as an umbrella and a man with one in whimsical contrast clipped nearly close to the crown the lady sometimes refreshed herself with a fan and the gentleman meanwhile with a pipe of tobacco every village we passed resounded with hoarse music and the clatter of wooden shoes among these the prettiest was nieuversluys bordering each side of the canal with a white drawbridge picturesquely shadowed with high trees and green banks sloping to the waters brim pleasureboats and trechtschuyts lined the shores and the windows of every house were thronged with broad faces on the little terraces below were groups of smokers and of girls in the neat trim dutch dress with the fair complexion and air of decorous modesty by which their countrywomen are distinguished  about half way from amsterdam stands a small modern fortification and it is an instance of dutch carefulness that grass had just been mowed even from the parapets of the batteries and was made up in heaps within the works not far from it is an ancient castle of one tower left in the state to which it was reduced during the contest with the spaniards  near utrecht the ground has improved so much that nothing but its evenness distinguishes it from other countries and at some distance eastward the hills of guelderland rise to destroy this last difference the entrance into the city is between high terraces from which steps descend to the canal but the street is not wide enough to have its appearance improved by this sort of approach warehouses formed under the terraces show also that the latter have been raised more for convenience than splendor  the steeple of the great church formerly a cathedral excites in the mean time an expectation of dignity in the interior where some considerable streets and another canal complete the air of an opulent city it is not immediately seen that a great part of the body of this cathedral has been destroyed and that the canals being subject to tides have dirty walls during the ebb the splendor which might be expected in the capital of a province much inhabited by nobility does not appear nor is there perhaps any street equal to the best of leyden and haerlem yet in general beauty the city is superior to either of these  we arrived just before nine at which hour a bell rings to denote the shutting of the larger gates for the rules of a walled town are observed here though the fortifications could be of little other use than to prevent a surprise by horse the chateau danvers at which we lodged is an excellent inn with a landlord who tells that he has walked sixty years in his own passage and that he had the honor of entertaining the marquis of granby thirteen times during the war of      though the dutch inns are generally unobjectionable there is an air of english completeness about this which the others do not reach  utrecht is an university but with as little appearance of such an institution as leyden the students have no academical dress and their halls which are used only for lectures and exercises are formed in the cloisters of the ancient cathedral the chief sign of their residence in the place is that the householders who have lodgings to let write upon a board as is done at leyden cubicula locanda we were shown round the town by a member of the university who carefully avoided the halls and we did not press to see them  there are still some traces remaining of the bishopric which was once so powerful as to excite the jealousy or rather perhaps to tempt the avarice of charles the fifth who seized upon many of its possessions the use made of the remainder by the states general is scarcely more justifiable for the prebends still subsist and are disposed of by sale to lay canons who send delegates to the provincial states as if they had ecclesiastical characters  the substantial remains of the cathedral are one aisle in which divine service is performed and a lofty magnificent gothic tower that stands apart from it the ascent of this tower is one of the tasks prescribed to strangers and laborious as it is the view from the summit sufficiently rewards them a stone staircase steep narrow and winding after passing several grated doors leads into a floor which you hope is at the top but which is little more than half way up here the family of the belfryman fill several decently furnished apartments and show the great bell with several others the noise of which it might be supposed no human ears could bear as they must at the distance of only three or four yards after resting a few minutes in a room the windows of which command perhaps a more extensive land view than any other inhabited apartment in europe you begin the second ascent by a staircase still narrower and steeper and when you seem to be so weary as to be incapable of another step half the horizon suddenly bursts upon the view and all your meditated complaints are overborne by expressions of admiration  toward the west the prospect after including the rich plain of gardens near utrecht extends over the province of holland intersected with water speckled with towns and finally bounded by the sea the mists of which hide the low shores from the sight to the northward the zuyder zee spreads its haziness over amsterdam and naerden but from thence to the east the spires of amersfoort rhenen arnheim nimeguen and many intermediate towns are seen amongst the woods and hills that gradually rise toward germany southward the more mountainous district of cleves and then the level parts of guelderland and holland with the windings of the waal and the leck in which the rhine loses itself complete a circle of probably more than sixty miles diameter that strains the sight from this tremendous steeple the almost perpendicular view into the streets of utrecht affords afterward some relief to the eye but increases any notions of danger you may have had from observing that the openwork gothic parapet which alone prevents you from falling with dizziness has suffered something in the general decay of the church  while we were at the top the bells struck and between the giddiness communicated by the eye and the stunning effect of a sound that seemed to shake the steeple we were compelled to conclude sooner than had been intended this comprehensive and farewell prospect of holland  the mall which is esteemed the chief ornament of utrecht is perhaps the only avenue of the sort in europe still fit to be used for the game that gives its name to them all the several rows of noble trees include at the sides roads and walks but the center is laid out for the game of mall and though not often used is in perfect preservation it is divided so as to admit of two parties of players at once and the side boards sufficiently restrain spectators the mall in st jamess park was kept in the same state till      when the present great walk was formed over the part which was separated by similar side boards the length of that at utrecht is nearly three quarters of a mile the luxuriance and loftiness of the trees preserve a perspective much superior to that of st jamess but in the latter the whole breadth of the walks is greater and the view is more extensive as well as more ornamented  this city being a sort of capital to the neighboring nobility is called the politest in the united provinces and certainly abounds more than the others with the professions and trades which are subservient to splendor one practice observed in some degree in all the cities is most frequent here that of bows paid to all parties in which there are ladies by every gentleman who passes there are however no plays or other public amusements and the festivities or ceremonies by which other nations commemorate the happier events in their history are as unusual here as in the other parts of the united provinces where there are more occasions to celebrate and fewer celebrations than in most european countries music is very little cultivated in any of the cities and plays are to be seen only at amsterdam and the hague where german and dutch pieces are acted upon alternate nights at amsterdam a french operahouse has been shut up and at the hague a comedy and the actors ordered to leave the country  the ramparts of the city which are high and command extensive prospects are rather emblems of the peacefulness which it has long enjoyed than signs of any effectual resistance prepared for an enemy they are in many places regularly planted with trees which must be old enough to have been spared together with the mall by louis the fourteenth in others pleasure houses instead of batteries have been raised upon them a few pieces of old cannon are planted for the purpose of saluting the prince of orange when he passes the city  trechtschuyts go no further eastward than this place so that we hired a voituriers carriage a sort of curricle with a drivers box in front for the journey to nimeguen the price for thirtyeight or thirtynine miles was something more than a guinea and a half the horses were worth probably sixty pounds upon the spot and were as able as they were showy or they could not have drawn us through the deep sands that cover one third of the road  we were now speedily quitting almost every thing that is generally characteristic of dutch land the pastures were intermixed with fields of prosperous corn the best houses were surrounded by high woods and the grounds were separated by hedges instead of water where any sort of partition was used windmills were seldom seen and those only for corn but these improvements in the appearance of the country were accompanied by many symptoms of a diminished prosperity among the people in eightandthirty miles there was not one considerable town a space which in the province of holland would probably have included three opulent cities several extensive villages and ranges of mansions erected by merchants and manufacturers  wyk de duerstede the first town in the road is distinguishable at some distance by the shattered tower of its church a monument of the desolation spread by the spaniards the inhabitants probably intending that it should remain as a lesson to posterity have not attempted to restore it further than to place some stones over the part filled by the clock the body of the church and the remainder of the tower are not deficient of gothic dignity the town itself consists of one or two wide streets not well filled either with inhabitants or houses  the road here turns to the eastward and is led along the right bank of the leck one of the branches of the rhine upon a raised mound or dique sometimes twenty or thirty feet above the river on the one side and the plains on the other small posts each numbered are placed along this road at unequal distances for no other use which we could discover than to enable the surveyors to report exactly where the mound may want repairs the carriage way is formed of a deep sand which we were very glad to leave by crossing the river at a ferry though this road had given us a sine view of its course and of some stately vessels pressing against the stream on their voyage to germany  on the other side the road went further from the river though we continued to skirt it occasionally as far as a small ferryhouse opposite to rhenen at which we dined while the horses rested under a shed built over the road as weigh houses are at our turnpikes rhenen is a walled town built upon an ascent from the water and appears to have two or three neat streets  having dined in a room where a table large enough for twenty persons was placed on one side and a line of four or five beds covered by one long curtain was formed against the wainscot on the other the voiturier clamoured that the gates of nimeguen would be shut before we could get to them and we soon began to cross the country between the leck and the waal another branch of the rhine which in guelderland divides itself into so many channels that none can be allowed the preeminence of retaining its name soon after reaching the right bank of the waal the road affords a view of the distant towers of nimeguen which appear there to be very important standing upon a brow that seems to front the whole stream of the river in the way we passed several noble estates with mansions built in the castellated form which james the first introduced into england instead of the more fortified residences and there was a sufficient grandeur of woods and avenues to show that there might be parks if the owners had the taste to form them between the avenues the gilded ornaments of the roof and the peaked coverings placed in summer over the chimneys glittered to the light and showed the fantastic style of the architecture so exactly copied in flemish landscapes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries  as the sun declined and we drew near nimeguen the various coloring of a scene more rich than extensive rendered its effect highly interesting the wide waal on our left reflecting the evening blush and a vessel whose full sails caught a yellow gleam from the west the ramparts and pointed roofs of nimeguen rising over each other just tinted by the vapor that ascended from the bay below the faint and fainter blue of two ridges of hills in germany retiring in the distance with the mellow green of nearer woods and meadows formed a combination of hues surprisingly gay and beautiful but nimeguen lost much of its dignity on a nearer approach for many of the towers which the treachery of fancy had painted at distance changed into forms less picturesque and its situation which a bold sweep of the waal had represented to be on a rising peninsula crowning the flood was found to be only on a steep beside it the ramparts however the high old tower of the citadel the belvidere with the southern gate of the town beneath composed part of an interesting picture on the opposite margin of the river but there was very little time to observe it the driver saw the flying bridge making its last voyage for the night toward our shore and likely to return in about twenty minutes he therefore drove furiously along the high bank of the river and turning the angle of the two roads with a velocity which would have done honor to a brentford postillion entered that adjoining the first half of the bridge and showed the directors of the other half that we were to be part of their cargo  this bridge which is partly laid over boats and partly over two barges that float from the boats to the shore is so divided because the stream is occasionally too rapid to permit an entire range of boats between the two banks it is thus for one half a bridge of boats and for the other a flying bridge which last part is capable of containing several carriages and joins to the other so exactly as not to occasion the least interruption it is also railed for the safety of foot passengers of whom there are commonly twenty or thirty the price for a carriage is something about twentypence which the tollmen carefully collect as soon as the demibridge has begun its voyage  nimeguen has toward the water little other fortification than an ancient brick wall and a gate though it is a garrison town and certainly no trifling object we were not detained at the gate by troublesome ceremonies the commander affecting no unnecessary carefulness is satisfied with a copy of the report which the innkeepers in all the towns send to the magistrates of the names and conditions of their guests a printed paper is usually brought up after supper in which you are asked to write your name addition residence how long you intend to stay and to whom you are known in the province we did not show a passport in holland  the town has an abrupt but short elevation from the river which you ascend by a narrow but clean street opening into a spacious marketplace the great church and the guardhouse are on one side of this from the other a street runs to the eastern gate of the town formed in the old wall beyond which commence the modern and strong fortifications that defend it on the land side at the eastern extremity of the place a small mall leads to the house in which the prince of orange resided during the troubles of      and beyond it on a sudden promontory toward the river stands a prospect house called the belvidere which from its eastern and southern windows commands a long view into germany and to the north looks over guelderland from this place all the fortifications which are very extensive are plainly seen and a military person might estimate their strength there are several forts and outworks and though the ditch is pallisadoed instead of filled the place must be capable of a considerable defense unless the besieging army should be masters of the river and the opposite bank there was formerly a fortress upon this bank which was often won and lost during the sieges of nimeguen but no remains of it are visible now  the town is classic ground to those who venerate the efforts by which the provinces were rescued from the dominion of the spaniards it was first attempted by sengius a commander in the earl of leicesters army who proposed to enter it at night from the river through a house which was to be opened to him but his troops by mistake entered another where a large company was collected on occasion of a wedding and being thus discovered to the garrison great numbers of those already landed upon the beach were put to the sword or drowned in the confusion of the retreat an attempt by prince maurice to surprise it was defeated by the failure of a petard applied to one of the gates but it was soon after taken by a regular siege carried on chiefly from the other side of the river this and the neighboring fortress of grave were among the places first taken by louis the fourteenth during his invasion having been left without sufficient garrisons  the citadel a remnant of the ancient fortifications is near the eastern gate which appears to be thought stronger than the others for on this side also is the arsenal  nimeguen has been compared to nottingham which it resembles more in situation than in structure though many of the streets are steep and the windows of one range of houses sometimes overlook the chimnies of another the views also as from some parts of nottingham are over a green and extensive level rising into distant hills and here the comparison ends the houses are built entirely in the dutch fashion with many colored painted fronts terminating in peaked roofs but some decline of neatness may be observed by those who arrive here from the province of holland the marketplace though gay and large cannot be compared with that of nottingham in extent nor is the town more than half the size of the latter though it is said to contain nearly fifty thousand inhabitants from almost every part of it you have however a glimpse of the surrounding landscape which is more extensive than that seen from nottingham and is adorned by the sweeps of a river of much greater dignity than the trent  we left nimeguen in the afternoon with a voiturier whose price according to the ordonnatic was higher than if we had set out half an hour sooner upon the supposition that he could not return that night the road lies through part of the fortifications concerning which there can of course be no secrecy it then enters an extensive plain and runs almost parallel to a range of heights at the extremity of which nimeguen stands and presents an appearance of still greater strength and importance than when seen from the westward  after a few miles this road leaves the territories of the united provinces and enters the prussian duchy of cleves at a spot where a mill is in one country and the millers house in the other an instance of difference between the conditions of the people in the two countries was observable even at this passage of their boundary our postillion bought at the millers a loaf of black bread such as is not made in the dutch provinces and carried it away for the food of his horses which were thus initiated into some of the blessings of the german peasantry after another quarter of a mile you have more proofs that you have entered the country of the king of prussia from almost every cluster of huts barefooted children run out to beg and ten or a dozen stand at every gate nearly throwing themselves under the wheels to catch your money which every now and then the bigger seize from the less  yet the land is not illcultivated the distinction between the culture of land in free and arbitrary countries was indeed never very apparent to us who should have been ready enough to perceive it the great landholders know what should be done and the peasantry are directed to do it the latter are perhaps supplied with stock and the grounds produce as much as elsewhere though you may read in the looks and manners of the people that very little of its productions is for them  approaching nearer to cleves we traveled on a ridge of heights and were once more cheared with the pomp of groves between the branches were delightful catches of extensive landscapes varied with hills clothed to their summits with wood where frequently the distant spires of a town peeped out most picturesquely the open vales between were chiefly spread with corn and such a prospect of undulating ground and of hills tufted with the grandeur of forests was inexpressibly chearing to eyes fatigued by the long view of level countries  at a few miles from cleves the road enters the park and a close avenue of noble planetrees when these prospects are for a while excluded the first opening is where on one hand a second avenue commences and on the other a sort of broad bay in the woods which were planted by prince maurice includes an handsome house now converted into an inn which owing to the pleasantness of the situation and its vicinity to a mineral spring is much frequented in summer a statue of general martin schenck of dark bronze in complete armor and with the beaver down is raised upon a lofty ionic column in the center of the avenue before the house resting upon a lance the figure seems to look down upon the passenger and to watch over the scene with the sternness of an ancient knight it appears to be formed with remarkable skill and has an air more striking and grand than can be readily described  the orangerie of the palace is still preserved together with a semicircular pavilion in a recess of the woods through which an avenue of two miles leads you to  cleves this place which being the capital of a duchy is entitled a city consists of some irregular streets built upon the brow of a steep hill it is walled but cannot be mentioned as fortified having no solid works the houses are chiefly built of stone and there is a little of dutch cleanliness but the marks of decay are strongly impressed upon them and on the ancient walls what little trade there is exists in retailing goods sent from holland the dutch language and coins are in circulation here almost as much as the german  the established religion of the town is protestant but here is an almost universal toleration and the catholics have several churches and monasteries cleves has suffered a various fate in the sport of war during many centuries but has now little to distinguish it except the beauty of its prospects which extend into guelderland and the province of holland over a country enriched with woody hills and valleys of corn and pasturage  being convinced in two or three hours that there was nothing to require a longer stay we set out for xanten a town in the same duchy distant about eighteen miles for nearly the whole of this length the road lay through a broad avenue which frequently entered a forest of oak fir elm and majestic planetrees and emerged from it only to wind along its skirts the views then opened over a country diversified with gentle hills and ornamented by numberless spires upon the heights every small town having several convents the castle of eltenberg on the summit of a wooded mountain was visible during the whole of this stage and part of the next days journey yet the fewness or the poverty of the inhabitants appeared from our meeting only one chaise and two or three small carts for eighteen miles of the only highroad in the country  it was a fine evening in june and the rich lights thrown among the forest glades with the solitary calmness of the scene and the sereneness of the air filled with scents from the woods were circumstances which persuaded to such tranquil rapture as collins must have felt when he had the happiness to address to evening  for when thy folding star arising shows his paly circlet at his warning lamp the fragrant hours and elves who slept in buds the day and many a nymph who wreaths her brows with sedge and sheds the freshning dew and lovelier still the pensive pleasures sweet prepare thy shadowy car   a small halfway village a stately convent with its gardens called marienbaum founded in the   th century by maria duchess of cleves and a few mud cottages of the woodcutters were the only buildings on the road the foot passengers were two prussian soldiers it was moonlight and we became impatient to reach xanten long before our driver could say in a mixture of german and dutch that we were near it at length from the woods that had concealed the town a few lights appeared over the walls and dissipated some gloomy fancies about a night to be passed in a forest  xanten this is a small town near the rhine without much appearance of prosperity but neater than most of the others around it several narrow streets open into a wide and pleasant marketplace in the center of which an old but flourishing elm has its branches carefully extended by a circular railing to form an arbor over benches a cathedral that proves the town to have been once more considerable is on the north side of this place a fine building which shown by the moon of a summer midnight when only the bell of the adjoining convent calling the monks to prayers and the waving of the aged tree were to be heard presented a scene before the windows of our inn that fully recompensed for its want of accommodation  there were also humbler reasons toward contentment for the people of the house were extremely desirous to afford it and the landlord was an orator in french of which and his address he was pleasantly vain he received us with an air of humor mingled with his complaisance and hoped that as monsieur was anglois he should surprise him with his vin extraordinaire all the rhenish wine being adulterated by the dutch before they sent it to england his house could not be fine because he had little money but he had an excellent cook otherwise it could not be expected that the prebendaries of the cathedral would dine at it every day and become as they were vraiment monsieur gros comme vous me voyez  there are in this small town several monasteries and one convent of noble canonesses of which last the members are few and the revenues very great the interior of the cathedral is nearly as grand as the outside and mass is performed in it with more solemnity than in many which have larger institutions  we left xanten the next morning in high spirits expecting to reach cologne which was little more than fifty miles distant before night though the landlord and the postmaster hinted that we should go no further than neuss this was our first use of the german post the slowness of which though it has been so often described we had not estimated the day was intensely hot and the road unsheltered by trees lay over deep sands that reflected the rays the refreshing forests of yesterday we now severely regretted and watched impatiently to catch a freer air from the summit of every hill on the way the postillion would permit his horses to do little more than walk and every step threw up heaps of dust into the chaise it had been so often said by travelers that money has as little effect in such cases as entreaties or threats that we supposed this slowness irremediable which was really intended only to produce an offer of what we would willingly have given  rheinberg in something more than three hours we reached rheinberg distant about nine miles a place often mentioned in the military history of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and which we had supposed would at least gratify us by the show of magnificent ruins together with some remains of its former importance it is a wretched place of one dirty street and three or four hundred mean houses surrounded by a decayed wall that never was grand and half filled by inhabitants whose indolence while it is probably more to be pitied than blamed accounts for the sullenness and wretchedness of their appearance not one symptom of labor or comfort was to be perceived in the whole town the men seemed for the most part to be standing at their doors in unbuckled shoes and woollen caps what few women we saw were brown without the appearance of health which their leanness and dirtiness prevented some small shops of hucksters wares were the only signs of trade  the inn that seemed to be the best was such as might be expected in a remote village in a cross road in england the landlord was standing before the door in his cap and remained there some time after we had found the way into a sitting room and from thence for want of attendance into a kitchen where two women without stockings were watching over some sort of cookery in earthen jugs we were supplied at length with bread butter and sour wine and did not suffer ourselves to consider this as any specimen of german towns because rheinberg was not a station of the post a delusion the spirit of which continued through several weeks for we were always finding reasons to believe that the wretchedness of present places and persons was produced by some circumstances which would not operate in other districts  this is the condition of a town which in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was thought important enough to be five times attacked by large armies farnese the spanish commander was diverted from his attempt upon it by the necessity of relieving zutphen then besieged by the earl of leceister in      the marquis of varambon invested it for the spaniards by order of the prince of parma but it was relieved by our colonel vere who after a long battle completely defeated the spanish army in      when it was attacked by mendoza a magazine caught fire the governor his family and a part of the garrison were buried in the ruins of a tower and the explosion sunk several vessels in the rhine after which the remainder of the garrison surrendered the place the prince of orange retook it in      four years afterward the spaniards attempted to surprise it in the night but the deputy governor and others who perceived that the garrison could not be immediately collected passed the walls and pretending to be deserters mingled with the enemy whom they persuaded to delay the attack for a few minutes the troops within were in the mean time prepared for their defense and succeeded in it but the governor with two officers and fifteen soldiers who had accompanied him being discovered were killed all these contests were for a place not belonging to either party being in the electorate of cologne but which was valuable to both for its neighborhood to their frontiers  beyond rheinberg our prospects were extensive but not so woody or so rich as those of the day before and few villages enlivened the landscape open corn lands intermixed with fields of turnips spread to a considerable distance on both sides on the east the high ridges of the westphalian mountains shut up the scene the rhine which frequently swept near the road showed a broad surface though shrunk within its sandy shores by the dryness of the season not a single vessel animated its current which was here tame and smooth though often interrupted by sands that rose above its level  hoogstrass the next town was hoogstrass a post station fifteen miles from xanten of which we saw little more than the inn the other part of this small place being out of the road a large house which might have been easily made convenient and was really not without plenty confirmed our notion that at the post stages there would always be some accommodation we dined here and were well attended the landlord a young man who had served in the army of the country and appeared by his dress to have gained some promotion was very industrious in the house during this interval of his other employments  the next stage was of eighteen miles which make a german post and an half and during this space we passed by only one town ordingen or urdingen the greatest part of which spread between the road and the rhine  toward evening the country became more woody and the slender spires of convents frequently appeared sheltered in their groves and surrounded by corn lands of their own domain one of these nearer to the road was a noble mansion and with its courts offices and gardens spread over a considerable space a summer house built over the garden wall had no windows toward the road but there were several small apertures which looked upon it and beyond to a large tract of enclosed wood the property of the convent  neuss soon after sunset we came to neuss which as it is a post town and was mentioned as far off as xanten we had been sure would afford a comfortable lodging whether there were any vestiges or not of its ancient and modern history the view of it at some little distance did not altogether contradict this notion for it stands upon a gentle ascent and the spires of several convents might justly give ideas of a considerable town to those who had not learned how slightly such symptoms are to be attended to in germany  on each side of the gate cannon balls of various sizes remain in the walls within you enter immediately into a close street of high but dirty stone houses from which you expect to escape presently supposing it to be only some wretched quarter appropriated to disease and misfortune you see no passengers but at the door of every house an haggard group of men and women stare upon you with looks of hungry rage rather than curiosity and their gaunt figures excite at first more fear than pity continuing to look for the better quarter and to pass between houses that seem to have been left after a siege and never entered since the other gate of the town at length appears which you would rather pass at midnight than stop at any place yet perceived within a small distance of the gate there is however a house with a wider front and windows of unshattered glass and walls not quite as black as the others which is known to be the inn only because the driver stops there for according to the etiquette of sullenness in germany the people of the house make no show of receiving you  if it had not already appeared that there was no other inn you might learn it from the manners of the two hostesses and their servants some sort of accommodation is however to be had and those who have been longer from the civilities and assiduities of similar places in england may by more submission and more patience obtain it sooner than we did by these means they may reduce all their difficulties into one that of determining whether the windows shall be open or shut whether they will endure the closeness of the rooms or will admit air loaded with the feculence of putrid kennels that stagnate along the whole town  this is the novesium of tacitus the entrance of the thirteenth legion into which he relates at a time when the rhine incognita illi coelo siccitate became vix navium patiens and which vocula was soon after compelled to surrender by the treachery of other leaders and the corruption of his army whom he addressed just before his murder in the fine speech beginning  nunquam apud vos verba feci aut pro vobis solicitior aut pro me securior a passage so near to the cunctisque timentem securumque sui by which lucan describes cato that it must be supposed to have been inspired by it  this place stood a siege for twelve months against  0000 men commanded by charles the bold duke of burgundy and succeeded in its resistance but in      when it held out for gebhert de trusches an elector of cologne expelled by his chapter for having married it was the scene of a dreadful calamity farnese the spanish general who had just taken venlo marched against it with an army enraged at having lost the plunder of that place by a capitulation when the inhabitants of neuss were upon the point of surrendering it upon similar terms the army resolving not to lose another prey of blood and gold rushed to the assault set fire to the place and murdered all the inhabitants except a few women and children who took refuge in two churches which alone were saved from the flames  when the first shock of the surprise indignation and pity excited by the mention of such events is overcome we are of course anxious to ascertain whether the perpetrators of them were previously distinguished by a voluntary entrance into situations that could be supposed to mark their characters this was the army of philip the second the soldiers were probably for the most part forced into the service the officers of whom only two are related to have opposed the massacre could not have been so  what was then the previous distinction of the officers of philip the second but it is not proper to enter into a discussion here of the nature of their employment  neuss was rebuilt on the same spot the situation being convenient for an intercourse with the eastern shore of the rhine especially with dusseldorff to which it is nearly opposite the ancient walls were partly restored by the french in   0  one of the churches spared by the spaniards was founded by a daughter of charlemagne in the ninth century and is now attached to the chapter of noble ladies of st quirin besides which there are a chapter of canons and five or six convents in the place  cologne from neuss hither we passed through a deep sandy road that sometimes wound near the rhine the shores of which were yet low and the water tame and shallow there were no vessels upon it to give one ideas either of the commerce or the population of its banks  the country for the greater part of twenty miles was a flat of corn lands but within a short distance of cologne a gentle rise affords a view of the whole city whose numerous towers and steeples had before appeared and of the extensive plains that spread round it in the southern perspective of these at the distance of about eight leagues rise the fantastic forms of what are called the seven mountains westward are the cultivated hills that extend toward flanders and eastward over the rhine the distant mountains that run through several countries of interior germany over the wild and gigantic features of the seven mountains dark thunder mists soon spread an awful obscurity and heightened the expectation which this glimpse of them had awakened concerning the scenery we were approaching  the appearance of cologne at the distance of one or two miles is not inferior to the conception which a traveller may have already formed of one of the capitals of germany should his mind have obeyed that almost universal illusion of fancy which dresses up the images of places unseen as soon as much expectation or attention is directed toward them the air above is crowded with the towers and spires of churches and convents among which the cathedral with its huge unfinished mass has a striking appearance the walls are also high enough to be observed and their whole enclosure seems at a distance to be thickly filled with buildings  we should have known ourselves to be in the neighborhood of some place larger than usual from the sight of two or three carriages at once on the road nearly the first we had seen in germany there is besides some show of labor in the adjoining villages but the sallow countenances and miserable air of the people prove that it is not a labor beneficial to them the houses are only the desolated homes of these villagers for there is not one that can be supposed to belong to any prosperous inhabitant of the city or to afford the coveted stillness in which the active find an occasional reward and the idle a perpetual misery  a bridge over a dry fosse leads to the northern gate on each side of which a small modern battery defends the ancient walls the city is not fortified according to any present sense of the term but is surrounded by these walls and by a ditch of which the latter near the northern gate serves as a sort of kitchen garden to the inhabitants  before passing the inner gate a soldier demanded our names and we showed our passport for the first time but as the inquisitor did not understand french in which language passports from england are written it was handed to his comrades who formed a circle about our chaise and began with leaden looks to spell over the paper some talked in the mean time of examining the baggage and the money which we gave to prevent this being in various pieces and in prussian coin which is not perfectly understood here the whole party turned from the passport counting and estimating the money in the hand of their collector as openly as if it had been a legal tribute when this was done and they had heard with surprise that we had not determined where to lodge being inclined to take the pleasantest inn we wrote our names in the corporals dirty book and were allowed to drive under a dark tower into the city  instantly the narrow street gloomy houses stagnant kennels and wretchedly looking people reminded us of the horrors of neuss the lower windows of these prisonlike houses are so strongly barricadoed that we had supposed the first two or three to be really parts of a gaol but it soon appeared that this profusion of heavy iron work was intended to exclude not to confine robbers a succession of narrow streets in which the largest houses were not less disgusting than the others for the filthiness of their windows doorways and massy walls continued through half the city in one of these streets or lanes the postillion stopped at the door of an inn which he said was the best but the suffocating air of the street rendered it unnecessary to enquire whether contrary to appearances there could be any accommodation within and as we had read of many squares or marketplaces he was desired to stop at an inn situated in one of these thus we came to the hotel de prague a large straggling building said to be not worse than the others for wanting half its furniture and probably superior to them by having a landlord of better than german civility  having counted from our windows the spires of ten or twelve churches or convents we were at leisure to walk farther into the city and to look for the spacious squares neat streets noble public buildings and handsome houses which there could be no doubt must be found in an imperial and electoral city seated on the rhine at a point where the chief roads from holland and flanders join those of germany treated by all writers as a considerable place and evidently by its situation capable of becoming a sort of emporium for the three countries the spot into which our inn opened though a parallelogram of considerable extent bordered by lime trees we passed quickly through perceiving that the houses on all its sides were mean buildings and therefore such as could not deserve the attention in the imperial and electoral city of cologne there are streets from each angle of this place and we pursued them all in their turn narrow winding and dirty as they are pestilent with kennels gloomy from the height and blackness of the houses unadorned by any public buildings except the churches that were grand or by one private dwelling that appeared to be clean with little show of traffic and less of passengers either busy or gay till we saw them ending in other streets still worse or concluded by the gates of the city one of them indeed led through a marketplace in which the air is free from the feculence of the streets but which is inferior to the other opening in space and not better surrounded by buildings  these diminutive observations seem to take away something from the dignity of writing and therefore are never communicated but with hesitation and a little fear of abasement and contempt dr samuel johnson  and it is not only because they take away something from the dignity of writing that such observations are withheld to be thought capable of commanding more pleasures and preventing more inconveniences than others is a too general passport to respect and in the ordinary affairs of life for one that will show somewhat less prosperity than he has in order to try who will really respect him thousands exert themselves to assume an appearance of more which they might know can procure only the mockery of esteem for themselves and the reality of it for their supposed conditions authors are not always free from a willingness to receive the fallacious sort of respect that attaches to accidental circumstances for the real sort of which it would be more reasonable to be proud a man relating part of the history of his life which is always necessarily done by a writer of travels does not choose to show that his course could lie through any scenes deficient of delights or that if it did he was not enough elevated by his friends importance fortune fame or business to be incapable of observing them minutely the curiosities of cabinets and of courts are therefore exactly described and as much of every occurrence as does not show the relater moving in any of the plainer walks of life but the difference between the stock of physical comforts in different countries the character of conditions if the phrase may be used such as it appears in the ordinary circumstances of residence dress food cleanliness opportunities of relaxation in short the information which all may gain is sometimes left to be gained by all not from the book but from travel a writer issuing into the world makes up what he mistakes for his best appearance and is continually telling his happiness or showing his good humor as people in a promenade always smile and always look round to observe whether they are seen smiling the politest salutation of the chinese when they meet is sir prosperity is painted on your countenance or your whole air announces your felicity and the writers of travels especially since the censure thrown upon smollet seem to provide that their prosperity shall be painted on their volumes and all their observations announce their felicity  cologne though it bears the name of the electorate by which it is surrounded is an imperial city and the elector as to temporal affairs has very little jurisdiction within it the government has an affectation of being formed upon the model of republican rome a form certainly not worthy of imitation but which is as much disgraced by this burlesque of it as ancient statues are by the gilding and the wigs with which they are said to be sometimes arrayed by modern hands there is a senate of fortynine persons who being returned at different times of the year are partly nominated by the remaining members and partly chosen by twentytwo tribes of burgesses or rather by so many companies of traders of six burgomasters two are in office every third year and when these appear in public they are preceded by lictors bearing fasces surmounted by their own arms each of the tribes or companies has a president and the twentytwo presidents form a council which is authorized to enquire into the conduct of the senate but the humbleness of the burgesses in their individual condition has virtually abolished all this scheme of a political constitution without some of the intelligence and personal independence which are but little consistent with the general poverty and indolence of german traders nothing but the forms of any constitution can be preserved long after the virtual destruction of it has been meditated by those in a better condition the greater part of these companies of traders having in fact no trade which can place them much above the rank of menial servants to their rich customers the design that their council shall check the senate and the senate direct the burgomasters has now of course little effect and this or a still humbler condition is that of several cities in germany called free and independent in which the neighboring sovereigns have scarcely less authority though with something more of circumstance than in their own dominions  the constitution of cologne permits indeed some direct interference of the elector for the tribunal of appeal which is the supreme court of law is nominated by him he has otherwise no direct power within the city and being forbidden to reside there more than three days successively he does not even retain a palace but is contented with a suite of apartments reserved for his use at an inn that this exclusion is no punishment those who have ever passed two days at cologne will admit and it can tend very little to lessen his influence for the greatest part of his personal expenditure must reach the merchants of the place and the officers of several of his territorial jurisdictions make part of the inhabitants his residences with which he is remarkably well provided are at bonn at bruhl a palace between cologne and that place at poppelsdorff which is beyond it at herzogs freud an hunting seat and in munster of which he is the bishop  the duties of customs and excise are imposed by the magistrates of the city and these enable them to pay their contributions to the germanic fund for though such cities are formally independent of the neighboring princes and nobility they are not so of the general laws or expenses of the empire in the diet of which they have some small share fortynine cities being allowed to send two representatives and thus to have two votes out of an hundred and thirtysix these duties of both sorts are very high at cologne and the first form a considerable part of the interruptions which all the states upon the rhine give to the commerce of that river here also commodities intended to be carried beyond the city by water must be reshipped for in order to provide cargoes for the boatmen of the place vessels from the lower parts of the rhine are not allowed to ascend beyond cologne and those from the higher parts cannot descend it farther they may indeed reload with other cargoes for their return and as they constantly do so the cologne boatmen are not much benefited by the regulation but the transfer of the goods employs some hands subjects them better to the inspection of the customhouse officers and makes it necessary for the merchants of places on both sides trading with each other to have intermediate correspondents here yet notwithstanding all this aggression upon the freedom of trade cologne is less considerable as a port than some dutch towns never mentioned in a book and is inferior perhaps to half the minor seaports in england we could not find more than thirty vessels of burden against the quay all mean and illbuilt except the dutch which are very large and being constructed purposely for a tedious navigation contain apartments upon the deck for the family of the skipper well furnished and so commodious as to have four or five sashed windows on each side generally gay with flowerpots little flowergardens too sometimes formed upon the roof of the cabin increase the domestic comforts of the skipper and the neatness of his vessel can perhaps be equalled only by that of a dutch house in a time of perfect peace there is no doubt more traffic but from what we saw of the general means and occasions of commerce in germany we cannot suppose it to be much reduced by war wealthy and commercial countries may be injured immensely by making war either for germany or against it by too much friendship or too much enmity but germany itself cannot be proportionately injured with them except when it is the scene of actual violence englishmen who feel as they always must the love of their own country much increased by the view of others should be induced at every step to wish that there may be as little political intercourse as possible either of friendship or enmity between the blessings of their island and the wretchedness of the continent  our inn had formerly been a convent and was in a part of the town where such societies are more numerous than elsewhere at five oclock on the sunday after our arrival the bells of churches and convents began to sound on all sides and there was scarcely any entire intermission of them till evening the places of public amusement chiefly a sort of teagardens were then set open and in many streets the sound of music and dancing was heard almost as plainly as that of the bells had been before a disgusting excess of licentiousness which appeared in other instances for we heard at the same time the voices of a choir on one side of the street and the noise of a billiard table on the other near the inn this contrast was more observable while the strains of revelry arose from an adjoining garden into which our windows opened a pause in the music allowed us to catch some notes of the vesper service performing in a convent of the order of clarisse only three or four doors beyond of the severe rules of this society we had been told in the morning the members take a vow not only to renounce the world but their dearest friends and are never after permitted to see even their fathers or mothers though they may sometimes converse with the latter from behind a curtain and lest some lingering remains of filial affection should tempt an unhappy nun to lift the veil of separation between herself and her mother she is not allowed to speak even with her but in the presence of the abbess accounts of such horrible perversions of human reason make the blood thrill and the teeth chatter their fathers they can never speak to for no man is suffered to be in any part of the convent used by the sisterhood nor indeed is admitted beyond the gate except when there is a necessity for repairs when all the votaries of the order are previously secluded it is not easily that a cautious mind becomes convinced of the existence of such severe orders when it does astonishment at the artificial miseries which the ingenuity of human beings forms for themselves by seclusion is as boundless as at the other miseries with which the most trivial vanity and envy so frequently pollute the intercourses of social life the poor nuns thus nearly entombed during their lives are after death tied upon a board in the clothes they die in and with only their veils thrown over the face are buried in the garden of the convent  during this day trinity sunday processions were passing on all sides most of them attended by some sort of martial music many of the parishes of which there are nineteen paraded with their officers and the burgesses who are distributed into eight corpse under a supposition that they could and would defend the city if it was attacked presented their captains at the churches the host accompanied all these processions a party of the city guards followed and forty or fifty persons out of uniform the representatives probably of the burgesses who are about six thousand succeeded besides the guards there was only one man in uniform who in the burlesque dress of a drummajor entertained the populace by a kind of extravagant marching dance in the middle of the procession our companion would not tell us that this was the captain  the cathedral though unfinished is conspicuous amongst a great number of churches for the dignity of some detached features that show part of the vast design formed for the whole it was begun in      by the elector conrad who is related in an hexameter inscription over a gate to have laid the first stone himself in    0 the choir was finished and the workmen continued to be employed upon the other parts in      when of two towers destined to be   0 feet above the roof one had risen    feet and the other   0 feet according to the measurement mentioned in a printed description we did not learn at what period the design of completing the edifice was abandoned but the original founder lived to see all the treasures expended which he had collected for the purpose in its present state the inequality of its vast towers renders it a striking object at a considerable distance and from the large unfilled area around it the magnificence of its gothic architecture especially of some parts which have not been joined to the rest and appear to be the ruined remains rather than the commencement of a work is viewed with awful delight  in the interior of the cathedral a fine choir leads to an altar of black marble raised above several steps which being free from the incongruous ornaments usual in romish churches is left to impress the mind by its majestic plainness the tall painted windows above of which there are six are superior in richness of coloring and design to any we ever saw beyond even those in the chapter house at york and most resembling the very fine ones in the cathedral of canterbury the nave is deformed by a low wooden roof which appears to have been intended only as a temporary covering and should certainly be succeeded by one of equal dignity to the vast columns placed for its support whether the other parts of the original design can ever be completed or not  by some accident we did not see the tomb of the three kings of jerusalem whose bodies are affirmed to have been brought here from milan in      when the latter city was destroyed by the emperor frederic barbarossa their boasted treasures of golden crowns and diamonds pass of course without our estimation  a description of the churches in cologne set out with good antiquarian minuteness would fill volumes the whole number of churches chapters and chapels which last are by far the most numerous is not less than eighty and none are without an history of two or three centuries they are all opened on sundays and we can believe that the city may contain as is asserted  0000 souls for nearly all that we saw were well attended in one indeed the congregation consisted only of two or three females kneeling at a great distance from the altar with an appearance of the utmost intentness upon the service and abstraction from the noise of the processions that could be easily heard within they were entirely covered with a loose black drapery whether for penance or not we did not hear in the cathedral a figure in the same attitude was rendered more interesting by her situation beneath the broken arches and shattered fretwork of a painted window through which the rays of the sun scarcely penetrated to break the shade she had chosen  several of the chapels are not much larger than an ordinary apartment but they are higher that the nuns of some adjoining convent may have a gallery where veiled from observation by a lawn curtain their voices often mingle sweetly with the choir there are thirtynine convents of women and nineteen of men which are supposed to contain about fifteen hundred persons the chapters of which some are noble and extremely opulent support nearly four hundred more and there are said to be upon the whole between two and three thousand persons under religious denominations in cologne walls of convents and their gardens appear in every street but do not attract notice unless as frequently happens their bell sounds while you are passing some of their female inhabitants may be seen in various parts of the city for there is an order the members of which are employed by rotation in teaching children and attending the sick those of the noble chapters are little more confined than if they were with their own families being permitted to visit their friends to appear at balls and promenades to wear what dresses they please except when they chaunt in the choir and to quit the chapter if the offer of an acceptable marriage induces their families to authorize it but their own admission into the chapter proves them to be noble by sixteen quarterings or four generations and the offer must be from a person of equal rank or their descendants could not be received into similar chapters an important circumstance in the affairs of the german noblesse  some of these ladies we saw in the church of their convent their habits were remarkably graceful robes of lawn and black silk flowed from the shoulder whence a quilled ruff somewhat resembling that of queen elizabeths time spread round the neck the hair was in curls without powder and in the english fashion their voices were peculiarly sweet and they sung the responses with a kind of plaintive tenderness that was extremely interesting  the jesuits church is one of the grandest in cologne and has the greatest display of paintings over its numerous altars as well as of marble pillars the churches of the chapters are for the most part very large and endowed with the richest ornaments which are however not shown to the public except upon days of fete we do not remember to have seen that of the chapter of st ursula where heads and other relics are said to be handed to you from shelves like books in a library nor that of the convent of jacobins where some mss and other effects of albert the great bishop of ratisbon are among the treasures of the monks  opposite to the jesuits church was an hospital for wounded soldiers several of whom were walking in the court yard before it halfcloathed in dirty woollen through which the bare arms of many appeared sickness and neglect had subdued all the symptoms of a soldier and it was impossible to distinguish the wounded french from the others though we were assured that several of that nation were in the crowd the windows of the hospital were filled with figures still more wretched there was a large assemblage of spectators who looked as if they were astonished to see that war is compounded of something else besides the glories of which it is so easy to be informed  the soldiery of cologne are under the command of the magistrates and are employed only within the gates of the city the whole body does not exceed an hundred and fifty whom we saw reviewed by their colonel in the place before the hotel de prague the uniform is red faced with white the men wear whiskers and affect an air of ferocity but appear to be mostly invalids who have grown old in their guardhouses  protestants though protected in their persons are not allowed the exercise of their religion within the walls of the city but have a chapel in a village on the other side of the rhine as some of the chief merchants and those who are most useful to the inhabitants are of the reformed church they ventured lately to request that they might have a place of worship within the city but they received the common answer which opposes all sort of improvement religious or civil that though the privilege in itself might be justly required it could not be granted because they would then think of asking something more  the government of cologne in ecclesiastical affairs is with the elector as archbishop and the chapter as his council in civil matters though the city constitution is of little effect the real power is not so constantly with him as might be supposed those who have influence being sometimes out of his interest conversation as we were told was scarcely less free than in holland where there is justly no opposition to any opinion however improper or absurd except from the reason of those who hear it on that account and because of its easy intercourse with brussels and spa this city is somewhat the resort of strangers by whom such conversation is perhaps chiefly carried on but those must come from very wretched countries who can find pleasure in a residence at cologne  amongst the public buildings must be reckoned the theater of which we did not see the inside there being no performance during our stay except on sunday this it seems may be opened without offense to the magistrates though a protestant church may not it stands in a row of small houses from which it is distinguished only by a painted front once tawdry and now dirty with the inscription  musis gratiisque decentibus the townhouse is an awkward and irregular stone building the arsenal which is in one of the narrowest streets we should have passed without notice if it had not been pointed out to us as a building it is nothing more than such as might be formed out of four or five of the plainest houses laid into one its contents are said to be chiefly ancient arms of various fashions and sizes not very proper for modern use  bonn after a stay of nearly three tedious days we left cologne for bonn passing through an avenue of limes which extends from one place to the other without interruption except where there is a small half way village the distance is not less than eighteen miles and the diversified culture of the plains through which it passes is unusually grateful to the eye after the dirty buildings of cologne and the long uniformity of corn lands in the approach to it vines cover a great part of these plains and are here first seen in germany except indeed within the walls of cologne itself which contain many large enclosures converted from gardens and orchards into well sheltered vineyards the vines reminded us of english hop plants being set like them in rows and led round poles to various heights though all less than that of hops corn fruit or herbs were frequently growing between the rows whose light green foliage mingled beautifully with yellow wheat and larger patches of garden plantations that spread without any enclosures to the sweeping rhine on the left beyond appeared the blue ridges of westphalian mountains on the right the plains extend to a chain of lower and less distant hills whose skirts are covered with vines and summits darkened with thick woods  the electors palace of bruhl is on the right hand of the road at no great distance but we were not told till afterward of the magnificent architecture and furniture which ought to have attracted our curiosity  on a green and circular hill near the rhine stands the benedictine abbey of siegbourg one of the first picturesque objects of the rich approach to bonn and further on the castlelike towers of a convent of noble ladies both societies celebrated for their wealth and the pleasantness of their situations which command extensive prospects over the country on each side of the river as we drew near bonn we frequently caught between the trees of the avenue imperfect but awakening glimpses of the pointed mountains beyond contrasted with the solemn grandeur of which was the beauty of a round woody hill apparently separated from them only by the rhine and crowned with the spire of a comely convent bonn with tall slender steeples and the trees of its ramparts thus backed by sublime mountains looks well as you approach it from cologne though neither its noble palace nor the rhine which washes its walls are seen from hence  we were asked our names at the gate but had no trouble about passports or baggage a long and narrow street leads from thence to the market place not disgusting you either with the gloom or the dirt of cologne though mean houses are abundantly intermixed with the others and the best are far from admirable the physiognomy of the place if one may use the expression is wholesome though humble by the recommendation of a dutch merchant we went to an inn in another street branching from the market place and found it the cleanest since we had left holland  bonn may be called the political capital of the country the electors court being held only there and what would not be expected this has importance enough to command the residence of an agent from almost every power in europe the present elector being the uncle of the emperor this attention is perhaps partly paid with the view that it may be felt at the court of vienna even russia is not unrepresented in this miniature state  the electors palace is in point of grandeur much better fitted to be the scene of diplomatic ceremonies than those of many greater sovereigns and it is fitted also for better than diplomatic purposes being placed before some of the most striking of natures features of which it is nearly as worthy an ornament as art can make it is seated on the western bank of the rhine the general course of which it fronts though it forms a considerable angle with the part immediately nearest the first emotion on perceiving it being that of admiration at its vastness the wonder is of course equal with which you discover that it is only part of a greater design it consists of a center and an eastern wing which are completed and of a western wing of which not half is yet raised the extent from east to west is so great that if we had enquired the measurement we should have been but little assisted in giving an idea of the spectacle exhibited by so immense a building  it is of stone of an architecture perhaps not adequate to the grandeur of its extent but which fills no part with unsuitable or inelegant ornaments along the whole garden front which is the chief a broad terrace supports a promenade and an orangery of noble trees occasionally refreshed by fountains that ornamented with statues rise from marble bafons an arcade through the center of the palace leads to this terrace from whence the prospect is strikingly beautiful and sublime the eye passes over the green lawn of the garden and a tract of level country to the groupe called the seven mountains broken rocky and abrupt toward their summits yet sweeping finely near their bases and uniting with the plains by long and gradual descents that spread round many miles the nearest is about a league and a half off we saw them under the cloudless sky of june invested with the mistiness of heat which softening their rocky points and half veiling their recesses left much for the imagination to supply and gave them an aerial appearance a faint tint of silvery gray that was inexpressibly interesting the rhine that winds at their feet was concealed from us by the garden groves but from the upper windows of the palace it is seen in all its majesty  on the right from this terrace the smaller palace of poppelsdorff terminates a long avenue of limes and chestnut trees that communicates with both buildings and above are the hill and the convent sanctae crucis the latter looking out from among sirs and shrubby steeps from thence the western horizon is bounded by a range of hills clothed to their summits with wood the plain that extends between these and the rhine is cultivated with vines and corn and the middle distance is marked by a pyramidal mountain darkened by wood and crowned with the tower and walls of a ruined castle  the gardens of the palace are formally laid out in straight walks and alleys of cut trees but the spacious lawn between these gives fine effect to the perspective of the distant mountains and the bowery walks while they afford refreshing shelter from a summer sun allow partial views of the palace and the romantic landscape  it was the elector joseph clement the same who repaired the city left in a ruinous state by the siege of   0  under the duke of marlborough that built this magnificent residence there are in it many suites of state rooms and every sort of apartment usual in the mansions of sovereigns saloons of audience and ceremony a library a cabinet of natural history and a theater though these are readily opened to strangers we are to confess that we did not see them being prevented by the attentions of those whose civilities gave them a right to command us while their situations enabled them to point out the best occupation of our time the hall of the grand master of the teutonic order ornamented with portraits of all the grand masters we are however sorry to have neglected even for the delights of poppelsdorff which we were presently shown  leaving the palace we passed through the garden on the right to a fine avenue of turf nearly a mile long bordered by alleys of tall trees and so wide that the late elector had designed to form a canal in the middle of it for an opportunity of passing between his palaces by land or water as he might wish the palace of poppelsdorff terminates the perspective of this avenue it is a small building surrounded by its gardens in a taste not very good and remarkable chiefly for the pleasantness of its situation an arcade encompassing a court in the interior communicates with all the apartments on the ground floor which is the principal and with the gardens on the eastern side of the chateau the entrance is through a small hall decorated with the ensigns of hunting and round nearly the whole arcade stags heads are placed at equal distances these have remained here since the reign of clement augustus the founder of the palace who died in      and they exhibit some part of the history of his life for under each is an inscription relating the events and date of the hunt by which he killed it there are twentythree such ornaments  the greatest part of the furniture had been removed during the approach of the french in      and the archduchess maria christina to whom the elector her brother had lent the chateau was now very far from sumptuously accommodated on this account she passed much of her time at goodesberg a small watering place in the neighborhood after her retreat from brussels in consequence of the advances of the french in the same year she had accompanied her husband the duke of saxe teschen into saxony but since his appointment to the command of the emperors army of the upper rhine her residence had been established in the dominions of her brother  we were shown through her apartments which she had left for goodesberg a few hours before on the table of her sitting room lay the fragments of a painted cross composed of small pieces like our dissected maps the putting of which together exercises ingenuity and passes perhaps for a sort of piety the attendant said that it served to pass the time but it cannot be supposed that rank and fortune have so little power to bestow happiness as that their possessors should have recourse to such means of lightening the hours of life  on another table was spread a map of all the countries then included in the theater of war and on it a box filled with small pieces of various colored wax intended to mark the positions of the different armies these were of many shades for the archduchess who is said to be conversant with military affairs and to have descended to the firing of bombs at the siege of lisle was able to distinguish the several corpse of the allied armies that were acting separately from each other the positions were marked up to the latest accounts then public the course of her thoughts was visible from this chart and they were interesting to curiosity being those of the sister of the late unfortunate queen of france  the walls of an adjoining cabinet were ornamented with drawings from the antique by the archduchess disposed upon a light ground and serving instead of tapestry  the chapel is a rotunda rising into a dome and though small is splendid with painting and gilding in the center are four altars formed on the four sides of a square pedestal that supports a figure of our savior but the beauty of this design is marred by the vanity of placing near each altar the statue of a founder of the teutonic order the furniture of the electors gallery is of crimson velvet and gold  on another side of the chateau we were shown an apartment entirely covered with grotto work and called the hall of shells a curious instance of patient industry having been completed by one man during a labor of many years its situation in the middle of an inhabited mansion is unsuitable to the character of a grotto but its coolness must render it a very convenient retreat and the likenesses of animals as well as the other forms into which the shells are thrown though not very elegant are fanciful enough especially as the ornaments of fountains which play into several parts of the room  leaving the palace by the bridge of a moat that nearly surrounds it we passed through the pleasant village of poppelsdorff and ascended the hill sanctae crucis called so from the convent of the same name which occupies its summit the road wound between thick woods but we soon left it for a path that led more immediately to the summit among shrubs and plantations of larch and fir and which opened into easy avenues of turf that sometimes allowed momentary views of other woody points and of the plains around the turf was uncommonly fragrant and fine abounding with plants which made us regret the want of a botanists knowledge and pleasures during the ascent the peaked tops of the mountains of the rhine so often admired below began to appear above a ridge of dark woods very near us in a contrast of hues which was exquisitely fine it was now near evening the mistiness of heat was gone from the surface of these mountains and they had assumed a blue tint so peculiar and clear that they appeared upon the sky like supernatural transparencies  we had heard at bonn of the capuchins courtesy and had no hesitation to knock at their gate after taking some rest in the portico of the church from whence we looked down another side of the mountain over the long plains between bonn and cologne having waited some time at the gate during which many steps fled along the passage and the head of a monk appeared peeping through a window above a servant admitted us into a parlour adjoining the refectory which appeared to have been just left this was the first convent we had entered and we could not help expecting to see more than others had described an involuntary habit from which few are free and which need not be imputed to vanity so long as the love of surprise shall be so visible in human pursuits when the laybrother had quitted us to inform the superior of our request not a footstep or a voice approached for near a quarter of an hour and the place seemed as if uninhabited our curiosity had no indulgence within the room which was of the utmost plainness and that plainness free from any thing that the most tractable imagination could suppose peculiar to a convent at length a monk appeared who received us with infinite good humor and with the ease which must have been acquired in more general society his shaven head and black garments formed a whimsical contrast to the character of his person and countenance which bore no symptoms of sorrow or penance and were indeed animated by an air of cheerfulness and intelligence that would have become the happiest inhabitant of the gayest city  through some silent passages in which he did not show us a cell and we did not perceive another monk we passed to the church where the favor of several electors has assisted the display of paintings marble sculpture gold and silver mingled and arranged with magnificent effect among these was the marble statue brought from england at a great expense and here called a representation of st anne who is said to have found the cross our conductor seemed to be a man of good understanding and desirous of being thought so a disposition which gave an awkwardness to his manner when in noticing a relic he was obliged to touch upon some unproved and unimportant tradition peculiar to his church and not essential to the least article of our faith his sense of decorum as a member of the convent seemed then to be struggling with his vanity as a man  but there are relics here pretending to a connection with some parts of christian history which it is shocking to see introduced to consideration by any means so trivial and so liable to ridicule it is indeed wonderful that the absurd exhibitions made in romish churches should so often be minutely described and dwelt upon in terms of ludicrous exultation by those who do not intend that most malignant of offenses against human nature the endeavor to excite a wretched vanity by sarcasm and jest and to employ it in eradicating the comforts of religion to such writers the probable mischief of uniting with the mention of the most important divine doctrines the most ridiculous of human impositions ought to be apparent and as the risk is unnecessary in a protestant country why is it encountered that persons otherwise inclined should adopt these topics is not surprising the easiest pretenses to wit are found to be made by means of familiar allusions to sacred subjects because their necessary incongruity accomplishes the greatest part of what in other cases must be done by wit itself there will therefore never be an end of such allusions till it is generally seen that they are the resources and symptoms of mean understandings urged by the feverish desire of an eminence to which they feel themselves inadequate  from the chapel we ascended to a tower of the convent whence all the scattered scenes of whose beauty or sublimity we had caught partial glimpses between the woods below were collected into one vast landscape and exhibited almost to a single glance the point on which the convent stands commands the whole horizon to the north spread the wide plains before seen covered with corn then just embrowned and with vines and gardens whose alternate colors formed a gay checker work with villages convents and castles the grandeur of this level was unbroken by any enclosures that could seem to diminish its vastness the range of woody heights that bound it on the west extend to the southward many leagues beyond the hill sanctae cruois but the uniform and unbroken ridges of distant mountains on the east cease before the seven mountains rise above the rhine in all their awful majesty the bases of the latter were yet concealed by the woody ridge near the convent which gives such enchanting effect to their aerial points the sky above them was clear and glowing unstained by the lightest vapor and these mountains still appeared upon it like unsubstantial visions on the two highest pinnacles we could just distinguish the ruins of castles and on a lower precipice a building which our reverend guide pointed out as a convent dedicated to st bernard giving us new occasion to admire the fine taste of the monks in their choice of situations  opposite to the seven mountains the plains of goodesberg are screened by the chain of hills already mentioned which begin in the neighborhood of cologne and whose woods spreading into france there assume the name of the forest of ardennes within the recesses of these woods the elector has a huntingseat almost every window of which opens upon a different alley and not a stag can cross these without being seen from the chateau it is melancholy to consider that the most frequent motives of mans retirement among the beautiful recesses of nature are only those of destroying the innocent animals that inhabit her shades strange that her lovely scenes cannot soften his heart to milder pleasures or elevate his fancy to nobler pursuits and that he must still seek his amusement in scattering death among the harmless and the happy  as we afterward walked in the garden of the convent the greater part of which was planted with vines the monk further exhibited his good humor and liberality he enquired concerning the events of the war of which he appeared to know the latest spoke of his friends in cologne and other places drew a ludicrous picture of the effect which would be produced by the appearance of a capuchin in london and laughed immoderately at it there said he it would be supposed that some harlequin was walking in a capuchins dress to attract spectators for a pantomime here nobody will follow him left he should lead them to church every nation has its way and laughs at the ways of others considering the effects which differences sometimes have there are few things more innocent than that sort of laughter  the garden was stored with fruits and the vegetable luxuries of the table but was laid out with no attention to beauty its inimitable prospects having as the good monk said rendered the society careless of less advantages after exchanging our thanks for his civilities against his thanks for the visit we descended to poppelsdorff by a steep road bordered with firs and fragrant shrubs which frequently opened to corn lands and vineyards where peasants were busied in dressing the vines  about a mile from bonn is a garden or rather nursery to which they have given the name of vaxhall it is much more rural than that of london being planted with thick and lofty groves which in this climate are gratefully refreshing during the summerday but are very pernicious in the evening when the vapor arising from the ground cannot escape through the thick foliage the garden is lighted up only on great festivals or when the elector or his courtiers give a ball in a large room built for the purpose on some days half the inhabitants of bonn are to be seen in this garden mingling in the promenade with the elector and his nobility but there were few visitors when we saw it count gimnich the commander who had surrendered mentz to the french was the only person pointed out to us  the road from hence to bonn was laid out and planted with poplars at the expense of the elector who has a taste for works of public advantage and ornament his grandmastership of the teutonic order renders his court more frequented than those of the other ecclesiastical princes the possessions of that order being still considerable enough to support many younger brothers of noble families having passed his youth in the army or at the courts of vienna or brussels he is also environed by friends made before the vacancy of an ecclesiastical electorate induced him to change his profession and the union of his three incomes as bishop of munster grand master and elector enables him to spend something more than two hundred thousand pounds annually his experience and revenues are in many respects very usefully employed to the nobility he affords an example of so much personal dignity as to be able to reject many ostentatious customs and to remove some of the ceremonial barriers which men do not constantly place between themselves and their fellowbeings except from some consciousness of personal weakness all sovereigns who have had any sense of their individual liberty and power have shown a readiness to remove such barriers but not many have been able to effect so much as the elector of cologne against the chamberlains pages and other footmanry of their courts who are always upon the alerte to defend the false magnificence that makes their offices seem necessary he now enjoys many of the blessings usual only in private stations among others that of conversing with great numbers of persons not forced into his society by their rank and of dispensing with much of that attendance which would render his menial servants part of his company  his secretary mr floret whom we had the pleasure to see gave us some accounts of the industry and carefulness of his private life which he judiciously thought were better than any other panegyrics upon his master his attention to the relief employment and education of the poor to the state of manufactures and the encouragement of talents appears to be continual and his country would soon have elapsed from the general wretchedness of germany if the exertions of three campaigns had not destroyed what thirty years of care and improvement cannot restore  his residence at bonn occasions expenditure enough to keep the people busy but he has not been able to divert to it any part of the commerce which though it is of so little use at cologne is here spoken of with some envy and seems to be estimated above its amount the town which is much neater than the others in the electorate and so pleasantly situated that its name has been supposed to be formed from the latin synonym for good is ornamented by few public buildings except the palace what is called the university is a small brick building used more as a school than a college except that the masters are called professors the principal church of four which are within the walls is a large building distinguished by several spires but not remarkable for its antiquity or beauty  many of the german powers retain some show of a representative government as to affairs of finance and have states by which taxes are voted those of the electorate of cologne consist of four colleges representing the clergy nobility knights and cities the votes are given by colleges so that the inhabitants of the cities if they elect their representatives fairly have one vote in four these states assemble at bonn  one of the privileges which it is surprising that the present elector should retain is that of grinding corn for the consumption of the whole town his mill like those of all the towns on the rhine is a floating one moored in the river which turns its wheel bread is bad at bonn but this oppressive privilege is not entirely answerable for it there being little better throughout the whole country it generally appears in rolls with glazed crusts half hollow the crumb not brown but a sort of dirty white  there are few cities in germany without walls which when the dreadful science of war was less advanced than at present frequently protected them against large armies these are now so useless that such cannon as are employed against batteries could probably not be fired from them without shaking their foundations the fortifications of bonn are of this sort and though they were doubtless better when the duke of marlborough arrived before them it is wonderful that they should have sustained a regular siege during which great part of the town was demolished the electorate of cologne is indeed so ill prepared for war that it has not one town which could resist ten thousand men for three days  the inhabitants of bonn whenever they regret the loss of their fortifications should be reminded of the three sieges which in the course of thirty years nearly destroyed their city of these the first was in      when the elector had received a french garrison into it but the resistance did not then continue many days it was in this siege that the prince of orange afterward our honored william the third had one of his few military successes in      the french who had lately defended it returned to attack it and before they could subdue the strong garrison left in it by the elector of brandenburg the palace and several public buildings were destroyed the third siege was commanded by the duke of marlborough and continued from the   th of april to the   th of may the french being then the defenders and the celebrated cohorn one of the assailants it was not till fifteen years afterward that all the houses demolished in this siege could be restored by the efforts of the elector joseph  the present elector maintains in time of peace about eight hundred soldiers which is the number of his contingent to the army of the empire in the present war he has supplied somewhat more than this allotment and when we were at bonn two thousand recruits were in training his troops wear the general uniform of the empire blue faced with red which many of the germanic sovereigns give only to their contingent troops while those of their separate establishments are distinguished by other colors the austrian regiments are chiefly in white faced with light blue gray or red but the artillery are dressed with very little show in a cloak speckled with light brown  bonn was one of the very few places in germany which we left with regret it is endeared to the votaries of landscape by its situation in the midst of fruitful plains in the presence of stupendous mountains and on the bank of a river that in summer is impelled by the dissolved snows of switzerland and in winter rolls with the accumulation of a thousand torrents from the rocks on its shores it contained many inhabitants who had the independence to aim at a just taste in morals and letters in spite of the ill examples with which such countries supply them and having the vices of the form of government established in it corrected by the moderation and immediate attention of the governor it might be considered as a happy region in the midst of ignorance injustice and misery and remembered like the green spot that in an arabian desert cheers the senses and sustains the hopes of the weary traveller  goodesberg the ride from bonn to this delightful village is only one league over a narrow plain covered with corn and vineyards on our right was the range of hills before seen from the mountain sanctae crucis sweeping into frequent recesses and starting forward into promontories with inequalities which gave exquisite richness to the forest that mantled from their bases to their utmost summits many a lurking village with its slender gray steeple peeped from among the woody skirts of these hills on our left the tremendous mountains that bind the eastern shore of the rhine gradually lost their aerial complexion as we approached them and displayed new features and new enchantments an evervarying illusion to which the transient circumstance of thunder clouds contributed the sunbeams streaming among these clouds threw partial gleams upon the precipices and followed by dark shadows gave surprising and inimitable effect to the natural coloring of the mountains whose pointed tops we now discerned to be covered with dark heath extended down their rocky sides and mingled with the reddish and light yellow tints of other vegetation and the soil it was delightful to watch the shadows sweeping over these steeps now involving them in deep obscurity and then leaving them to the suns rays which brought out all their hues into vivid contrast  near goodesberg a small mountain insulated abrupt and pyramidal rises from the plain which it seems to terminate and conceals the village that lies along its southern skirt this mountain covered with vineyards and thick dwarf wood to its summit where one high tower and some shattered walls appear is a very interesting object  at the entrance of the village the road was obstructed by a great number of small carts filled with soldiers apparently wounded the line of their procession had been broken by some carriages hastening with company to the ridotto at goodesberg and was not easily restored misery and festivity could scarcely be brought into closer contrast we thought of johnsons manycoloured life and of his picture in the preface to shakespeare of cotemporary wretchedness and joy when the reveller is hastening to his wine and the mourner is burying his friend this was a procession of wounded french prisoners chiefly boys whose appearance had indeed led us to suspect their nation before we saw the stamp of the fasces and the words  republique francoise upon the buttons of some whom our driver had nearly overset the few that could raise themselves above the floor of their carts showed countenances yellow or livid with sickness they did not talk to their guards nor did the latter show any signs of exultation over them  in a plain beyond the village a row of large houses built upon one plan and almost resembling a palace form the little watering place of goodesberg which has been founded partly at the expense of the elector and partly by individuals under his patronage one of the houses was occupied by the archduchess his sister and is often used by the elector who is extremely solicitous for the prosperity of the place a large building at the end contains the public rooms and is fitted up as an hotel  the situation of this house is beautiful beyond any hope or power of description for description though it may tell that there are mountains and rocks cannot paint the grandeur or the elegance of outline cannot give the effect of precipices or draw the minute features that reward the actual observer by continual changes of color and by varying their forms at every new choice of his position delightful goodesberg the sublime and beautiful of landscape the charms of music and the pleasures of gay and elegant society were thine the immediate unhappiness of war has now fallen upon thee but though the graces may have fled thee thy terrible majesty remains beyond the sphere of human contention  the plain that contains the village and the spa is about five miles in length and of half that breadth it is covered by uninclosed corn and nearly surrounded by a vast amphitheatre of mountains in front of the inn at the distance of half a league extend along the opposite shore of the rhine the seven mountains so long seen and admired which here assume a new attitude the three tallest points are now nearest to the eye and the lower mountains are seen either in the perspective between them or sinking with less abrupt declivities into the plains on the north the whole mass exhibits a grandeur of outline such as the pencil only can describe but fancy may paint the stupendous precipices of rock that rise over the rhine the rich tuftings of wood that emboss the cliffs or lurk within the recesses the spiry summits and the ruined castles faintly discerned that crown them yet the appearance of these mountains though more grand from goodesberg is less sublime than from bonn for the nearness which increases their grandeur diminishes their sublimity by removing the obscurity that had veiled them to the south of this plain the long perspective is crossed by further ranges of mountains which open to glimpses of others still beyond an endless succession of summits that lead on the imagination to unknown valleys and regions of solitary obscurity  amidst so many attractions of nature art cannot do much the little which it attempts at goodesberg is the disposition of some walks from the houses to a spring which is said to resemble that at spa and through the woods above it twice a week there are some musical performances and a ball given by the elector who frequently appears and with the ease and plainness of a private gentleman at these entertainments the company visiting the spring are joined by neighboring families so as to be in number sixty or a hundred the balls agreeably to the earliness of german hours begin at six and that which we meant to see was nearly concluded before our arrival the company then retired to a public game at which large sums of gold were risked and a severe anxiety defied the influence of mozarts music that continued to be played by an excellent orchestra the dresses of the company were in the english taste and as we were glad to believe chiefly of english manufacture the wearing of countenances by play appears to be also according to our manners and the german ladies with features scarcely less elegant have complexions perhaps finer than are general in england  meditating censures against the electors policy or carelessness in this respect we took advantage of the last gleams of evening to ascend the slender and spiry mountain which bears the name of the village and appears ready to precipitate the ruins of its ancient castle upon it a steep road winding among vineyards and dwarf wood enters at the summit of the mountain the broken walls which surround the ancient citadel of the castle an almost solid building that has existed for more than five centuries from the area of these ruins we saw the sun set over the whole line of plains that extend to the westward of cologne whose spires were distinctly visible bonn and the hill sanctae crucis appeared at a leagues distance and the windings of the rhine gleamed here and there amidst the rich scene like distant lakes it was a still and beautiful evening in which no shade remained of the thunder clouds that passed in the day to the west under the glow of sunset the landscape melted into the horizon in tints so soft so clear so delicately roseate as claude only could have painted viewed as we then saw it beyond a deep and dark arch of the ruin its effect was enchanting it was to the eye what the finest strains of paisiello are to the heart or the poetry of collins is to the fancy  all tender sweet elegant and glowing  from the other side of the hill the character of the view is entirely different and instead of a long prospect over an open and level country the little plain of goodesberg appears reposing amidst wild and awful mountains these were now melancholy and silent the last rays were fading from their many points and the obscurity of twilight began to spread over them we seemed to have found the spot for which collins wished now let me rove some wild and heathy scene or find some ruin midst its dreary dells whose walls more awful nod by thy religious gleams ode to evening  and this is a place almost as renowned in the history of the country as it is worthy to exercise the powers of poetry and painting the same ernest in the cause of whose sovereignty the massacre of neuss was perpetrated besieged here the same gerard de trusches the elector who had embraced the protestant religion and for whom neuss held out the castle of goodesberg was impregnable except by famine but was very liable to that from its insulated situation and the ease with which the whole base of the mountain could be surrounded gerards defense was rendered the more obstinate by his belief that nothing less than his life and that of a beautiful woman the marrying of whom had constituted one of the offenses against his chapter would appease his ferocious enemies he was personally beloved by his garrison and they adhered to him with the affection of friends as well as with the enthusiasm of soldiers when therefore they perceived that their surrender could not be much longer protracted they resolved to employ their remaining time and strength in enabling him to separate his fortunes from theirs they labored incessantly in forming a subterraneous passage which should open beyond the besiegers lines and though their distress became extreme before this was completed they made no overtures for a surrender till gerard and his wife had escaped by it the fugitives arrived safely in holland and the vengeance of their adversaries was never gratified further than by hearing many years after that they died poor  the fortress rendered interesting by these traits of fidelity and misfortune is not so far decayed but that its remains exhibit much of its original form it covered the whole summit of the hill and was valuable as a residence as well as a fortification what seem to have been the walls of the great hall in which probably the horn of two quarts was often emptied to welcome the guest or reward the soldier are still perfect enough to preserve the arches of its capacious windows and the doorways that admitted its festive trains the vast strength of the citadel has been unsubdued by war or time though the battlements that crown it are broken and of a gallery that once encircled it half way from the ground the corbells alone remain the solid walls of the building itself are unimpaired at the narrow doorway by which only it could be entered we measured their thickness and found it to be more than ten feet nearly half the diameter of its area there has never been a fixed staircase though these walls would so well have contained one and the hole is still perfect in the floor above through which the garrison ascended and drew up their ladder after them behind the loopholes the wall has been hollowed and would permit a soldier half bent to stand within them and use his bow it was twilight without and night within the edifice which fancy might have easily filled with the stern and silent forms of warriors waiting for their prey with the patience of safety and sure superiority  we wandered long among these vestiges of ancient story rendered still more interesting by the shadowy hour and the vesper bell of a chapel on a cliff below the village to which this belongs straggles half way up the mountain and there are several little shrines above it which the cottagers on festivals decorate with flowers the priest is the schoolmaster of the parish and almost all the children within several miles of the hill walk to it every day to prayers and lessons whether it is from this care of their minds or that they are under the authority of milder landlords than elsewhere the manners of the inhabitants in this plain differ much from those usual in germany instead of an inveterate sullenness approaching frequently to malignity they show a civility and gentleness in their intercourse with strangers which leave the enjoyments derived from inanimate nature unalloyed by the remembrances of human deformity that mingle with them in other districts even the childrens begging is in a manner which shows a different character they here kiss their little hands and silently hold them out to you almost as much in salute as in entreaty in many parts of germany their manner is so offensive not only for its intrusion but as a symptom of their disposition that nothing but the remembrance of the oppression that produces it can prevent you from denying the little they are compelled to require  the music had not ceased when we returned to the inn and the mellowness of french horns mingled with the tenderness of hautboys gave a kind of enchantment to the scenery which we continued to watch from our windows the opposite mountains of the rhine were gradually vanishing in twilight and then as gradually reappearing as the rising moon threw her light upon their broken surfaces the perspective in the east received a silvery softness which made its heights appear like shadowy illusions while the nearer mountains were distinguished by their coloring as much as by their forms the broad rhine at their feet rolled a stream of light for their boundary on this side but the first exquisite tint of beauty soon began to fade the mountains became misty underneath the moon and as she ascended these mists thickened till they veiled the landscape from our view  the spring which is supposed to have some medicinal qualities is about a quarter of a mile from the rooms in a woody valley in which the elector has laid out several roads and walks it rises in a stone basin to which the company if they wish to drink it on the spot descend by an handsome flight of steps we were not told its qualities but there is a ferrugineous tint upon all the stones which it touches the taste is slightly unpleasant  the three superior points of the seven mountains which contribute so much to the distinction of goodesberg are called drakenfels wolkenbourg and lowenbourg and have each been crowned by its castle of which two are still visible in ruins there is a story faintly recorded concerning them three brothers resolving to found three distinguished families took the method which was anciently in use for such a purpose that of establishing themselves in fortresses from whence they could issue out and take what they wanted from their industrious neighbors the pinnacles of drakenfels wolkenbourg and lowenbourg which with all assistance cannot be ascended now without the utmost fatigue were inaccessible when guarded by the castles built by the three brothers their depredations which they called successes in war enriched their families and placed them amongst the most distinguished in the empire  they had a sister named adelaide famed to have been very beautiful and their parents being dead the care of her had descended to them roland a young knight whose castle was on the opposite bank of the rhine became her suitor and gained her affections whether the brothers had expected by her means to form a more splendid alliance or that they remembered the ancient enmity between their family and that of roland they secretly resolved to deny the hand of adelaide but did not choose to provoke him by a direct refusal they stipulated that he should serve a certain number of years in the war of palestine and on his return should be permitted to renew his suit  roland took a reluctant farewell of adelaide and went to the war where he was soon distinguished for an impetuous career adelaide remained in the castle of drakenfels waiting in solitary fidelity for his return but the brothers had determined that he should not return for her they clothed one of their dependents in the disguise of a pilgrim and introduced him into the castle where he related that he was arrived from the holy wars and had been desired by roland in his latest moments to assure adelaide of his having loved her till death  the unhappy adelaide believed the tale and from that time devoted herself to the memory of roland and to the nourishment of her sorrow she rejected all the suitors introduced by her brothers and accepted no society but that of some neighboring nuns at length the gloom of a cloister became so necessary to the melancholy of her imagination that she resolved to found a convent and take the veil a design which her brothers assisted with the view of placing her effectually beyond the reach of her lover she chose an island in the rhine between her brothers castle and the seat of roland both of which she could see from the windows of her convent and here she passed some years in the placid performance of her new duties  at length roland returned and they both discovered the cruel device by which they had been separated for ever adelaide remained in her convent and soon after died but roland emulating the fidelity of her retirement built at the extreme point of his domains toward the rhine a small castle that overlooked the island where he wasted his days in melancholy regret and in watching over the walls that shrouded his adelaide  this is the story on which the wild and vivid imagination of ariosto is said to have founded his orlando  the valley of andernach after spending part of two days at goodesberg we set out in a sultry afternoon for the town of andernach distant about fiveandtwenty english miles the road wound among cornlands toward the rhine and approached almost as near to the seven mountains as the river would permit opposite to the last and nearly the tallest of these called drakenfels the open plain terminates and the narrower valley begins  this mountain towers the majestic sentinel of the river over which it aspires in vast masses of rock varied with rich tuftings of dwarfwood and bearing on its narrow peak the remains of a castle whose walls seem to rise in a line with the perpendicular precipice on which they stand and when viewed from the opposite bank appear little more than a rugged cabin the eye aches in attempting to scale this rock but the sublimity of its height and the grandeur of its intermingled cliffs and woods gratify the warmest wish of fancy  the road led us along the western bank of the rhine among vineyards and corn and thick trees that allowed only transient catches of the water between their branches but the gigantic form of drakenfels was always seen its superior features perhaps appearing more wild from the partial concealment of its base and assuming new attitudes as we passed away from it lowenberg whose upper region only had been seen from goodesberg soon unfolded itself from behind drakenfels and displayed all its pomp of wood sweeping from the spreading base in one uninterrupted line of grandeur to the spiry top on which one high tower of the castle appears enthroned among the forests this is the loftiest of the seven mountains and its dark sides where no rock is visible form a fine contrast with the broken cliffs of drakenfels a multitude of spiry summits appeared beyond lowenberg seen and lost again as the nearer rocks of the shore opened to the distance or reunited about a mile further lies the pleasant island on which adelaide raised her convent as it was well endowed it has been rebuilt and is now a large and handsome quadrangle of white stone surrounded with trees and corn and vineyards and still allotted to the society which she established an abrupt but not lofty rock on the western shore of the rhine called rolands eck or rolands corner is the site of her lovers castle of which one arch picturesquely shadowed with wood is all that remains of this monument to faithful love the road winds beneath it and nearly overhangs the narrow channel that separates adelaides island from the shore concerning this rock there is an ancient rhyme in the country amounting to something like the following was not roland the knight a strange silly wight for the love of a nun to live on this height   after passing the island the valley contracts and the river is soon shut up between fruitful and abrupt hills which rise immediately over it on one side and a series of rocky heights on the other in the small space left between these heights and the rhine the road is formed for the greater part of the way it has been hollowed in the solid rock which ascends almost perpendicularly above it on one hand and sinks as abruptly below it to the river on the other a work worthy of roman perseverance and design and well known to be a monument of both it was made during the reign of marcus aurelius and lucius verus and as the inscription whose antiquity has not been doubted dates its completion in the year     it must have been finished in one year or little more marcus aurelius having been raised to the purple in     the elector palatine having repaired this road which the electors of cologne had neglected in      has caused his name to be joined with those of the roman emperors in the following inscription upon an oblisk viam  we did not sufficiently observe the commencement and conclusion of this road to be certain of its exact length but it is probably about twelve miles the rock above is for the most part naked to the summit where it is thinly covered with earth but sometimes it slopes so much as to permit patches of soil on its side and these are carefully planted with vines this shore of the rhine may be said to be bounded for many miles by an immense wall of rock through which the openings into the country behind are few and these breaks show only deep glens seen and lost again so quickly that a woody mountain or a castle or a convent were the only objects we could ascertain  this rock lies in oblique strata and resembles marble in its brown and reddish tints marked with veins of deeper red but we are unable to mention it under its proper and scientific denomination the coloring of the cliffs is beautiful when mingled with the verdure of shrubs that sometimes hang in rich drapery from their points and with the mosses and creeping vegetables of bright crimson yellow and purple that emboss their fractured sides  the road which the elector mentions himself to have widened is now and then very narrow and approaches near enough to the river over which it has no parapet to make a traveller anxious for the sobriety and skill of his postillion it is sometimes elevated forty feet above the level of the rhine and seldom less than thirty an elevation from whence the water and its scenery are viewed to great advantage but to the variety and grandeur of these shores and the ever changing form of the river description cannot do justice  sometimes as we approached a rocky point we seemed going to plunge into the expanse of water beyond when turning the sharp angle of the promontory the road swept along an ample bay where the rocks receding formed an amphitheatre covered with ilex and dwarfwood round a narrow but cultivated level stripe then winding the furthest angle of this crescent under huge cliffs we saw the river beyond shut in by the folding bases of more distant promontories assume the form of a lake amidst wild and romantic landscapes having doubled one of these capes the prospect opened in long perspective and the green waters of the rhine appeared in all their majesty flowing rapidly between ranges of marbled rocks and a succession of woody steeps and overlooked by a multitude of spiry summits which distance had sweetly colored with the blue and purple tints of air  the retrospect of the river too was often enchanting and the seven mountains long maintained their dignity in the scene superior to many intervening heights the dark summit of lowenburg in particular appeared for several leagues overlooking the whole valley of the rhine  the eastern margin of the river sometimes exhibited as extensive a range of steep rocks as the western and frequently the fitness of the salient angles on one side to the recipient ones on the other seemed to justify the speculation that they had been divided by an earthquake which let the river in between them the general state of the eastern bank though steep is that of the thickest cultivation the rock frequently peeps in rugged projections through the thin soil which is scattered over its declivity and every where appears at top but the sides are covered with vines so abundantly that the labor of cultivating them and of expressing the wine supports a village at least at every half mile the green rows are led up the steeps to an height which cannot be ascended without the help of steps cut in the rock the soil itself is there supported by walls of loose stones or it would fall either by its own weight or with the first pressure of rain and sometimes even this scanty mould appears to have been placed there by art being in such small patches that perhaps only twenty vines can be planted in each but such excessive labor has been necessary only toward the summits for lower down the soil is sufficiently deep to support the most luxuriant vegetation  it might be supposed from so much produce and exertion that this bank of the rhine is the residence of an opulent or at least a wellconditioned peasantry and that the villages of which seven or eight are frequently in sight at once are as superior to the neighboring towns by the state of their inhabitants as they are by their picturesque situation on the contrary the inhabitants of the wine country are said to be amongst the poorest in germany the value of every hill is exactly watched by the landlords so that the tenants are very seldom benefited by any improvement of its produce if the rent is paid in money it leaves only so much in the hands of the farmer as will enable him to live and pay his workmen while the attention of a great number of stewards is supposed to supply what might be expected from his attention had he a common interest with his landlord in the welfare of the estate but the rent is frequently paid in kind amounting to a settled proportion of the produce and this proportion is so fixed that though the farmer is immoderately distressed by a bad vintage the best will not afford him any means of approaching to independence in other countries it might be asked but though we can suppose the ingenuity of the landlord to be greater than that of the tenant at the commencement of a bargain how happens it that since the result must be felt the tenant will remain under his burdens or can be succeeded by any other on such terms here however these questions are not applicable they presume a choice of situations which the country does not afford the severity of the agricultural system continues itself by continuing the poverty upon which it acts and those who would escape from it find few manufactures and little trade to employ them had they the capital and the education necessary for either the choice of such persons is between the being a master of daylabourers for their landlord or a labourer under other masters  many of these estates belong immediately to princes or chapters whose stewards superintend the cultivation and are themselves instead of the farmers so that all other persons employed in such vineyards are ordinary servants by one or other of these means it happens that the bounteousness of nature to the country is very little felt by the body of the inhabitants the payment of rents in kind is usual wherever the vineyards are most celebrated and at such places there is this sure proof of the wretchedness of the inhabitants that in a month after the wine is made you cannot obtain one bottle of the true produce except by favor of the proprietors or their stewards how much is the delight of looking upon plenteousness lessened by the belief that it supplies the means of excess to a few but denies those of competence to many  between this pass of cultivated steeps on one side of the river and of romantic rocks on the other the road continues for several miles being thus commanded on both sides it must be one of the most difficult passages in europe to an enemy if resolutely defended the rhine pent between these impenetrable boundaries is considerably narrower here than in other parts of the valley and so rapid that a loaded vessel can seldom be drawn faster than at the rate of six english miles a day against the stream the passage down the river from mentz to cologne may be easily performed in two days that from cologne to mentz requires a fortnight  the view along this pass though bounded is various and changeful villages vineyards and rocks alternately ornament the borders of the river and every fifty yards enable the eye to double some massy projection that concealed the fruitful bay behind an object at the end of the pass is presented singly to the sight as through an inverted telescope the surface of the water or the whole stillness of the scene was very seldom interrupted by the passing of a boat carriages were still fewer and indeed throughout germany you will not meet more than one in twenty miles traveling is considered by the natives who know the fatigue of going in carriages nearly without springs and stopping at inns where there is little of either accommodation or civility as productive of no pleasure and they have seldom curiosity or business enough to recompense for its inconveniences  we passed through two or three small towns whose ruined gates and walls told of their antiquity and that they had once been held of some consequence in the defense of the valley their present desolation formed a melancholy contrast with the cheerful cultivation around them these however with every village in our way were decorated with green boughs planted before the door of each cottage for it was a day of festival the little chapels at the roadside and the image which every now and then appeared under a spreading tree were adorned with wreaths of fresh flowers and though one might smile at the emblems of superstition it was impossible not to reverence the sentiment of pious affection which had adjusted these simple ornaments  about halfway to andernach the western rocks suddenly recede from the river and rising to greater height form a grand sweep round a plain cultivated with orchards gardenfields corn and vineyards the valley here spreads to a breadth of nearly a mile and an half and exhibits grandeur beauty and barren sublimity united in a singular manner the abrupt steeps that rise over this plain are entirely covered with wood except that here and there the ravage of a winter torrent appeared which could sometimes be traced from the very summit of the acclivity to the base near the center this noble amphitheatre opens to a glen that shows only wooded mountains point above point in long perspective such sylvan pomp we had seldom seen but though the tuftings of the nearer woods were beautifully luxuriant there seemed to be few timber trees amongst them the opposite shore exhibited only a range of rocks variegated like marble of which purple was the predominating tint and uniformly disposed in vast oblique strata but even here little green patches of vines peeped among the cliffs and were led up crevices where it seemed as if no human foot could rest along the base of this tremendous wall and on the points above villages with each its tall gray steeple were thickly strewn thus mingling in striking contrast the cheerfulness of populous inhabitation with the horrors of untamed nature a few monasteries resembling castles in their extent and known from such only by their spires were distinguishable and in the widening perspective of the rhine an old castle itself now and then appeared on the summit of a mountain somewhat remote from the shore an object rendered sweetly picturesque as the suns rays lighted up its towers and fortified terraees while the shrubby steeps below were in shade  we saw this landscape under the happiest circumstances of season and weather the woods and plants were in their midsummer bloom and the mellow light of evening heightened the richness of their hues and gave exquisite effect to one half of the amphitheatre we were passing while the other half was in shadow the air was scented by beanblossoms and by limetrees then in flower that bordered the road if this plain had mingled pasture with its groves it would have been truly arcadian but neither here nor through the whole of this delightful valley did we see a single pasture or meadow except now and then in an island on the rhine deficiencies which are here supplied to the lover of landscape by the verdure of the woods and vines in other parts of germany they are more to be regretted where frequently only corn and rock color the land  fatigued at length by such prodigality of beauty we were glad to be shrouded awhile from the view of it among close boughs and to see only the wide rivulets with their rustic bridges of faggots and earth that descending from among the mountains frequently crossed our way or the simple peasantgirl leading her cows to feed on the narrow stripe of grass that margined the road the little bells that jingled at their necks would not suffer them to stray beyond her hearing if we had not long since dismissed our surprise at the scarcity and bad quality of cheese and butter in germany we should have done so now on perceiving this scanty method of pasturing the cattle which future observation convinced us was the frequent practice  about sunset we reached the little village of namedy seated near the foot of a rock round which the rhine makes a sudden sweep and contracted by the bold precipices of hammerstein on the opposite shore its green current passes with astonishing rapidity and sounding strength these circumstances of scenery with the tall masts of vessels lying below the shrubby bank on which the village stands and seeming to heighten by comparison the stupendous rocks that rose around them the moving figures of boatmen and horses employed in towing a barge against the stream in the bay beyond and a group of peasants on the high quay in the fore ground watching their progress the ancient castle of hammerstein overlooking the whole  these were a combination of images that formed one of the most interesting pictures we had seen  the valley again expanding the walls and turrets of andernach with its roman tower rising independently at the foot of a mountain and the ruins of its castle above appeared athwart the perspective of the river terminating the pass for there the rocky boundary opened to plains and remote mountains the light vapor that rose from the water and was tinged by the setting rays spread a purple haze over the town and the cliffs which at this distance appeared to impend over it coloring extremely beautiful contrasted as it was by the clearer and deeper tints of rocks wood and water nearer to the eye  as we approached andernach its situation seemed to be perpetually changing with the winding bank now it appeared seated on a low peninsula that nearly crossed the rhine overhung by romantic rocks but this vision vanished as we advanced and we perceived the town lying along a curving shore near the foot of the cliffs which were finely fringed with wood and at the entrance of extensive plains its towers seen afar would be signs of a considerable place to those who had not before been wearied of such symptoms by the towers of neuss and other german towns from a wooded precipice over the river we had soon after a fine retrospective glimpse of the valley its fantastic shores and long mountainous distance over which evening had drawn her sweetest coloring as we pursued the pass the heights on either hand gradually softened the country beyond showed remote mountains less wild and aspiring than those we had left and the blooming tint which had invested the distance deepened to a dusky purple and then vanished in the gloom of twilight the progressive influence of the hour upon the landscape was interesting and the shade of evening under which we entered andernach harmonized with the desolation and silence of its old walls and the broken ground around them we passed a drawbridge and a ruinous gateway and were sufficiently fatigued to be somewhat anxious as to our accommodation the english habit of considering toward the end of the days journey that you are not far from the cheerful reception the ready attendance and the conveniences of a substantial inn will soon be lost in germany there instead of being in good spirits during the last stage from such a prospect you have to consider whether you shall find a room not absolutely disgusting or a house with any eatable provision or a landlady who will give it you before the delay and the fatigue of an hundred requests have rendered you almost incapable of receiving it when your carriage stops at the inn you will perhaps perceive instead of the alacrity of an english waiter or the civility of an english landlord a huge figure wrapped in a great coat with a red worsted cap on his head and a pipe in his mouth stalking before the door this is the landlord he makes no alteration in his pace on perceiving you or if he stops it is to eye you with curiosity he seldom speaks never bows or assists you to alight and perhaps stands surrounded by a troop of slovenly girls his daughters whom the sound of wheels has brought to the door and who as they lean indolently against it gaze at you with rude curiosity and surprise  the drivers in germany are all bribed by the innkeepers and either by affecting to misunderstand you or otherwise will constantly stop at the door where they are best paid that this money comes out of your pocket the next morning is not the grievance the evil is that the worst inns give them the most and a traveller unless he exactly remembers his directions is liable to be lodged in all the vilest rooms of a country where the best hotels have no lodging so clean and no larder so wholesomely filled as those of every halfway house between london and canterbury when you are within the inn the landlord who is eager to keep though not to accommodate you will affirm that his is the inn you ask for or that the other sign is not in the place and as you soon learn to believe any thing of the wretchedness of the country you are unwilling to give up one lodging lest you should not find another  our driver after passing a desolate half filled place into which the gate of andernach opened entered a narrow passage which afterward appeared to be one of the chief streets of the place here he found a miserable inn and declared that there was no other but as we had seen one of a much better appearance we were at length brought to that and though with some delay were not ill accommodated for the night  andernach is an ancient town and it is believed that a tower which stands alone at one end of the walls was built by drusus of whom there are many traces in walls and castles intended to defend the colonies on this side of the rhine against the germans on the other the fortifications can now be of little other use than to authorize the toll which travelers pay for entering a walled town a tax on account of which many of the walls are supported though it is pretended that the tax is to support the walls by their means also the elector of cologne collects here the last of four payments which he demands for the privilege of passing the rhine from urdingen to andernach and this is the most southern frontier town of his dominions on the western side of the rhine which soon after join those of the elector of treves their length from hence to rheinberg is not less than ninety miles the breadth probably never more than twenty  there is some trade at andernach in tiles timber and millstones but the heaps of these commodities upon the beach are the only visible symptoms of the traffic for you will not see one person in the place moving as if he had business to attract him or one shop of a better appearance than an english hucksters or one man in the dress of a creditable trader or one house which can be supposed to belong to persons in easy circumstances the port contains perhaps half a dozen vessels clinker built in shape between a barge and a sloop on the quay you may see two or three fellows harnessing half a dozen horses to a tow line while twenty more watch their lingering maneuvers and this may probably be the mornings business of the town those who are concerned in it say that they are engaged in commerce  this or something like it is the condition as to trade of all the towns we saw in germany one or two excepted they are so far from having well filled or spacious repositories that you can scarcely tell at what houses there are any till you are led within the door you may then wait long after you are heard or seen before the owner if he has any other engagement thinks it necessary to approach you if he has what you ask for which he probably has not unless it is something very ordinary he tells the price and takes it with as much sullenness as if you were forcing the goods from him if he has not and can show you only something very different he then considers your enquiry as an intrusion and appears to think himself injured by having had the trouble to answer you what seems unaccountable in the manners of a german trader is that though he is so careless in attending you he looks as much distressed as vexed if you do not leave some money with him but he probably knows that you can be supplied no where else in the town and therefore will not deny himself the indulgence of his temper even when you are satisfied his manner is so ill that he appears to consider you his dependent by wanting something which he can refuse after perceiving that this is nearly general the pain of making continual discoveries of idleness and malignity becomes so much greater than the inconvenience of wanting any thing short of necessaries that you decline going into shops and wait for some easier opportunities of supplying whatever you may lose upon the road  coblentz it is one post from andernach hither over a road as good as any in england beyond the dominions of the elector of cologne the face of the country on this side of the rhine entirely changes its character the rocks cease at andernach and a rich plain commences along which the road is led at a greater distance from the rhine through corn lands and uninclosed orchards about a mile from andernach on the other side of the river the white town of neuwiedt the capital of a small protestant principality is seen and the general report that it is one of the most commercial places on the rhine appeared to be true from the cheerful neatness of the principal street which faces toward the water there were also about twenty small vessels lying before it and the quay seemed to be wide enough to serve as a spacious terrace to the houses the princes palace an extensive stone building with a lofty orangery along the shore is at the end of this street which as well as the greatest part of the town was built or improved under the auspices of his father a wise prince distinguished by having negotiated in      a peace between the empire and france when the continuance of the war had seemed to be inevitable the same benevolence led him to a voluntary surrender of many oppressive privileges over his subjects as well as to the most careful protection of commerce and manufactures accordingly the town of neuwiedt has been continually increasing in prosperity and size for the last fifty years and the inhabitants of the whole principality are said to be as much more qualified in their characters as they are happier in their conditions than those of the neighboring states but then there is the wretchedness of a deficiency of game in the country for the late prince was guilty of such an innovation as to mitigate the severity of the laws respecting it  the forest hills that rise behind neuwiedt and over the rocky margin of the river extend themselves toward the more rugged mountains of wetteravia which are seen a shapeless multitude in the east  the river is soon after lost to the view between high sedgy banks but near coblentz the broad bay which it makes in conjunction with the moselle is seen expanding between the walls of the city and the huge pyramidal precipice on which stands the fortress of ehrenbreitstein or rather which is itself formed into that fortress the moselle is here a noble river by which the streams of a thousand hills covered with vines pour themselves into the rhine the ancient stone bridge over it leads to the northern gate of coblentz and the entrance into the city is ornamented by several large chateaulike mansions erected to command a view of the two rivers a narrow street of high but ancient houses then commences and runs through the place those which branch from it extend on each side toward the walls immediately within which there are others that nearly follow their course and encompass the city being built between two rivers its form is triangular and only one side is entirely open to the land a situation so convenient both for the purposes of commerce and war that it could not be overlooked by the romans and was not much neglected by the moderns till the industry of maritime countries and the complicated constitution of the empire reduced germany in the scale of nations this was accordingly the station of the first legion and the union of the two rivers gave it a name confluentia at the commencement of the modern division of nations the successors of charlemagne frequently resided here for the convenience of an intercourse between the other parts of the empire and france but in the eleventh century the whole territory of treves regained the distinction as a separate country which the romans had given it by calling the inhabitants treveri  coblentz is a city of many spires and has establishments of chapters and monasteries which make the great pride of german capitals and are sometimes the chief objects that could distinguish them from the neglected villages of other countries the streets are not all narrow but few of them are straight and the same pavement serves for the horses of the elector and the feet of his subjects the port or beach has the appearance of something more business than that of andernach being the resort of passagevessels between mentz and cologne but the broad quay which has been raised above it is chiefly useful as a promenade to the visitors of a close and gloomy town beyond the terrace stands the electors palace an elegant and spacious stone edifice built to the height of three stories and enclosing a court which is large enough to be light as well as magnificent the front toward the rhine is simple yet grand the few ornaments being so well proportioned to its size as neither to debase it by minuteness nor encumber it by vastness an entablature displaying some allegorical figures in bas relief is supported by six doric columns which contribute much to the majestic simplicity of the edifice the palace was built about ten years since by the reigning elector who mentions in an inscription his attention to the architectural art and a fountain between the building and the town is inscribed with a few words which seem to acknowledge his subjects as beings of the same species with himself clemens winceslaus vicinis suis  but the most striking parts of the view from this quay are the rock and fortress of ehrenbreitstein that present themselves immediately before it on the other side of the river notwithstanding the breadth of which they appear to rise almost perpendicularly over coblentz at the base of the rock stands a large building formerly the palace of the electors who chose to reside under the immediate protection of the fortress rather than in the midst of their capital adjoining it is the village of ehrenbreitstein between which and coblentz a flying bridge is continually passing and with its train of subordinate boats forms a very picturesque object from the quay the fortress itself consists of several tier of low walls built wherever there was a projection in the rock capable of supporting them or wherever the rock could be hewn so as to afford room for cannon and soldiers the stone taken out of the mass served for the formation of the walls which in some places can scarcely be distinguished from the living rock above these tier which are divided into several small parts according to the conveniences afforded by the cliff is built the castle or citadel covering its summit and surrounded by walls more regularly continued as well as higher small towers somewhat in the ancient form defend the castle which would be of little value except for its height and for the gradations of batteries between it and the river thus protected it seems impregnable on that side and is said to be not much weaker on the other so that the garrison if they should be willing to fire upon coblentz might make it impossible for an enemy to remain within it except under the cover of very high entrenchments this is the real defense of the city for its walls would presently fall before heavy artillery and this it is believed might be preserved as long as the garrison could be supplied with stores  we crossed the river from the quay to the fortress by means of the very simple invention a flying bridge that by which part of the passage of the waal is made at nimeguen has been already mentioned this is upon the same principle but on a much larger scale after the barges upon which the platform is laid are clear of the bank the whole passage is effected with no other labor than that of the rudder a strong cable which is fastened to an anchor at each side of the river is supported across it by a series of small boats the bridge has two low masts one on each barge and these are connected at the top by a beam over which the cable is passed being confined so as that it cannot slip beyond them when the bridge is launched the rapidity of the current forces it down the rhine as far as the cable will permit having reached that point the force received from the current gives it the only direction of which it is capable that across the river with the cable which holds it the steersman manages two rudders by which he assists in giving it this direction the voyage requires nine or ten minutes and the bridge is continually passing the toll which for a foot passenger is something less than a penny is paid for the benefit of the elector at an office on the bank and a sentinel always accompanies the bridge to support his government during the voyage  the old palace of ehrenbreitstein deserted because of its dampness and from the fear of its being overwhelmed by the rock that sometimes scatters its fragments upon it is now used as a barrack and hospital for soldiers it is a large building even more pleasantly situated than the new one being opposite to the entrance of the moselle into the rhine and its structure which has been once magnificent denotes scarcely any other decay than all buildings will show after a few years neglect the rock has allowed little room for a garden but there are some ridiculous ornaments upon a very narrow strip of ground which was probably intended for one  the only entrance into the fortress on this side is by a road cut in the solid rock under four gateways it is so steep that we were compelled to decline the honor of admission but ascended it far enough to judge of the view commanded from the summit and to be behind the batteries of which some were mounted with large brass cannon coblentz lies beneath it as open to inspection as a model upon a table the sweeps of the rhine and the meanders of the moselle the one binding the plain the other intersecting it lead the eye toward distant hills that encircle the capacious level the quay of the city with the palace and the moving bridge form an interesting picture immediately below and we were unwilling to leave the rock for the dull and close streets of coblentz on our return the extreme nakedness of the new palace which is not sheltered by trees on any side withdrew our attention from the motley group of passengers mingled with hay carts and other carriages on the flying bridge  the long residence of the emigrant princes and noblesse of france in this city is to be accounted for not by its general accommodations or gaieties of which it is nearly as deficient as the others of germany but first by the great hospitality of the elector toward them and then by the convenience of its situation for receiving intelligence from france and for communicating with other countries the elector held frequent levies for the french nobility and continued for them part of the splendor which they had enjoyed in their own country the readiness for lending money upon property or employments in france was also so great that those who had not brought cash with them were immediately supplied and those who had were encouraged to continue their usual expenses we know it from some of the best possible authority that at the commencement of the march toward longwy money at four per cent was even pressed upon many and that large sums were refused  here and in the neighborhood between sixty and seventy squadrons of cavalry consisting chiefly of those who had formerly enjoyed military or other rank were formed each person being mounted and equipped chiefly at his own expense we heard several anecdotes of the confidence entertained in this army of a speedy arrival in paris but as the persons to whom they relate are now under the pressure of misfortune there would be as little pleasure as propriety in repeating them  at coblentz we quitted for a time the left bank of the rhine in order to take the watering place of selters in our way to mentz having crossed the river and ascended a steep road near the fortress we had fine glimpses of its walls bastions and outtowers and the heathy knolls around them with catches of distant country the way continued to lie through the dominions of the elector of treves which are here so distinguished for their wretchedness as to be named the siberia of germany it is paved and called a chaussee but those who have not experienced its ruggedness can have no idea of it except by supposing the pavement of a street torn up by a plough and then suffered to fix itself as it had fallen always steep either in ascent or descent it is not only the roughness that prevents your exceeding the usual postpace of three english miles an hour sometimes it runs along edges of mountains that might almost be called precipices and commands short views of other mountains and of valleys entirely covered with thick but not lofty forests sometimes it buries itself in the depths of such forests and glens sometimes the turrets of an old chateau peep above these but rather confirm than contradict the notion of their desolateness having been evidently built for the purposes of the chase and sometimes a mud village surprises you with a few inhabitants emblems of the misery and savageness of the country  these are the mountains of wetteravia the boundaries of many a former and farseen prospect then picturesque sublime or graceful but now desolate shaggy and almost hideous as in life that which is so grand as to charm at a distance is often found to be forlorn disgustful and comfortless by those who approach it  montabaur six hours after leaving coblentz we reached montabaur the first posttown on the road and distant about eighteen miles an ancient chateau not strong enough to be a castle nor light enough to be a good house commands the town and is probably the residence of the lord the walls and gates show the antiquity of montabaur but the ruggedness of its site should seem to prove that there was no other place in the neighborhood on which a town could be built though it is situated in a valley as to the nearer mountains it is constructed chiefly on two sides of a narrow rock the abrupt summit of which is in the center of this very little place  the appearance of montabaur is adequate in gloominess to that of several before seen but it would be endless to repeat as often as they should be true the descriptions of the squalidness and decay that characterise german towns nor should we have noticed these so often if the negligence of others in this respect had not left us to form deceitful expectations suitable to the supposed importance of several very conspicuous but really very wretched cities  limbourg over a succession of forest mountains similar to those just passed we came in the afternoon to limbourg another post town or perhaps city and another collection of houses like tombs or forsaken hospitals at an inn called the three kings we saw first the sullenness and then the ferocious malignity of a german landlord and his wife exemplified much more fully than had before occurred when we afterward expressed our surprise that the magistrates should permit persons of such conduct to keep an inn especially where there was only one we learned that this fellow was himself the chief magistrate or burgomaster of the place and his authority appeared in the fearfulness of his neighbors to afford any sort of refreshment to those who had left his inn one of the electors ministers with whom we had the pleasure to be acquainted informed us that he knew this man and that he must have been intoxicated for that though civil when sober he was madly turbulent and abusive if otherwise it appeared therefore that a person was permitted to be a magistrate who to the knowledge of government was exposed by his situation to be intoxicated and was outrageous whenever he was so so little is the order of society estimated here when it is not connected with the order of politics  near limbourg the forest scenery which had shut up the view during the day disappeared and the country lost at least an uniformity of savageness the hills continue but they are partly cultivated at a small distance from the town a steep ascent leads to a plain on which a battle was fought during the short stay of the french in this district in the campaign of       four thousand french were advancing toward limbourg a small prussian corpse drew up to oppose them and the engagement though short was vivid for the prussians did not perceive the superiority of the french in numbers till the latter began to spread upon the plain for the purpose of surrounding them being then compelled to retreat they left several of the electors towns open to contribution from which fiveandtwenty thousand florins were demanded but the remonstrances of the magistrates reduced this sum to  000 florins or about  00 l the french then entered limbourg and extended themselves over the neighboring country at weilbourg the residence of a prince of the house of nassau they required  00000 florins or   000 l which the prince neither had nor could collect in two days through his whole country all his plate horses coaches arms and six pieces of cannon were brought together for the purpose of removal but afterward two individuals were accepted as hostages instead of the prince himself who had been at first demanded the action near limbourg took place on the  th of november and before the conclusion of the month the french had fallen back to franckfort upon the reapproach of the prussian and austrian troops  selters we had a curiosity to see this place which under the name of seltzer is so celebrated throughout europe for its medicinal water though it is rather in the high road to franckfort than to mentz there seemed no probability of inconvenience in making this short departure from our route when it was to be joined again from a place of such public access as selters appeared likely to be found  about seven miles from limbourg a descent commences at the bottom of which stands this village what a reproof to the expectations of comfort or convenience in germany selters a spot to which a valetudinarian might be directed with the prospect of his finding not only abundant accommodation but many luxuries selters is literally and positively nothing more than an assemblage of miserable cottages with one inn and two houses for officers of the elector stuck in a dirty pass which more resembles a ditch than a road the village may be said to be near half a mile long because the huts being mostly separated from each other continue as far and this length would increase its inconvenience to invalids if such should ever stay there longer than to see it for there is nothing like a swept pathway and the road in which they must walk is probably always deeply covered with mud being so when we were there in the beginning of july there was then however not one stranger besides ourselves in the place and we found that very rarely any aggravate the miseries of sickness by a stay at selters  the only lodgings to be had are at the inn and fortunately for travelers this is not such as might be expected from the appearance of the village finding there the novelty of an obliging host and hostess we were very well contented to have reached it at night though we were to stay there also the next day being sunday the rooms are as good as those in the inns of german cities and three which are called court chambers having been used by the elector and lately by the king of prussia are better these are as open as the others to strangers  the spring is at the foot of one of several hills which immediately surround the village and is separated from the road by a small court yard an oaken covering at the height of ten or twelve feet prevents rain from falling into the wooden basin in which the stream rises and two or three of the electors guards watch over it that no considerable quantity may be taken without payment of the duty which forms a large part of his income many thousands of stone bottles are piled round this court and for the reputation of the spring care is taken to fill them as immediately as possible before their removal for exportation  the policy of keeping this income entire is said to be a motive for neglecting the condition of the village a duty could not well be demanded of those who should drink at the spring but is easily collected before the water is bottled for removal it is therefore not wished that there should be many visitors at selters we did not hear this reason upon the spot but it is difficult otherwise to account for a negligence which prevents the inhabitants of the neighboring country from being enriched at the expense of wanderers from others  nor is it only a duty but the whole profit of the traffic till the water leaves the place which rewards the care of the elector his office for the sale of it is established here and his agents alone transmit it into foreign countries the business is sufficient to employ several clerks and the number of bottles annually filled is so immense that having omitted to write it down we will not venture to mention it from memory the water is brought to table constantly and at an easy price in all the towns near the rhine mixed with rhenish wine and sugar it forms a delightful but not always a safe beverage in hot weather the acid of the wine expelling the fixed air of other ingredients occasions an effervescence like that of champagne but the liquor has not a fourth part of the obnoxious strength of the latter the danger of drinking it is that the acid may be too powerful for some constitutions  after being surprised by the desolateness of the village we were not less so to find amongst its few inhabitants one whose manners and information so far from bearing the character of the dreariness around him were worthy of the best society in the most intelligent cities this was the commissary and privy counselor of the elector for the district who having heard that there were some english visitors at the well very frankly introduced himself to us by his civilities and favored us with his company in the afternoon he had been in england with many valuable introductions and had formed from the talents and accomplishments of a distinguished marquis an high opinion of the national character a circumstance which probably united with his natural disposition in inducing him to emulate toward us the general politeness of that truly honorable person  when we enquired how the journey of the next day was to be performed it appeared that no other carriage could be hired in the place than a sort of onehorse chair which would take us to the next post town from whence we might proceed with the usual chaises the driver walked at the side of this uncouth carriage which had shafts and wheels strong enough for a wagon and either by the mistake or intention of his master in directing him we were led not to the post town for a chaise if it could be had but entirely through a forest country to mentz by roads made only for the woodcutters and as it afterward proved known to few others except to our ingenious voiturier we did not pass a town or village at which it was possible to change the carriage and had therefore no other alternative when the mistake was discovered than to return to selters or to proceed to mentz in this inconvenient and ludicrous vehicle we chose to proceed and had some reward for fatigue by passing nearly an whole day under the shade of deep and delightful forests little tamed by the hand of man and appearing to acknowledge only the seasons difference  between selters and these forests the country is well cultivated and frequently laid out in garden fields in which there was the first appearance ofcheerful labor we had seen in germany after passing a small town on the summit of a hill to the left still surrounded by its ancient fortifications we entered a large plain skirted on one side by villages another town at the end of which was almost the last sign of an inhabited country that appeared for several hours the forest then commenced and with the exception of one hamlet enveloped near the middle we saw nothing but lofty oaks elms and chestnuts till we emerged from it in the afternoon and came to a town of the landgrave of hesse darmstadt roebucks are said to be numerous and wild boars not very scarce in this forest but we saw none either here or in those near limbourg which are much inferior to this in beauty upon the whole it was a scene of perfect novelty without which it now seems that we should have wanted many ideas of sylvan life and much of the delight excited by shakespeares exquisite description of it  the country afterward opens toward  mentz which stands in a spacious plain on the opposite edge of the rhine and is visible at a considerable distance with its massy towers and numerous spires within two or three miles of the city the symptoms of ruin occasioned by the siege in      began to appear a village on the left had scarcely one house entire and the tower of the church was a mere wreck blackened by flames and with large chasms that admitted the light the road did not pass nearer to it than two miles but the broken walls and roofs were distinguishable even at that distance and sometimes a part which had been repaired contrasted its color with the black and smoky hues of the remainder this was the village of kostheim so often contended for in the course of the siege being on the opposite bank of the rhine to the city and capable of obstructing the intercourse with it by water  the country on the eastern side of the river was otherwise but little damaged if we except the destruction of numerous orchards for the allies were not strong enough to besiege the city on all sides at once and contented themselves with occupying some posts in this quarter capable of holding the garrison of cassel in awe  this cassel is a small village exactly opposite to mentz and communicating with it by a bridge of boats it was unfortified before the invasion of the french but these had no sooner entered the city than they perceived the importance of such a place and prepared themselves to render it a regular fortress in about two months they completely surrounded it with earthen works and outworks ditched and pallisadoed some of the nearest orchards were cut down to be used in these fortifications the fruit trees still remain with their branches upwards from the ditch and serve instead of chevaux de frise  the village of hockheim which is also on this side of the rhine is further to the left than kostheim and remains uninjured at the top of the round and easy hill the vines of which are so much celebrated for their flavor as to give a name to great quantities of wine produced in other districts after the siege the merchants of the neighborhood enhanced the price of their stocks by reporting that all the vineyards had been destroyed but the truth is that hockheim was not much contended for and that little damage was done even to the crops then in bloom the village is advantageously situated about the confluence of the rhine and the maine and if it had been nearer the city would probably have been so important as to have been contested till it was destroyed  this is the home ground of the scene which spreads before the traveller who approaches mentz from the eastern shore of the rhine furthest to the left is hockheim then the devastated village of kostheim then the fortifications of cassel which with the river are between him and the city beyond the horizon is bounded on all sides by gradual hills distant and apparently fruitful but those to the north are preeminent with gentle slopes at their feet colored sweetly by corn dark wood and gleams of reddish earth  the works of cassel render the approach to the city very tedious for they have been so contrived as that the road nearly follows them in all their angles for the purpose of being commanded by many points at once the village was now garrisoned by prussians of whom some were lying under the sheds of their guardhouse near the bridge and others were riding over it with just speed enough to give one an idea of military earnestness their horses shook the floor of the bridge of boats which here crosses the rhine at its breadth of nearly eight hundred feet and disturbed the promenade for which it is usually frequented in an evening we followed them admiring the expanse and rapidity of the river more than the appearance of the city where gloominess is too much mingled with grandeur till at the end of the bridge we were stopped at another guardhouse to answer the usual enquiries a soldier accompanied us thence to a large square filled with cannon and mortars where the captain of the guard examined our passport we were then very glad to pass the evening at an inn without further researches but there were some symptoms of the late condition of the city to attract attention in the way  the electors palace which forms one side of this square having been converted into an hospital by the french is still used as such or as a barrack by the prussians and the windows were crowded with the figures of halfdressed soldiers many of the cannon in the square remained with the fractures made by the balls of the besiegers this place communicates with a broad street in which were many buildings filled with soldiers and an handsome house that having belonged to one of the clubbists was destroyed immediately after the expulsion of the french the walls still remain bare and open some greater ruins occasioned by fire during the siege were visible at a distance and upon the whole we had interest enough excited as to the immediate history of the place to take little notice of the narrow and difficult passages through which we wound for half an hour after leaving the principal street  the next morning the friends to whom we had letters began to conduct us through the melancholy curiosities left in the city by the siege these are chiefly in the southern quarter against which the direct attack of the allies was made and their approaches most advanced some entire streets have been destroyed here and were still in ruins a magnificent church attached to a convent of franciscan monks is among the most lamentable spectacles what was the roof now lies in heaps over the pavement not a vestige of furniture or decoration has escaped the flames and there are chasms in the walls larger than the noble windows that once illuminated them this church and convent were set on fire by a bomb and of the sick soldiers who were lodged in the latter it is feared that but few were removed before the destruction of the building we next saw the remains of a palace built by the present provost of the chapter of nobles an institution which is so rich that their superior had a more elegant residence than the elector it was of stone and the principal front was in the corinthian order six columns of which supported a spacious open gallery ornamented with statues for its whole length the wings formed two sides of a square which separated the palace from the street a profusion of the richest furniture and a valuable collection of paintings filled the interior of the whole edifice little now remains but the shattered walls of the center which have been so scorched as to lose all appearance of having belonged to a splendid structure it was burnt the night before the fire of the franciscan church and two nights after the french had removed their head quarters and their municipality from it on the day before the removal a bomb had fallen upon the french general blou destroying him on the spot and mortally wounding an officer with whom he was conversing the ruins are now so accumulated over the courtyard that we could not discern it to have ever had that appendage of a distinguished residence  but the church of notre dame was the most conspicuous of many ruined objects the steeple of this had been one of the grandest ornaments of the city a shower of bombs set fire to it and while it was thus rendered an easy mark for the besiegers their cannon played upon and beat a great part of it to the ground by its fall the roof of the church was shattered but the body did not otherwise suffer any material injury wooden galleries have been raised round the remainder of the steeple not for the purpose of repairing but for that of entirely removing it and to save the trouble of letting down the stones on the outside a wooden pipe or channel has been made through which they are lowered into the church the appearance of this steeple which was once very large and lofty is rendered striking by these preparations for its total destruction  the whole church is built of a stone dug from the neighboring hills the color of which is so delicate a pink that it might be supposed to be given by art the electors palace and several other public buildings in the city are formed of this stone  passing through the gates on this side of mentz we came to a slope near the river and beyond the glacis of the place which was then partly covered with huge masses of stone scattered among the roots of broken trees and shrubs that had begun again to shoot their verdure over the amputated trunks this was the site of a palace of the elector called both from the beauty of its situation and the splendor of its structure la favorita the apartments of the palace and the terraces of the garden commanded extensive views of the rhine and the surrounding country ascending from its banks and the gardens themselves were so beautifully disposed as to be thought worthy of the name of english they were ornamented with pavilions which had each its distinct prospect and with one music room in the thickest part of the shrubbery of the building nothing is now visible but some disjointed stones and of the garden only the broken trunks of trees the palace was burned and the gardens levelled by the french that they might not afford shelter to the prussians during the siege  from this spot we were shown the positions of the allied forces the course of their approaches and the chief outworks of the city hockheim kostheim and cassel lay before us on the other side of the river a gentle rise on this side at the distance of nearly a mile was the first station of the allies part of whose force was covered behind it their last batteries were within two hundred and fifty paces of the city the ground had been since levelled and was now covered with standing corn but the track of the trenches was in some places visible on the other hand the forts in which the strength of the whole so much consists were completely repaired and had no appearance of having been so lately attacked they are five in number and being raised at a considerable distance from the walls of the city no near approaches can be made till some of them are either taken or destroyed for they are said to be regular and strong fortifications capable of containing numerous garrisons and communicating with the city itself by passages cut in the ground through which they may be constantly reinforced  only one of these five forts that nearest to the river was destroyed in the late siege which would have been much more tedious but for the want of provisions and medicines that began to be felt in the garrison the walls of the city were almost uninjured so that it has not been thought necessary to repair them in the few places where balls may be perceived to have struck the bombardment was the chief annoyance of the garrison who were not sheltered in caserns and whose magazines both of ammunition and provision were frequently destroyed by it their numbers were also greatly reduced by sallies and by engagements on the other side of the rhine in defense of cassel or in attack of part of an island called the bleiau  we walked round the city upon what is termed the glacis that is upon the slope which ascends from the plain toward the top of the ditch and which is the furthest of the defensive works being very gradually raised that those who are upon it may be exposed at every step to the fire from the walls the forts which are formed of solid earthen works covered with turf would scarcely attract the notice of an unmilitary eye if the channelled passages to them did not issue from this slope and if the sentinels stalking upon the parapets did not seem of a gigantic size by having their whole figures raised against the light  mentz was at this time the depot of stores for the prussian army on the rhine and there were persons employed upon the glacis in counting heaps of cannon balls which had been delivered from some neighboring foundery on the bank of the river others were throwing waggonloads of hay into large barges on which it was piled to such an height that small passages were cut through it for the rowers to work in there were nine or ten barges so filled and in these labors more activity was apparent than in any other transactions we saw at mentz  having passed round the city between the walls and the forts which protect them to the north west and south we came at this latter side to some other signals of a theater of war here had been a noble alley of at least a mile and a half long formed of poplars as large and high as elms and surrounded on each side by plantations intersected by small and irregular walks being led along the banks of the rhine this alley with its adjoining groves afforded a most delightful promenade and was classed amongst the best ornaments given to the river in its whole course this also was destroyed upon the approach of the besiegers that it might not afford them shelter the trunks of the sturdy trees cut at the height of one or two feet from the ground show by their solidity and the abundance of their vigorous shoots how long they might have flourished but for this disaster  an englishman walking amidst the ensigns of such artificial and premature desolation cannot help considering the natural security of his country and rejoicing that even if the strong and plain policy of neglecting all foreign consequence and avoiding all foreign interests except the commercial ones which may be maintained by a navy should for ever be rejected still his home cannot be invaded and though the expense of wars should make poverty general the immediate horrors of them cannot enter the cities or the cottages of an island  great part of our time at mentz was occupied by enquiries concerning the siege which was not so much a topic as we had expected to find it we probably heard however all that was to be told and had a german pamphlet recommended containing the history of the place from the first invasion of the french to their departure the authenticity of this was assured to us and it is partly from it partly from the accounts given by our friends that the following short narrative has been extracted  of mentz in      and      the entrance of a french army into worms in the beginning of october      had excited a considerable alarm in mentz before the inhabitants of the latter city received the accounts which were not long wanting of express and avowed preparations for a march toward them great numbers of french emigrants had been drawn to the city by the meeting of the emperor and the king of prussia there a few months before many had arrived since the dissolution of their army in champagne and during the approach of the republican troops to spires and worms families were continually passing through the city joining those who began to take their flight from it the narrow streets were filled with carriages and the distressful haste of the travelers served to depress the spirits of the inhabitants who saw how little their city was thought capable of defense on the   th of october baron dalbini a counselor of the court called the burgesses together and admonished them to make preparations for their security he also enquired whether they thought it prudent that the elector should remain in the city with them and it being readily answered that they did not the elector set out for wurtzburg a town about  00 miles distant and was followed by the members of the government at the same time a considerable emigration of the other inhabitants took place  the approach of the french had been so little foreseen till within the few last weeks that the garrison did not amount to a tenth part of the war complement the inhabitants however having happily had little experience of sieges did not know what this complement should be and after the first alarm began to think the deficiency might be easily remedied the electoral troops having sent some useless detachments to spires amounted to only     men to whom an hundred were added obtained from nassau oranien weilburg bieberich and fuld by the electors demands of assistance from his neighbors two hundred and seven austrian hussars of esterhazy had also arrived on the   th and all the inhabitants of the rheingau a populous district bordering upon the rhine were summoned to the assistance of the capital the ancient society of archers of the city laid down their bows for muskets the academicians formed themselves into a corpse and were placed together with the archers at several outposts the traders though exempt from personal service and unwilling to surrender that privilege resolved to pay double watchmoney for substitutes it began to be thought that the threatened progress of the french had been untruly reported that the siege could not be commenced at that late season of the year and lastly that some promised reinforcements of austrian troops could not be far off  but on the   th of october the french in four columns began to surround the place they wore at first white cockades expecting to be mistaken for the army of m de conde they were however known and fired upon though some days had been passed in preparation it was now found that there was little readiness for defense the best artillerymen had been lost at spires there were at first no horses to draw the cannon so that oxen were used for that purpose the nearest balls to the batteries of twentyfour pound cannon were cast for twelvepounders and many of the musket cartridges could not be fired in a few hours however several of the artisans applied themselves to the making of cartridges horses were supplied by the servants of the court and the nobility and all hands were in some way or other employed it was then reported that a corpse of austrian troops was in the neighborhood and on the   th   00 men entered the city these were recruits without ammunition and for the most part without arms being on their march to join the army of the emperor they were then under the command of two or three subalterns but some other imperial officers came in from the neighborhood and arms were obtained from the electors arsenal after this reinforcement there were probably about four thousand men in arms in the city  with this force it is allowed that a much longer defense than was made might have been expected and unless there was some failure of the commanders attention the treachery of an engineer to whom the surrender is imputed could certainly not have been so effectual eikenmayer this engineer had it seems made known to the french the commanders preparations for defense intelligence which if the preparations had been greater could have been but little serviceable to the assailants his chief assistance was afforded to them by much more conspicuous means for as the inhabitants went frequently to a building called st stephens tower to observe the progress of the besiegers he assured them that the army which really amounted only to eleven thousand men consisted of forty thousand that they had with them twoandtwenty wagons laden with scaling ladders and that the city would presently be taken by storm the same representations of the besiegers force were also made by him to the council of war and these it is said determined them to the surrender before the french had raised a battery against the works  many of the citizens however were surprised and enraged at this resolution and the captain of the austrian reinforcements expressed his displeasure at the council house where he declared that he would continue to defend the place even without permission in the mean time the capitulation was signed and he was induced to submit to it by the solicitations even of the citizens by whom it was blamed and by their representations that in the present agitated temper of the inhabitants all attempts at defense must be useless  baron dalbini carried news of the surrender to the elector at wurtzburg and about five oclock on the   st of october two french officers came to the council house followed by two companies of grenadiers on the   d eight thousand french entered the city the other three thousand having marched the preceding day to franckfort the inhabitants astonished to find themselves taken by so small a force now saw to their still greater surprise that their conquerors had scarcely any heavy cannon this day was passed in assigning quarters to the troops and on the next custine the commander of the french called the members of the city council together to whom in a short speech he promised the protection of persons and properties inviting them at the same time to promote the fraternization of the inhabitants with the french nation professor bohmer who had accepted the office of his secretary translated this address into german and it was circulated through the city  it is remarkable that the french had no sooner taken possession of this sudden prize than they began to foresee the probability of being reduced to defensive measures and to prepare for them they immediately collected contributions of forage and corn from the neighboring villages the streets were rendered almost impassable by the loads brought in and as the magazines were soon filled great quantities were wasted by being exposed to the rain in gardens and trodden under the feet of horses in the streets the garrison was soon increased to  0000 men of whom sometimes three hundred sometimes five hundred were lodged in each convent the french soldiery having committed some excesses custine reproved their licentiousness and began to habituate them to discipline by ordering a retirement to their quarters at certain hours by beat of drum  the inhabitants soon began to suspect the contrivance and the persons that had produced the surrender for eikenmayer lived in intimacy with custine professor metternich of the academy of mentz mounted the french cockade and the electors physician having left the city upon a promise of assisting some peasants whom he asserted to be seized with an infectious fever had carried on a correspondence with the french as had patoki a merchant born at colmar who had lately received the right of citizenship  the palaces of the elector and the provost were now ransacked and though it had been published as a rule that the property of private individuals should not be touched the houses of the nobility were treated as if they had belonged to the prince the profligacy and pride of custine became every day more conspicuous and were oppressive upon the garrison as well as the inhabitants though in a less degree johannesberg a village upon the rhine at the distance of a few miles is celebrated for its wines which fell for three times the price of those of hockheim custine sent a part of the garrison solely to bring him the wines from the cellars of the prince of fuld who has a palace there but a compromise being proposed the negotiation was protracted so long that a prussian corpse for which the prince had sent carried johannesberg before the terms were concluded the prince saved his money and lost only eighteen barrels of wine of which part was sent to paris and the rest supplied the entertainments given by custine  those of the germans who attached themselves to custine supplied him with information of the state of the whole country his secretary professor bohmer had begun the institution of a club so early as the   d of october but this society is thought to have become inconvenient and they soon after began to prepare for a national convention in mentz  in the mean time cassel was surveyed and the fortifications for which eikenmayer is said to have furnished the design were commenced the neighboring peasants were summoned to work at these at the price of fifteen french sous or about seven pence halfpenny a day and intrenchments were thrown round kostheim  on the   th of december custine published a proclamation in which he stated that whereas some persons had supposed the king of prussia to have so little respect for his character as to have invited him to a surrender none should presume on pain of death to speak of such a measure in future this proclamation gave the inhabitants of mentz information that the prussians were approaching some german troops had indeed begun by degrees to occupy the ground about coblentz but in a condition which did not promise active measures being weakened by a long march and by sickness the hessians posted themselves between hanau and franckfort and the prussians advanced so near to the latter city that the scattered parties of the french retired to and at length lost it  about this time an electoral professor of philosophy and a canon of mentz named dorsel who had left his posts in the preceding year to be naturalized at strasbourg returned with a design for an union of spires worms and mentz into one territory under the protection of the french he procured the substitution of a municipality for the city council he obtained considerable influence in the city and on the  st of january      when the three commissioners of the convention reubell merlin and haussman entered mentz and were received by custine with military honors they showed more attention to the professor than to the general  the prussian head quarters had been established within a short distance of mentz but during all december there had been only affairs of advanced posts so that some tranquillity prevailed in the city on the  th of january hockheim was assailed by six thousand prussians the french however had been informed of the preparations for attack and had time to retire to kostheim and cassel leaving     prisoners and twelve pieces of cannon some french who had concealed themselves in the church tower were thrown headlong from it for having shouted or thrown stones at the king of prussia as he passed  after this another month passed without hostile attempts on either side the prussian troops were refreshed by rest the french passed the same time partly in balls to which all the ladies of mentz were invited and partly in preparations for defense on the   th of january a small tree of liberty which had been planted in november was removed and a fir seventy feet high placed in its stead with much ceremony all the inhabitants were pressingly invited upon this occasion messrs reubell merlin haussman and custine attended the mayor municipality and the members of the clubs followed the ensigns of the former government were burned custine called upon the music of the garrison for french airs which occupied the rest of the day and the evening concluded with entertainments and dancing soon after the commissioners left the city and proceeded on a journey to the moselle  on the   th of february custine published a proclamation and two new commissioners who had just arrived issued another founded upon a decree of the french convention relative to the union of other countries with france the council house was full from morning till night the assembled traders declared their adherence to the germanic system and the new commissioners seemed inclined to listen to their remonstrances but when the three former commissioners returned they treated the deputies of the trades with great haughtiness and refused them permission to send agents to paris a second deputation on the   d of february was no better received and they were informed that the   th was the day for the commencement of the new form the traders are described to have been much affected at the return of their deputies on the   d of february early in the morning the author of a remonstrance which had been presented was arrested and carried into banishment being accompanied by guards to the advanced posts of the prussians at hockheim  the inhabitants now began to leave the city by passports which were however not easily procured or used a proclamation by the municipality divided mentz into sections and directed the manner in which each section should elect a representative on the   th on that day the streets were unusually silent all the former burgesses having resolved to remain in their houses except one and only     persons met to take the new oath and to make the new elections on the   th another proclamation came out and several banishments succeeded but the burgesses still adhered to their resolution the municipality on the  st of march again invited them to take the new oaths and gave notice of an order of the commissioners to the mayor to publish a list of the sworn and unsworn on the monday or tuesday following notwithstanding this the number of sworn did not equal   0  some of the neighboring villages which were visited by the french commissioners accepted their terms the greater part refused them  at worms where clubs similar to those at mentz had been formed  0   persons took the oaths the inhabitants of bingen refused them  in the mean time some expeditions were made into the palatinate and corn to the amount of sixty thousand florins was taken away before the reiterated remonstrances of the palatine resident at mentz upon the subject of his masters neutrality could restrain them in the first days of february the french had also entered deux ponts where the duke relied so much upon his having supplied only his contingent to the treasure of the empire that he had not left his palace though he knew of their approaches to his country on the  th at eleven at night the duke and duchess fled with the utmost precipitation to manheim having left the palace only one hour before the french entered it great quantities of forage were swept away from this country and brought to mentz which the allies now approached so nearly that the garrison hastily completed the fortifications of cassel and filled the magazines with stores left the communication should be cut off by the destruction of the bridge  on the   th of february they had begun to destroy the palace of la favorita and to erect a battery upon its ruins though the carriage of provisions now occupied so much of their attention a great number of large and small cannon were brought from landau fresh troops arrived and general wimpfen who had defended thionville against the king of prussia was declared the first in command by banishments and emigration the number of persons in the city was reduced fifteen thousand  the new national assembly met in mentz on the  0th of march that city having chosen six deputies spires two worms two and some other places one each on the   th they had their first sitting and on the   th declared all the country between landau and bingen which places were then the limits of the french posts near the rhine united in one independent state on the   th was agitated the great question relative to the connections of this state and it was not till the   st that they declared their incorporation with the french three deputies forster patoki and lucks were appointed the next day to carry this resolution to paris and several decrees relative to the interior administration of this state were passed in consequence of which many persons were conducted over the bridge into banishment on the  0th  accounts now arrived that the siege would shortly commence and orders were issued relative to the prevention of fires to the collection of stores of provisions by each family and to several other domestic particulars all the inhabitants those especially in the neighborhood of the granaries were directed to preserve large quantities of water and the proprietors of gardens within the city were ordered to plant them with herbs officers were sent round to examine these gardens already each family had been admonished to provide subsistence for seven months and the richer class were now directed to furnish a loan to the burgesses that the latter might be enabled to provide for the poor in consequence of this order       florins  0 creitzers or about   00 l were collected and expended for provisions the gardens and walks round the city were now dismantled of their trees of which those in the rheinallee before mentioned were an hundred years old all the summerhouses and villas within cannonshot of the city were destroyed  on the  th of march the french garrison in the fortress of konigstein which the prussians had blockaded for some months surrendered in this month also other advances were made toward mentz the prussian general schonfield brought   000 men into the neighborhood of hockheim near which the saxons were posted the king of prussia his son and the duke of brunswick who had passed part of the winter at franckfort left it on the   d of march a bridge was laid at st goar over which numerous bodies of prussian troops passed the rhine the french fell back toward bingen and the prussians occupied a hill not far from it on the   th they were closer pressed and left all the villages in the neighborhood of bingen from which place they were driven the next day by a bombardment  at the same time a similar retreat toward mentz also took place from the southward at worms during the abandonment great quantities of hay and straw were burned and the burgesses kept watch all night dreading the conflagration of the whole city by the flames rising from the magazines immense masses of hay and straw were also burned at frankenthal where there had been a garrison during the whole winter but the corn was carried away at spires early on the   st of march the burgesses and troops were employed in throwing the hay and straw from the magazines into the ditch but it appeared that even this mode would not be expeditious enough and fire was at length set to the whole store at once  in the retreat from oppenheim though the french were under considerable difficulties they were upon the point of obtaining what they would have thought an abundant reward for them it was on the  0th of march that their cavalry and flying artillery took the road by alsheim as this was a place capable of making some defense and there were prussian troops visible at the gates they began the attack by planting cannon and directing a vigorous fire upon it the king of prussia who was at dinner in the town and had not an hundred men with him received his first intelligence of their approach from this fire he immediately rode out on the opposite side and sending some hussars to the spot the french did not continue the contest but made their retreat by another road if they had known how few troops were in the town they would of course have entered it without commencing this fire and the prussian officers agree that if they had done so there would have been little chance of saving their monarch had they been aware also that his prussian majesty was there they might have reduced this slight chance to an impossibility for they were sufficiently numerous to have surrounded the town and had approached so quietly that they were not known to be near it the prussians had no cannon and the french were otherwise greatly superior though having no other purpose for entering the town than to continue their retreat they did not wait to contest it but retired by another road that a circumstance which would have had such an effect upon the affairs of europe should have depended upon so slight a chance as this we could not have believed if the story had not been confirmed to us by ample authority  the garrison of mentz was increased by these retreats to   000 men general kalkreuth who commanded the blockade from laubenheim to budenheim a distance of twelve miles had only   000 men general schonfield with his corpse of observation was at hockheim the besiegers however presently amounted to  0000 men it is remarkable that though the french retreated from several quarters at once and in many small columns not one of these was effectually interrupted by the prussian commander  upon intelligence of these advances the elector of mentz paid a visit to the king of prussia at his head quarters and left his minister the baron dalbini to attend to the affairs of the recovered places  in the beginning of april the blockade was more closely pressed and the preparations for the siege seriously commenced general doyre was made commander in the city with a council of sixteen persons to assist him in restoring the means of its defense a person was placed at the top of an high building called stephens tower with glasses which enabled him to overlook the country for nine miles round he had a secretary with him that his view might never be unnecessarily diverted and was obliged to make a daily report of his observations the beating of drums and ringing of bells were forbidden throughout the whole city that the besiegers might not know in what quarters the corpse de guard were placed or what churches were left without the military all prospect houses and trees within the walls which could serve as marks to the fire without were ordered to be demolished many days were passed in bringing further stores of provisions into the city after which an account of the stock was taken and there were found to be   0 0 sacks of wheat      of other corn     of mixed grain   of which       sacks it was stated that   0 0 sacks of meal could be made to this was to be added in sifted meal of wheat  0  sacks of other corn    sacks of mixed grain  00   sacks making in all    00 sacks of meal there were besides     0 rations of biscuit      pounds of rice   0   of dried herbs   of forage there were  0  0 quintals of hay     0 of straw      sacks of oats   0  of barley   the council estimated that the garrison had corn enough for nine months rice for seven and herbs for six there were fifteen hundred horses and it was reckoned that the straw was enough for ten months the oats for fourandtwenty days and the barley for eighty days the garrison was numbered and found to consist of       persons of whom to each soldier was allotted for the future    ounces of bread per day in lieu of    and   ounces of fresh meat or   ounces of salt in lieu of   ounces of fresh the allowance of the sick in the hospitals was changed from twelve to eight ounces  during these preparations for a long siege the diminution of the number of inhabitants by means of the clubs was pursued on the  th of april all persons not useful to the army were ordered to leave the city unless they would take the new oath at the same time it was said that on account of the foreseen want of money the soldiers employed on the works would be no longer paid but the other workmen would continue to receive their salaries  the garrison made their first sortie on the night of the  0th and   th proceeding toward the rhine kostheim was immediately taken and the attack upon the hessians succeeded at first but a reinforcement compelled the french to retire about this time the commissioner reubell went to oppenheim where he delivered a proposal for peace to the king of prussia  the village of weissenau was contended for on the   th   th and   th and finally destroyed the french soldiers who remained upon the spot subscribing   0 livres for the inhabitants  on the   th nearly the whole of a french convoy of  0 wagons was taken by the prussians on the  0th the imperialists erected a small fort on a point of land near the main and the french on the other hand perfected a battery at kostheim with which they set on fire some stables  the price of provisions was already so much increased in the city that salt butter cost    creitzers or   d pence per pound  in the night of the   th and   th the french landed in three vessels and destroyed a battery erected near the main on the  st of may at one in the morning they attacked the prussians at hockheim and set the village of kostheim on fire the prussians repulsed them with loss but they remained in kostheim notwithstanding the fire which continued for three days they were then expelled by the prussians but soon returned with reinforcements and a sanguinary contest commenced at the end of which they continued to be masters of the village a numerous garrison was placed in it which on the  th was again attacked by the prussians but without effect thus the greatest part of may was spent in contests for villages and posts in which the french were generally the assailants in the night of the  0th they beat up in three columns the prussian head quarters at marienborn having marched barefooted and with such exact information that they passed all the batteries unperceived they entered the village itself without resistance and it is supposed would have surprised the commander if they had not fired at his windows beat their drums and begun to shout vive la nation three balls which entered the apartment of general kalkreuth admonished him to quit it and a sentinel stepped up just in time to shoot a french soldier who had seized him prince louis ferdinand of prussia immediately arrived with some troops and the french began to retire leaving thirty prisoners and twenty killed of  000 engaged in the enterprise the loss of the prussians was considerable amongst the rest captain voss a relative of mademoiselle voss well known in the court of prussia  on the  th of june the allowance to the garrison was ordered to be two pounds of bread and one bottle of wine for each soldier per day  in the night of the  th and  th the cannonade was very fierce on both sides in mentz a powder magazine was fired by a bomb and blew up with a dreadful explosion  the scarceness of provisions increased so that a pound of fresh butter cost six shillings horseflesh began to be consumed in many families  on the night of the  th and  0th of june the garrison made four sorties which ended in considerable loss on both sides and in the retirement of the french into the city on the  0th they attacked at eight in the morning a post near gonsenheim retreating without loss after killing an officer and several men this was their first sally in open daylight  general meusnier who had been wounded near cassel on the  th died on the   th and was buried the next day within the new fortifications all the officers of the garrison with the members of the convention and clubs attending  some fire ships were now completed which a dutch engineer had conducted from holland to be employed by the besiegers in burning the bridge of boats over the rhine it was thought however that their explosion would damage the city unnecessarily and they were rejected in the night of the   th one of these floated down the river whether by accident or by the connivance of the inventor is not known the inhabitants were in the utmost terror but it struck against the quay and being immediately boarded did no damage  the trenches were opened in the night of the   th and   th but the workmen having been ill conducted were not covered in at daylight and were compelled to retire leaving their implements behind them two nights afterward the work was renewed in good order and without loss the king of prussia his sons and the duke of brunswick surveying them from a neighboring height the first balls fell in a street near one of the gates and all that part of the town was presently deserted  the   th was a distressful day for the inhabitants four days before the king of prussia had sent a general passport for such as chose to come out and   00 persons chiefly women and children had accepted his offer a short time after the gate had been opened dismay was spread through the whole city by an account that the prussians would suffer no more to pass and the french none to return the bridge was covered with these unhappy fugitives who had no food or shelter and who thought themselves within reach of the hockheim batteries that played furiously upon the city two children lost their senses through fright at length the french soldiers took compassion upon them they carried several persons into the city under their cloaks and the next day their remonstrances against the inhumanity of the german clubbists who had shut the gates against this defenseless crowd obliged them to permit the return of the whole number  for several succeeding nights the garrison made sorties with various effect interrupting but not preventing the completion of the parallel  at sunset on the   th the besiegers began a dreadful cannonade and bombardment on this night the steeple of the church of notre dame caught fire and during the alarm excited by an immense volume of flame arising in the midst of the city the austrians completely carried the french posts near weissenau the next night was equally terrible to the inhabitants the flames caught several parts of the city amongst others the cathedral some of the magazines took fire and eleven hundred sacks of corn were burned the church formerly belonging to the jesuits was much injured the french intending to retaliate their last surprise upon the austrians made a fruitless attack upon the weissenau redoubt  on the   th of june at midday the french were driven from a point of land near the main called the bleiau in this affair a vessel with    prussians on board drove from her anchor owing to the unskilfulness of the crew and during a fire by which eight men were killed made toward the city the prussians were taken prisoners and exchanged the next day at night the bombardment was renewed the domprobstei or palace of the provost was burned and several of the neighboring residences in other parts of the city some houses were reduced to ashes  the next night the church of the franciscans and several other public buildings were destroyed a dreadful fire on the night of the  d and  th of june consumed the chapel of st alban families in the southern part of the city now constantly passed the night in their cellars in the daytime they ventured into their usual apartments for the batteries of the besiegers were by far the most terrible at night when the whole city was a sufficient mark for them though their works could scarcely be discerned by the garrison in the daytime the exactness of the french gunners frequently did great injury to the batteries which at night were repaired and used with equal effect against the city  st albans fort was now demolished so that the besieged withdrew their cannon from it elizabeth fort was also much damaged a strong work which the french had raised in prolongation of the glacis divided the opinions of the prussian engineers some thought it should be preserved when taken because it would command part of the town others that it should be demolished the latter opinion prevailed and in the night of the  th and  th general manstein was ordered to make the attack with three battalions he perfectly succeeded as to the nearest part of the work but the other on account of its solid foundation could not be entirely destroyed in the mean time two battalions were sent under cover of the darkness to attack the zahlbach fort a part of which they carried by storm but the reinforcements immediately supplied by the garrison obliged them to retire two prussian officers were killed one wounded and another with oneandthirty men taken the prussians lost in all    men the french had twelve killed and fortyseven wounded  on the  th of july the french repaired the damaged fort the distance of it from the prussians preventing the latter from hindering them  at night general kleist carried the fort at zahlbach by a second attack and demolished it at the same time some batteries of the second parallel were perfected the french could not support the loss of this fort on the  th they attacked the site carried it after a severe contest and rebuilt it at night they were driven back again and the fort entirely destroyed in the same night they were driven from kostheim after a furious battle by the prussian general schonfield during this engagement the rapid succession of flashes and explosion of bombs seemed to fill the air with flame a prussian detachment having been posted on the road to cassel in order to prevent the garrison of that place from sending succor to kostheim this road was so strongly bombarded by the french that seven bombs were frequently seen in the air at once the loss was great on both sides in this engagement after which the council in the city resolved to make no more attempts upon kostheim on account of the distance  the following night the fire was less than usual but a few bombs and grenades fell in the city where the inhabitants had now learned to extinguish such as grounded before their fusees were consumed they also formed themselves into parties for the ready suppression of fires the next morning the garrison saw the works of the besiegers brought to within two hundred and fifty paces of the walls  about this time the sickliness of the garrison became apparent and general doyre informed the council that on account of this and of the fatiguing service of the works he feared the defense could not be much longer continued he lamented that the troops of the line were so few and the others so inexperienced  for several nights the works of the besiegers were eagerly pushed but still they were not so forward as had been expected some of the besieging corpse began to be sickly the king of prussia having resolved to employ no more laborers it was reckoned that the soldiers for eightandforty hours of work had only eighteen of rest on the other hand they were assured that the garrison must be equally fatigued since in such an extensive fortification none could be left long unemployed  the french had been for some time busied in forming what is called a fleche at the head of one of their forts and this was thought necessary to be destroyed it was attacked in the night of the   th and   th by the austrians but so much time was passed in their operations that the french fell upon them in great force about two in the morning and beat them away with loss the austrians were as little employed as possible in services of this sort  on the   th of july another battery was stormed by the prussians but as the officer unlike the austrians advanced with too little caution his party was much hurt by some pieces of concealed cannon and the enterprise failed  the night of the   th and   th was passed in much agitation by the garrison and inhabitants several of the public buildings were set fire to and burned by grenades the works of the besiegers were now greatly advanced the garrison made five sorties in this night and were repulsed in all losing an hundred men while the besiegers lost eight killed and oneandthirty wounded  on the   th of july a cessation of arms took place from seven oclock in the morning till one in the city the french celebrated their annual fete general doyre and the troops took the oath and merlin delivered an address to them in the austrian camp the prince de conde was received with a feu de joye during this cessation the soldiers upon the different outposts entered into conversation with each other and the french boasted of the difficulties they labored under from the length of the siege  at night an affair at the fleche cost the allies who succeeded in part ninety men the french confessed that this work cost them in all three hundred the inhabitants of the city were again greatly alarmed their streets being covered with a shower of grenades the laboratory and a part of the benedictine abbey were burned and two explosions took place at the former the whole city shook with each report and in the nearer parts all the windows were broken and the doors burst open the remainder of the hay and straw was consumed in this fire the whole stock of other forage was reduced to a sufficiency for four days and the surgeons stores were much damaged  still the fleche prevented the besiegers from completing their second parallel it was therefore again attacked on the night of the   th and   th prince louis ferdinand of prussia commanding at the assault in which he was one of twelve officers wounded the fleche was then completely carried  the next night was very industriously spent by the besiegers in forming new batteries and those of the second parallel were raised before there were cannon enough at hand to place upon them the french took advantage of this and brought a part of theirs to bear so as to enfilade the parallel with great effect the prussians almost immediately losing an officer and forty men  in the city the sick had now increased so much that six hundred men were brought from cassel on the   th to reinforce the garrison on the   th the commandant informed the council that there was a want of fodder and such a loss of horses by desertion that there were not cavalry enough left for service the soldiers who knew the deficiency of medicines and other means of relief for the wounded were unwilling to be led to sorties though corn had not failed flour it appeared soon would for some of the mills had been rendered unserviceable for the present by shot and others were deserted by the millers  at night after an unsuccessful attempt upon the fleche it was resolved that the garrison which had hitherto scarcely suffered a night to pass without making some sorties should for the future adhere solely to defensive measures some engineers proposed to abandon the whole line of forts and others that two of the largest should be blown up the general and council at length confessed that they could not continue the defense and assured the inhabitants who had declared themselves in their favor that a longer delay of the surrender would produce a more severe disposition of the besiegers toward them without increasing the chance of escaping it  a negotiation relative to the surrender was now begun by doyre in a letter which partly replied to one from the prussian commander kalkreuth upon the subject of the departure of aged persons and children from the city their correspondence continued till the  0th and several letters were exchanged chiefly upon the question of the removal or detention of the inhabitants who had attached themselves to the french it was then broken off upon a disagreement as to this and some other points the firing on both sides had in the mean time continued and the besiegers carried on the trenches though these were now such an easy mark for the garrison that they lost an officer and fiveandtwenty men in the night of the   th and  0th the next night the dominicans church in the city took fire and six french soldiers were buried under its ruins  upon a renewal of the intercourse the fire slackened on the   st but on some delays in the negotiation was threatened to be recommenced at length the conditions of the surrender were settled and the negotiation signed on the   d of july by the two generals kalkreut hand doyre the former having rendered the capitulation somewhat easier than was expected for the garrison because the duke of brunswick had only nineteen thousand men to cover the siege and custine had forty thousand which were near enough to attack him general kalkreuths orders are supposed to have been to obtain possession of the place upon any terms that would give it him quickly  at this time the garrison which at the commencement of the siege had consisted of       men was reduced to   0   having had      killed      wounded or rendered unserviceable by sickness and having lost     by desertion  the loss of the besiegers is stated at about  000 men  the consumption of ammunition on the part of the french was found to have been      0 pounds of powder  0     cannon balls  0    bombs      grenades    00 pounds of iron  00  0 musket cartridges and during the siege  0  cannon either burst or were rendered unserviceable by the besiegers shot toward the conclusion sixty cannon also became useless by the failure of balls of the proper calibre  on the   th and   th the garrison marched out merlin leading the first column of   00 men the members of the clubs who would have gone out with the troops were pointed out by the other inhabitants and detained but the elector had the magnanimity to think of no other retaliation than their imprisonment in a tower near the rhine where they have since remained  there was now leisure to examine the city and it was found that six churches were in ruins that seven mansions of the nobility had been burned and that very few houses had escaped without some damage the surrounding grounds were torn up by balls and batteries the works of cassel were surrendered entire to the conquerors and are an important addition to the strength of mentz already reckoned one of the strongest and largest fortifications in europe between cassel and the ruins of kostheim not a tree was to be seen all the neighboring villages were more or less injured being contended for as posts at the commencement of the siege and the country was so much disfigured that the proprietors of lands had some difficulty to ascertain their boundaries    mentz something has been already said of the present condition of this city upon a review it appears that from the mention of churches palaces burgesses quays and streets we might be supposed to represent it as a considerable place either for splendor or commerce or for having its middle classes numerously filled any such opinion of mentz will be very incorrect after two broad and somewhat handsome streets all the other passages in the city are narrow lanes and into these many of the best houses open having for the most part their lower windows barricadoed like those of cologne the disadvantage with which any buildings must appear in such situations is increased by the neglected condition of these for a german has no notion that the outside of his house should be clean even if the inside is so an englishman who spends a few hundred pounds in a year has his house in better condition as to neatness than any german noblemans we saw a dutchman with fifty pounds a year exceeds both  the electors palace is a large turretted building of reddish stone with one front toward the rhine which it commands in a delightful point of view but we did not hear that it was so much altered by being now used as a barrack as that its appearance can formerly have been much less suitable than at present to such a purpose  on the quay there is some appearance of traffic but not much in the city so that the transfer of commodities from vessels of other districts to those of the electorate may be supposed to contribute great part of the show near the river the commerce is not sufficient to encourage the building of warehouses over the quay the vessels are ill rigged and the hulls are entirely covered with pitch without paint about thirty of these apparently from forty to seventy tons burden were lying near the quay and the war could scarcely have diminished their usual number so many being employed in carrying stores for the armies  the burgesses are numerous and have some privileges which render their political condition enviable to the other inhabitants of the electorate but though these have invited manufacturers and somewhat encouraged commerce there is not wealth enough in the neighboring country to make such a consumption as shall render many traders prosperous in point of wealth activity and address the burgesses of mentz are much below the opinion which must be formed while german cities are described and estimated by their importance in their own country rather than by a comparison of their condition with that of others a trader it will be allowed is at least as likely to appear to advantage in his business as in any other state his intelligence may surely be in some degree judged of by those who deal with him and that we might know something of those of mentz we passed some of the little time we were left to ourselves in endeavoring to buy trifles at their shops  the idleness and inadvertence we generally saw are difficult to be conceived perhaps the trouble experienced in purchasing a book may give an idea of them we wanted the german pamphlet from which most of the abovementioned particulars of the siege are extracted and as it related to a topic so general within the place we smiled when our friends said they would assist us to procure it during a walk two booksellers to whom we applied knew nothing of it and one supposed that an engraved view of the works would do quite as well passing another shop a young german gentleman enquired for it of the master who was at the door and heard that we might have it upon our return in half an hour the door when we came back was shut and no knocking could procure it to be opened so that we were obliged to send into the dwelling house when the shopman came he knew nothing of the book but being assured that his master had promised it went away and returned with a copy in sheets we paid for this and left it to be sewed which was agreed to be done in three hours at that time it was not finished but might be had in another hour and after that hour it was again promised within two finally it could not be had that night but would be ready in the morning and in the morning it was still unfinished we then went to franckfort without it and it was sent after us by a friend this was the most aggravated instance we saw of a german traders manners but something like it may be almost every where met with  from such symptoms and from the infrequency of wealth among the middle classes it is apparent that mentz could not have been important as to commerce even if there had been no siege which is here mentioned as the cause of all deficiencies and certainly is so of many the destruction of property occasioned by it will not be soon remedied the nobility have almost forsaken a place where their palaces have been either destroyed or ransacked the prince has no residence there some of the germans who emigrated on account of the last siege fled into france the wartaxes as well as the partial maintenance of the garrison diminish what property remains and all expenditure is upon a reduced footing  the contribution of the inhabitants toward a support of the garrison is made by the very irksome means of affording them lodging at the best houses the doors are chalked over with the names of officers lodged in them which the servants dare not efface for the soldiers must know where to find their officers in a family whom we visited four officers and their servants were quartered but it must be acknowledged that the former so far from adding to this inconvenience by any negligent conduct were constantly and carefully polite we indeed never saw prussian officers otherwise and can testify that they are as much superior to those austrians in manners and intelligence as they are usually said to be in military qualities  another obstruction which the siege has given to the prosperity of mentz consists in the absence of many members of the noble chapter an institution which however useless or injurious to the country occasions the expenditure of considerable sums in the capital that of mentz is said to be one of the richest of many similar chapters in germany from such foundations the younger sons of noble families derive sometimes very ample incomes and are but little restricted by their regulations from any enjoyment of temporal splendor their carriages and liveries vie with those of the other attendants at court they are not prohibited from wearing the ornaments of orders of knighthood are very little enjoined to residence are received in the environs of the court with military honors and allowed to reside in their separate houses they may wear embroidery of gold and cloths of any colors except scarlet or green which as well as silver lace are thought too gay being thus permitted and enabled to become examples of luxury their residence in any city diffuses some appearance of prosperity over it  one of the largest buildings in mentz is the arsenal which fronts toward the river and attracts the attention of those who walk upon the quay by having armed heads placed at the windows of the first floor which seem to frown with roman sternness upon the passenger in one of the principal rooms within a party of figures in similar armor are placed at a council board we did not hear who contrived them but the heads in the windows may be mistaken for real ones at the distance of fifty yards  the elector of mentz who is chosen by a chapter of twentyfour canons and is usually one of their number is the first ecclesiastical prince in the empire of which he is also the archchancellor and director of the electoral college in the diet he sits on the right hand of the emperor affixes the seal of the empire to its decrees and has afterward the custody of them among the archives his revenues in a time of peace are nearly  00000 l annually but during a war they are much less a third part of them arising from tolls imposed upon the navigation of the rhine the vineyards supply another large part and his subjects not interested in them are but little taxed except when military preparations are to be made the taxes are then as direct as possible that money may be immediately collected  the fortifications of his chief city are as much a misfortune to his country as they are an advantage to the rest of the empire being always one of the first objects on this side of the rhine since an enemy cannot cross the river while so considerable a fortress and so large a garrison as it may contain might perhaps check their return the electorate has been often the scene of a tedious warfare from the first raising of the works by louis the fourteenth their strength has never been fully tried the surrender in      was partly for the want of a proper garrison and partly by contrivance even in      when the defense was so furious and long the garrison it is thought might have held out further if their stores had been secured in bombproof buildings a german garrison supported by an army which should occupy the opposite bank of the rhine might be continually reinforced and supplied so as to be conquered by nothing but the absolute demolition of the walls  the bridge of boats over the rhine which both in peace and war is so important to the city is now in a much better state than the french found it being guarded at the eastern end by the fortifications of cassel notwithstanding its great length and the rapidity of the river it is so well constructed as to be much less liable to injury than might be supposed and would probably sustain batteries which might defeat every attempt at destroying it by fireships it is     feet long and wide enough for the passage of two carriages at once various repairs and the care of a daily survey have continued it since      when it was thrown over the river  the practice of modifying the names of towns so as to incorporate them separately with every language is no where more remarkable than with respect to those of germany where a stranger unless he is aware of them might find the variations very inconvenient the german name for what we call mentz is maynz the french which is most used mayence and the italian magontio by descent from the roman magontiacum the german synonym for liege is luttich for aix la chapelle achen for bois le duc herzogenbusch and for cologne coln which is pronounced keln the name borne by every town in the nation to which it belongs should surely be its name wherever it is mentioned for the same reason that words derived into one language from another are pronounced according to the authority of their roots because the use of the primary term is already established and there can never be a decision between subsequent varieties which are cotemporary among themselves and are each produced by the same arrogance of invention  franckfort we came hither by means of a passage boat which we were told would show something of the german populace but which displayed nothing so much as the unskilfulness of the german sailors though they make this voyage every day they went aground in the even stream of the maine and during the calmest weather fixing the vessel so fast by their illdirected struggle to get off that they were compelled to bring the towing horses to the side and tug backward with the stream there were an hundred people in the boat but the expedient of desiring them to remove from the part which was aground was never used we heard that they seldom make the voyage without a similar stoppage not against any shifting sand but upon the permanent shelves of the river  the distance is about fourandtwenty miles but we were nine hours in reaching franckfort the environs of which afford some symptoms of a commercial and opulent city the banks of the maine being covered for nearly the last mile with country seats separated from each other by small pleasure grounds  there are gates and walls to franckfort but the magistrates do not oppress travelers by a military examination at their entrance having seen the worthlessness of many places which bear ostentatious characters either for splendor or trade we were surprised to find in this as much of both as had been reported the quays were well covered with goods and laborers the streets nearest to the water are lined with shops and those in the middle of the city with the houses of merchants of which nearly all are spacious and many magnificent some indeed might be called palaces if they had nobility for their tenants but though the independence which commerce spreads among the middle classes does not entirely deter the german nobility from a residence here the finest houses are the property of merchants  in our way to the cigne blanc which is one of the best inns we passed many of so good an appearance that it was difficult to believe there could be better in a german city but franckfort which is the pride of germany in this respect has probably a greater number of large inns than any other place of equal extent in europe the fairs fill these twice in a year for three weeks at each time and the order which is indispensible then continues at other periods to the surprise and comfort of strangers  this city has been justly described by many travelers and doctor moore has treated of its inhabitants with the ease and elegant animation of his peculiar manner we shall not assume the disadvantage of entering upon the same subject after him the inhabitants of franckfort are very distinct as to manners and information from the other germans but they are so far like to those of our own commercial cities that one able account leaves scarcely any thing new to be seen or told concerning them  all their blessings of liberty intelligence and wealth are observed with the more attention because they cannot be approached except through countries afflicted by arbitrary power ignorance and poverty the existence of such a city in such a situation is little less than a phenomenon the causes of which are so various and minute as to make the effect at first sight appear almost accidental the jealousy of the neighboring princes toward each other is the known and certainly the chief cause of its exterior protection against each the continuance of its interior liberties is probably owing to the circumstance which but for that jealousy would expose it to subjection from without  the smallness of its territory where the departments of government must be very few very difficult to be rendered expensive to the public and very near to their inspection the ambition of individuals can be but little tempted to contrive encroachments upon the community so complexly are the chief causes of its exterior and interior independence connected with each other  as to the first of these it may perhaps be replied that a similar jealousy has not always been sufficient to protect similar cities and dantzick is the recent instance of its insufficiency but the jealousy s to dantzick though similar was not equal to this and the temptation to oppose it was considerably greater what would the most capable of the neighboring princes gain by the seizure of franckfort a place of strength no a place capable of paying taxes yes but taxes which would be reimposed upon commodities consumed partly by his own subjects whose property is his own already and partly by those of his neighbors to whose jealousy they would afford an additional and an unappeasable provocation dantzick on the contrary being a seaport was if not strong capable of supplying strength and might pay taxes which should not fall entirely upon its neighbors but upon the distant countries that traffic with it and even to these considerations it is unnecessary to resort unless we can suppose that despotism would have no effect upon commerce a supposition which does not require to be refuted if a severe taxation was introduced here and in so small a district taxation must be severe to be productive if such a taxation was to be introduced and if the other advantage of conquest that of a forcible levy of soldiers was attempted commerce would vanish in silence before the oppressor and the prince that should seize the liberties of franckfort would find nothing but those liberties in his grasp  on the other hand what are the advantages of permitting the independence of such a city to the sovereigns who have the power of violating it those of a neutral barrier are well known but apply only to military or political circumstances the others are the market which franckfort affords for the produce and manufactures of all the neighboring states its value as a banking depot and emporium in which princes may place their money without rendering it liable to the orders of each other or from which they may derive loans by negotiating solely and directly with the lenders its incapacity for offensive measures and its usefulness as a place of meeting to themselves or their ministers when political connections are to be discussed  that the inhabitants do enjoy this independence without and freedom within we believe not because they are asserted by treaties or political forms of which the former might not have survived the temporary interests that concluded them and the latter might be subdued by corruption if there were the means of it but because they were acknowledged to us by many temperate and discerning persons as much aloof from faction as they were from the affectation or servility that sometimes makes men boast themselves free only because they have or would be thought to have a little share in oppressing others many such persons declared to us that they had a substantial practical freedom and we thought a testimony to their actual enjoyments more valuable than any formal acknowledgments of their rights as to these latter securities indeed franckfort is no better provided than other imperial cities which have proved their inutility it stands in the same list with cologne but is as superior to it in government as in wealth  the inhabitants having had the good sense to foresee that fortifications might render them a more desirable prize to their neighbors at the same time that their real protection must depend upon other means have done little more than sustain their ancient walls which are sufficient to defend them against a surprise by small parties they maintain no troops except a few companies of cityguards and make their contributions to the army of the empire in specie these companies are filled chiefly with middleaged men whose appearance bespeaks the plenty and peacefulness of the city their uniforms blue and white are of the cut of those in the prints of marlboroughs days and their grenadiers caps are of the same peaked sort with tin facings impressed with the city arms  in wars with france the fate of franckfort has usually depended upon that of mentz which is properly called the key of germany on the western frontier in the campaign of      custine detached  000 troops of the   000 with which he had besieged mentz and these reached franckfort early in the morning of the   d of october neuwinger their commander sent a letter to the magistrates from custine demanding a contribution of two millions of florins which by a negotiation at mentz was reduced to a million and a half for the present notice was accordingly given in the city that the magistrates would receive money at four per cent interest and on the   d at break of day it began to flow in to the councilhouse from all quarters part was immediately given to neuwinger but payment of the rest was delayed so that custine came himself on the   th and by throwing the hostages into prison obtained on the   st of october the remainder of the first million for the second the magistrates gave security to neuwinger but it was never paid the convention disavowed great part of the proceedings of custine and the money was not again demanded  the french during the whole of their stay were very eager to spread exaggerated accounts of their numbers troops were accordingly marched out at one gate of the city with very little parade that they might enter with much pomp and in a longer column at the other the inhabitants who were not expert at military numeration easily believed that the first party had joined other troops and that the whole amounted to treble their real number after the entry of the prussians this contrivance was related by prisoners  the number of troops left in the city by custine on his retirement from the neighboring posts in the latter end of november was   00 men with two pieces of cannon on the   th when the prussian lieutenant pellet brought a summons to surrender helden the commander having sent to custine for reinforcements and cannon was answered that no men could be spared and that as to cannon he might use the city artillery helden endeavored to remove this from the arsenal but the populace encouraged by the neighborhood of the prussians rose to prevent him and there might have been a considerable tumult if custine had not arrived on the   th and assured the magistrates that the garrison should retire rather than expose the place to a siege the city then became tranquil and remained so till the  d of december when the inhabitants being in church first knew by the noise of cannon that the place was attacked  general helden would then have taken his two cannon to the gate which was contended for but the inhabitants remembering custines promise would permit no resistance they cut the harness of the horses broke the cannon wheels and themselves opened the gates to the prussians or rather to the hessians for the advanced corpse of the assailants was chiefly formed of them about  00 fell in this attack of the french    were killed     wounded and  00 taken prisoners the remainder of the   00 reached custines army a monument erected without the northern gate of the city commemorates the loss of the  00 assailants on the spot on which they fell  thus franckfort having happily but few fortifications was lost and regained without a siege while mentz in a period of six more months had nearly all its best buildings destroyed by a similar change of masters  we stayed here almost a week which was well occupied by visits but showed nothing in addition to what is already known of the society of the place manners customs the topics of conversation and even dress differ very slightly from those of london in similar ranks the merchants of franckfort have more generally the advantages of travel than those of england but they have not that minute knowledge of modern events and characters which an attention to public transactions renders common in our island those who have been in england or who speak english seem desirous to discuss the state of parliamentary transactions and interests and to remedy the thinness of their own public topics by introducing ours in such discussions one error is very general from their want of experience the faculty of making a speech is taken for the standard of intellectual power in every sort of exertion though there is nothing better known in countries where public speakers are numerous enough to be often observed than that persons may be educated to oratory so as to have a facility elegance and force in it distinct from the endowments of deliberative wisdom may be taught to speak in terms remote from common use to combine them with an unfailing dexterity of arrangement and to invest every thought with its portion of artificial dignity who through the chaos of benefits and evils which the agitation of difficult times throws up before the eye of the politician shall be able to see no gleam of light to describe no direct path to discern no difference between greater and lesser evils nor to think one wholesome truth for a confiding and an honest country to estimate the general intellectual powers of men tutored to oratory from their success in the practice of it is as absurd as to judge of corporeal strength from that of one arm which may have been rendered unusually strong by exercise and art  of the society at franckfort messrs bethman the chief bankers seem able to collect a valuable part and their politeness to strangers induces them to do it often a traveller who misses their table loses both as to conversation and elegant hospitality a welcome proof of what freedom and commerce can do against the mental and physical desolation otherwise spread over the country  the assistance which the mutual use of languages gives to a connection between distant places we were happy to see existing and increasing to the advantage of england at franckfort at the messrs bethmans one day french was nearly excluded the majority being able to converse with nine or ten english who were there in their own language of the merchants who have not been in england several speak english without difficulty and the rising generation it is said will be generally accomplished in it  one of the luxuries of franckfort is a cabinet literaire which is open to strangers by the introduction of members there the best periodical publications of the continent are received and their titles immediately entered in a book so that the reading is not disturbed by conversation with the librarian it excited our shame to hear that some contrivance had for several months prevented the society from receiving a very valuable english publication  after this the theater may seem to require some notice it is a modern but not an elegant building standing in an area that renders it convenient of access and nearly in the middle of the city the interior which has been gaudily decorated contains a pit three rows of boxes that surround the audience part and a gallery over them in the center it is larger than the little theater in the haymarket and in form resembles that of covent garden except that six or seven of the central boxes in each tier encroach upon the oval figure by a projection over the pit the boxes are let by the year the price of admission for nonsubscribers is a florin for which they may find places in the boxes engaged by their friends or in the pit which is in the same proportion of esteem as that at an operahouse  the performances are plays and operas alternately both in german and the music of the latter chiefly by german composers the players are very far beneath mediocrity but the orchestra when we heard it accorded with the fame of german musicians for spirit and precision in these qualities even the wandering parties that play at inns are very seldom deficient  the stage was well lighted but the other parts of the theater were left in duskiness which scarcely permitted us to see the diamonds profusely worn by several ladies six oclock is the hour of beginning and the performances conclude soon after nine  the cabinet literaire and the theater are the only permanent places of public amusement at franckfort which is however in want of no more the inhabitants being accustomed to pass much of their time in friendly parties at their houses though wealth is of course earnestly and universally sought for in a place purely mercantile we were assured that the richest persons and there are some who have above half a million sterling find no more attention in these parties than others this was acknowledged and separately boasted of by some of the very rich and by those who were comparatively poor we are so far able to report it for true as that we could never discern the least traces of the officiousness or subserviency that in a corrupt and debased state of society frequently point to the wealthiest individuals in every private party  these and many other circumstances would probably render franckfort a place of residence for foreigners if the magistrates either dreading the increase of luxury or the interference of strangers with their commerce did not prevent this by prohibiting them from being lodged otherwise than at inns it was with difficulty that an english officer acting as commissary to some of the german regiments lately raised upon our pay could obtain an exemption from this rule at the request of the hanoverian minister  round the city are several welldisposed walks as pleasant as the flatness of the nearer country will permit and at intervals along these are the country houses of the merchants who do not choose to go beyond the city territories for a residence saxenhausen a small town on the other side of the maine though incorporated with franckfort as to jurisdiction and connected with it by a bridge is chiefly inhabited by watermen and other laborers  we left franckfort after a stay of six days fortified by a german passport from m de swartzhoff the hanoverian minister who obligingly advised us to be prepared with one in the native language of the austrian officers at mentz the ceremonies of examination were rendered much more troublesome than before the governor general kalkreuth happening to be in the great square who chose to make several travelers wait as if for a sort of review before him though after all nothing was to be said but go to the commandant who will look at your passports this commandant was m de lucadou a gentleman of considerate and polite manners who knowing our friends in mentz added to his confirmation of m de swartzhoffs passport an address to m de wild the intendant of some salt mines in switzerland which he recommended to us to see these circumstances are necessary to be mentioned here because they soon led to a disagreeable and very contradictory event in our journey  the next morning we set out from mentz and were conducted by our voiturier over a summer road on the left bank of the rhine then flowing with the melted snows of switzerland  oppenheim this is the first town of the palatinate on arriving from the north and it bears marks of the devastation inflicted upon that country in the last century more flagrant than could be expected when the length of the intervening time and the complete recovery of other cities from similar disasters are considered louis the fourteenths fury has converted it from a populous city into little more than a picturesque ruin it was burned in      and the walls which remain in double or sometimes in treble circles are more visible at a distance than the streets which have been thinly erected within them above all is the landscroon or crown of the country a castle erected on an eminence which commands the rhine and dignisies the view from it for several miles the whole city or rather ruin stands on a brow over this majestic river  the gates do not now open directly into streets but into lanes of stone walls between vineyards and gardens formed on the site of houses never restored since the fire the town itself has shrunk from its ancient limits into a few streets in the center in some of the interstices corn grows up to the walls of the present houses in others the ruins of former buildings remain which the owners have not been tempted to remove for the sake of cultivating their sites of the cathedral said to have been once the finest on the rhine nearly all the walls and the tower still exist but these are the only remains of grandeur in a city which seems entirely incapable of overcoming in this century the wretchedness it inherits from the last  had the walls been as strong as they are extensive this place might not improbably have endured a siege in the present age having been several times lost and regained it was surrendered to the french without a contest in the campaign of      after their retreat from worms and during the siege of mentz it was occupied by the prussians and in december      when the allies retired from alsace the duke of brunswick established his headquarters in it for the purpose of covering the fortress his army ovens remained near the northern gate in july      when we passed through it in october of the fame year it fell again into the hands of the french  no city on the banks of the rhine is so well seated for affording a view of it as this which to the north overlooks all its windings as far as mentz and southward commands them toward worms the river is also here of a noble breadth and force beating so vehemently against the watermills moored near the side that they seem likely to be borne away with the current a city might be built on the site of oppenheim which should faintly rival the castle of goodesberg in the richness though not in the sublimity of its prospect  from hence the road leads through a fertile country of corn and vines but at a greater distance from the river to worms five or six miles from which it becomes broad straight and bordered with regularlyplanted trees that form an avenue to the city soon after leaving oppenheim we had the first symptom of an approach to the immediate theater of the war meeting a wagon loaded with wounded soldiers on this road there was a long train of carriages taking stores to some military depot the defacement of the electors arms on posts near the road showed also that the country had been lately occupied by the french as the delay in cutting the ripe corn did that there was little expectation of their return  worms the condition of worms is an aggravated repetition of the wretchedness of oppenheim it suffered something in the war which the unfortunate elector soninlaw of our james the first provoked by accepting the kingdom of bohemia louis the fourteenth came upon it next and in      burned every thing that could be consumed nothing was restored but on that part which was the center of the ancient city and the walls include as at oppenheim corn and vineyards upon the ground which was once covered with houses and which plainly appears to have been so from the lanes that pass between and doors that open into the enclosures a much larger space is so covered than at oppenheim for you are some time in driving from the northern gate of the old city to the first street of the present one  on the right of the road stands the skeleton of the electoral palace which the french burned in one of the late campaigns and it is as curious as melancholy to observe how the signs of ancient and modern desolation mingle with each other on one hand is a palace burned by the present french on the other the walls of a church laid open by louis the fourteenth  the first and principal street of theplace leads through these mingled ruins and through rows of dirty houses miserably tenanted to the other end of the city a few others branch from it chiefly toward the rhine including sometimes the ruins and sometimes the repaired parts of churches of which streets narrow illpaved and gloomy consists the city of worms the french general that lately wrote to paris we entered the fair episcopal city of worms may be supposed to have derived his terms from a geographical dictionary rather than from a view of his conquest  we were now in a place occupied by part of the acting army of the allies which if not immediately liable to be attacked was to be defended by the maintenance of posts at a very short distance troops passed through it daily for the service of these posts the noise of every cannonade was audible and the result of every engagement was immediately known for it might make an advance or a retreat necessary from worms the wounded men arrived soon after the intelligence to the military hospitals of the prussians a city so circumstanced seemed to differ but little from a camp and we were aware for a few hours of a departure from the security and order of civil life  the inn which was not otherwise a mean building was nearly destitute of furniture so that the owner was prepared to receive any sort of guests or masters the only provision which we could obtain was bread the commonest sort of wine and one piece of cold veal for the city was under military jurisdiction and no guests were allowed to have more than one dish at their table  in the afternoon we saw for the first time a crowd in a german city a narrow wagon of which nearly all but the wheels was basketwork had arrived from the army with a wounded officer who lay upon the floor supported by his servant but occasionally rose to return the salutes of passengers this was the prince of anhalt plessis who had been wounded in the morning when the french attacked all the neighboring lines of the allies and an indecisive engagement ensued the noise of which had been distinctly heard at worms he was hurt in the leg and descended with much difficulty from the wagon but did not for an instant lose the elegance of his address and continued bowing through the passage to his apartment no doubt was entertained of his recovery but there seemed to be a considerable degree of sympathy attending this young man  we had not time to look into the churches or numerous monasteries that yet remain at worms the war appeared to have depopulated the latter for not a monk was to be seen the cathedral or church of st mary and st peter is one of the most ancient sacred buildings in germany having been founded at least as early as the commencement of the seventh century one of the prebends was established in  0   another in  0   the dominicans carmelites capuchins and augustines have each a monastery at worms as have the cistercians and the augustines a nunnery a protestant church was also consecrated on the  th of june      something more than two hundred years after the ineffectual conference held here of protestant and catholic divines which charles the fifth interrupted when melancthon on one side and echius on the other had engaged in it ordering them to resume their arguments in his presence at ratisbon this meeting was five years previous to the celebrated diet of worms at which charles having then estimated the temporal strength of the two parties openly showed his animosity to the protestants as maurice of saxony did his intriguing ambition by referring the question to the council of trent  the jews at worms inhabit a separate street and have a synagogue of great antiquity their numbers having been once such as to endanger the peace of the city but in      when the french turned their synagogue into a stable they fled with the rest of the opulent inhabitants to holland those of the present day can have very few articles of traffic except money the changing of which may have been frequent on account of the neighborhood of france  worms is somewhat connected with english history having been occupied by the troops which james the first uselessly sent to the assistance of the proscribed elector palatine when his just abhorrence of continental wars was once though tardily overcome by the entreaties of his daughter here too george the second held his headquarters from the  th to the  0th of september      on the   th of which month lord carteret concluded in his name an offensive and defensive treaty with the ministers of hungary and sardinia  this city like cologne retains some affectation of the roman form of government to which it was rendered subject by caesar with the title of augusta vangionum the stadtmeister is sometimes called the consul and the schultheis or mayor the praetor but in   0  some trivial tumult afforded a pretense for abolishing its little remains of liberty and the elector palatine was declared its protector this blow completed the desolation which the disasters of the preceding century had commenced and a city that was once called the market of the palatinate as the palatinate was reputed the market of germany continues to exhibit nothing more than the ruins of its ancient prosperity  few of the present inhabitants can be the descendants of those who witnessed its destruction in      for we could not find that the particulars of that event were much known or commemorated by them dreadful and impressive as they must have been a column of louis the fourteenths army had entered the city in september of the preceding year under the command of the marquis de bonfleur who soon distressed the inhabitants by preparations for blowing up the walls with gunpowder the mines were so numerous and large as to threaten nothing less than the entire overwhelming of the city but being fired at different times the walls of the houses were left standing though they shook with almost every explosion the artillery and balls had been previously carried away to landau or mentz then possessed by louis at length on the   th of may      the intendant sent the melancholy news to the magistracy that he had received orders from his monarch to burn the whole city six days were allowed for the departure of the inhabitants and the removal of their property which period was prolonged by their entreaties to nineteen at the expiration of these on ascension day the   st of may the french grenadiers were employed from twelve oclock till four in placing combustibles about the houses and public buildings against several of which large heaps of hay and straw were raised the word being then given fire was set to almost every house at once and in a few hours the city was reduced to ashes the conflagration being so general and strong as to be visible in daylight at the distance of more than thirty english miles such was one of the calamities of a city so unfortunately situated that the chapter of the cathedral alone proved a loss by wars previous to the year      amounting to         florins  the attention due to so memorable a place detained us at worms till the voiturier talked of being unable to reach manheim before the gates would be shut and we let him drive vehemently toward  franckenthal another place destroyed by louis the fourteenth but restored upon a plan so uniform and convenient that nothing but a fuller population is necessary to confirm its title of a flourishing city the streets which intersect each other at right angles are wide and exactly straight the houses are handsomely built but the poverty or indolence of the owners suffers them to partake of the air of neglect which is general in german habitations and the streets though spacious and not illpaved had so few passengers that the depopulation of the place seemed to be rendered the more observable by its grandeur  yet it would be unfair to estimate the general prosperity of franckenthal by its present circumstances even had we stayed long enough to know them more accurately this place had been occupied but a few weeks before by the french army who had plundered it as well as several other towns of the palatinate after the retreat of the allies from alsace at the latter end of      the inhabitants had for the most part returned to their houses but their commerce which is said to have been not contemptible could not be so easily restored the manufactures of porcelain cloths silks spangles vinegar and soap of which some were established and all are protected by the wise liberality of the elector though far from being answerable either in their capitals or produce to the english idea of similar enterprises command some share with england and france in supplying the rest of germany one method of facilitating the operations of trade the elector has advantageously adopted here that of instituting a court upon the spot for the decision of all causes in which the traders are interested and at his expense a navigable canal has been formed from the town to the rhine artists and merchants have also some privileges at franckenthal of which that of being exempt from the military press is not the least  this press or levy is the method by which all the german princes return their contingents to the army of the empire the population of every town and district in their dominions is known with sufficient accuracy and a settled number of recruits is supplied by each when these are wanted notice is given that the men of a certain age must assemble and cast lots for the service those who are drawn may find substitutes but with this condition that the deputy must be at least as tall as his principal a regulation which makes the price of substitutes depend upon their height and frequently renders it impossible for the principals to avail themselves of the permission a farmer in this neighborhood who was considerably above six feet in height could not obtain a substitute for less than a hundred louis dors  another unpleasant condition is attached to this exchange if the substitute is disabled or deserts another must be supplied and if he carries his arms or accoutrements away these must be paid for by the person who sent him  after a ride of a few miles we reached  oggersheim a small town on the west bank of the rhine rebuilt in uniform streets like franckenthal having been destroyed by the same exertion of louis the fourteenths cruelty here also the modern french had very lately been and some of the ruins left near the road by louis appeared to have served them for kitchens in their excursion  at the east end of the town toward the rhine stands a chateau of the elector built with modern but not very admirable taste and commanding the distant river in several fine points of view we could not be admitted to see the inside which is said to have been splendidly decorated for the french had just dismantled it of the furniture  the road from hence to manheim was bordered for its whole length of at least two miles by rows of poplars of which some still remain near oggersheim but those within a mile and a half of manheim have been felled at one or two feet from the ground this was done in december      when the french began to advance from landau and were expected to besiege manheim their operations against which might have been covered in some measure by this noble alley  near the rhine the road is now commanded by two forts of which one was thrown up during the approach of the french and completed in the middle of the summer with great care these contribute much to the present security of the city which might otherwise be bombarded from the opposite bank of the river even by an enemy who should not be able and should not propose to attempt the conquest of the place they are ditched and pallisadoed but being divided from the body of the city by the rhine are of course without the communication which renders such works capable of a long defense round one of these forts the road now winds entering a part of the works near the bridge where there is a guardhouse for the troops of the elector  manheim it was twilight when we approached manheim and the palace the numerous turrets and the fortisications had their grandeur probably increased by the obscurity the bridge of boats is not so long as that at mentz but we had time enough in passing it to observe the extent of the city on the left of which the neckar pours itself into the rhine so that two sides are entirely washed by their streams at the next guardhouse where we were detained by the usual enquiries the troops were more numerous and surely no military figures ever accorded so well with the gloomy gates and walls they guarded the uniform of the palatine light troops is a close jacket of motley brown and pantaloons of the same that reach to their halfboots they have black helmets with crests and fronts of brass large whiskers and their faces by constant exposure to the sun are of the deepest brown that can be without approaching to black as they stood singly on the ramparts or in groups at the gates their bronze faces and roman helmets seemed of a deeper hue than the gloom that partly concealed their figures  the entrance into manheim from the rhine is by a spacious street which leads directly into the center of the city and to a large square planted with limes consisting on one side of public buildings and on the other of several noble houses one of which is the chief inn called the cour palatine this is the first city in germany that can answer by its appearance the expectations of a foreigner who has formed them from books its aspect is truly that of a capital and of the residence of a court except that in the daytime a traveller may be somewhat surprised at the fewness of passengers and the small show of traffic amidst such public buildings and in streets of such convenience and extent the fairness the grandeur and the stateliness which he may have seen attributed to other german cities till he is as much disgusted as deceived by every idea derived from description may be perceived in several parts of manheim and the justness of disposition in all  nor is the beauty of the present city solely owing to the destruction of the ancient one by louis the fourteenth in      the year of general devastation in the palatinate it was laid out in right lines though to a less extent in the beginning of the seventeenth century when frederic the fifth laid the foundation of the fortifications behind which a town was built that adopted the ancient name of manheim from a neighboring one then in decay these were the fortifications and the town destroyed by the french in      the plan of both was but extended when the present works were formed upon the system of cohorn and the city by degrees restored with streets which intersecting each other at right angles divide it into an hundred and seven square portions the number of the inhabitants exclusive of the garrison was in             some of the streets are planted with rows of trees and there are five or six open places suitable for promenades or markets the customhouse which forms a side to one of these is a noble stone building rather appearing to be a palace than an office except that under the colonnades which surround it are shops for jewelry and other commodities  the electoral palace which opens on one side to the city and on the other to the ramparts was built by the elector charlesphilippe who in the year      removed his residence hither from heidelberg on account of some difference with the magistrates or as is said of the prevalence of religious disputes in that city he began to erect it in    0 but the edisice was not completed till the right wing was added by the present elector not to be used as a residence but to contain a gallery of paintings cabinets of antiquities and natural history a library treasury and manege we passed a morning in viewing the apartments in the other wing all the paintings and books having been removed from this as well as great part of the furniture from the whole palace in the dread of an approaching bombardment the person who showed them took care to keep the credit of each room safe by assuring us at the door that it was not in its usual condition the elector had been for some months at munich but the duke and duchess of deux ponts and their family have resided in this palace since their retirement from deux ponts in the latter end of the campaign of       the rooms are all lofty and floored with inlaid work of oak and chestnut the ceilings for the most part painted and the walls covered with tapestry finely wrought both as to color and design some of this came from a manufactory established by the elector at franckenthal  the furniture left in several of the rooms was grand and ancient but could never have been so costly as those who have seen the mansions of wealthy individuals in england would expect to find in a palace the electors statebed was enclosed not only by a railing but by a glass case to the height of the ceiling with windows that could be opened at pleasure to permit a conversation with his courtiers when compliments were paid literally at a levee in the court of france this practice continued even to very late years and there were three distinct privileges of entree denoting the time at which persons of different classes were permitted to enter the chamber in the earl of portlands embassy for king william to louis the fourteenth it was thought a signal mark of honor that he was admitted to his audience not only in the chamber but within the rails and there the french monarch stood with the three young princes his grandsons the count de toulouse the duke daumont and the marshall de noailles the duke made his speech covered after which the king entered into conversation with him for several minutes  one room at manheim was called the silver chamber from the quantity of solid silver used about the furniture such articles as could be carried away entire had been removed but the walls were disfigured by the loss of the ornaments torn from them on account of their value in several rooms the furniture that remained was partly packed to be carried away upon the next alarm the contents of the wardrobe were in this state and the interior of these now desolated apartments seemed like the skeleton of grandeur the beauty of the painted ceilings however the richness of the various prospects commanded by the windows and the great extent of the building sufficiently accounted for the reputation which this palace has of being the finest in germany  it is built of stone which has somewhat the reddish hue of that used at mentz and though several parts are positively disapproved by persons of skill in architecture the whole is certainly a grand and sumptuous building  the situation of manheim and the scenery around it are viewed to great advantage from the tower of the observatory in which strangers are politely received by the professor of astronomy whose residence is established in it from this are seen the fruitful plains of the palatinate spreading on all sides to bold mountains of which those of lorrain that extend on the west lose in distance the variety of their coloring and assuming a blue tint retain only the dignity of their form among these the vast and round headland called the tonnesberg which is in sight during the greatest part of the journey from mentz to manheim is preeminent  but the chain that binds the horizon on the east and is known by the name of the bergstrasse or road of mountains is near enough to display all their wild irregularity of shape the forest glens to which they open and the various tints of rock and soil of red and purple that mingle with the corn and wood on their lower steeps these mountains are seen in the north from their commencement near franckfort and this line is never interrupted from thence southward into switzerland the rivals to them on the south west are the mountains of alsace which extend in long perspective and at a distance appear to unite with those of the bergstrasse among the numerous towns and villages that throng the palatinate the spires of oppenheim and worms are distinctly visible to the north almost beneath the eye are those of franckenthal and oggersheim and to the southward spires shows its many towers  in the nearer scene the neckar after tumbling from among the forests of the bergstrasse falls into the rhine a little below the walls of manheim and the gardens of a summer chateau belonging to the elector occupy the angle between the two rivers  these gardens were now surrendered by the prince to be the camp of three thousand of his troops detached from the garrison of the city which at this time consisted of nearly ten thousand men in several places on the banks of the two rivers batteries were thrown up and near the camp a regular fort for the purpose of commanding both so that manheim by its natural and artificial means of defense was supposed to be rendered nearly unassailable on two sides on that of heidelberg it was not so secure nor could the others be defended by a garrison of less than   000 men it was on this account that the elector detained ten thousand of his troops from actual service contrary as is said to the remonstrances of the emperor who offered but without success to garrison his capital with austrians from the observatory the camp and the works were easily seen and by the help of a dollond telescope the only optical instrument remaining the order of both was so exactly pointed out by our guide that it was not difficult to comprehend the uses of them military preparations indeed occurred very frequently in manheim in the gardens of the chief electoral palace extending to the ramparts over the rhine cannon were planted which were as regularly guarded by sentinels as in the other parts of the fortifications  all the gates of manheim appear to be defended by fortifications of unusual strength besides two broad ditches there are batteries which play directly upon the bridges and might destroy them in a few minutes the gates are guarded with the utmost strictness and no person is suffered to enter them after ten at night without the express permission of the governor when a courier arrives who wishes to use his privilege of passing at all hours he puts some token of his office into a small tin box which is kept on the outside of the ditch to be drawn across it by a cord that runs upon a roller on each bank the officer of the guard carries this to the governor and obtains the keys but so much time is passed in this sort of application that couriers when the nights are short usually wait the opening of the gates which is soon after daylight in summer and at six or seven in winter  the absence of the elector we were assured had much altered the appearance of manheim where scarcely a carriage was now to be seen though there were traces enough of the gaiety and general splendor of this little court here are an opera house a german comedy an amateur concert an electoral lottery an academy of sculpture and design and an academy of sciences the opera performances are held in a wing of the palace and were established in      but have not attained much celebrity being supported chiefly by performers from the other theater this last is called a national establishment the players being germans and the theater founded in      at the expense of the elector the baron de dahlberg one of his ministers has the superintendance of it the amateur concert is held every friday during the winter and is much frequented  the electoral lotteries for there are two are drawn in the presence of the minister of finances and one of them is less disadvantageous for the gamesters than is usual with such undertakings that which consists of chances determined in the customary way gives the elector an advantage of only five to four over the subscribers the other which is formed upon the more intricate model of that of genoa entitles the subscribers to prizes proportioned to the number of times a certain ticket issues from the wheel five numbers being drawn out of ninety or rather five drawings of one number each being successively made out of ninety tickets a ticket which issues once in these five drawings wins fifteen times the value of the stake one that should be drawn each of the five times would entitle the owner to have his original stake multiplied by sixty thousand and the product would be his prize the undertaker of this latter lottery has the chances immensely in his favor  from the very large income to which these lotteries contribute a part the present elector has certainly made considerable disbursements with useful purposes if not to useful effects of his foundation are the academy of sciences which was opened in      for weekly sittings and has proceeded to some correspondence with other academies the german society established for the easy purpose of purifying and the difficult one of fixing language the cabinet of physics or rather of experimental philosophy celebrated for the variety and magnitude of its instruments among which are two burning glasses of three feet diameter said to be capable of liquefying bodies even bottles filled with water at  0 feet distance the observatory of  0  feet high in which all the chief instruments were english a botanical garden and directorship an academy of sculpture and a cabinet of engravings and drawings formed under the direction of m krahe of dusseldorff in  00 folio volumes  of all these establishments none of the ornaments or materials that were portable now remain at manheim the astronomical instruments the celebrated collection of statues the paintings and the prints have been removed together with the electoral treasure of diamonds and jewels some to munich and some to other places of security but though we missed a sight which even its rarity would have rendered welcome it seems proper after such frequent notice of the barrenness of germany to mention what has been collected in one of its chief cities  the expectation of an attack had dismantled other houses besides the electors of their furniture for in the cour palatine a very spacious and really a good inn not a curtain and scarcely a spoon was left a cause de la guerre was indeed the general excuse for every deficiency used by those who had civility enough to offer one but in truth the war had not often incroached upon the ordinary stock of conveniences in germany which was previously too low to be capable of much reduction the places which the french had actually entered are of course to be excepted but it may otherwise be believed that germany can lose little by a war more than the unfortunate laborers whom it forces to become soldiers the loss of wealth must come chiefly from other countries a rich nation may give present treasure a commercial nation may give both present treasure and the means of future competence  the land near manheim is chiefly planted with tobacco and madder and the landscape is enlivened with small but neat countryhouses scattered along the margin of the neckar the neighborhood abounds in pleasant rides and whether you wind the high banks of the majestic rhine or the borders of the more tranquil neckar the mountains of the bergstrasse tumbled upon each other in wild confusion generally form the magnificent back ground of the scene  on returning from an excursion of this kind at the close of evening the soldiers at the gates are frequently heard chanting martial songs in parts and chorus a fonorous music in severe unison with the solemnity of the hour and the imperfect forms that meet the eye of sentinels keeping watch beneath the dusky gateways while their brethren reposing on the benches without mingle their voices in the deep chorus rude and simple as are these strains they are often singularly impressive and touch the imagination with something approaching to horror when the circumstances of the place are remembered and it is considered how soon these men sent to inflict death on others may themselves be thrown into the unnumbered heap of the military slain  schwezingen an excellent road sheltered for nine english miles by rows of high poplars conducted us through richly cultivated plains from manheim to schwezingen a small village distinguished by an electoral chateau and gardens this was one of the pleasantest rides we had found in germany for the road though it exhibited little of either the wild or picturesque frequently opened toward the mountains bright with a variety of coloring and then again was shrouded among woods and plantations that bordered the neighboring fields and brought faintly to remembrance the style and mingled verdure of our native landscape  schwezingen had been very lately the austrian headquarters for the army of the upper rhine and some soldiers were still stationed near the road to guard an immense magazine of wood but there were otherwise no military symptoms about the place  the chateau is an old and inelegant building not large enough to have been ever used as a formal residence the present elector has added to it two wings each of six hundred feet long but so low that the apartments are all on the ground floor somewhat of that air of neglect which can sadden even the most delightful scenes is visible here several of the windows are broken and the theater musicroom and ballroom which have been laid out in one of the wings are abandoned to dust and lumber  the gardens however are preserved in better order before the palace a long vista of lawn and wood with numerous and spacious fountains guarded by statues display something of the old french manner other parts show charming scenery and deep sylvan recesses where nature is again at liberty in a bay formed by the woods is an amphitheatre of fragrant orange trees placed in front of a light semicircular greenhouse and crowned with lofty groves near this delicious spot extends a bending arcade of latticework interwoven with vines and many beautifully flowering plants a sort of structure the filagree lightness of which it is impossible not to admire against precept and perhaps when general effect is considered against necessary taste in another part sheltered by the woods is an edifice in the style of a turkish mosque with its light cloistered courts slender minarets and painted entrances inscribed with arabic mottos which by the german translations appear to express the pleasure of friendly conversation and of indolence in summer the gardens have this result of a judicious arrangement that they seem to extend much beyond their real limits which we discovered only by ascending one of the minarets they are open to the public during great part of every day under certain rules for their preservation of which copies are pasted up in several places  carlsruhe at schwezingen the fine electoral road concludes and we began to wind along the skirts of a forest on the left having on the right an open corn country beyond which appeared the towers of spires and philipsburg of which the former was then the headquarters of the austrian army and the latter is memorable for having given birth to melancthon in      waghausel and bruchsal are small posting places in this route at a village between which we had another instance of the little attention paid to travelers in germany at a small inn noxious with some fumigation used against bugs we were detained a quarter of an hour because the landlord who had gone out after our arrival had not left word how much we should pay and the poor old woman who without shoes or stockings attended us was terrified when we talked of leaving what was proper and proceeding before his return  about a mile beyond bruchsal our postillion quitted the chaussee and entered a summer road through the deep and extensive forest of carlsruhe preserved by the margrave of baden for the shelter of game avenues cut through this forest for nine or ten miles in every direction converge at his palace and city of carlsruhe as at a point other cruelties than those of the chase sometimes take place in these delightful scenes for an amphitheatre has been formed in the woods where imitations of a spanish bull feast have been exhibited to such horrid means of preventing vacuity of mind has a prince had recourse who is otherwise distinguished for the elegance of his taste and the suavity of his manners  the scenery of this forest is very various sometimes we found our way through groves of ancient pine and fir so thickly planted that their lower branches were withered for want of air and it seemed as if the carriage could not proceed between them at others we passed under the spreading shade of chestnuts oak and walnut and crossed many a cool stream green with the impending foliage on whose sequestered bank one almost expected to see the moralizing jacques so exactly did the scene accord with shakespeares description the woods again opening we found ourselves in a noble avenue and saw the stag gracefully bounding across it to more profound repose while now and then a hut formed of rude green planks under some old oak seemed by its smoked sides to have often afforded a sheltered repast to hunting parties  near carlsruhe the gardens of the prince and then the palace become visible the road winding along them on the edge of the forest till it enters the northern gate of the city the uniformity of which has the same date as its completion the ground plot having been entirely laid out between january and june      on the   th of which month the margrave charles william laid the foundation stone  the streets are accordingly spacious light and exactly straight but not so magnificent as those of manheim and still less enlivened with passengers since the commencement of the war the gaieties of the court which afforded some occupation to the inhabitants have ceased the nobility have left their houses and the margrave is contented with the amusements of his library in which english literature is said to fill a considerable space  carlsruhe has the advantage of not being fortified so that the inhabitants are not oppressed by a numerous garrison and strangers pass through it though so near the seat of war without interruption it is less than manheim by at least half and has no considerable public building except the palace from the spacious area before which all the streets proceed as radii till their furthest ends fill up the figure of a semicircle the houses in the area which immediately front the palace are built over a piazza interrupted only by the commencement of the streets the palace has of course an unexampled advantage in the mixture of town and rural scenery in its prospects looking on one side through all the streets of the city and on the other through thirtytwo forest alleys cut to various lengths of from ten to fifteen english miles each few however of the latter prospects are now commanded except from the upper windows the present elector having entirely changed the style of the intervening gardens and permitted them to be laid out in the english taste without respect to the thirtytwo intersections that rendered them conformable with the forest  we passed part of two days at carlsruhe and were chiefly in these gardens which are of the most enchanting beauty and richness the warmth of the climate draws up colors for the shrubs and plants which we thought could not be equalled in more northern latitudes two thousand and seven hundred orange and lemon trees loaded with fruit and blossoms perfumed the air and choice shrubs marked with the linnean distinctions composed the thickets the gardens being limited only by the forests appear to unite with them and the deep verdure and luxuriance of the latter are contrasted sweetly with the tender green of the lawns and plants and with the variety of scarce and majestic trees mingled with the garden groves  the palace is a large and sumptuous though not an elegant edisice built of stone like all the rest of the city and at the same period the margrave generally resides in it and has rendered it a valuable home by adding greatly to the library filling an observatory with excellent instruments and preserving the whole structure in a condition not usual in germany the spot compared with the surrounding country appeared like miltons eden  like paradise opened in the wild  beyond carlsruhe the road begins to approach the rhine which we had lost sight of near manheim and though the river is never within view the country is considered as a military frontier being constantly patrolled by troops some of these were of the prince of condes army of emigrants who have no uniform and are distinguished only by the white cockade and by a bandage of white linen impressed with black fleurs de lis upon the right arm they were chiefly on foot and then wore only their swords without firearms  near the road a small party of austrians were guarding a magazine before a tent marked like their regimentals with green upon white soon afterward our postillion drew up on one side to permit a train of carriages to pass and immediately announced the prinz von conde who was in an open landau followed by two covered wagons for his kitchen and laundry and by a coach with attendants  he appeared to be between fifty and sixty tall not corpulent and of an air which might have announced the french courtier if his rank had been unknown a star was embroidered upon his military surtout but he had no guards though traveling within the jurisdiction allotted to him as a general officer so little was the road frequented at this period that his was the second or third carriage we had met except military wagons since leaving mentz a distance of more than eighty english miles  the road for the whole stage between carlsruhe and rastadt about fifteen miles is planted as seems customary in germany between the palaces of sovereigns with lofty trees of which the shade was extremely refreshing at this season the clouds of sand that rose from the road would otherwise have made the heat intolerable  the first house in rastadt is the palace of the margrave of baden baden brother of the margrave of baden durlach whose residence is at carlsruhe a small and heavy building that fronts the avenue and is surrounded with stone walls the interior is said to be splendidly decorated and a chamber is preserved in the state in which prince eugene and marshal villars left it in      after concluding the peace between the emperor and louis the fourteenth the prince of baden being then a general in the service of the emperor had not been able to escape the vengeance of louis whose troops in      first plundered and then burnt the palace and city and in the war of the succession they had a camp on the adjoining plain the prince is therefore supposed to have lent the palace which he had rebuilt with the more readiness that the marshal might see how perfectly he could overcome his loss the plunder of the city in      had continued for five days and it is mentioned in its history that the french carried away fifteen wagon loads of wine of the vintage of       rastadt like carlsruhe is built upon one plan but is as inferior to it in beauty as in size the chief street is however uncommonly broad so much so that the upper end is used as a marketplace and the statue of the founder prince louis in the center is seen with all the advantages of space and perspective there is notwithstanding little appearance of traffic and the inhabitants seemed to be much less numerous than the emigrant corpse which was then stationed there the head quarters of the prince of conde being established in the city we passed an hour at an inn which was nearly filled by part of this corpse and were compelled to witness the distress and disappointment excited by intelligence just then received of the state of affairs in the low countries  a small park of artillery was kept on the southern side of rastadt where there is a handsome stone bridge over the river murg that falls into the rhine at the distance of a league from the city soon after the road passes by the groves of the favorita a summer palace built by a dowager margravine we now drew nearer to the mountains of the bergstrasse which had disappeared near schwezingen and had risen again partially through the morning mists soon after our quitting carlsruhe they are here of more awful height and abrupt steepness than in the neighborhood of manheim and on their pointed brows are frequently the ruins of castles placed sometimes where it seems as if no human foot could climb the nearer we approached these mountains the more we had occasion to admire the various tints of their granites sometimes the precipices were of a faint pink then of a deep red a dull purple or a blush approaching to lilac and sometimes gleams of a pale yellow mingled with the low shrubs that grew upon their sides the day was cloudless and bright and we were too near these heights to be deceived by the illusions of aerial coloring the real hues of their features were as beautiful as their magnitude was sublime the plains that extend along their feet to the rhine are richly cultivated with corn and beyond the river others which appear to be equally fruitful spread toward the mountains of alsace a corresponding chain with the bergstrasse vast and now blue with distance  the manners of the people from manheim downwards are more civilized than in the upper parts of germany an improvement which may with great probability be imputed to the superior fruitfulness of the country that amends their condition and with it the social qualities the farms are more numerous the laborers less dejected and the women who still work barefooted in the fields have somewhat of a ruddy brown in their complexion instead of the sallowness that renders the ferocious or sullen air of the others more striking they are also better dressed for though they retain the slouched woollen hat they have caps and toward the borders of switzerland their appearance becomes picturesque here they frequently wear a blue petticoat with a cherrycoloured boddice full white sleeves fastened above the elbow and a muslin handkerchief thrown gracefully round the neck in a sort of roll the hair sometimes platted round the head and held on the crown with a large bodkin on holidays the girls have often a flat straw hat with bows of ribband hanging behind higher up the women wear their long black hair platted but falling in a queue down the back  the cottages are also somewhat better and the sides entirely covered with vines on which in the beginning of july were grapes bigger than capers and in immense quantities sometimes turkey corn is put to dry under the projections of the first floor and the gardens are ornamented with a short alley of hops meat is however bad and scarce the appearance so disgusting before it is dressed that those who can accommodate their palates to the cooking must endeavor to forget what they have seen butter is still more scarce and the little cheese that appears is only a new white curd made up in rolls scarcely bigger than an egg a sort of beer is here made for servants the taste of which affords no symptom of either malt or hops it is often nearly white and appears to have been brewed but a few hours what is somewhat browner is bottled and sold at about threepence a quart  our road this day was feldom more than two leagues distant from the rhine and we expected to have heard the fire which the austrian and french posts who have their batteries on the two banks of the river frequently exchange with each other the tranquillity was however as sound as in any other country and nothing but the continuance of patroles and convoys reminded us of our nearness to the war the peasants were as leisurely cutting their harvest and all the other business of rural life was proceeding as uninterruptedly as if there was no possibility of an attack yet we afterward learned that the french had very early on the morning of this day ineffectually attempted the passage of the rhine about fifteen miles higher up and the firing had been distinctly heard at a little village where we dined  one road as short as this lies immediately upon the margin of the river and as we were assured that none but military parties were fired at we wished to pass it for the purpose of observing the ingenious methods by which a country so circumstanced is defended but our postillion who dreaded that he might be pressed by the austrians for the intrusion refused to venture upon it and instead of proceeding to kehl which is directly opposite to strasbourg we took the road for offenburg about three leagues from the rhine  the country through which our route now lay better as it is than more northern parts has suffered some positive injuries by the war before this all the little towns from carlsruhe downwards maintained some commerce with france on their own account and supplied carriage for that of others in return for provisions and coarse commodities for manufacture carried to strasbourg they received the silks and woollens of france to be dispersed at franckfort or manheim the intercourse between the two countries was so frequent that nearly all the tradesmen and many of the laboring persons in this part of germany speak a little french the landlord of the house where we dined assured us that though his village was so small he had sufficient business before the war now he was upon the point of removing to offenburg being unable to pay his rent during the interruption of traveling  a little before sunset we came to appenweyer one of these towns from the entrance of which the spires of strasbourg were so plainly visible that we could see the fanes glittering against the light and even the forms of the fortifications near the water could be traced in the midst of the straggling town of appenweyer the loud sounds of martial music and then the appearance of troops entering at the opposite end surprised us this was the advanced guard of several austrian regiments on their march to reinforce the allied army in the low countries our postillion had drawn up to surrender as much of the road as possible to them but their march was so irregular that they frequently thronged round the carriage affording us sufficient opportunity to observe how far their air corresponded with what has been so often said of the austrian soldiery  except as to their dress and arms their appearance is not military according to any notion which an englishman is likely to have formed that is there is nothing of activity nothing of spirit of cheerfulness of the correctness of discipline or of the eagerness of the youthful in it there is much of ferocity much of timid cruelty of sullenness indolence and awkwardness they dress up their faces with mustachios and seem extremely desirous to impress terror how far this may be effectual against other troops we cannot know but they certainly are by their ferocious manners and by the traits which a nearer view of them discloses very terrible to the peaceful traveller though now immediately under the eyes of their officers they could scarcely refrain from petty insults and from wishfully laying their hands upon our baggage  about a thousand men passed in two divisions which had commenced their march a few hours before for the purpose of avoiding the heat of the day as we proceeded the trodden corn in the sields showed where they had rested  it was night before we reached offenburg where we were compelled to lodge at a wretched inn called the post house the master of the other having that day removed to admit a new tenant but the condition of the lodging was of little importance for all night the heavy trampling of feet along the road below prevented sleep and with the first dawn the sound of martial music drew us to the windows it seemed like a dream when the austrian bands played ca ira with double drums and cymbals thrown almost up to our casements louder than any we had ever heard before this was the main body of the army of which we had met the advanced party each regiment was followed by a long train of baggage carriages of various and curious descriptions some of the cabriolets having a woman nearly in mans apparel in the front and behind a large basket higher than the carriage filled with hay this tide of human existence continued to pass for several hours but the whole army did not consist of more than three regiments of infantry among which were those of darcy and pellegrini and one of horse for each of the austrian regiments of foot contains when complete two thousand three hundred men they had with them a small train of artillery and were to proceed to the low countries as quick as they could march but so uniform are the expedients of the councils of vienna that the opportunity of carrying these troops down the rhine in barges from phillipsburg where it was practicable was not adopted though this method would have saved two weeks out of three and have landed the army unfatigued at its post  all their regimentals were white faced either with light blue or pompadour and seemed unsuitably delicate for figures so large and heavy the cavalry were loaded with many articles of baggage but their horses appeared to be of the strongest and most serviceable kind this was a grand military show which it was impossible to see without many reflections on human nature and human misery  offenburg is a small town in the margraviate of baden baden pleasantly seated at the feet of the bergstrasse which the road again approaches so near as to be somewhat obstructed by its acclivities our way lay along the base of these steeps during the whole day and as we drew nearer to switzerland their height became still more stupendous and the mountains of alsace seemed advancing to meet them in the long perspective the plains between through which the rhine gleamed in long sweeps appeared to be entirely covered with corn and in the nearer scene joyous groups were loading the wagons with the harvest an harvest of another kind was ripening among the lower rocks of the bergstrasse where the light green of the vines enlivened every cliff and sometimes overspread the ruinous walls of what had once been fortresses  we passed many villages shaded with noble trees which had more appearance of comfort than any we had seen and which were enviable for the pleasantness of their situation their spacious street generally opening to the grandeur of the mountain vista that extended to the south in these landscapes the peasant girl in the simple dress of the country and balancing on her large straw hat an harvest keg was a very picturesque figure  it was evening when we came within view of friburg the last city of germany on the borders of switzerland and found ourselves among mountains which partook of the immensity and sublimity of those of that enchanting country but what was our emotion when from an eminence we discovered the pointed summits of what we believed to be the swiss mountains themselves a multitudinous assemblage rolled in the fardistant prospect this glimpse of a country of all others in europe the most astonishing and grand awakened a thousand interesting recollections and delightful expectations while we watched with regret even this partial vision vanishing from our eyes as we descended toward friburg the mountains that encompass this city have so much the character of the great that we immediately recollect the line of separation between germany and switzerland to be merely artificial not marked even by a river yet while we yield to the awful pleasure which this eternal vastness inspires we feel the insignificance of our temporary nature and seeming more than ever conscious by what a slender system our existence is upheld somewhat of dejection and anxiety mingle with our admiration  friburg is an ancient imperial city and the capital of the brisgau its name alludes to the privileges granted to such cities but its present condition like that of many others is a proof of the virtual discontinuance of the rights by which the sovereign intended to invite to one part of his dominions the advantages of commerce its appearance is that which we have so often described better than cologne and worse than mentz its size is about a third part of the latter city on descending to it the first distinct object is the spire of the great church a remarkable structure the stones of which are laid with open interstices so that the light appears through its tapering sides of this sort of stone fillagree work there are said to be other specimens in germany the city was once strongly fortified and has endured some celebrated sieges in           and      is was taken by the french who in the latter year destroyed all the fortifications which had rendered it formidable and left nothing but the present walls  being however a frontier place toward switzerland it is provided with a small austrian garrison and the business of permitting or preventing the passage of travelers into that country is entrusted to its officers the malignity or ignorance of one of these called the lieutenant de place prevented us from reaching it after a journey of more than six hundred miles a disappointment which no person could bear without severe regret but which was alloyed to us by the reports we daily heard of some approaching change in switzerland unfavourable to england and by a consciousness of the deduction which in spite of all endeavors at abstraction encroachments upon physical comfort and upon the assurance of peacefulness make from the disposition to enquiry or fancy  we had delivered at the gate the german passport recommended to us by m de schwartzkoff and which had been signed by the commandant at mentz the man who took it promising to bring it properly attested to our inn he returned without the passport and as we afterward found carried our voiturier to be examined by an officer we endeavored in vain to obtain an explanation as to this delay and appearance of suspicion till at supper the lieutenant de place announced himself and presently showed that he was not come to offer apologies this man an illiterate piedmontese in the austrian service either believed or affected to do so that our name was not radcliffe but something like it with a german termination and that we were not english but germans neither my lord grenvilles or m de schwartzkoffs passports our letters from london to families in switzerland nor one of credit from the messrs hopes of amsterdam to the bankinghouse of porta at lausanne all of which he pretended to examine could remove this discerning suspicion as to our country while we were considering as much as vexation would permit what circumstance could have afforded a pretext for any part of this intrusion it came out incidentally that the confirmation given to our passport at mentz which we had never examined expressed returning to england though the pass itself was for basil to which place we were upon our route  such a contradiction might certainly have justified some delay if we had not been enabled to prove it accidental to the satisfaction of any person desirous of being right the passport had been produced at mentz together with those of two english artists then on their return from rome whom we had the pleasure to see at franckfort the secretary inscribed all the passports alike for england and m de lucadou the commandant hastily signed ours without observing the mistake though he so well knew us to be upon the road to switzerland that he politely endeavored to render us some service there our friends in mentz being known to him he desired us to accept an address from himself to m de wild intendant of salt mines near bec we produced to mr lieutenant this address as a proof that the commandant both knew us and where we were going but it soon appeared that though the former might have honestly fallen into his suspicions at first he had a malignant obstinacy in refusing to abandon them he left us with notice that we could not quit the town without receiving the commandants permission by his means and it was with some terror that we perceived ourselves to be so much in his power in a place where there was a pretext for military authority and where the least expression of just indignation seemed to provoke a disposition for further injustice  the only relief which could be hinted to us was to write to the commandant at mentz who might retestify his knowledge of our destination yet as an answer could not be received in less than eight days and as imagination suggested not only all the possible horrors of oppression during that period but all the contrivances by which the malignant disposition we had already experienced might even then be prevented from disappointment we looked upon this resource as little better than the worst and resolved in the morning to demand leave for an immediate return to mentz  there being then some witnesses to the application the lieutenant conducted himself with more propriety and even proposed an introduction to the commandant to whom we could not before hear of any direct means of access there being a possibility he said that a passage into switzerland might be permitted but the disgust of austrian authority was now so complete that we were not disposed to risk the mockery of an appeal the lieutenant expressed his readiness to allow our passage if we should choose to return from mentz with another passport but we had no intention to be ever again in his power and assuring him that we should not return left friburg without the hope of penetrating through the experienced and present difficulties of germany into the farseen delights of switzerland  as those who leave one home for another think in the first part of their journey of the friends they have left and in the last of those to whom they are going so we in quitting the borders of switzerland thought only of that country and when we regained the eminence from whence the tops of its mountains had been so lately viewed with enthusiastic hope all this delightful expectation occurred again to the mind only to torture it with the certainty of our loss but as the distance from switzerland increased the attractions of home gathered strength and the inconveniences of germany which had been so readily felt before could scarcely be noticed when we knew them to lie in the road to england  we passed offenburg on the first day of our return and traveling till midnight as is customary in germany during the summer traversed the unusual space of fifty miles in fourteen hours soon after passing appenweyer we overtook the rearguard of the army the advanced party of which we had met at that place three nights before the troops were then quartered in the villages near the road and their narrow wagons were sometimes drawn up on both sides of it they had probably but lately separated for there were parties of french ladies and gentlemen who seemed to have taken the benefit of moonlight to be spectators and some of the glowworms that had been numerous on the banks now glittered very prettily in the hair of the former  at biel a small town which we reached about midnight the street was rendered nearly impassable by military carriages and we were surprised to find that every room in the inn was not occupied by troops but one must have been very fastidious to have complained of any part of our reception here as to lodging though the apartment was as bare as is usual in germany there was the inscription of chamber de monsieur over the door and on another near it chamber de conde le grand personages who it appeared had once been accommodated there for the honor of which the landlord chose to retain their inscriptions their meeting here was probably in      soon after the departure of the former from france  the second days journey brought us again to schwetzingen from whence we hoped to have reached manheim that night but the post horses were all out and none others could be hired the village being obliged to furnish a certain number for the carriage of stores to the austrian army eighteen of these we had met an hour before drawing slowly in one wagon laden with cannon balls we stayed the following day at manheim and on the next reached mentz where our statement of the obstruction at friburg excited less surprise than indignation the want of agreement between the austrian and prussian officers being such that the former who are frequently persons of the lowest education are said to neglect no opportunity of preying upon accidental mistakes in passports or other business committed by the prussians before our departure we were however assured that a proper representation of the affair had been sent by the first estaffette to the commandant at friburg  further intelligence of the course of affairs in flanders was now made known in germany and our regrets relative to switzerland were lessened by the apparent probability that a return homeward might in a few months be rendered difficult by some still more unfortunate events to the allies several effects of the late reverses and symptoms of the general alarm were indeed already apparent at mentz our inn was filled with refugees not only from flanders but from liege which the french had not then threatened some of the emigrants of the latter nation in quitting the places where they had temporarily settled abandoned their only means of livelihood and several parties arrived in a state almost too distressful to be repeated ladies and children who had passed the night in fields came with so little property and so little appearance of any that they were refused admittance at many inns for some others it seemed after resting a day or two could offer only tears and lamentations instead of payment our good landlord philip bolz relieved several and others had a little charity from individuals but as far as we saw and heard the germans very seldom afforded them even the consolations of compassion and tender manners  mentz is the usual place of embarkment for a voyage down the rhine the celebrated scenery of whose banks we determined to view as some compensation for the loss of switzerland we were also glad to escape a repetition of the fatigues of travel by land now that these were to be attended with the uncertainties occasioned by any unusual influx of travelers upon the roads  the business of supplying posthorses is here not the private undertaking of the innkeepers so that the emulation and civility which might be excited by their views of profit are entirely wanting the prince de la tour taxis is the hereditary grand postmaster of the empire an office which has raised his family from the station of private counts to a seat in the college of princes he has a monopoly of the profits arising from this concern for which he is obliged to forward all the imperial packets gratis a settled number of horses and a postmaster are kept at every stage where the arms of the prince and some line entreating a blessing upon the post distinguish the door of his office the postmaster determines according to the number of travelers and the quantity of baggage how many horses must be hired three persons cannot be allowed to proceed with less than three horses and he will generally endeavor to send out as many horses as there are persons  the price for each horse was established at one florin or twenty pence per post but on account of the war a florin and an half is now paid half a florin is also due for the carriage and the postillion is entitled to a trinkgeld or drinkmoney of another half florin but unless he is promised more than this at the beginning of the stage he will proceed only at the regulated pace of four hours for each post which may be reckoned at ten or twelve english miles we soon learned the way of quickening him and in the palatinate and the brisgau where the roads are good could proceed nearly as fast as we wished amounting to about five miles an hour  if the postmaster supplies a carriage he demands half a florin per stage for it but the whole expense of a chaise and two horses including the tolls and the trinkgeld which word the postillions accommodate to english ears by pronouncing it drinkhealth does not exceed eight pence per mile we are however to caution all persons against supposing as we did that the chaises of the post must be proper ones and that the necessity of buying a carriage which may be urged to them is merely that of show these chaises are more inconvenient and filthy than any traveling carriage seen in england can give an idea of and a stranger should not enter germany before he has purchased a carriage which will probably cost twenty pounds in holland and sell for fifteen at his return having neglected this we escaped from the chaises de post as often as possible by hiring those of voituriers whose price is about half as much again as that of the post  the regular drivers wear a sort of uniform consisting of a yellow coat with black cuffs and cape a small bugle horn slung over the shoulders and a yellow sash at the entrance of towns and narrow passes they sometimes sound the horn playing upon it a perfect and not unpleasant tune the music of their order all other carriages give way to theirs and persons traveling with them are considered to be under the protection of the empire so that if they were robbed information would be forwarded from one post house to another throughout all germany and it would become a common cause to detect the aggressors on this account and because there can be no concealment in a country so little populous highway robberies are almost unknown in it and the fear of them is never mentioned the germans who in summer travel chiefly by night are seldom armed and are so far from thinking even watchfulness necessary that most of their carriages though open in front during the daytime are contrived with curtains and benches in order to promote rest the postmasters also assure you that if there were robbers they would content themselves with attacking private voituriers without violating the sacredness of the post and the security of the postillions is so strictly attended to that no man dare strike them while they have the yellow coat on in disputes with their passengers they have therefore sometimes been known to put off this coat in order to show that they do not claim the extraordinary protection of the laws  these postillions acknowledge no obligation to travelers who usually give double what can be demanded and seem to consider them only as so many bales of goods which they are under a contract with the postmaster to deliver at a certain place and within a certain time knowing that their slowness if there is no addition to their trinkgeld is of itself sufficient to compel some gratuity they do not depart from the german luxury of incivility and frequently return no answer when they are questioned as to distance or desired to call the servant of an inn or to quit the worst part of a road when you tell them that they shall have a good drinkhealth for speed they reply yaw yaw and after that think it unnecessary to reply to any enquiry till they ask you for the money at the end of a stage they are all provided with tobacco boxes and combustible bark on which they stop to strike with a slint and steel immediately after leaving their town in the hottest day and on the most dusty road they will begin to smoke though every whiff flies into the faces of the passengers behind and it must be some very positive interference that prevents them from continuing it  as long as there are horses not engaged at any post house the people are bound to supply travelers within half an hour after their arrival but all the german princes and many of their ministers are permitted to engage the whole stock on the road they intend to pass and it frequently happens that individuals may be detained a day or even two by such an order if there should be no voiturier to furnish them with others at cologne and bonn when we were first there all the horses were ordered for the emperor who passed through however with only one carriage accompanied by an aidedecamp and followed by two servants on horseback it happens also frequently that a sudden throng of private travelers has employed the whole stock of the postmasters and the present emigrations from liege and juliers we were assured had filled the roads so much that we might be frequently detained in small towns and should find even the best overwhelmed with crowds of fugitives  during a stay of five days at mentz we often wandered amidst the ruins of the late siege especially on the site of the favorita from whence the majestic rhine is seen rolling from one chain of mountains to another near this spot and not less fortunately situated stood a carthusian convent known in english history for having been the headquarters of george the second in the year      soon after the battle of dettingen the apartments used by this monarch were preserved in the state in which he left them till a short time before the late siege when the whole building was demolished so that scarcely a trace of it now remains  by our enquiries for a passage vessel we discovered the unpleasant truth that the dread of another invasion began now to be felt at mentz where a fortnight before not a symptom of it was discernible several of the inhabitants had hired boats to be in readiness for transporting their effects to franckfort if the french should approach much nearer to the rhine and our friends when we mentioned the circumstance confessed that they were preparing for a removal to saxony the state of the arsenal had been lately enquired into and a deficiency which was whispered to have been discovered in the gunpowder was imputed to the want of cordiality between the austrians and prussians of whom the latter being uncertain that they should stay in the place had refused to replenish the stores at their own expense and the former would not spare their ammunition till the departure of the prussians should leave it to be guarded by themselves the communication with the other shore of the rhine by the bridge and the fortifications of cassel secured however to a german garrison the opportunity of receiving supplies even if the french should occupy all the western bank of the river  voyage down the rhine the boats to be hired at mentz are awkward imitations of the dutch trechtschuyts or what upon the thames would be called houseboats but for the sake of being allowed to dispose of one as the varieties of the voyage should seem to tempt we gave four louis for the use of a cabin between mentz and cologne the boatmen being permitted to take passengers in the other part of the vessel in this we embarked at six oclock on a delightful morning in the latter end of july and as we left the shore had leisure to observe the city in a new point of view the most picturesque we had seen its principal features were the high quays called the rheinstrasse the castellated palace with its gothic turrets of pale red stone the arsenal the lofty ramparts far extended along the river and the northern gate the long bridge of boats completed the foreground and some forest hills the picture  we soon passed the wooded island called petersau of so much consequence during the siege for its command of the bridge and approaching the mountains of the rheingau to the north the most sublime in this horizon saw their summits veiled in clouds while the sun soon melted the mists that dimmed their lower sides and brought out their various coloring of wood corn and soils it was however nearly two hours before the windings of the rhine permitted us to reach any of their bases meanwhile the river flowed through highly cultivated plains chiefly of corn with villages thickly scattered on its banks in which are the country houses of the richer inhabitants of mentz among pleasant orchards and vineyards those on the right bank are in the dominions of the prince of nassau usingen who has a large chateau in the midst of them once tenanted for a night by george the second and the duke of cumberland  the rhine is here and for several leagues downward of a very noble breadth perhaps wider than in any other part of its german course and its surface is animated by many islands covered with poplars and low wood the western shore often fringed with pine and elms is flat but the eastern begins to swell into hillocks near wallauf the last village of nassau usingen and once somewhat fortified  here the rheingau or the country of the vines commences and we approached the northern mountains which rise on the right in sine sweeping undulations these increased in dignity as we advanced and their summits then appeared to be darkened with heath and woods which form part of the extensive forest of landeswald or woodland hitherto the scenery had been open and pleasant only but now the eastern shore began to be romantic starting into heights so abrupt that the vineyards almost overhung the river and opening to forest glens among the mountains still however towns and villages perpetually occurred and the banks of the river were populous though not a vessel besides our own appeared upon it  on the eastern margin are two small towns oder and niederingelheim which in the midst of the dominions of mentz belong to the elector palatine on this shore also is made one of the celebrated wines of the rhine called markerbrunner which ranks next to those of johannesberg and hockheim at no great distance on the same shore but beneath a bank somewhat more abrupt is the former of these places alienated in the sixteenth century from the dominions of mentz to those of the abbot now prince bishop of fulde  the wine of the neighboring steeps is the highest priced of all the numerous sorts of rhenish a bottle selling upon the spot where it is least likely to be pure for three four or five shillings according to the vintages the merits and distinctions of which are in the memory of almost every german that of      was the most celebrated since      but we continually heard that the heat of      would render this year equal in fame to any of the others  behind the village is the large and well built abbey of johannesberg rich with all this produce for the security of which there are immense cellars cut in the rock below said to be capable of containing several thousand tons of wine the abbey was founded in   0  and there is a long history of changes pertaining to it till it came into the possession of the abbot of fulde who rebuilt it in its present state this part of the rheingau is indeed thickly set with similar edisices having in a short space the nunnery of marienthal and the monasteries of nothgottes aulenhausen and eibingen  further on is the large modern chateau of count ostein a nobleman of great wealth and as it appears of not less taste having disposed all his nearer grounds in a style for the most part english he has had recourse to the ridge of precipices that rise over the river for sublimity and grandeur of prospect on the brink of these woody heights several pavilions have been erected from the most conspicuous of which coblentz it is said may be distinguished at the distance of forty miles the view must be astonishingly grand for to the southeast the eye overlooks all the fine country of the rheingau to mentz to the west the course of the moselle toward france and to the north the chaos of wild mountains that screen the rhine in its progress to coblentz  so general was the alarm of invasion that count ostein had already withdrawn into the interior of germany and was endeavoring to dispose of this charming residence partly protected as it is by the river at the very disadvantageous price now paid for estates on the western frontier of the empire  the vineyards that succeed are proofs of the industry and skill to which the germans are accustomed in this part of their labors the seanty soil being prevented from falling down the almost perpendicular rocks by walls that frequently require some new toil from the careful farmer every addition made to the mould must be carried in baskets up the steep paths or rather staircases cut in the solid rock at the time of the vintage when these precipices are thronged with people and the sounds of merriment are echoed along them the spectacle must here be as striking and gay as can be painted by fancy  bingen about eleven oclock we reached bingen a town of which the antiquity is so clear that one of its gates is still called drusithor or the gate of drusus its appearance however is neither rendered venerable by age or neat by novelty the present buildings were all raised in the distress and confusion produced in      after louis the fourteenth had blown up the fortifications that endured a tedious siege in the beginning of the century and had destroyed the city in which drusus is said to have died  it has now the appearance which we have often mentioned is characteristic of most german towns nearly every house being covered with symptoms of decay and neglect and the streets abandoned to a few idle passengers yet bingen has the advantage of standing at the conflux of two rivers the nahe making there its junction with the rhine and an ancient german book mentions it as the central place of an hundred villages or chateaux the inhabitants of which might come to its market and return between sunrise and sunset  since the revolution in france it has occasionally been much the residence of emigrants and in a plain behind the town which was pointed out to us the king of prussia reviewed their army before the entrance into france in      a part of his speech was repeated to us by a gentleman who bore a high commission in it gentlemen be tranquil and happy in a little time i shall conduct you to your homes and your property  our companion as he remembered the hopes excited by this speech was deeply affected an emigrant officer of whom as well as of an exnobleman of the same nation with the latter of whom we parted here we must pause to say that had the old system in france oppressive as it was and injurious as englishmen were once justly taught to believe it been universally administered by men of their mildness integrity and benevolence it could not have been entirely overthrown by all the theories or all the eloquence in the world  soon after this review the march commenced the general effect of which it is unnecessary to repeat when the retreat was ordered the emigrant army comprising seventy squadrons of cavalry was declared by the king of prussia to be disbanded and not any person was allowed to retain an horse or arms no other purchasers were present but the prussians and in consequence of this order the sinest horses many of which had cost forty louis each were now sold for four or five some even for one it resulted accidentally no doubt from this measure that the prussian army was thus reprovided with horses almost as cheaply as if they had seized them from dumourier  bingen was taken by the french in the latter end of the campaign of      and was then nearly the northernmost of their posts on the rhine it was regained by the prussians in their advances to mentz at the commencement of the next campaign and has since occasionally served them as a depot of stores  this town seated on the low western margin surrounded with its old walls and overtopped by its ruined castle harmonizes well with the gloomy grandeur near it and here the aspect of the country changes to a character awfully wild the rhine after expanding to a great breadth at its conflux with the nahe suddenly contracts itself and winds with an abrupt and rapid sweep among the dark and tremendous rocks that close the perspective then disappearing beyond them it leaves the imagination to paint the dangers of its course near the entrance of this close pass stands the town of bingen immediately opposite to which appear the ruins of the castle of ehrenfels on a cliff highly elevated above the water broken craggy and impending but with vines crawling in narrow crevices and other rocks still aspiring above it on an island between these shores is a third ruined castle very ancient and of which little more than one tower remains this is called mausthurm or the tower of the rats from a mavelous tradition that in the tenth century an archbishop statto was devoured there by these animals after many cruelties to the poor whom he called rats that eat the bread of the rich  ehrenfels ehrenfels is synonymous to majestic or noble rock and fels which is the present term for rock in all the northern counties of england as well as in germany is among several instances of exact similarity as there are many of resemblance between the present british and german languages a german of the southern districts meaning to enquire what you would have says  was woll zu haben and in the north there is a sort of patois called plat deutsche which brings the words much nearer to our own in both parts the accent or rather tone is that which prevails in scotland and the adjoining counties of england to express a temperate approbation of what they hear the germans say so  so pronouncing the words slowly and long exactly as our brethren of scotland would in a printed narrative of the siege of mentz there is this passage  funfzehn hundert menschen meistens weiber und kinder  wanderten mit them bundel under them arm uber die brucke  fifteen hundred persons mostly wives and children wandered with their bundles under their arms upon the bridge so permanent has been the influence over our language which the saxons acquired by their establishment of more than five centuries amongst us exiling the ancient british tongue to the mountains of scotland and wales and afterward when incorporated with this resisting the persecution of the normans rather improving than yielding under their endeavors to extirpate it the injuries of the bishop of winchester who in henry the seconds time was deprived of his see for being  an english idcot that could not speak french one would fondly imagine had the effect due to all persecutions that of strengthening not subduing their objects  after parting with some of the friends who had accompanied us from mentz and taking in provision for the voyage our oars were again plied and we approached bingerloch the commencement of that tremendous pass of rocky mountains which enclose the rhine nearly as far as coblentz bingerloch is one of the most dangerous parts of the river that being here at once impelled by the waters of the nahe compressed by the projection of its boundaries and irritated by hidden rocks in its current makes an abrupt descent frequently rendered further dangerous by whirlpools several german authors assert that a part of the rhine here takes a channel beneath its general bed from which it does not issue till it reaches st goar a distance of probably twenty miles the sorce and rapidity of the stream the aspect of the dark disjointed cliffs under which we passed and the strength of the wind opposing our entrance among their chasms and uniting with the sounding force of the waters to baffle the dexterity of the boatmen who struggled hard to prevent the vessel from being whirled round were circumstances of the true sublime inspiring terror in some and admiration in a high degree  reviewing this now in the leisure of recollection these nervous lines of thomson appear to describe much of the scene the roused up river pours along resistless roaring dreadful down it comes from the rude mountain and the mossy wild tumbling through rocks abrupt and sounding far  again constrained between two meeting hills it bursts away where rocks and woods oerhang the turbid stream there gathering triple force rapid and deep it boils and wheels and foams and thunders through   having doubled the sharp promontory that alters the course of the river we saw in perspective sometimes perpendicular rocks and then mountains dark with dwarfwoods shooting their precipices over the margin of the water a boundary which for many leagues was not broken on either margin except where by some slight receding the rocks embosomed villages lying on the edge of the river and once guarded them by the ancient castles on their points a stormy day with frequent showers obscured the scenery making it appear dreary without increasing its gloomy grandeur but we had leisure to observe every venerable ruin that seemed to tell the religious or military history of the country the first of these beyond bingen is the old castle of bauzberg and next the church of st clement built in a place once greatly infested by robbers there are then the modern castle of konigstein in which the french were besieged in      and the remains of the old one deserted for more than two hundred years opposite to these is the village of assmans or hasemanshausen celebrated for the flavor of its wines and near them was formerly a warm bath supplied by a spring now lost from its source to the rhine notwithstanding many expensive searches to regain it about a mile farther is the ancient castle of falkenburg and below it the village of drechsen then the ruins of an extensive chateau called sonneck beneath which the rhine expands and encircles two small islands that conclude the district of the rheingau  after passing the small town of lorrich on the eastern bank the rhine is again straightened by rocky precipices and rolls hastily past the ancient castle of furstenberg which gives its name to one of the dearest wines of the rhine  we now reached bacharach a town on the left bank of the river sorming part of the widely scattered dominions of the elector palatine who has attended to its prosperity by permitting the calvinists and lutherans to establish their forms of worship there under equal privileges with the roman catholics  it has a considerable commerce in rhenish wine and its tollhouse near which all vessels are compelled to stop adds considerably to the revenues of the palatinate for the purpose of enforcing these the ancient castle called stahleck founded in    0 was probably built for bacharach is the oldest town of the palatinate and has scarcely any history between the period when it was annexed to that dominion and the departure of the romans who are supposed to have given it the name of bacchi ara and to have performed some ceremonies to that deity upon a stone said to be still concealed in the rhine in the year                and    0 when the river was remarkably low this stone is recorded to have been seen near the opposite island of worth and the country people have given it the name of the aelterstein as this extreme lowness of the waters never happens but in the hottest years the sight of the aelterstein is earnestly desired as the symptom of a prosperous vintage the river was unusually low when we passed the island but we looked in vain for this stone which is said to be so large that fiveandtwenty persons may stand upon its surface  bacharach is in the list of places ruined by louis the fourteenth in      the whole town was then so carefully and methodically plundered that the french commander during the last night of his stay had nothing to sleep on but straw and the next day this bedding was employed in assisting to set fire to the town which was presently reduced to ashes  pfaltz about a mile lower is the island of pfaltz or pfalzgrafenstein a place of such ancient importance in the history of the palatinate that it has given its name to the whole territory in germany called pfaltz it was probably the first residence of the counts the peaceable possession of which was one means of attesting the right to the palatinate for as a sign of such possession it was anciently necessary that the heir apparent should be born in a castle which still subsists in a repaired state upon it this melancholy fortress is now provided with a garrison of invalids who are chiefly employed in guarding state prisoners and in giving notice to the neighboring tollhouse of kaub of the approach of vessels on the rhine being much smaller than is suitable to the value placed upon it it is secured from surprise by having no entrance except by a ladder which is drawn up at night  kaub kaub a palatine town on the right bank of the river is also fortified and claims a toll upon the rhine notwithstanding its neighborhood to bacharach an oppression of which the expense is almost the least inconvenience for the tollgatherers do not come to the boats but demand that each should stop while one at least of the crew goes on shore and tells the number of his passengers who are also sometimes required to appear the officers do not even think it necessary to wait at home for this information and our boatmen had frequently to search for them throughout the towns so familiar however is this injustice that it never appeared to excite surprise or anger the boatman dares not proceed till he has found and satisfied the officers nor has he any means of compelling them to be punctual ours was astonished when we enquired whether the merchants to whom such delays might be important could not have redress for them  the stay we made at kaub enabled us however to perceive that fine slate made a considerable part of its traffic  the rhine at bacharach and kaub is of great breadth and the dark mountains that ascend from its margin form a grand vista with ancient chateaux still appearing on the heights and frequent villages edging the stream or studded among the cliffs  though the district of the rheingau the vines of which are the most celebrated terminated some miles past the vineyards are scarcely less abundant here covering the lower rocks of the mountains and creeping along the fractures of their upper crags these however sometimes exhibit huge projecting masses and walls of granite so entire and perpendicular that not an handful of soil can lodge for the nourishment of any plant they lie in vast oblique strata and as in the valley of andernach the angles of the promontories on one shore of the river frequently correspond with the recesses on the other  oberwesel is another town supported by the manufacture and trade of wines which are however here shared by too many places to bestow much wealth singly upon any wine is also so important a production that all the germans have some degree of connoisseurship in it and can distinguish its quantities and value so readily that the advantage of dealing in it cannot be great except to those who supply foreign countries the merits of the different vineyards form a frequent topic of conversation and almost every person has his own scale of their rank running over with familiar fluency the uncouth names of johannesberg ammanshausen hauptberg fuldische schossberg rudesheim hockheim rodtland hinterhauser markerbrunner grafenberg laubenheim bischeim nierstein harscheim and kapellgarren all celebrated vineyards in the rheingau the growth and manufacture of these wines are treated of in many books from one of which we translate an account that seems to be the most comprehensive and simple  of the rhenish vineyards and wines the strongest and as they are termed fullestbodied wines those of course which are best for keeping are produced upon mountains of a cold and strong soil the most brisk and spirited on a warm and gravelly situation those produced near the middle of an ascent are esteemed the most wholesome the soil being there sufficiently watered without becoming too moist and on this account the vineyards of hockheim are more esteemed than some whose produce is better flavoured on the contrary those at the feet of hills are thought so unwholesome on account of their extreme humidity that the wine is directed to be kept for several years before it is brought to table the finest flavor is communicated by soils either argillaceous or marly of this sort is a mountain near bacharach the wines of which are said to have a muscadine flavor and to be so highly valued that an emperor in the fourteenth century demanded four large barrels of them instead of  0000 florins which the city of nuremberg would have paid for its privileges  a vineyard newly manured produces a strong spirited and wellflavoured but usually an unwholesome wine because the manure contains a corrosive salt and a fat sulphur which being dissolved passes with the juices of the earth into the vines a manure consisting of street mud old earth the ruins of houses well broken and whatever has been much exposed to the elements is however laid on once in five or six years between the vintage and winter  the sorts of vines cultivated in the rheingau are the low ones called the reistinge which are the most common and ripen the first those of klebroth or red burgundy the wine of which is nearly purple of orleans and of lambert and lastly the tall vine raised against houses or supported by bowers in gardens the wines of the two first classes are wholesome those of the latter are reputed dangerous or at least unfit to be preserved  the vintagers do not pluck the branches by hand but carefully cut them that the grapes may not fall off in the rheingau and about worms the cultivators afterward bruise them with clubs but those of franckfort with their feet after which the grapes are carried to the press and the wine flows from them by wooden pipes into barrels in the cellar that which flows upon the first pressure is the most delicately flavoured but the weakest the next is strongest and most brisk the third is four but the mixture of all forms a good wine the skins are sometimes pressed a fourth time and a bad brandy is obtained from the fermented juice lastly in the scarcity of pasturage in this part of germany they are given for food to oxen but not to cows their heat being destructive of milk  to these particulars it may be useful to add that one of the surest proofs of the purity of rhenish is the quick rising and disappearance of the froth on pouring it into a glass when the beads are formed slowly and remain long the wine is mixed and factitious    oberwesel the account of which has been interrupted by this digression is the first town of the electorate of treves on this side to which it has belonged since      when its freedom as an imperial city granted by the emperor frederic the second was persidiously seized by henry the seventh and the town given to him by his brother baldwin the then elector the new sovereign enriched it with a fine collegiate church which still dignifies the shore of the river if he used any other endeavors to make the prosperity of the place survive its liberties they appear to have failed for oberwesel now resembles the other towns of the electorate except that the great number of towers and steeples tell what it was before its declension into that territory the townhouse rendered unnecessary by the power of baldwin does not exist to insult the inhabitants with the memory of its former use but is in ruins and thus serves for an emblem of the effects produced by the change  between oberwesel and st goar the river is of extraordinary breadth and the majestic mountains are covered with forests which leave space for little more than a road between their feet and the water a group of peasants with baskets on their heads appeared now and then along the winding path and their diminutive figures as they passed under the cliffs seemed to make the heights show more tremendous when they disappeared for a moment in the copses their voices echoing with several repetitions among the rocks were heard at intervals and with good effect as our oars were suspended  soon after passing the island of sand we had a perspective view of st goar of the strong fortress of rhinfels on the rocks beyond and of the small fortified town of goarhausen on the opposite bank the mountains now become still more stupendous and many rivulets or becks which latter is a german as well as an english term descend from them into the river on either hand some of which in a season less dry than the present roar with angry torrents but the extreme violence with which the rhine passes in this district left us less leisure than in others to observe its scenery  st goar we soon reached st goar lying at the feet of rocks on the western shore with its ramparts and fortifications spreading far along the water and mounting in several lines among the surrounding cliffs so as to have a very striking and romantic appearance the rhine no where perhaps presents grander objects either of nature or of art than in the northern perspective from st goar there expanding with a bold sweep the river exhibits at one coup doeil on its mountainous shores six fortresses or towns many of them placed in the most wild and tremendous situations their ancient and gloomy structures giving ideas of the sullen tyranny of former times the height and fantastic shapes of the rocks upon which they are perched or by which they are overhung and the width and rapidity of the river that unchanged by the vicissitudes of ages and the contentions on its shores has rolled at their feet while generations that made its mountains roar have passed away into the silence of eternity  these were objects which combined formed one of the sublimest scenes we had viewed  the chief of the fortresses is that of rhinsels impending over st goar on the west shore its high round tower rising above massy buildings that crown two rocks of such enormous bulk and threatening power that as we glided under them it was necessary to remember their fixed foundations to soften the awe they inspired other fortifications extend down the precipices and margin the river at their base further on in the perspective and where the east bank of the rhine makes its boldest sweep is the very striking and singular castle of platz a cluster of towers overtopped by one of immense height that perched upon the summit of a pyramidal rock seems ready to precipitate itself into the water below wherever the cliffs beneath will admit of a footing the sharp angles of fortifications appear  on another rock still further in the perspective is the castle of thumberg and at its foot on the edge of the water the walled tower of welmick here the rhine winds from the eye among heights that close the scene  nearly opposite to st goar is goarshaussen behind which the rocks rise so suddenly as scarcely to leave space for the town to lie between them and the river a flying bridge maintains a communication between the two places which as well as the fortress of rhinfels are under the dominion of the prince of hesse cassel  the number of fortresses here over which rhinfels is in every respect paramount seem to be the less necessary because the river itself suddenly swollen by many streams and vexed by hidden rocks is a sort of natural fortification to both shores a very little resistance from either of which must render it impassable whether the water has a subterraneous passage from bingen hither or not there are occasionally agitations in this part which confound the skill of naturalists and the river is universally allowed to have a fall near st goar a sudden gust of wind assisted by the current rendered our boat so unmanageable that in spite of its heaviness and of all the efforts of the watermen it was whirled round and nearly forced upon the opposite bank to that on which they would have directed it  st goar is a place of great antiquity a dispute about the etymology of its name is remarkable for the ludicrous contrariety of the two opinions one author maintains that it is derived from an hermit named goar who in the sixth century built a small chapel here another supposes that gewerb the name of a neighboring fall in the rhine has been corrupted to gewer and thence to goar after which considering that there is an island called sand in the river and that a great quantity of that material is hereabouts thrown up he finds the two words combine very satisfactorily into a likeness of the present denomination the former opinion is however promoted by this circumstance which the advocates of the latter may complain of as a partiality that a statue of st goar is actually to be seen in the great church founded in    0 and that notwithstanding the robberies and violences committed in the church by a spanish army the following inscription is still entire s goar  st goar is one of the largest places we had yet passed and has a considerable share of the commerce carried on by the rhine having in time of war a numerous garrison and being a little resorted to on account of its romantic situation it has an air of somewhat more animation than might be expected mingling with the gloom of its walls and the appearance of decay which it has in common with other german towns we were here required to pay the fifth toll from mentz and were visited by a hessian sergeant who demanded that our names and condition should be written in his book these being given not in the saxon but the roman character he returned to require another edition of them in german so that his officer was probably unable to read any other language or characters this being complied with it seemed that the noble garrison of st goar had no further fears concerning us and we were not troubled by more of the precautions used lest foul invasion in disguise approach   the fortress of rhinfels which commands st goar is frequently mentioned in the histories of german wars in the year      it endured forty assaults of an army combined from sixty towns on the rhine in      the french general tallard besieged it in vain retreating with the loss of four thousand men and nearly two hundred officers but in      the marquis de castries surprised it with so much ingenuity and vigor that not a life was lost and it remained in possession of the french till      when it was restored by the treaty of peace  boppart we next reached the dismal old town of boppart once an imperial city still surrounded with venerable walls and dignified by the fine benedictine nunnery and abbey of marienberg perched upon a mountain above an institution founded in the eleventh century for the benefit of noble families only and enriched by the donations of several emperors and electors boppart like many other towns is built on the margin of the rhine whence it spreads up the rocks that almost impend over the water on which the clustered houses are scarcely distinguishable from the cliffs themselves besides the benedictine abbey here is a convent of carmelites and another of franciscans and the spot is such as suited well the superstition of former times for  over the twilight groves and dusky caves longsounding aisles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a deathlike silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades every flower and darkens every green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror over the woods   the river expanding into a vast bay seems nearly surrounded by mountains that assume all shapes as they aspire above each other shooting into cliffs of naked rock which impend over the water or covered with forests retiring in multiplied steeps into regions whither fancy only can follow at their base a few miserable cabins and halffamished vineyards are all that diversify the savageness of the scene here two capuchins belonging probably to the convent above as they walked along the shore beneath the dark cliffs of boppart wrapped in the long black drapery of their order and their heads shrouded in cowls that half concealed their faces were interesting figures in a picture always gloomily sublime  place of ancient elections passing the town of braubach and the majestic castle of marksberg which we had long observed above the windings of the stream on a steep mountain we came to rense a small town remarkable only for its neighborhood to a spot on which the elections of kings of the romans or at least the meetings preliminary to them are believed to have anciently taken place this is distinguished at present by the remains of a low octagonal building open at top and accessible beneath by eight arches in one of which is a slight of steps within is a stone bench supposed to be formed for the electors who might ascend to it by these steps in the center of the pavement below is a thick pillar the use of which whether as a tribune for the new king or as a table for receiving the attestations of the electors is not exactly known that the building itself now called koningstuhl or kings throne was used for some purposes of election appears from several german historians who mention meetings there in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and impute them to ancient customs  intermixture of german territories nearly opposite to rense is the small town of oberlahnstein which belongs to the elector of mentz though separated from his other dominions by those of several princes to such intersections of one territory with another the individual weakness of the german princes is partly owing while their collected body has not only necessarily the infirmities of each of its members but is enfeebled by the counteraction arising from an arrangement which brings persons together to decide a question according to a common interest who are always likely to have an individual one of more importance to each than his share in the general concern  the banks of the rhine afford many instances of this disjunction of territory the elector of cologn has a town to the southward of nearly all the dominions of treves the elector palatine whose possessions on the east bank of the rhine are intersected by those of five or six other princes crosses the river to occupy some towns between the electorates of mentz and treves the landgrave of hesse cassel does the same to his fortress of rhinfels and the elector of mentz in return has a strip of land and his chief country residence between the dominions of the two houses of hesse  that this intermixture of territory exists without producing domestic violences is however obviously a proof that the present state of the germanic body weak as it may be with respect to foreign interests is well formed for the preservation of interior peace the aggrandizement of the houses of austria and prussia which has been supposed dangerous to the constitution of the empire tends considerably to secure its domestic tranquillity though it diminishes the independence of the lesser sovereigns for the interests of the latter are known to be ranged on one or the other side and as the house to which each is attached is likely to interfere upon any aggression against them the weaker princes are withheld from contests among themselves which would be accompanied by wars so very extensive and so disproportionate to their causes  nor is the chamber of wetzlaar or the court for deciding the causes of princes as well as all questions relative to the constitution to be considered as a nullity the appointment of the judges by the free but secret votes of all princes subject to their decrees is alone wanting to make its purity equal to its power in minute questions the chief princes readily receive its decision instead of that of arms which without it might sometimes be adopted and the other sovereigns may be compelled to obey it the chamber being authorized to command any prince to enforce its decrees by his army and to take payment of the expenses out of the dominions of his refractory neighbor an instance of such a command and of its being virtually effectual notwithstanding the ridicule with which it was treated occurred during the reign of the late frederic of prussia the story is variously told but the following account was confirmed to us by an advocate of the chamber of wetzlaar  the landgrave of hesse cassel had disobeyed several injunctions of the chamber relative to a question which had been constitutionally submitted to them at length the judges had recourse to their power of calling out what is called the armee executrice de lempire consisting of so many troops of any prince not a party in the cause as may be sufficient for enforcing submission the sovereign of hesse cassel was not to be conquered by any of his immediate neighbors and they were induced to direct their order to the king of prussia notwithstanding the probability that so unjust a monarch would show some resentment of their control  frederic consented to the propriety of supporting the chamber but did not choose to involve himself with the landgrave on their account he therefore sent him a copy of their order accompanied by a letter which in his own style of courteous pleasantry yet with a sufficient show of some further intentions admonished him to obey them the landgrave assured him of his readiness to conform and the two princes had privately settled the matter when the king of prussia resolved to obey and to ridicule the chamber of wetzlaar he sent by a public diligence a sergeant of foot who at the first hessian garrison delivered a paper to the captain of the guard declaring himself to be the commander of the armee executrice set on foot by order of the chamber and the army consisted of two corporals who waited at the door the judges of wetzlaar did not show that they knew the disrespect and were contented that the king of prussia had reduced the landgrave of hesse cassel to obedience  to this court subjects may make appeals from the orders of their immediate sovereigns when the question can be shown to have any general or constitutional tendency such a cause we heard of in germany and it seemed likely to place the chamber in somewhat a delicate situation the elector of treves had banished a magistrate for having addressed himself to custine during the invasion of the french in      and requested to know whether he might remain on a part of his property near their posts and perform the duties of his office as usual the magistrate appealed to wetzlaar admitted the facts charged and set forth that in this part of his conduct he had exactly followed the example of the chamber itself who though at a greater distance had made a similar application  soon after leaving oberlahnstein we passed the mouth of the lahn a small river which descends from the mountains of wetteravia on the right and washes silver and lead mines in its course it issues from one of those narrow and gloomy forestglens which had continually occurred on the eastern bank since we left boppart and which were once terrible for more than their aspect having been the haunt of robbers of whose crimes some testimonies still remain in the tombs of murdered travelers near the shore in the ruins of castles and abandoned fortresses within the recesses of these wild mountains such banditti took up their abode and these are not fancied personages for in the year      an elector of mentz destroyed the deserted fortress of rheinberg because it had been a rendezvous for them  toward sunset the rain which had fallen at intervals during the day ceased a fiery flush from the west was reflected on the water and partially colored the rocks sometimes an oblique gleam glanced among these glens touching their upper cliffs but leaving their depths with the rivulets that roared there in darkness as the boat glided by we could now and then discover on the heights a convent or a chateau lighted up by the rays and which like the pictures in a magic lanthorn appeared and vanished in a moment as we passed on the current  but the shores soon begin to wear a milder aspect the mountains of the western bank soften into gradual heights and vineyards which had disappeared near boppart again climb along them the eastern shore is more abrupt still bearing on its points some ancient buildings till opposite to coblentz it shoots up into that enormous mass which sustains the fortress of ehrenbreitstein  having passed a benedictine convent seated on the island of oberworth we reached coblentz as the moon began to tint the rugged ehrenbreitstein whose towers and pointed angles caught the light part of the rock below shaded by projecting cliffs was dark and awful but the rhine expanding at its feet trembled with radiance there the flyingbridge and its sweeping line of boats were just discernible on the left the quay of coblentz extended high and broad crowned with handsome buildings with tall vessels lying along its base  ehrenbreitstein we were now somewhat more pleasantly lodged than before at an inn near the rhine almost opposite to the fortress the importance of which had in the mean time greatly increased by the approach of the french armies the strength of it was somewhat a popular topic being considered as one of the keys of germany toward france the governor takes the oaths not only to the elector of treves but to the emperor and the empire as it can be attacked but on one side and that is not toward the rhine a blockade is more expected than a siege and there are storehouses in the rock for preserving a great quantity of provisions the supply of water has been provided for so long since as the fifteenth century when three years were passed in digging with incredible labor a well through the solid rock an inscription on a part of the castle mentions this work and that the rock was hewn to the depth of two hundred and eighty feet the possession of the fortress was confirmed to the elector of treves by the treaty of westphalia in    0  in the morning our boatmen crossed the river from coblentz to pass under the walls of ehrenbreitstein perhaps an established symptom of submission the river is still of noble breadth and after the junction with the moselle which immediately fronts the old palace flows with great but even rapidity its shores are now less romantic and more open spreading on the left into the plains of coblentz and swelling on the right into retiring mountains  conversation relative to france but our attention was withdrawn from the view and our party in the cabin this day increased by a circumstance that occurred to our emigrant friend having found a large sabre which he thought was of french manufacture he was enquiring for the owner when it was claimed by a gentleman whom he recognized to be an old friend but with whose escape from france he was unacquainted so that he had supposed from his rank he must have fallen there the meeting on both sides was very affecting and they shed some tears and embraced again and again with all the ardour of frenchmen before the stranger was introduced to us after which we had the pleasure of his company as far as cologne  this gentleman a lieutenant colonel before the revolution had made his escape from france so lately as may last and his conversation of course turned upon his late condition there were in most towns many persons who like himself were obnoxious for their principles yet being unsuspected of active designs and unreached by the private malice of roberspierres agents were suffered to exist out of prison they generally endeavored to lodge in the houses of persons favorable to the revolution went to no public places never visited each other and when they met in the street passed with an hasty or concealed salutation their apartments were frequently searched and those who had houses took care to have their cellars frequently dug for saltpetre  with respect to the prospect of any political change they had little hopes and still less of being able by remaining in france to give assistance to the combined powers they expected nothing but some chance of escape which in general they would not attempt without many probabilities in their favor knowing the sure consequences of being discovered it was impossible for them to pass by the common roads being exposed to examination at every town and by every patrol but in the daytime they might venture upon tracts through forests and at night upon cultivated ground a sort of journey to which they were tempted by the successes of others in it but which could not be performed without experienced guides it will be heard with astonishment that notwithstanding the many difficulties and dangers of such an employment there were persons who obtained a living by conducting others to the frontiers without passing any town village or military post who having delivered one person returned with his recommendation to another and an offer to escort him for a certain sum our companion had waited several months for a guide the person whom he chose to trust being under prior engagements in all of which he was successful they set out each laden with his share of provisions in the dress of peasants and without any other accident than that of being once so near the patrols as to hear their conversation arrived in the electorate of treves from whence this gentleman had been to rastadt for the purpose of presenting himself to m de conde  it was remarkable that some of these guides did not share the principles of those whom they conducted yet they were faithful to their engagements and seemed to gratify their humanity as much as they served their interests considering the many contrivances which are behind almost every political transaction it seems not improbable that these men were secretly encouraged by some of the rulers who wished to be disencumbered from their enemies without the guilt of a massacre or the unpopularity of appearing to assist them  the attachment to the new principles seemed to be increased when any circumstances either of signal disadvantage or success occurred in the course of a campaign the disasters of an army it was said attracted sympathy their victories aroused pride such a change of manners and of the course of education had taken place that the rising generation were all enragees in favor of the revolution of which the following was a remarkable instance two young ladies the daughters of a baron who had remained passively in the country without promoting or resisting the revolution were then engaged in a lawsuit with their father by which they demanded a maintenance separate from him he being either an aristocrat or a neutralist with whom they did not choose to reside they did not pretend to any other complaint and it was positively believed had no other motive yet these ladies had been previously educated with the nicest care by the most accomplished instructors and in fact with more expense than was suitable to their fathers income having been intended for places at the court the children of the poorer classes were equally changed by education and those of both sexes were proficients in all the revolutionary songs and catechisms    this conversation passed while we were floating through the vale of ehrenbreitstein where the river bending round the plains of coblentz flows through open and richly cultivated banks till it enters the valley of andernach where it is again enclosed among romantic rocks the places washed by it in its passage thither are the villages of neuralf warschheim nerenberg malter the old castle of malterberg the village of engus the fine electoral palace of schonbornust the neat town and palace of neuwied and the chateau of friedrichstein called by the country people the devils castle from that love of the wonderful which has taught them to people it with apparitions  neuwied was now the headquarters of a legion raised by the prince of salm for the pay of great britain and a scarlet uniform somewhat resembling the english was frequent on the quay we heard of several such corpse in germany and of the facility with which they are raised the english pay being as eightpence to twopence better than those of austria and prussia recruits receive from one to two crowns bounty whether it is equally true that the officers are notwithstanding allowed ten pounds for each we cannot positively assert but this was said within the hearing of several at cologne and was not contradicted la sold dangleterre is extremely popular in germany and the great wealth of the english nation begins to be very familiarly known  andernach was occupied by imperial troops and as we entered the gorge of its rocky pass it was curious to observe the appearances of modern mixed with those of ancient warfare the soldiers of francis the second lying at the foot of the tower of drusus their artillery and baggage wagons lining the shore along the whole extent of the walls  in this neighborhood are three celebrated mineral springs of which one rises in the domain of the carmelite monastery of jonniesstein the second called ponterbrunnen is so brisk and spirited that the laborers in the neighboring fields declare it a remedy for fatigue as well as thirst and a third called heilbrunnen has so much fixed air as to effervesce slightly when mixed with wine  the interesting valley of andernach has been already described its scenery viewed now from the water was neither so beautiful or so striking as from the road by which we had before passed the elevation of the latter though not great enabled the eye to take a wider range and to see mountains now screened by the nearer rocks of the shore which added greatly to the grandeur of the scene the river itself was then also a noble object either expanding below or winding in the distance but now that we were upon its level its appearance lost much both in dignity and extent and even the rocks on its margin seemed less tremendous when viewed from below something however should be allowed in this last respect to our having just quitted wilder landscapes for though the banks of the rhine in its course from bingen to coblentz are less various and beautiful than in its passage between andernach and bonn they are more grand and sublime  but the merits of the different situations for the view of riverscenery have been noticed and contended for by the three persons most authorized by their taste to decide upon them of whom gray has left all his enthusiasm and nearly all his sublimity to his two surviving friends so that this opinion is to be understood only with respect to the scenery of the rhine and does not presume to mingle with the general question between them the rhine now passes by the village and castle of hammerstein which with those of rheineck were nearly laid waste by louis the fourteenth the castle of argendorff and the towns of lintz and rheinmagen all exhibiting symptoms of decay though lintz is called a commercial town  rolands castle appears soon after and almost beneath it the island that bears adelaides convent called rolands werth or the worth of roland  we were now again at the base of the seven mountains whose summits had long aspired in the distance and as we passed under the cliffs of drakenfels hailed the delightful plain of goodesberg though much of it was concealed by the high sedgy bank of the rhine on the left the spreading skirts of these favorite mountains accompanied us nearly to bonn and displayed all their various charms of form and coloring in this our farewell view of them  the town and palace of bonn extend with much dignity along the western bank where the rhine makes a very bold sweep one wing of the former overlooking the shore and the want of uniformity in the front which is seen obliquely being concealed by the garden groves the many tall spires of the great church rise over the roof of the palace and appear to belong to the building  after leaving bonn the shores have little that is interesting unless in the retrospect of the seven mountains with rich woodlands undulating at their feet and when these at length disappear the rhine loses for the rest of its course the wild and sublime character which distinguishes it between bingen and bonn the rich plain which it waters between the latter place and cologne is studded at every gentle ascent that bounds it with abbeys and convents most of them appropriated to the maintenance of noble chapters  of these the first is the ladies chapter of vilich founded in the year    0 by megiegor a count and prince of guelderland who endowed it richly and made his own daughter the first abbess a lady who had such excellent notions of discipline that when any nuns neglected to sing in the choir she thought a heavy blow on the cheek the best means of restoring their voices this chapter is one of the richest in germany and is peculiarly valuable to the nobility of this electorate from its neighborhood to bonn where many of the ladies pass great part of the year with their families on the other side of the river is the benedictine abbey of siegberg appropriated also to nobles and lying in the midst of its own domains of which a small town at the foot of its vineyards is part admission into this society is an affair of the most strict and ceremonious proof as to the sixteen quarterings in the arms of the candidate each of which must be unblemished by any plebeian symptoms accompanied by his genealogy these quarterings are exposed to view for six weeks and three days before the election and as there is an ample income to be contended for the candidates do not hesitate to impeach each others claims by every means in their power the prelate of this abbey writes himself count of guls strahlen and neiderpleis and has six provostships within his jurisdiction  besides this and similar buildings the rhine passes not less than twenty villages in its course from bonn to cologne a distance of probably fiveandtwenty english miles  cologne now began to experience the inconveniences of its neighborhood to the seat of war some of which had appeared at bonn from the arrival of families who could not be lodged in the former place we were no sooner within the gates than the throng of people and carriages in a city which only a few weeks before was almost as silent as gloomy convinced us we should not find a very easy welcome the sentinels when they made the usual enquiry as to our inn assured us that there had been no lodgings at the hotel de prague for several days and one of them followed us to see what others we should find through many obstructions by military and other carriages we however reached this inn and were soon convinced that there could be no room the landlord showing us the chaises in which some of his guests slept and his billiard table already laden with beds for others there was so much confusion meanwhile in the adjoining square that upon a slight assurance we could have believed the french to be within a few miles of the city and have taken refuge on the opposite bank of the rhine  at length our host told us that what he believed to be the worst room in the place was still vacant but might not be so half an hour longer we followed his man to it in a distant part of the city and saw enough in our way of parties taking refreshment in carriages and gentlemen carrying their own baggage to make us contented with a viler cabin than any person can have an idea of who has not been out of england the next morning we heard from the mistress of it how fortunately we had been situated two or three families having passed the night in the open marketplace and great numbers in their carriages  the occasion of this excessive pressure upon cologne was the entry of the french into brussels their advances toward liege and the immediate prospect of the siege of maestricht all which had dispeopled an immense tract of territory of its wealthier inhabitants and driven them together with the french emigrants upon the confines of holland and germany the austrian hospitals having been removed from maestricht five hundred wagons laden with sick and wounded had passed through cologne the day before the carriages on the roads from maestricht and liege were almost as close as in a procession and at aix la chapelle where these roads meet there was an obstruction for some hours while we were at cologne another detachment of hospital wagons arrived some hundreds of which we had the misfortune to see for they passed before our window they were all uncovered so that the emaciated figures and ghastly countenances of the soldiers laid out upon straw in each were exposed to the rays of a burning sun as well as to the fruitless pity of passengers and as the carriages had no springs it seemed as if these halfsacrificed victims to war would expire before they could be drawn over the rugged pavement of cologne any person who had once witnessed such a sight would know how to estimate the glories of war even though there should be a mercenary at every corner to insult his unavoidable feelings and the eternal sacredness of peace with the slander of disaffection to his country  we had some thoughts of resuming our course by land from this place but were now convinced that it was impracticable seeing the number of posthorses which were engaged and judging of the crowds of travelers that must fill the inns on the road our watermen from mentz were however not allowed to proceed lower so that we had to comply with the extortions of others and to give nine louis for a boat from cologne to nimeguen having not without some difficulty obtained this and stored it with provisions we again embarked on the rhine rejoicing that we were not for a second night to make part of the crowd on shore  cologne viewed from the river appears with more of ancient majesty than from any other point its quays extending far along the bank its lofty ramparts shaded with old chestnuts and crowned by many massy towers black with age the old gateways opening to the rhine and the crowd of steeples overtopping all give it a venerable and picturesque character but however thronged the city now was the shore without was silent and almost deserted the sentinels watching at the gates and looking out from the ramparts or a few women gliding beneath wrapped in the nunlike scarf so melancholy in its appearance and so generally worn at cologne were nearly the only persons seen  the shores though here flat when compared with those to the southward are high enough to obstruct the view of the distant mountains that rise in the east in the south the wild summits of those near bonn were yet visible but after this faint glimpse we saw them no more  about two miles below cologne the west bank of the rhine was covered with hospital wagons and with troops removed from them for the purpose of crossing the river to a mansion converted by the elector into an hospital about a mile lower but on the opposite bank is muhleim a small town in the dominions of the elector palatine which in the beginning of the present century was likely to become a rival of cologne a persecution of the protestant merchants of the latter place drove them to muhleim where they erected a staple and began to trade with many advantages over the mother city but the pusillanimity of the elector palatine permitted them to sink under the jealousy of the colonese merchants their engines for removing heavy goods from vessels to the shore were ordered to be demolished and the commerce of the place has since consisted chiefly in the exportation of grain  the shores are now less enlivened by villages than in the rheingan and other districts to the southward where the cultivation and produce of the vineyards afsord at least so much employment that six or seven little towns each clustered round its church are frequently visible at once the course of the river being also wider and less rapid the succession of objects is flower and the eye is often wearied with the uniform lowness of the nearer country where the ancient castle and the perched abbey so frequent in the rheingau seldom appear corn lands with a slight intermixture of wood border the river from hence to dusseldorff and the stream flows with an even force through long reaches scarcely distinguished from each other by any variety of the country or intervention of towns those which do occur are called stammel niel flietert merkenich westdorff langelt and woringen in which last place the burgesses of cologne at the latter end of the thirteenth century stood a siege against their archbishop and by a successful resistance obtained the enjoyment of some commercial rights here so rare as to be called privileges after dormagen a small town very slightly provided with the means of benefiting itself by the river we came opposite to zons the fortifications of which are so far preserved as that the boatmen on the rhine are required to stop before them and give an account of their cargoes  we were listening to an old french song and had almost forgotten the chance of interruption from any abuses of power when the steersman called to us in a low but eager voice and enquired whether we would permit him to attempt passing the castle where if we landed we might probably be detained an hour or if the officer was at supper for the whole night by the help of twilight and our silence he thought it possible to glide unnoticed under the opposite bank or that we should be in very little danger if the sentinels should obey their order for firing upon all vessels that might attempt to pass the insolent tediousness of a german customhouse and the probable wretchedness of inns at such a place as this determined us in favor of the mans proposal we were silent for a quarter of an hour the men withheld their oars and the watchful garrison of zons saw us not or did not think a boat of two tons burden could be laden with an army for the conquest of germany  the evening was not so dark as entirely to deny the view of either shore while we continued to float between both and to trace the features of three or four small towns upon them neuss being at some little distance from the river was concealed but we had an accurate remembrance of its hideousness and recognizing it for the model of many towns since seen were pleased with a mode of traveling which rendered us independent of them the same mode however prevented us from visiting dusseldorff which we did not reach till after the shutting of the gates so that had we stayed we must have passed the night in our boat on the outside a sacrifice of too much time to be made while an army was advancing to the opposite shore being compelled to remain in the boat we thought it desirable to be at the same time proceeding with the stream and suffered the steersman to attempt passing another garrison by whom as he said we should otherwise be inevitably detained for the night he did not effect this without being noticed by the sentinels who called and threatened to fire but as the boatmen assured us this would scarcely be done without leave from an officer who might not be immediately at hand we yielded to their method of pressing forward as hastily as possible and were presently out of sight of dusseldorff of which we had seen only the walls and the extensive palace rising immediately above the water in the next reach the boatmen stopped to take breath and then confessed that though we had escaped being detained as they had said they had saved some florins due for tolls here and at zons which saving was their motive for running the risk though we would not have encouraged such a purpose had we been aware of it since the neglect of an unjust payment might produce an habitual omission of a just one it did not seem necessary to say much in behalf of a toll on the rhine for which there is no other pretense and no other authority than the power to enforce it  the loss of dusseldorff we were assured was the less because the pictures of the celebrated gallery had been carried off to meet those of manheim at munich  it was now dark for two or three hours but we did not hear of any town or view worth waiting to observe the first object in the dawn was the island of kaiserwerth on which there is a small town twice besieged in the wars of louis the fourteenth and now in the condition to which military glory has reduced so many others one of the mines in the last siege blew so large a part of the walls over the island into the rhine that the navigation of the river was for some time obstructed by them the dominion of this island for which the elector of cologne and the elector palatine contended was decided so lately as      by the authority of the chamber of wetzlaar who summoned the king of prussia to assist them with his troops as the armee executrice de lempire and the elector palatine was put in possession of it notwithstanding the remonstrances of his rival  as the morning advanced we reached the villages of kreuzberg rheinam and einingen and at five stopped at urdingen a town on the west bank of the rhine at which the elector of cologne takes his northernmost toll and a place of more commerce than we had expected to see short of holland great part of this is in timber which it adds to the floats annually sent to that country a sort of expedition so curious and useful that we shall make no apology for introducing the following account of it  timber floats on the rhine these are formed chiefly at andernach but consist of the fellings of almost every german forest which by streams or short land carriage can be brought to the rhine having passed the rocks of bingen and the rapids of st goar in small detachments the several rafts are compacted at some town not higher than andernach into one immense body of which an idea may be formed from this list of dimensions  the length is from  00 to  000 feet the breadth from  0 to  0 the depth when manned with the whole crew usually seven feet the trees in the principal rafts are not less than  0 feet long of which ten compose a rast  on this sort of floating island five hundred laborers of different classes are employed maintained and lodged during the whole voyage and a little street of deal huts is built upon it for their reception the captains dwelling and the kitchen are distinguished from the other apartments by being somewhat better built  the first rafts laid down in this structure are called the foundation and are always either of oak or sirtrees bound together at their tops and strengthened with firs fastened upon them crossways by iron spikes when this foundation has been carefully compacted the other rafts are laid upon it the trees of each being bound together in the same manner and each stratum fastened to that beneath it the surface is rendered even storehouses and other apartments are raised and the whole is again strengthened by large masts of oak  before the main body proceed several thin and narrow rafts composed only of one floor of timbers which being held at a certain distance from the float by masts of oak are used to give it direction and force according to the efforts of the laborers upon them  behind it are a great number of small boats of which fifteen or sixteen guided by seven men each are laden with anchors and cables others contain articles of light rigging and some are used for messages from this populous and important fleet to the towns which it passes there are twelve sorts of cordage each having a name used only by the floatmasters among the largest are cables of four hundred yards long and eleven inches diameter iron chains are also used in several parts of the structure  the consumption of provisions on board such a float is estimated for each voyage at fifteen or twenty thousand pounds of fresh meat between forty and fifty thousand pounds of bread ten or fifteen thousand pounds of cheese one thousand or fifteen hundred pounds of butter eight hundred or one thousand pounds of dried meat and five or six hundred tons of beer  the apartments on the deck are first that of the pilot which is near one of the magazines and opposite to it that of the persons called masters of the float another class called masters of the valets have also their apartment near it is that of the valets and then that of the subvalets after this are the cabins of the tyrolois or last class of persons employed in the float of whom eighty or an hundred sleep upon straw in each to the humber of more than four hundred in all there is lastly one large eatingroom in which the greater part of this crew dine at the same time  the pilot who conducts the fleet from andernach to dusseldorff quits it there and another is engaged at the same salary that is five hundred florins or    l each has his subpilot at nearly the same price about twenty tolls are paid in the course of the voyage the amount of which varies with the size of the fleet and the estimation of its value in which latter respect the proprietors are so much subject to the caprice of customhouse officers that the first signal of their intention to depart is to collect all these gentlemen from the neighborhood and to give them a grand dinner on board after this the float is sounded and measured and their demands upon the owners settled  on the morning of departure every labourer takes his post the rowers on their benches the guides of the leading rafts on theirs and each boats crew in its own vessel the eldest of the valetmasters then makes the tour of the whole float examines the laborers passes them in review and dismisses those who are unfit he afterward addresses them in a short speech recommends regularity and alertness and repeats the terms of their engagement that each shall have five crowns and a half besides provisions for the ordinary voyage that in case of delay by accident they shall work three days gratis but that after that time each shall be paid at the rate of twelve creitzers about four pence per day  after this the laborers have a repast and then each being at his post the pilot who stands on high near the rudder takes off his hat and calls out let us all pray in an instant there is the happy spectacle of all these numbers on their knees imploring a blessing on their undertaking  the anchors which were fastened on the shores are now brought on board the pilot gives a signal and the rowers put the whole float in motion while the crews of the several boats ply round it to facilitate the departure  dort in holland is the destination of all these floats the sale of one of which occupies several months and frequently produces   0000 florins or more than  0000 l    urdingen has a neat marketplace and some symptoms of greater comfort than are usual in the towns of the electorate of cologne but it is subject to violent floods so much so that at the inn which is at least an hundred and fifty yards from the shore a brass plate nailed upon the door of the parlour relates that the river had risen to that height about five feet from the ground  after resting here five hours we returned to our little bark with the spirits inspired by favorable weather and were soon borne away on the ample current of the rhine  large dutch vessels bound to cologne now frequently appeared and refreshed us once again with the show of neatness industry and prosperity the boatmen learned that several of these were from rotterdam laden with the effects of flemish refugees brought thither from ostend and others were carrying military stores for the use as they said of the emperor the ordinary trade of the dutch with germany in tea coffee english cloths and english hardware which we had heard at mentz was slackened by the expected approach of armies now seemed to be exchanged for the conveyance of property from scenes of actual distress to those not likely to be long exempted from it  a little beyond urdingen the town of bodberg marks the northern extremity of the long and narrow dominions of cologne once so far connected with holland as that the archbishop had jurisdiction over the bishop of holland and the chapter of utrecht but philip the second before the states had resisted his plundering obtained of the pope that they should not be subject to any foreign see and the bishop had a residence assigned to him at haerlem  the rhine is now bounded on the left by the country of meurs and having after a few miles part of the duchy of cleves on the right it becomes thus enclosed by the territories of the king of prussia under whose dominion it rolls till the states of guelderland repose upon one bank and soon after those of utrecht on the other we were here of course in the country of tolls and our waterman could not promise how far we should proceed in the day since it was impossible to estimate the delays of the collectors meurs has no place except small villages near the river but at the commencement of the duchy of cleves the influx of the ruhr into the rhine makes a small port at which all vessels are obliged to stop and pay for a prussian pass some dutch barks of probably one hundred and twenty tons burden we were assured would not be dismissed for less than fifty ducats or twenty guineas each the town is called the ruhort and we had abundance of time to view it for the collector would not come to the boat but ordered that we should walk up and make our appearance before him  it is a small place rendered busy by a dockyard for building vessels to be employed on the rhine and has somewhat of the fresh appearance exhibited by such towns as seem to be built for present use rather than to subsist because they have once been erected in the dock which opens to the ruhr two vessels of about sixty tons each were nearly finished and with more capital many might no doubt be built for the dutch timber and labor being here much cheaper than in holland  after the boatman had satisfied the collector we resumed our voyage very well contented to have been detained only an hour the woody heights of cleves now broke the flat monotony of the eastern shore the antiquity of whose forests is commemorated by tacitus in the name of saltus teutoburgensis supposed to have been bounded here by the town now called duisbourg  haud procul teutoburgensi saltu in quo reliquiae vari legionumque msepultae dicebantur  unburied remain inglorious on the plain   these forests were also celebrated for their herds of wild horses and the town of duisbourg having been rendered an university in      is thus panegyrized by a german poet dis is it die deutsche burg vor langst gar hochgeehrt von vielen konig und auch kaiserlichen kronen der schone musenthron woe kluge leute wohnen und woe die kausmannschast so manchen burger nahrt this is the german town that is famed so long by throned kings and gentle muses song where learned folks live well on princely pay and commerce makes so many burghers gay   of the commerce there were still some signs in half a dozen vessels collected on the beach whether the university also subsists or is any thing more than a free school which is frequently called an university in germany we did not learn  wesel after five or six small towns or villages more the rhine reaches the well known fortified town and state prison of wesel a place not always unfavourable to freedom for here rapin driven from the district now called la vendee in france by louis the fourteenths persecution of protestants retired to write his history recollecting perhaps that it had before sheltered refugees from the tyranny of the duke of alva and our sanguinary mary  the towers and citadel of wesel give it the appearance of a military place and it is frequently so mentioned but the truth is that the late king of prussia with the same fear of his subjects which was felt by joseph the second in flanders demolished all the effectual works except those of the citadel a policy not very injurious to the monarch in this instance but which in flanders has submitted the country to be twice overrun in three years and has in fact been the most decisive of passed events in their influence upon present circumstances  the reformed worship is exercised in the two principal churches but the catholics have two or three monasteries and there is a chapter of noble ladies of whom two thirds are protestants and one third catholic an arrangement which probably accounts for their having no settled and common residence  opposite to wesel is burick the fortifications of which remain and are probably intended to serve instead of the demolished works of the former place being connected with it by a flyingbridge over the rhine a little lower are the remains of the old chateau of furstemberg on a hill where the ladies of the noble cistercian nunnery of furstemberg had once a delightful seat now deserted for the society of xanten  xanten the first place at which we had stopped in germany and the last for a long tract which we had seen with pleasure xanten now distinguishable at a small distance from the river by its spires reminded us of the gay hopes we had formed on leaving it with a new world spread out before us for curiosity and as we thought for admiration yet did not render the remembrance of disappointment as to the last respect painful for even the little information we had gained seemed to be worth the labor of acquiring it  the exchange of indefinite for exact ideas is for ever desirable without this journey of eleven or twelve hundred miles we should have considered germany as its position in maps and description in books represent it to be important powerful and prosperous or even if it had been called wretched the idea would have been indistinct and the assertion perhaps not wholly credited the greatest and as it is reasonable to believe the best part of germany we have now seen and in whatever train of reasoning it is noticed have an opinion how it should be valued those who cannot guess at causes may be sure of effects and having seen that there is little individual prosperity in germany little diffusion of intelligence manners or even of the means for comfort few sources of independence or honorable wealth and no examples of the poverty in which there may be pride it was not less perceptible that there can be no general importance no weight in the balance of useful that is peaceful power and no place but that of an instrument even in the desperate exercises of politics  a respect for the persons of learning or thought who live as the impertinence of high and the ignorance of low society forces them to live in a strict and fastidious retirement cannot alter the general estimation of the country in any respect here considered their conversation with each other has no influence upon the community their works cannot have a present though they will have a general and a permanent effect the humbler classes from whom prosperity should result in peace and strength in war give little of either to germany and man is very seldom negatively stationed when not useful to his fellow creatures he is generally somewhat injurious the substantial debasement of the german peasantry that is their want of ordinary intelligence reacts upon the means that produced it and continuing their inferiority continues many injurious effects upon the rest of europe  that germany should be thus essentially humble perhaps none would have ventured to foresee the materialist could not have found it in the climate the politician might hastily expect it from the arbitrary character of the governments but must hesitate when he recollects how france advanced in science and manufactures under the dominion of louis the fourteenth greatly more despotic than the usual administrations in germany perhaps the only solution for this difference of effects from apparently similar causes is that the greater extent of his territory as well as the better opportunities of his subjects for commerce enabled louis to gratify his taste for splendor at the same time that they showed his ambition a means of indulgence by increasing the means of his people germany frittered into several score of sovereignties has no opulent power no considerable income remaining after the payment of its armies few wealthy individuals the emperor with fiftysix titles does not gain a florin by his chief dignity or granvelle the minister of charles the fifth would have been contradicted when he said so in the chamber of princes the elector palatine is almost the only prince whose revenue is not absorbed by political military and household establishments and though in an advanced state of society or in opulent nations what is called patronage is seldom necessary and must perhaps be as injurious to the happiness as it is to the dignity of those who receive it nothing is more certain than that there have been periods in the history of all countries when the liberality of the prince or the more independent protection of beneficed institutions was necessary to the existence of curiosity and knowledge at such times a large expenditure if directed by taste or even by vanity afforded a slow recompense for the aggressions that might support it by spreading a desire of distinction for some intellectual accomplishment as the claim to notice from the court and the improvement of mind circulated by more general encouragement till every town and village had its men of science thus it was that the despotism of louis the fourteenth had a different effect from that of his contemporary german princes who by no oppressions could raise a sufficient income to make their own expenditure the involuntary means of improving the intellectual condition of their people  from the neighborhood of xanten in which we were induced thus to estimate what had been gained since we saw it last and from a shore that gradually rises into the many woody heights around calcar and cleves the rhine speedily reaches rees a town on the right bank built advantageously at an angle made by a flexue of the river to the left  we landed to view this place and were soon persuaded by the dutchlike cleanliness and civility of the people at the inn to remain there for the night rather than to attempt reaching emmerick  rees is near enough to holland to have some of its advantages and whatever contempt it may be natural for english travelers at the commencement of their tour to feel for dutch dullness and covetousness nothing but some experience of germany is necessary to make them rejoice in a return to the neatness the civility the comforts quietness and even the good humor and intelligence to be easily found in holland such at least was the change produced in our minds by a journey from nimeguen to friburg the lower classes of the dutch and it is the conduct of such classes that every where has the chief influence upon the comforts of others are not only without the malignant fullenness of the germans and therefore ready to return you services for money but are also much superior to them in intelligence and docility frequent opportunities of gain and the habit of comparing them sharpen intellects which might otherwise never be exercised in a commercial country the humblest persons have opportunities of profiting by their qualifications they are therefore in some degree prepared for better conditions and do not feel that angry envy of others which arises from the consciousness of some irremediable distinction  the inhabitants of rees speak both dutch and german and it was pleasing to hear at the inn the sulky yaw of the latter exchanged for the civil yaw well mynheer of the dutch the town is built chiefly of brick like those in holland the streets light the marketplace spacious and the houses well preserved it is of no great extent but the space within the walls is filled though this must have been sometimes partly cleared by the sieges to which rees was subject in the war of philip the second upon the dutch a few emigrants from brussels and maestricht were now sheltered in it but there was no garrison and no other symptom of its neighborhood to the scene of hostilities than the arrival of a prussian commissary to collect hay and corn we were cheered by the reappearance of prosperity in a country where it is so seldom to be seen and passed a better evening in this little town than in any other between friburg and holland  in the morning having no disgust to impel us we were somewhat tardy in embarking and the boatmen who had found out the way of reviving our impatience talked of the great distance of holland till they had us on board five or six welllooking villages presently appear after leaving rees the next port to which is emmerick once an hanseatic town and still a place of some dignity from spires and towers but certainly not of much commerce for we could not see more than two vessels on the beach  this is the town at which a governor and general appointed by philip the second with probably half a dozen titles asserting his excellence serenity and honor gave an instance of baseness scarcely ever exceeded even by philip himself approaching the place which was then neutral the inhabitants went out to him with an entreaty that he would not send troops into it and probably by something more than entreaty obtained his promise that they should be spared in spite of this promise of the remonstrances of the inhabitants and of the representations of a clergyman that the spanish assurances of having engaged in the war chiefly for the interests of the catholic religion could not be credited if acts contrary to the precepts of all religion were daily perpetrated in spite of these mendoza the spanish commander sent in four hundred troops but with another promise that their number should not be increased and with this consolation for the burgesses that the spanish colonel of the detachment was directed to swear in their presence to admit no more even if they should be offered to him  mendoza had estimated this mans heart by his own and considered his oath only as a convenient delusion for preventing the resistance of the inhabitants he accordingly sent other troops to him under the command of a foreign hireling and with a peremptory order for their admission but the honest spaniard gave him this reply though the general has set the example i will not violate my faith  passing emmerick with much pleasure we speedily came to the point at which the rhine dividing itself into two streams loses its name immediately in the one and presently after in the other some writer has compared this merging to the voluntary surrender of exertions and views by which affectionate parents lose themselves in their children the stream which bends to the west takes the name of the waal that which flows in the general direction of the river retains its name for a few miles when another stream issues to the northward and takes that of the yssel the old river is still recognized after this separation and the town of rhenen takes its name from it but about a mile lower it yields to the denomination of the leck which like that of the waal does not long enjoy its usurped distinction the waal or wahl being joined by the maas as the dutch or the meuse as the french call it near bommel takes the name of that river and soon after the leck merges in their united stream which carries the title of the maas by rotterdam schiedam and flaarding into the german ocean  we did not yield to this artificial distinction so far as to think ourselves taking leave of the rhine or losing the stream that had presented to us at first features of the boldest grandeur mingled with others of the sweetest beauty and then borne us safely past a shore pressed by the hasty steps of distress as well as threatened by those of ravage from a flying and a pursuing army nor does the river change the character it has lately assumed but still passes with an even wide and forceful current between cultivated or pastoral levels bounded at some distance by gradual woody ascents  among these heights and woods cleves is visible to the left and those who see it only at this distance may repeat the dictionary descriptions of its grandeur and consequence as a capital soon after schenckenkanze a small fort built on the point of the long island round which the rhine and the waal slow occurs and then the southern extremity of the province of utrecht we were glad to see this commencement of the dominions of the united states though the shore opposite to them was still prussian and telling the boatmen if they had occasion to stop at any town to touch only upon the free bank they humoured us so far as to row out of the current for the sake of approaching it in short we stepped no more upon german land and within a few miles were enveloped on both sides by the prospering abounding plains of the dutch provinces italiam italiam  early in the afternoon the lofty tower of the belvidere or prospecthouse at nimeguen came in sight then the bright pinnacles of the public buildings and the high turfcoloured angles of the fortifications the town was thronged with fugitives from flanders but we found sufficient accommodation as before at the inn in the marketplace and were not in a tone of spirits to be fastidious about any thing heightened as the appearance of prosperity was to us by contrast and happy as even the refugees appeared to be at finding peace and safety the mall before the prince of oranges house was filled with parties of them as gay as if they had left their homes in flanders but for an holiday excursion  we were at the belvidere till evening lingering over the rich prospect of probably forty miles diameter from arnheim and duisbourg in the north to cleves and guelders in the south with an eastern view over half the forests of guelderland to those of westphalia such an extent of green landscape richly varied with towns villages and woods spreading and gradually ascending to the horizon was now almost as novel to us as it was placidly beautiful on the east the blue mountainous lines of germany broke in upon the reposing character of the scene  in the waal below two or three vessels bore the emperors flag and were laden as it was said with some of his regalia from flanders near them several bilanders the decks of which were covered with awnings had attracted spectators to the opposite bank for to that side only they were open and the company in all were objects of curiosity to the dutch being no less than the sisterhood of several flemish convents in their proper dresses and under the care of their respective abbesses these ladies had been thus situated for several days and nights which they had passed on board their vessels they were attended by their usual servants and remained together without going on shore being in expectation as we were told of invitations to suitable residences in germany but it was then reported at nimeguen that prince cobourg was readvancing to brussels and these societies had probably their misfortunes increased by the artifices of a political rumor we could not learn as we wished that they had brought away many effects their plate it was needless to enquire about the contributions of the preceding spring had no doubt swallowed up that  having dismissed our cologne watermen we embarked upon the waal the next day in a public boat for rotterdam a neat schuyt well equipped and navigated in which for a few florins you have the use of the cabin our voyage from the want of wind was slow enough to show as much as could be seen of the waal which at nimeguen runs almost constantly downward but is soon met by the tide and overcome or at least resisted by it the breadth which varies but little above bommel is to our recollection not less than that of the thames at fulham the depth during the beginning of the same space is probably considerable in the stream for even upon the shore our dextrous old steersman found water enough to sweep the rushy bank at almost every tack with a boat drawing about five feet the signs of activity in commerce are astonishing a small hamlet one cannot call any place in holland contemptible or miserable a hamlet of a dozen houses has two or three vessels of twenty tons each a village has a herring boat for almost every house and a trading vessel for rotterdam two or three times a week heavy high rigged vessels scarcely breasting the stream and fit only for river voyages we frequently met many of them carrying coals for the nearer part of germany such as we saw on the banks between rees and nimeguen and with much pleasure recognized for symptoms of neighborhood to england  the first town from nimeguen on the right bank of the waal is thiel which we had only time to see was enclosed by modern fortifications and was not inferior in neatness to other dutch towns at least not so in one good street which we were able to traverse a sand bank before the port has much lessened the trade of the place which in the tenth century was considerable enough to be acknowledged by the emperor otto in the grant of several privileges  about a league lower on the opposite side of the waal or rather on the small island of voorn stood formerly a fort called nassau which the french in      utterly destroyed near its site at the northern extremity of the island of bommel which lies between the maas and the waal a fort built by cardinal andrew of austria still subsists under the name of fort st andre the founder who built it upon the model of the citadel of antwerp had no other view than to command by it the town of bommel but in the year   00 prince maurice of nassau reduced the garrison after a siege of five weeks and it has since contributed to protect what it was raised to destroy the independence of the dutch commonwealth  in the evening we came opposite to the town of bommel where we were put on shore to pass the night and the next day being sunday the boat proceeded on the voyage for rotterdam but could not reach it before the next morning  bommel is a small town on the edge of the river surrounded by wood enough to make it remarkable in holland light neat and pretty the two principal streets cross each other at right angles and are without canals being at some distance from the general roads it is ill provided with inns but one of them has a delightful prospect and there is no dirt or other symptom of negligence within the inhabitants are advanced enough in prosperity and intelligent curiosity to have two societes where they meet to read new publications a luxury which may be found in almost every dutch town at the ends of the two principal streets are gates that toward the water between very old walls those on the land side modern and stronger with drawbridges over a wide fosse that nearly surrounds the town  on the other side of this ditch are high and broad embankments well planted with trees and so suitable to be used as public walks that we supposed them to have been raised partly for that purpose and partly as defenses to the country against water they are however greater curiosities having been thrown up by prince maurice in      chiefly because his garrison of four thousand foot and two thousand horse were too numerous for the old works and between these intrenchments was made what is thought to have been the first attempt at a covered way since improved into a regular part of fortifications this was during the ineffectual siege of three weeks in which mendoza lost two thousand men maurice having then a constant communication with the opposite bank of the waal by means of two bridges of boats one above the other below the town  bommel was otherwise extremely important in the struggle of the dutch against philip it was once planned to have been delivered by treachery but that being discovered the earl of mansfeldt philips commander raised the siege it adhered to the assembly at dort though the earl of march the commander of the first armed force of the flemings had committed such violences in the town that the prince of orange found it necessary to send him to prison in the campaign of   0  when prince maurice adopted defensive operations this was one of the extreme points of his line which extended from hence to schenck  the natural honesty of mankind is on the side of the defensive party and it is therefore that in reading accounts of sieges one is always on the side of the besieged the dutch except when subject to some extraordinary influence have been always defensive in their wars from their first astonishing resistance to philip to that against the petty attack which charles the second incited the bishop of munster to make who had the coolness to tell sir william temple that he had thought over the probabilities of his enterprise and if it failed he should not care for he could go into italy and buy a cardinals cap but that he had first a mind to make some figure in the world the territory of the united provinces is so small that in these wars the whole dutch nation has been in little better condition than that of a people besieged in one great town and louis the fourteenth in the attempt which charles the seconds wicked sister concerted between the two monarchs sent for the first time to a whole people a threat similar to those sometimes used against a single town his declaration of the   th of june      after boasting how his just designs and undertakings had prospered since his arrival in the army and how he would treat the dutch if by submission they would deserve his great goodness thus proceeds  on the contrary all of whatever quality and condition who shall refuse to comply with these offers and shall resist his majestys forces either by the inundation of their dyke or otherwise shall be punished with the utmost rigor at present all hostilities shall be used against those who oppose his majestys designs and when the ice shall open a passage on all sides his majesty will not give any quarter to the inhabitants of such cities but give order that their goods be plundered and their houses burnt  it is pleasant in every country to cherish the recollections which make it a spectacle for the mind as well as the eye and no country is enriched by so many as holland not even the west of england where patriotism and gratitude hover in remembrance over the places endeared by the steps of our glorious william  bommel is built on a broad projection of the island of the same name into the waal which thus flows nearly on two sides of its walls and must be effectually commanded by them but though it is therefore important in a military view and that the french were now so near to breda as to induce families to fly from thence whom we saw at bommel yet the latter place was in no readiness for defense there was not a cannon upon the walls or upon the ancient outworks which we mistook for terraces and not ten soldiers in the place a negligence which was however immediately after remedied  the dutch tardiness of exertion has been often blamed and in such instances deservedly but as to the influence of this sparingness in their general system of politics and in former periods a great deal more wit than truth has been circulated by politicians the chief value of power is in the known possession of it those who are believed to have exerted it much will be attacked because the exertion may be supposed to have exhausted the power the nation or the individual that attempts to rectify every error and punish every trivial offense of others may soon lose in worthless contests the strength that should be preserved for resisting the most positive and unequivocal attacks  ministers have appeared in holland who could plan unnecessary contests and meditate the baseness falsely called ambition of putting the whole valor and wealth of a nation into exercise for the purpose of enforcing whatever they may have once designed or said and as there is perhaps no country in europe which cannot justly allege some injury against another they have exaggerated the importance of such injuries for the purpose of impelling their own country by aggravated anger or fear into precipitate hostilities but the dutch accustoming themselves to as much vigilance as confidence have withheld encouragement from such artifices and hence that general tardiness in beginning wars which every politician capable of an inflammatory declamation thinks it wisdom to ridicule  we left bommel at seven in the morning in a stout decked seaboat well rigged and as appeared very dexterously navigated the wind was directly contrary and there are sometimes islands sometimes shoals in the waal which narrowed the channel to four or five times the length of the vessel yet there was not any failure in tacking and the boom was frequently assisted to traverse by the reeds of the bank which it swept the company in the cabin were not very numerous but there was amongst them at least one lamentable group the minister of a protestant church at maestricht an aged and decrepid gentleman flying with his wife and two daughters from the approaching siege of that place himself laid on pillows upon the floor of the cabin his daughters attending him all neglected all victims to the glories of war  the boat soon passed louvenstein on the left bank of the maese a brick castellated building apparently about two centuries old surrounded by some modern works which render it one of the defenses of the river count byland the late commander of breda was then imprisoned in this fortress which has been long used for state purposes here those friends of barneveldt were confined who derived from it and left to their posterity the name of the louvenstein party and hence grotius who was of the number made his escape concealed in a trunk which the sentinels had so often seen filled with arminian books that his wife persuaded them they carried nothing more than their usual cargo  from louvenstein near which the waal unites with the maese and assumes the name of that river we soon reached gorcum where the short stay of the boat permitted us only to observe the neatness of the town and that the fortifications had the appearance of being strong though small and seemed to be in most exact repair this indeed is one of the forts chiefly relied upon by the province of holland for in      their states made gorcum and naarden the extreme points of their line of defense and ordered a dyke to be thrown across the linge which flows into the maese at the former place for the purpose of overflowing the surrounding country  the next town in the voyage is dort formerly one of the most considerable in holland and still eminent for its wealth though the trade is diminished by that of rotterdam this is the town which dumourier strove to reach in the invasion of      and forty thousand stand of arms were found to have been collected there for him our boat passed before one quarter in which the houses rise immediately over a broad bay of the maese with an air of uncommon gaiety and lightness but the evenness of the town prevented us from seeing more than the part directly nearest  in the bay was one of those huge timber floats the construction of which has been before described it was crowded with visitors from the town and the wooden huts upon it being ornamented with flags had the appearance of booths at a fair large as this was it had been considerably diminished since its arrival at dort and several hundreds of the workmen had departed  a little further on and within sight of this joyous company was the melancholy reverse of nearly an hundred ladies driven from some convent in flanders now residing like those near nimeguen in bilanders moored to the bank their vessels being open on the side toward the water we caught as full a view of them as could be had without disrespect and saw that they still wore their conventual dresses and were seated apparently according to their ages at some sort of needle work it might have been censured a few years since that mistakes or deceptions as to religious duties should have driven them from the world but it was certainly now only to be lamented that any thing short of the gradual and peaceful progress of reason should have expelled them from their retirement  we reached rotterdam in the evening and stayed there the next day to observe whether the confidence of the dutch in their dykes and fortresses was sufficient to preserve their tranquillity in a place almost within hearing of the war the french being then besieging sluys there was no perceptible symptom of agitation or any diminution of the ordinary means for increasing wealth the persons with whom we conversed and they were not a few spoke of the transactions of the campaign with almost as much calmness and curiosity as if these had been passing in india they could not suppose it possible that the french might reach the city or if they did seemed to rely upon the facility with which their property could be removed by the canals through leyden and haerlem to the shore of the zuyder zee then across it by sailing barges and then again by the canals as far as groningen whither the french would certainly not penetrate so valuable was water thought in holland not only as a means of opulence in peace but of defense or preservative flight in war an excessive selfishness which is the vice of the dutch appeared sometimes to prevent those who could fly from thinking of their remaining countrymen  an intention of dispensing with the customary fair was the only circumstance which distinguished this season from others at rotterdam and that was imputed to the prudence of preventing any very numerous meetings of the populace  about three weeks sooner than was necessary for it was so long before a convenient passage occurred we went from hence to helvoetsluys and there remained a fortnight watching an inflexible northwesterly wind and listening to accounts but too truly certified of french frigates and privateers almost unopposed in those latitudes lloyds list brought the names of five or seven french ships then known to be cruising in the north and one packet was delayed in its voyage by the sight of several dutch vessels set on fire within a few leagues of goree the dutch lamented that the want of seamen crippled the operations of their admiralty board an englishman who was proud to deny that any such want or want in such a degree existed as to his country was reduced to silence and shame when it was enquired why then have these seas been for twelve months thus exposed to the dominion of the french  at length a convoy arrived for a noble family and we endeavored to take the benefit of it by embarking in a packet which sailed at the same time but the sloop of war was unable to pass over what are called the flats and our captain had resolved to proceed without it notwithstanding the contrarieties of the wind when with much joy we discerned a small boat and knew it to be english by the skilful impetuosity of the rowers having induced the people of the packet to make a signal by paying them for the passage to harwich we were fortunately taken on board this boat at the distance of about three leagues from helvoetsluys and soon relanded at that place the packet proceeding on her voyage which supposing no interruption from the french vessels was not likely to be made in less than three days we rejoiced at the release from fatigue and from fear at least if not from danger and seeing little probability of an immediate passage returned the next day to rotterdam with the hope of finding some neutral vessel bound to an english port  we were immediately gratified by the promise of an american captain to meet us with his vessel at helvoetsluys and the next day had a delightful voyage thither in a hired yacht partly by the maese and partly by channels inaccessible to large vessels  flaarding the maese presently brought us opposite to this small port the metropolis of the herring fishers rendered interesting by the patient industry and useful courage of its inhabitants we landed at it but saw only what was immediately open for observation like most of the dutch towns on the banks of rivers it is protected from floods by standing at the distance of three or four hundred yards from the shore and communicates with the stream only by a narrow but deep canal the best street is built upon the quays of this channel on which the herring boats deposit their cargoes before the doors of the owners we did not see more than fifty a great number being then at sea except the business in this street and the smell of herrings which prevailed every where there was nothing to show that we were in a place supported solely by the industry of fishermen no neglected houses no cottages no dirty streets no inferiority in point of neatness and brightness to the other towns of holland  the inhabitants are remarkable for adhering to the dress as well as the employments of their ancestors so much so that their clothing is mentioned in other towns as the representation of the ancient national dress common throughout all the provinces two centuries since and it is certain that their appearance is exactly such as is delineated in pictures of that date  some miles further we entered the old maese a channel in several parts very narrow and evidently preserved by art but in others nobly expansive and filled almost to the level of the luxuriant pastures and groves that border it in one part where the ancient stream takes a circuitous course a canal has been cut that shortens the voyage for light vessels by several miles and barks in one channel are sometimes visible from the other their sails swelling over fields in which at a distance no water is discernible neat and substantial farmhouses with meadows slanting from them to the river frequently occurred and there were more appearances of the careful labors peculiar to the dutch than in the great maese itself the banks being occasionally supported like their dykes by a compact basketwork of flags and faggots  passing many small villages or hamlets we came at sunset to the large branch of the sea which spreads from williamstadt to helvoetsluys and from thence to the german ocean the former fortress was faintly visible at a great distance over the water and while we were straining our sight toward it there was proof enough of a nearness to the present theater of war the sounds of the siege of sluys coming loudly and distinctly in the breeze the characters of evening had fallen upon the scene in mild and deep solemnity but the glories of nature were unselt while a dreadful estimation of the miseries produced at each return of the sullen roar pressed almost exclusively upon the mind considerations which were soon after prolonged by the melancholy view of several english transports filled with wounded soldiers whose blythe music now at the firing of the evening gun was rendered painful by its contrast to the truth of their conditions  at helvoetsluys nothing was to be heard but accounts derived from many respectable officers on their way to england of the unexampled difficulties borne cheerfully borne by the british army within the last three months and deservedly mentioned not as complaints but as proofs of their sirmness there were however mingled with these many reports as to the contrary conduct even of those continental troops which still kept the field with us of their tardiness their irregularity of the readiness with which they permitted the british to assume all the dangers of attacks and of their little cooperation even in the means of general resistance brave anglois brave anglois was the constant shout of these troops when they had recourse to the british to regain the posts themselves had just lost or to make some assault which they had refused or had attempted with ineffectual formality they would then follow our troops and when an advantage was gained seemed to think they had share enough of the victory if they were at hand to continue the slaughter of the retreating and to engross all the plunder of the dead  we were as glad to escape from such considerations as from the crowded inns of helvoetsluys now little more convenient than ships and the next morning embarked on board the american vessel then arrived from rotterdam a fair wind soon wafted us out of sight of the low coast of holland but we were afterward becalmed and carried by tides so far toward the flemish shore as to have the firing before sluys not only audible but terribly loud for part of three days we remained within hearing of this noise but did not therefore think ourselves very distant from the english coast knowing that the fire at the preceding siege of nieuport had been heard as far as the downs nieuport the wretched scene of so many massacres and of distress which in holland had been forcibly described to us by eyewitnesses  so keenly indeed were the horrors of this place conceived by those who personally escaped from them that of the emigrants rescued by the intrepidity of our seamen many suppressed all joy at their own deliverance by lamentations for the fate of their brethren one gentleman was no sooner on board a ship then exposed to the batteries on shore than he climbed the shrouds and remained aloft notwithstanding all entreaties till a severe wound obliged him to descend another who had been saved from the beach by a young sailor was unable to swim so far as the ship and the honest lad having taken him upon his back struggled hard amidst a shower of balls to save both their lives at length he too began to falter and the weakness of his efforts not his complaints seemed to show his companion that one or both of them must perish the latter nobly asked the lad whether he could save his own life if left to himself and receiving a reluctant reply that probably he might do so but that he would strive for both the emigrant instantly plunged into the ocean and was seen no more the glorious sailor reached his ship just as he began again to fail and was saved  the calm continued during the day and the sun set with uncommon grandeur among clouds of purple red and gold that mingling with the serene azure of the upper sky composed a richness and harmony of coloring which we never saw surpassed it was most interesting to watch the progress of evening and its effect on the waters streaks of light scattered among the dark western clouds after the sun had set and gleaming in long reflection on the sea while a gray obscurity was drawing over the east as the vapors rose gradually from the ocean the air was breathless the tall sails of the vessel were without motion and her course upon the deep scarcely perceptible while above the planet jupiter burned with steady dignity and threw a tremulous line of light on the sea whose surface flowed in smooth waveless expanse then other planets appeared and countless stars spangled the dark waters twilight now pervaded air and ocean but the west was still luminous where one solemn gleam of dusky red edged the horizon from under heavy vapors  it was now that we first discovered some symptoms of england the lighthouse on the southforeland appeared like a dawning star above the margin of the sea  the vessel made little progress during the night with the earliest dawn of morning we were on deck in the hope of seeing the english coast but the mists veiled it from our view a spectacle however the most grand in nature repaid us for our disappointment and we found the circumstances of a sunrise at sea yet more interesting than those of a sunset the moon bright and nearly at her meridian shed a strong luster on the ocean and gleamed between the sails upon the deck but the dawn beginning to glimmer contended with her light and soon touching the waters with a cold gray tint discovered them spreading all round to the vast horizon not a sound broke upon the silence except the lulling one occasioned by the course of the vessel through the waves and now and then the drowsy song of the pilot as he leaned on the helm his shadowy figure just discerned and that of a sailor pacing near the head of the ship with crossed arms and a rolling step the captain wrapped in a seacoat lay asleep on the deck wearied with the early watch as the dawn strengthened it discovered white sails stealing along the distance and the flight of some seafowls as they uttered their slender cry and then dropping upon the waves sat floating on the surface meanwhile the light tints in the east began to change and the skirts of a line of clouds below to assume a hue of tawny red which gradually became rich orange and purple we could now perceive a long tract of the coast of france like a dark streak of vapor hovering in the south and were somewhat alarmed on finding ourselves within view of the french shore while that of england was still invisible  the moonlight faded fast from the waters and soon the long beams of the sun shot their lines upwards through the clouds and into the clear blue sky above and all the sea below glowed with fiery reflections for a considerable time before his disk appeared at length he rose from the waves looking from under clouds of purple and gold and as he seemed to touch the water a distant vessel passed over his disk like a dark speck  we were soon after cheered by the faintly seen coast of england but at the same time discovered nearer to us on the southwest the high blue headlands of calais and more eastward the town with its large church and the steeples of two others seated on the edge of the sea the woods that fringe the summits of hills rising over it were easily distinguished with glasses as well as the national flag on the steeple of the great church as we proceeded calais cliffs at a considerable distance westward of the town lost their aerial blue and showed an high front of chalky precipice overtopped by dark downs beyond far to the southwest and at the foot of a bold promontory that swelled above all the neighboring heights our glasses gave us the towers and ramparts of boulogne sloping upward from the shore with its tall lighthouse on a low point running out into the sea the whole appearing with considerable dignity and picturesque effect the hills beyond were tamer and sunk gradually away in the horizon at length the breeze wafting us more to the north we discriminated the bolder features of the english coast and about noon found ourselves nearly in the middle of the channel having picardy on our left and kent on the right its white cliffs aspiring with great majesty over the flood the sweeping bay of dover with all its chalky heights soon after opened the town appeared low on the shore within and the castle with round and massy towers crowned the vast rock which advancing into the sea formed the eastern point of the crescent while shakespeares cliff bolder still and sublime as the eternal name it bears was the western promontory of the bay the height and grandeur of this cliff were particularly striking when a ship was seen sailing at its base diminished by comparison to an inch from hence the cliffs toward folkstone though still broken and majestic gradually decline there are perhaps few prospects of sea and shore more animated and magnisicent than this the vast expanse of water the character of the cliffs that guard the coast the ships of war and various merchantmen moored in the downs the lighter vessels skimming along the channel and the now distant shore of france with calais glimmering faintly and hinting of different modes of life and a new world all these circumstances formed a scene of preeminent combination and led to interesting reflection  our vessel was bound to deal and leaving dover and its cliffs on the south we entered that noble bay which the rich shores of kent open for the sea gentle hills swelling all round from the water green with woods or cultivation and speckled with towns and villages with now and then the towers of an old fortress offered a landscape particularly cheering to eyes accustomed to the monotonous flatness of dutch views and we landed in england under impressions of delight more varied and strong than can be conceived without referring to the joy of an escape from districts where there was scarcely an home for the natives and to the love of our own country greatly enhanced by all that had been seen of others  between deal and london after being first struck by the superior appearance and manners of the people to those of the countries we had been lately accustomed to a contrast too obvious as well as too often remarked to be again insisted upon but which made all the ordinary circumstances of the journey seem new and delightful the different between the landscapes of england and germany occurred forcibly to notice the large scale in which every division of land appeared in germany the long corn grounds the huge stretches of hills the vast plains and the wide valleys could not but be beautifully opposed by the varieties and undulations of english surface with gently swelling slopes rich in verdure thick enclosures woods bowery hop grounds sheltered mansions announcing the wealth and substantial farms with neat villages the comfort of the country english landscape may be compared to cabinet pictures delicately beautiful and highly finished german scenery to paintings for a vestibule of bold outline and often sublime but coarse and to be viewed with advantage only from a distance  northward beyond london we may make one stop after a country not otherwise necessary to be noticed to mention hardwick in derbyshire a seat of the duke of devonshire once the residence of the earl of shrewsbury to whom elizabeth deputed the custody of the unfortunate mary it stands on an easy height a few miles to the left of the road from mansfield to chesterfield and is approached through shady lanes which conceal the view of it till you are on the confines of the park three towers of hoary gray then rise with great majesty among old woods and their summits appear to be covered with the lightly shivered fragments of battlements which however are soon discovered to be perfectly carved open work in which the letters e s frequently occur under a coronet the initials and the memorials of the vanity of elizabeth countess of shrewsbury who built the present edifice its tall features of a most picturesque tint were finely disclosed between the luxuriant woods and over the lawns of the park which every now and then let in a glimpse of the derbyshire hills the scenery reminded us of the exquisite descriptions of harewood the deep embowering shades that veil elfrida and those of hardwick once veiled a form as lovely as the ideal graces of the poet and conspired to a fate more tragical than that which harewood witnessed  in front of the great gates of the castle court the ground adorned by old oaks suddenly sinks to a darkly shadowed glade and the view opens over the vale of scarsdale bounded by the wild mountains of the peak immediately to the left of the present residence some ruined features of the ancient one enwreathed with the rich drapery of ivy give an interest to the scene which the later but more historical structure heightens and prolongs we followed not without emotion the walk which mary had so often trodden to the folding doors of the great hall whose lofty grandeur aided by silence and seen under the influence of a lowering sky suited the temper of the whole scene the tall windows which half subdue the light they admit just allowed us to distinguish the large figures in the tapestry above the oak wainscoting and showed a colonnade of oak supporting a gallery along the bottom of the hall with a pair of gigantic elks horns flourishing between the windows opposite to the entrance the scene of marys arrival and her feelings upon entering this solemn shade came involuntarily to the mind the noise of horses feet and many voices from the court her proud yet gentle and melancholy look as led by my lord keeper she passed slowly up the hall his somewhat obsequious yet jealous and vigilant air while awed by her dignity and beauty he remembers the terrors of his own queen the silence and anxiety of her maids and the bustle of the surrounding attendants  from the hall a staircase ascends to the gallery of a small chapel in which the chairs and cushions used by mary still remain and proceeds to the first story where only one apartment bears memorials of her imprisonment the bed tapestry and chairs having been worked by herself this tapestry is richly embossed with emblematic figures each with its title worked above it and having been scrupulously preserved is still entire and fresh  over the chimney of an adjoining dining room to which as well as to other apartments on this floor some modern furniture has been added is this motto carved in oak there is only this to fear god and keep his commandments   so much less valuable was timber than workmanship when this mansion was constructed that where the staircases are not of stone they are formed of solid oaken steps instead of planks such is that from the second or state story to the roof whence on clear days york and lincoln cathedrals are said to be included in the extensive prospect this second floor is that which gives its chief interest to the edifice nearly all the apartments of it were allotted to mary some of them for state purposes and the furniture is known by other proofs than its appearance to remain as she left it the chief room or that of audience is of uncommon loftiness and strikes by its grandeur before the veneration and tenderness arise which its antiquities and the plainly told tale of the sufferings they witnessed excite  the walls which are covered to a considerable height with tapestry are painted above with historical groups the chairs are of black velvet nearly concealed by a raised needlework of gold silver and colors that mingle with surprising richness and remain in fresh preservation the upper end of the room is distinguished by a lofty canopy of the same materials and by steps which support two chairs so that the earl and countess of shrewsbury probably enjoyed their own stateliness here as well as assisted in the ceremonies practiced before mary a carpeted table in front of the canopy was perhaps the desk of commissioners or secretaries who here recorded some of the proceedings concerning her below which the room breaks into a spacious recess where a few articles of furniture are deposited not originally placed in it a bed of state used by mary the curtains of gold tissue but in so tattered a condition that its orginal texture can scarcely be perceived this and the chairs which accompany it are supposed to have been much earlier than marys time  a short passage leads from the state apartment to her own chamber a small room overlooked from the passage by a window which enabled her attendants to know that she was contriving no means of escape through the others into the court the bed and chairs of this room are of black velvet embroidered by herself the toilet of gold tissue all more decayed than worn and probably used only toward the conclusion of her imprisonment here when she was removed from some better apartment in which the ancient bed now in the stateroom had been placed the date      is once or twice inscribed in this chamber for no reason that could relate to mary who was removed hence in      and fell by the oftenblooded hands of elizabeth in       these are the apartments distinguished by having been the residence of so unhappy a personage on the other side of the mansion a grand gallery occupies the length of the whole front which is     feet and contains many portraits now placed carelessly on chairs or the floor amongst them an head of sir thomas more apparently very fine heads of henrys the fourth seventh and eighth a portrait of lady jane gray meek and fair before a harpsichord on which psalmbook is opened at the bottom of the gallery elizabeth slyly proud and meanly violent and at the top mary in black taken a short time before her death her countenance much faded deeply marked by indignation and grief and reduced as if to the spectre of herself frowning with suspicion upon all who approached it the black eyes looking out from their corners thin lips somewhat aquiline nose and beautiful chin  what remains of the more ancient building is a ruin which standing nearly on the brink of the glade is a fine object from this a few apartments though approached with difficulty through the fragments of others are still almost entire and the dimensions of that called the giants chamber are remarkable for the beauty of their proportion  from hardwick to within a few miles of middleton the beauty of the country declines while the sublimity is not perfected but from the northwest brow of brampton moor the vast hills of derbyshire appear in wild and ghastly succession middleton hewn out of the gray rocks that impend over it and scarcely distinguishable from them is worth notice for its very small and neat octagon church built partly by brief and partly by a donation from the duke of devonshire the valley or rather chasm at the entrance of which it stands is called middleton dale and runs for two miles between perpendicular walls of rock which have more the appearance of having been torn asunder by some convulsive rent of the earth than any we have elsewhere seen the strata are horizontal and the edges of each are often distinct and rounded one of the characteristics of granite three gray rocks resembling castles project from these solid walls and now and then a limekiln round like a bastion half involves in smoke a figure who standing on the summit looks the witch of the dale on an edge of her cauldron watching the workings of incantation  the chasm opened at length to a hill whence wild moorish mountains were seen on all sides some entirely covered with the dull purple of heath others green but without enclosures except sometimes a stone wall and the dark sides of others marked only by the blue smoke of weeds driven in circles near the ground  toward sunset from a hill in cheshire we had a vast view over part of that county and nearly all lancashire a scene of fertile plains and gentle heights till some broad and towering mountains at an immense distance were but uncertainly distinguished from the clouds soon after the cheerful populousness of the rich towns and villages in lancashire supplied objects for attention of a different character stockport first crowded with buildings and people as much so as some of the busiest quarters in london with large blazing fires in every house by the light of which women were frequently spinning and manufacturers issuing from their workshops and filling the steep streets which the chaise rolled down with dangerous rapidity then an almost continued street of villages to manchester some miles before which the road was busy with passengers and carriages as well as bordered by handsome country houses and finally for this day manchester itself a second london enormous to those who have not seen the first almost tumultuous with business and yet well proved to afford the necessary peacefulness to science letters and taste and not only for itself may manchester be an object of admiration but for the contrast of its useful profits to the wealth of a neighboring place immersed in the dreadful guilt of the slave trade with the continuance of which to believe national prosperity compatible is to hope that the actions of nations pass unseen before the almighty or to suppose extenuation of crimes by increase of criminality and that the eternal laws of right and truth which smite the wickedness of individuals are too weak to struggle with the accumulated and comprehensive guilt of a national participation in robbery cruelty and murder  from manchester to lancaster the road leads through a pleasant and populous country which rises gradually as it approaches the huge hills we had noticed in the distance from the brow of cheshire and whose attitudes now resembled those of the rheingau as seen from mentz from some moors on this side of lancaster the prospects open very extensively over a rich tract fading into blue ridges while on the left long lines of distant sea appear every now and then over the dark woods of the shore with vessels sailing as if on their summits but the view from a hill descending to lancaster is preeminent for grandeur and comprehends an extent of sea and land and a union of the sublime in both which we have never seen equalled in the green vale of the lune below lies the town spreading up the side of a round hill overtopped by the old towers of the castle and the church beyond over a ridge of gentle heights which bind the west side of the vale the noble inlet of the sea that flows upon the ulverston and lancaster sands is seen at the feet of an amphitheatre formed by nearly all the mountains of the lakes an exhibition of alpine grandeur both in form and coloring which with the extent of water below compose a scenery perhaps faintly rivalling that of the lake of geneva to the south and west the irish channel finishes the view  the ancient town and castle of lancaster have been so often and so well described that little remains to be said of them to the latter considerable additions are building in the gothic style which when time shall have shaded the stone will harmonize well with the venerable towers and gate house of the old structure from a turret rising over the leads of the castle called john of gaunts chair the prospect is still finer than from the terrace of the churchyard below overlooking the lune and its green slopes the eye ranges to the bay of the sea beyond and to the cumberland and lancashire mountains on an island near the extremity of the peninsula of low furness the double point of peel castle starts up from the sea but is so distant that it resembles a forked rock this peninsula which separates the bay of ulverston from the irish channel swells gradually into a pointed mountain called blackcomb thirty miles from lancaster the first in the amphitheatre that binds the bay hence a range of lower but more broken and forked summits extends northward to the fells of high furness rolled behind each other huge towering and dark then higher still langdale pikes with a confusion of other fells that crown the head of windermere and retire toward keswick whose gigantic mountains helvelyn and saddleback are however sunk in distance below the horizon of the nearer ones the top of skiddaw may be discerned when the air is clear but it is too far off to appear with dignity from windermerefells the heights soften toward the vale of lonsdale on the east side of which ingleborough a mountain in craven rears his rugged front the loftiest and most majestic in the scene the nearer country from this point of the landscape is intersected with cultivated hills between which the lune winds its bright but shallow stream falling over a weir and passing under a very handsome stone bridge at the entrance of the town in its progress toward the sea a ridge of rocky eminences shelters lancaster on the east whence they decline into the low and uninteresting country that stretches to the channel  the appearance of the northern fells is ever changing with the weather and shifting lights sometimes they resemble those evening clouds on the horizon that catch the last gleams of the sun at others wrapped in dark mist they are only faintly traced and seem like stormy vapors rising from the sea but in a bright day their appearance is beautiful then their grand outlines are distinctly drawn upon the sky a vision of alps the rugged sides are faintly marked with light and shadow with wood and rock and here and there a cluster of white cottages or farms and hamlets gleam at their feet along the waters edge over the whole landscape is then drawn a softening azure or sometimes a purple hue exquisitely lovely while the sea below reflects a brighter tint of blue  from lancaster to kendal leaving lancaster we wound along the southern brow of the vale of the lune which there serpentizes among meadows and is soon after shut up between steep shrubby banks from the heights we had some fine retrospects of lancaster and the distant sea but about three miles from the town the hills open forward to a view as much distinguished by the notice of mr gray as by its own charms we here looked down over a woody and finely broken foreground upon the lune and the vale of lonsdale undulating in richly cultivated slopes with ingleborough for the background bearing its bold promontory on high the very crown and paragon of the landscape to the west the vale winds from sight among smoother hills and the gracefully falling line of a mountain on the left forms with the wooded heights on the right a kind of frame for the distant picture  the road now turned into the sweetly retired vale of caton and by the village churchyard in which there is not a single gravestone to hornby a small straggling town delightfully seated near the entrance of the vale of lonsdale its thin toppling castle is seen among wood at a considerable distance with a dark hill rising over it what remains of the old edifice is a square gray building with a slender watchtower rising in one corner like a feather in a hat which joins the modern mansion of white stone and gives it a singular appearance by seeming to start from the center of its roof  in front a steep lawn descends between avenues of old wood and the park extends along the skirts of the craggy hill that towers above at its foot is a good stone bridge over the wenning now shrunk in its pebbly bed and further on near the castle the church showing a handsome octagonal tower crowned with battlements the road then becomes extremely interesting and at melling a village on a brow some miles further the view opens over the whole vale of lonsdale the eye now passes beneath the arching foliage of some trees in the foreground to the sweeping valley where meadows of the most vivid green and dark woods with white cottages and villages peeping from among them mingle with surprising richness and undulate from either bank of the lune to the feet of hills ingleborough rising from elegantly swelling ground overlooked this enchanting vale on the right clouds rolling along its broken top like smoke from a cauldron and its hoary tint forming a boundary to the soft verdure and rich woodlands of the slopes at its feet the perspective was terminated by the tall peeping heads of the westmoreland fells the nearer ones tinged with faintest purple the more distant with light azure and this is the general boundary to a scene in the midst of which enclosed between nearer and lower hills lies the vale of lonsdale of a character mild delicate and reposing like the countenance of a madona  descending melling brow and winding among the perpetually changing scenery of the valley we approached ingleborough and it was interesting to observe the lines of its bolder features gradually strengthening and the shadowy markings of its minuter ones becoming more distinct as we advanced rock and gray crags looked out from the heath on every side but its form on each was very different toward lonsdale the mountain is bold and majestic rising in abrupt and broken precipices and often impending till at the summit it suddenly becomes flat and is level for nearly a mile whence it descends in a long gradual ridge to craven in yorkshire in summer some festivities are annually celebrated on this top and the country people as they drink the freshness of the mountain breeze mrs barbauld  look over the wild moorlands of yorkshire the rich vales of lancashire and to the sublime mountains of westmoreland  crossing a small bridge we turned from ingleborough and passed very near the ancient walls of thirlham castle little of which is now remaining the ruin is on a green broken knoll one side of which is darkened with brushwood and dwarfoak cattle were reposing in the shade on the bank of a rivulet that rippled through what was formerly the castle ditch a few old trees waved over what was once a tower now covered with ivy  some miles further we crossed the leck a shrunk and desolate stream nearly choked with pebbles winding in a deep rocky glen where trees and shrubs marked the winter boundary of the waters our road mounting a green eminence of the opposite bank on which stands overborough the handsome modern mansion of mr fenwick wound between plantations and meadows painted with yellow and purple flowers like those of spring as we passed through their gentle slopes we had now and then sweet views between the foliage on the left into the vale of lonsdale now contracting in its course and winding into ruder scenery among these catches the best picture was perhaps where the white town of kirby lonsdale shelves along the opposite bank having rough heathy hills immediately above it and below a venerable gothic bridge over the lune rising in tall arches like an ancient aqueduct its gray tint agreeing well with the silvery lightness of the water and the green shades that flourished from the steep margin over the abutments  the view from this bridge too was beautiful the river foaming below among masses of dark rock variegated with light tints of gray as if touched by the painters pencil withdrew toward the south in a straight channel with the woods of overborough on the left the vale dilating opened a long perspective to ingleborough and many blue mountains more distant with all the little villages we had passed glittering on the intervening eminences the coloring of some low hills on the right was particularly beautiful long shades of wood being overtopped with brown heath while below meadows of soft verdure fell gently toward the river bank  kirby lonsdale a neat little town commanding the whole vale is on the western steep we staid two hours at it gratified by witnessing at the first inn we reached the abundance of the country and the goodwill of the people in times when the prices of necessary articles are increasing with the taste for all unnecessary display instances of cheapness may be to persons of small incomes something more than mere physical treasures they have a moral value in contributing to independence of mind  here we had an early and as it afterward appeared a very exaggerated specimen of the dialect of the country a woman talked for five minutes against our window of whose conversation we could understand scarcely a word soon after a boy replied to a question  i do na ken and  gang was presently the common word for go symptoms of nearness to a country which we did not approach without delighting to enumerate the instances of genius and worth that adorn it  leaving kirbylonsdale by the kendal road we mounted a steep hill and looking back from its summit upon the whole vale of lonsdale perceived ourselves to be in the midway between beauty and desolation so enchanting was the retrospect and so wild and dreary the prospect from the neighborhood of caton to kirby the ride was superior for elegant beauty to any we had passed this from kirby to kendal is of a character distinctly opposite after losing sight of the vale the road lies for nearly the whole distance over moors and perpetually succeeding hills thinly covered with dark purple heath flowers of which the most distant seemed black the dreariness of the scene was increased by a heavy rain and by the flowness of our progress jostling amongst coal carts for ten miles of rugged ground the views over the westmoreland mountains were however not entirely obscured their vast ridges were visible in the horizon to the north and west line over line frequently in five or six ranges sometimes the intersecting mountains opened to others beyond that fell in deep and abrupt precipices their profiles drawing toward a point below and seeming to sink in a bottomless abyss  on our way over these wilds parts of which are called endmoor and cowbrows we overtook only long trains of coal carts and after ten miles of bleak mountain road began to desire a temporary home somewhat sooner than we perceived kendal whitesmoking in the dark vale as we approached the outlines of its ruinous castle were just distinguishable through the gloom scattered in masses over the top of a small round hill on the right at the entrance of the town the river kent dashed in foam down a weir beyond it on a green slope the gothic tower of the church was half hid by a cluster of dark trees gray fells glimmered in the distance  we were lodged at another excellent inn and the next morning walked over the town which has an air of trade mingled with that of antiquity its history has been given in other places and we are not able to discuss the doubt whether it was the roman brocanonacio or not the manufacture of cloth which our statute books testify to have existed as early as the reign in which falstaff is made to allude to it appears to be still in vigor for the town is surrounded toward the river with dying grounds we saw however no shades of kendal green or indeed any but bright scarlet  the church is remarkable for three chapels memorials of the ancient dignity of three neighboring families the bellinghams stricklands and parrs these are enclosures on each side of the altar differing from pews chiefly in being large enough to contain tombs mr gray noticed them minutely in the year      they were then probably entire but the wainscot or railing which divided the chapel of the parrs from the aisle is now gone of two stone tombs in it one is enclosed with modern railing and there are many remnants of painted arms on the adjoining windows the chapel of the stricklands which is between this and the altar is separated from the church aisle by a solid wainscot to the height of four feet and after that by a wooden railing with broken fillagree ornaments that of the bellinghams contains an ancient tomb of which the brass plates that bore inscriptions and arms are now gone but some traces of the latter remain in plaistered stone at the side over it are the fragments of an helmet and in the roof those of armorial bearings carved in wood on a pillar near this is an inscription almost obliterated in which the following words may yet be traced dame thomasim thornburgh wiffe of sir william thornburgh knight daughter of sir robert bellingham gentle knight the ellventhe of august on thousand five hundredth eighty too   the saxon has been so strongly engrafted on our language that in reading old inscriptions especially those which are likely to have been spelt according to the pronunciation one is frequently reminded by ancient english words of the modern german synonyms a german of the present day would say for eleven eilf pronounced long like eilve and for five funf pronounced like fuynf  over the chief seat in the old pew of the bellinghams is a brass plate engraved with the figure of a man in armor and on each side of it a brass escutcheon of which that on the right has a motto thus spelled ains y lest under the figure is the following inscription also cut in brass here lies the body of alan bellingham esquier  the correctness of inserting the unpronounced consonants in the words eight and daughters notwithstanding the varieties of the other orthography in this inscription is a proof of the universality of the saxon mode of spelling with great abundance and even waste of letters a mode which is so incorporated with our language that those who are for dispensing with it in some instances as in the final k in public and other words should consider what a general change they have to effect or what partial incongruities they must submit to  kendal is built on the lower steeps of a hill that towers over the principal street and bears on one of its brows a testimony to the independence of the inhabitants an obelisk dedicated to liberty and to the memory of the revolution in      at a time when the memory of that revolution is reviled and the praises of liberty itself endeavored to be suppressed by the artifice of imputing to it the crimes of anarchy it was impossible to omit any act of veneration to the blessings of this event being thus led to ascend the hill we had a view of the country over which it presides a scene simple great and free as the spirit revered amidst it  from kendal to bampton and hawes water of two roads from kendal to bampton one is through long sleddale the other over shapfell the king of the westmoreland mountains of which routes the last is the most interesting for simple sublimity leading through the heart of the wildest tracts and opening to such vast highland scenery as even derbyshire cannot show we left kendal by this road and from a very old ruinous bridge had a full view of the castle stretching its dark walls and broken towers round the head of a green hill to the southward of the town these relics are however too far separated by the decay of large masses of the original edifice and contain little that is individually picturesque  the road now lay through shady lanes and over undulating but gradually ascending ground from whence were pleasant views of the valley with now and then a break in the hills on the left opening to a glimpse of the distant fells toward windermere gray and of more pointed form than any we had yet seen for hitherto the mountains though of huge outline were not so broken or alpine in their summits as to strike the fancy with surprise after about three miles a very steep hill shuts up the vale to the north and from a gray rock near the summit called stonecragg the prospect opens over the vale of kendal with great dignity and beauty its form from hence seems nearly circular the hills spread round it and sweep with easy lines into the bottom green nearly to their summits where no fantastic points bend over it though rock frequently mingles with the heath the castle or its low green hill looked well nearly in the center of the landscape with kendal and its mountain on the right far to the south were the groves of levens park almost the only wood in the scene and over the heights beyond blue hills bounded the horizon on the west an opening in the near steeps discovered clusters of huge and broken fells while other breaks on the east showed long ridges stretching toward the south nearer us and to the northward the hills rose dark and awful crowding over and intersecting each other in long and abrupt lines heath and crag their only furniture  the rough knolls around us and the dark mountain above gave force to the verdant beauty and tranquillity of the vale below and seemed especially to shelter from the storms of the north some white farms and cottages scattered among enclosures in the hollows soon after reaching the summit of the mountain itself a vale appeared below a deep retired abode and we looked down on the left into long sleddale a little scene of exquisite beauty surrounded with images of greatness this narrow vale or glen showed a level of the brightest verdure with a few cottages scattered among groves enclosed by dark fells that rose steeply yet gracefully and at their summits bent forward in masses of shattered rock an hugely pointed mountain called keintmoorhead shuts up this sweet scene to the north rising in a sudden precipice from the vale and heightening by barren and gloomy steeps the miniature beauty that glowed at its feet two mountains called whiteside and pottersfell screen the perspective stonecrag is at the southern end fronting keintmoorhead the vale seen beyond the broken ground we were upon formed a landscape of perhaps unexampled variety and grace of coloring the tender green of the lowland the darker verdure of the woods ascending the mountains the brown rough heath above them and the impending crags over all exhibit their numerous shades within a space not more than two miles long or half a mile in breadth  from the right of our road another valley extended whose character is that of simple sublimity unmixed with any tint of beauty the vast yet narrow perspective sweeps in ridges of mountains huge barren and brown point beyond point the highest of which howgillfell gives its name to the whole district in which not a wood a village or a farm appeared to cheer the long vista a shepherd boy told us the names of almost all the heights within the horizon and we are sorry not to have written them for the names of mountains are seldom compounded of modern or trivial denominations and frequently are somewhat descriptive of their prototypes he informed us also that we should go over eight miles of shapfell without seeing a house and soon after at hawsfoot we took leave of the last on the road entering then a close valley surrounded by stupendous mountains of heath and rock more towering and abrupt than those that had appeared in moorlands on the other side of kendal a stream rolling in its rocky channel and crossing the road under a rude bridge was all that broke the solitary silence or gave animation to the view except the flocks that hung upon the precipices and which at that height were scarcely distinguishable from the gray round stones thickly starting out from the heathy steeps the highlands of scotland could scarcely have offered to ossian more images of simple greatness or more circumstances for melancholy inspiration dark glens and fells the mossy stone the lonely blast descending on the valley the roar of distant torrents every where occurred and to the bard the song of spirits would have swelled with these sounds and their fleeting forms have appeared in the clouds that frequently floated along the mountain tops  the road now ascending shapfell alternately climbed the steeps and sunk among the hollows of this sovereign mountain which gives its name to all the surrounding hills and during an ascent of four miles we watched every form and attitude of the features which composed this vast scenery sometimes we looked from a precipice into deep valleys varied only with shades of heath with the rude summer hut of the shepherd or by streams accumulating into torrents and at others caught long prospects over high lands as huge and wild as the nearer ones which partially intercepted them  the flocks in this high region are so seldom disturbed by the footsteps of man that they have not learned to fear him they continued to graze within a few feet of the carriage or looked quietly at it seeming to consider these mountains as their own  near the summit of the road though not of the hill a retrospective glance gave us a long view over the fells and of a rich distance toward lancaster rising into blue hills which admitted glimpses of sparkling sea in the bay beyond this gay perspective lighted up by a gleam of sunshine and viewed between the brown lines of the nearer mountains showed like the miniature painting of a landscape illuminated beyond a darkened foreground  at the point of every steep as we ascended the air seemed to become thinner and at the northern summit of shapfell which we reached after nearly two hours toil the wind blew with piercing intenseness making it difficult to remain as long as was due to our admiration of the prospect the scene of mountains which burst upon us can be compared only to the multitudinous waves of the sea on the northern western and eastern scope of the horizon rose vast ridges of heights their broken lines sometimes appearing in seven or eight successive ranges though showing nothing either fantastic or peaked in their forms the autumnal lights gleaming on their sides or shadows sweeping in dark lines along them produced a very sublime effect while summits more remote were often misty with the streaming shower and others glittered in the partial rays or were colored with the mild azure of distance the greater tract of the intervening hills and shapfell itself were at this time darkened with clouds while fancy awed by the gloom imaged the genius of westmoreland brooding over it and directing the scowling storm  a descent of nearly four miles brought us to shap a straggling village lying on the side of a bleak hill feebly sheltered by clumps of trees here leaving the moorlands we were glad to find ourselves again where bells have knolled to church and in the midst of civilized though simple life after a short rest at a cleanly little inn we proceeded toward bampton a village five miles further in a vale to which it gives its name and one mile from hawswater the lake that invited us to it as the road advanced the sells of this lake fronted it and closing over the southern end of bampton vale were the most interesting objects in the view they were of a character very different from any yet seen tall rocky and of more broken and pointed form among them was the high blue peak called kidstowpike the broader ridge of wallowcrag a round and still loftier mountain  ikolmmoor beyond and further yet other ranges of peaked summits that overlook ullswater  in a hollow on the left of the road called the vale of magdalene are the ruins of shapabbey built in the reign of john of which little now appears except a tower with pointed windows the situation is deeply secluded and the gloom of the surrounding mountains may have accorded well with monastic melancholy  proceeding toward bampton we had a momentary peep into hawswater sunk deep among black and haggard rocks and overtopped by the towering fells before named whose summits were involved in tempest till the sun suddenly breaking out from under clouds threw a watery gleam aslant the broken top of kidstowpike and his rays struggling with the shower produced a fine effect of light opposed to the gloom that wrapped ickolmmoor and other huge mountains  we soon after looked down from the heights of bampton upon its open vale checkered with corn and meadows among which the slender lowther wound its way from hawswater to the vale of eden crossing that of bampton to the north the hills enriched here and there with hanging woods and seats were cultivated nearly to their summits except where in the south the rude heights of hawswater almost excluded the lake and shut up the valley immediately below us bamptongrange lay along the skirt of the hill and crossed the lowther a gray rambling and ancient village to which we descended among rough common darkened by plantations of fir and between corn enclosures  the interruption which enclosed waters and pathless mountains give to the intercourse and business of ordinary life renders the district that contains the lakes of lancashire westmoreland and cumberland more thinly inhabited than is due to the healthiness of the climate and perhaps to the richness of the valleys the roads are always difficult from their steepness and in winter are greatly obstructed by snow that over shapfell to kendal was some years since entirely impassable till the inhabitants of a few scattered towns subscribed thirty pounds and a way was cut wide enough for one horse but so deep that the snow was on each side above the riders head it is not in this age of communication and intelligence that any person will be credulously eager to suppose the inhabitants of one part of the island considerably or generally distinguished in their characters from those of another yet perhaps none can immerge themselves in this country of the lakes without being struck by the superior simplicity and modesty of the people secluded from great towns and from examples of selfish splendor their minds seem to act freely in the sphere of their own affairs without interruption from envy or triumph as to those of others they are obliging without servility and plain but not rude so that when in accosting you they omit the customary appellations you perceive it to be the familiarity of kindness not of disrespect and they do not bend with meanness or hypocrisy but show an independent well meaning without obtrusiveness and without the hope of more than ordinary gain  their views of profit from strangers are indeed more limited than we could have believed before witnessing it the servants at the little inns confess themselves by their manner of receiving what you give to be almost as much surprised as pleased a boy who had opened four or five gates for us between shap and bampton blushed when we called to him to have some halfpence and it frequently happened that persons who had looked at the harness or rendered some little services of that sort on the road passed on before anything could be offered them the confusion of others on being paid induced us to suppose at first that enough had not been given but we were soon informed that nothing was expected  the inns as here at bampton are frequently humble and those who are disposed to clamor for luxuries as if there was a crime in not being able to supply them may confound a simple people and be themselves greatly discontented before they go but those who will be satisfied with comforts and think the experience of integrity carefulness and goodwill is itself a luxury will be glad to have stopped at bampton and at several other little villages where there is some sort of preparation for travelers  nor is this secluded spot without provision for the mind a beneficed grammar school receives the children of the inhabitants and sends we believe some to an university bishop gibson received his education at it bishop law who was born at bampton went daily across one or two of the rudest fells on the lake to another school at martindale an exercise of no trifling fatigue or resolution for among the things to be gained by seeing the lakes is a conception of the extreme wildness of their boundaries you arrive with a notion that you can and dare rove any where amongst the mountains and have only to see three to have the utmost terror of losing your way  the danger of wandering in these regions without a guide is increased by an uncertainty as to the titles of heights for the people of each village have a name for the part of a mountain nearest to themselves and they sometimes call the whole by that name the circumference of such heights is also too vast and the flexures too numerous to admit of great accuracy skiddaw saddleback and helvellyn may however be certainly distinguished there are others a passage over which would save perhaps eight or ten miles out of twenty but which are so little known except to the shepherds that they are very rarely crossed by travelers we could not trust to any persons knowledge of harterfell beyond the head of hawswater  hawswater this is a lake of which little has been mentioned perhaps because it is inferior in size to the others but which is distinguished by the solemn grandeur of its rocks and mountains that rise in very bold and awful characters the water about three miles long and at the widest only half a mile over nearly describes the figure   being narrowed in the center by the projecting shores and at this spot it is said to be fifty fathom deep  crossing the meadows of bampton vale and ascending the opposite heights we approached the fells of hawswater and having proceeded for a mile along the side of hills the views over the vale and of the southern mountains changing with almost every step the lake began to open between a very lofty ridge covered with forest and abrupt fells of heath or naked rock soon after we looked upon the first expanse of the lake its eastern shore rising in a tremendous ridge of rocks darkened with wood to the summit appears to terminate in wallowcrag a promontory of towering height beyond which the lake winds from view the finely broken mountains on the west are covered with heath and the tops impend in crags and precipices but their ascent from the water is less sudden than that of the opposite rocks and they are skirted by a narrow margin of vivid green where cattle were feeding and tufted shrubs and little groves overhung the lake and were reflected on its dark surface above a very few white cottages among wood broke in upon the solitude higher still the mountainflocks were browsing and above all the narrow perspective was closed by dark and monstrous summits  as we wound along the bank the rocks unfolded and disclosed the second expanse with scenery yet more towering and sublime than the first this perspective seemed to be terminated by the huge mountain called castlestreet but as we advanced harterfell reared his awful front impending over the water and shut in the scene where amidst rocks and at the entrance of a glen almost choked by fragments from the heights stands the chapel of martindale spoken by the country people mardale among the fells of this dark prospect are lathale wiltercrag castle crag and riggindale their bold lines appearing beyond each other as they fell into the upper part of the lake and some of them showing only masses of shattered rock kidstowpike is preeminent among the crowding summits beyond the eastern shore and the clouds frequently spread their gloom over its point or fall in showers into the cup within on the west high street which overlooks the head of ullswater is the most dignified of the mountains  leaving the green margin of the lake we ascended to the parsonage a low white building on a knoll sheltered by the mountain and a grove of sycamores with a small garden in front falling toward the water from the door we had a view of the whole lake and the surrounding fells which the eminence we were upon was just raised enough to show to advantage nearly opposite to it the bold promontory of wallowcrag pushed its base into the lake where a peninsula advanced to meet it spread with bright verdure on which the hamlet of martindale lay half concealed among a grove of oak beech and sycamore whose tints contrasted with the darker one of the spiry spruce or more clumped english sir and accorded sweetly with the pastoral green beneath the ridge of precipices that swept from wallowcrag southward and formed a bay for the upper part of the lake was despoiled of its forest but that which curved northward was dark with dwarfwood to the waters brim and opening distantly to bampton vale let in a gay miniature landscape bright in sunshine below the lake reflected the gloom of the woods and was sometimes marked with long white lines which we were told indicated bad weather but except when a sudden gust swept the surface it gave back every image on the shore as in a dark mirror  the interior of the parsonage was as comfortable as the situation was interesting a neat parlour opened from the passage but it was newly painted and we were shown into the family room having a large oldfashioned chimney corner with benches to receive a social party and forming a most enviable retreat from the storms of the mountains here in the winter evening a family circle gathering round a blazing pile of wood on the hearth might defy the weather and the world it was delightful to picture such a party happy in their home in the sweet affections of kindred and in honest independence conversing working and reading occasionally while the blast was struggling against the casement and the snow pelting on the roof  the seat of a long window overlooking the lake offered the delights of other seasons hence the luxuriance of summer and the coloring of autumn successively spread their enchantments over the opposite woods and the meadows that margined the water below and a little garden of sweets sent up its fragrance to that of the honeysuckles that twined round the window here too lay a store of books and to instance that an inhabitant of this remote nook could not exclude an interest concerning the distant world among them was a history of passing events alas to what scenes to what display of human passions and human suffering did it open how opposite to the simplicity the innocence and the peace of these  the venerable father of the mansion was engaged in his duty at his chapel of martindale but we were hospitably received within and heard the next day how gladly he would have rendered any civilities to strangers  on leaving this enviable little residence we pursued the steeps of the mountain behind it and were soon amidst the flocks and the crags whence the lookdown upon the lake and among the fells was solemn and surprising about a quarter of a mile from the parsonage a torrent of some dignity rushed past us foaming down a rocky chasm in its way to the lake every where little streams of crystal clearness wandered silently among the moss and turf which half concealed their progress or dashed over the rocks and across the largest sheepbridges of flat stone were thrown to prevent the flocks from being carried away in attempting to pass them in winter the gray stones that grew among the heath were spotted with mosses of so fine a texture that it was difficult to ascertain whether they were vegetable their tints were a delicate peagreen and primrose with a variety of colors which it was not necessary to be a botanist to admire  an hour passed in ascending brought us to the brow of bampton vale which sloped gently downward to the north where it opened to lines of distant mountains that extended far into the east the woods of lowtherpark capped two remote hills and spread luxuriantly down their sides into the valley and nearer bamptongrange lay at the base of a mountain crowned with sir plantations over which in a distant vale we discovered the village of shap and long ridges of the hig hland passed on the preceding day  one of the fells we had just crossed is called blanarasa at the summit of which two gray stones each about four feet high and placed upright at the distance of nine feet from each other remain of four which are remembered to have been formerly there the place is still called four stones but tradition does not relate the design of the monument whether to limit adjoining districts or to commemorate a battle or a hero  we descended gradually into the vale among thickets of rough oaks on the bank of a rivulet which foamed in a deep channel beneath their foliage and came to a glade so sequestered and gloomily overshadowed that one almost expected to see the venerable arch of a ruin peeping between the branches it was the very spot which the founder of a monastery might have chosen for his retirement where the chantings of a choir might have mingled with the soothing murmur of the stream and monks have glided beneath the solemn trees in garments scarcely distinguishable from the shades themselves  this glade sloping from the eye opened under spreading oaks to a remote glimpse of the vale with blue hills in the distance and on the grassy hillocks of the foreground cattle were every where reposing  we returned about sunset to bampton after a walk of little more than four miles which had exhibited a great variety of scenery beautiful romantic and sublime at the entrance of the village the lowther and a nameless rivulet that runs from hawswater join their waters both streams were now sunk in their beds but in winter they sometimes contend for the conquest and ravage of the neighboring plains the waters have then risen to the height of five or six feet in a meadow forty yards from their summer channels in an enclosure of this vale was fought the last battle or skirmish with the scots in westmoreland and it is within the telling of the sons of greatgrandfathers that the contest continued till the scots were discovered to fire only pebbles the villagers had then the folly to close with them and the success to drive them away but such was the simplicity of the times that it was called a victory to have made one prisoner stories of this sort are not yet entirely forgotten in the deeply enclosed vales of westmoreland and cumberland where the greater part of the present inhabitants can refer to an ancestry of several centuries on the same spot  we thought bampton though a very illbuilt village an enviable spot having a clergyman as we heard of exemplary manners and as one of us witnessed of a most faithful earnestness in addressing his congregation in the church being but slightly removed from one of the lakes that accumulates in a small space many of the varieties and attractions of the others and having the adjoining lands distributed for the most part into small farms so that as it is not thought low to be without wealth the poor do not acquire the offensive and disreputable habits by which they are too often tempted to revenge or resist the ostentation of the rich  ullswater the ride from bampton to ullswater is very various and delightful it winds for about three miles along the western heights of this green and open vale among embowered lanes that alternately admit and exclude the pastoral scenes below and the fine landscapes on the opposite hills formed by the plantations and ancient woods of lowtherpark these spread over a long tract and mingle in sweet variety with the lively verdure of lawns and meadows that slope into the valley and sometimes appear in gleams among the dark thickets the house of white stone with red windowcases embosomed among the woods has nothing in its appearance answerable to the surrounding grounds its situation and that of the park are exquisitely happy just where the vale of bampton opens to that of eden and the long mountainous ridge and peak of crossfell aspiring above them all stretch before the eye with the town of penrith shelving along the side of a distant mountain and its beacon on the summit the ruins of its castle appearing distinctly at the same time crowning a low round hill the horizon to the north and the east is bounded by lines of mountains range above range not romantic and surprising but multitudinous and vast of these crossfell said to be the highest mountain in cumberland gives its name to the whole northern ridge which in its full extent from the neighborhood of gillsland to that of kirkbysteven is near fifty miles this perspective of the extensive vale of eden has grandeur and magnificence in as high a degree as that of bampton has pastoral beauty closing in the gloomy solitudes of hawswater the vale is finely wooded and variegated with mansions parks meadowland corn towns villages and all that make a distant landscape rich among the peculiarities of it are little mountains of alpine shape that start up like pyramids in the middle of the vale some covered with wood others barren and rocky the scene perhaps only wants a river like the rhine or the thames to make it the very finest in england for union of grandeur beauty and extent  opposite lowtherhall we gave a farewell look to the pleasant vale of bampton and its southern fells as the road winding more to the west led us over the high lands that separate it from the vale of emont then ascending through shady lanes and among fields where the oat harvest was gathering we had enchanting retrospects of the vale of eden spreading to the east with all its chain of mountains chequered by the autumnal shadows  soon after the road brought us to the brows of emont a narrow wellwooded vale the river from which it takes its name meandering through it from ullswater among pastures and pleasuregrounds to meet the lowther near brougham castle penrith and its castle and beacon look up the vale from the north and the astonishing fells of ullswater close upon it in the south while delemain the house and beautiful grounds of mr hassel hutton st john a venerable old mansion and the single tower called dacrecastle adorn the valley but who can pause to admire the elegancies of art when surrounded by the wonders of nature the approach to this sublime lake along the heights of emont is exquisitely interesting for the road being shrouded by woods allows the eye only partial glimpses of the gigantic shapes that are assembled in the distance and awakening high expectation leaves the imagination thus elevated to paint the forms of things unseen thus it was when we caught a first view of the dark broken tops of the fells that rise round ullswater of size and shape most huge bold and awful overspread with a blue mysterious tint that seemed almost supernatural though according in gloom and sublimity with the severe features it involved  further on the mountains began to unfold themselves their outlines broken abrupt and intersecting each other in innumerable directions seemed now and then to fall back like a multitude at some supreme command and permitted an oblique glimpse into the deep vales a close lane then descended toward poolybridge where at length the lake itself appeared beyond the spreading branches and soon after the first reach expanded before us with all its mountains tumbled round it rocky ruinous and vast impending yet rising in wild confusion and multiplied points behind each other  this view of the first reach from the foot of dunmallet a pointed woody hill near poolybridge is one of the finest on the lake which here spreads in a noble sheet near three miles long and almost two miles broad to the base of thwaithillnab winding round which it disappears and the whole is then believed to be seen the character of this view is nearly that of simple grandeur the mountains that impend over the shore in front are peculiarly awful in their forms and attitudes on the left the fells soften woodlands and their pastures color their lower declivities and the water is margined with the tenderest verdure opposed to the dark woods and crags above on the right a green conical hill slopes to the shore where cattle were reposing on the grass or sipping the clear wave further rise the bolder rocks of thwaithillnab where the lake disappears and beyond the dark precipices and summits of fells that crown the second reach  winding the foot of dunmallet the almost pyramidal hill that shuts up this end of ullswater and separates it from the vale of emont we crossed barton bridge where this little river clear as crystal issues from the lake and through a close pass hurries over a rocky channel to the vale its woody steeps the tufted island that interrupts its stream and the valley beyond form altogether a picture in fine contrast with the majesty of ullswater expanding on the other side of the bridge  we followed the skirts of a smooth green hill the lake on the other hand flowing softly against the road and showing every pebble on the beach beneath and proceeded toward the second bend but soon mounted from the shore among the broken knolls of dacrecommon whence we had various views of the first reach its scenery appearing in darkened majesty as the autumnal shadows swept over it sometimes however the rays falling in gleams upon the water gave it the finest silvery tone imaginable sober though splendid dunmallet at the foot of the lake was a formal unpleasing object not large enough to be grand or wild enough to be romantic  the ground of the common is finely broken and is scattered sparingly with white cottages each picturesquely shadowed by its dark grove above rise plantations and gray crags which lead the eye forward to the alpine forms that crown the second reach changing their attitudes every instant as they are approached  ullswater in all its windings which give it the form of the letter s is nearly nine miles long the width is various sometimes nearly two miles and seldom less than one but skellingnab a vast rock in the second reach projects so as to reduce it to less than a quarter of a mile these are chiefly the reputed measurements but the eye loses its power of judging even of the breadth confounded by the boldness of the shores and the grandeur of the fells that rise beyond the proportions however are grand for the water retains its dignity notwithstanding the vastness of its accompaniments a circumstance which derwentwater can scarcely boast  the second bend assuming the form of a river is very long but generally broad and brought strongly to remembrance some of the passes of the rhine beyond coblentz though here the rocks that rise over the water are little wooded and there their skirts are never margined by pasture or open to such fairy summer scenes of vivid green mingling with shades of wood and gleams of corn as sometimes appear within the recesses of these wintry mountains these cliffs however do not show the variety of hue or marbled veins that frequently surprise and delight on the rhine being generally dark and gray and the varieties in their complexion when there are any purely aerial but they are vast and broken rise immediately from the stream and often shoot their masses over it while the expanse of water below accords with the dignity of that river in many of its reaches once too there were other points of resemblance in the ruins of monasteries and convents which though reason rejoices that they no longer exist the eye may be allowed to regret of these all which now remains on record is that a society of benedictine monks was founded on the summit of dunmallet and a nunnery of the same order on a point behind sowlbyfell traces of these ruins it is said may still be seen  thus grandeur and immensity are the characteristics of the left shore of the second reach the right exhibits romantic wildness in the rough ground of dacrecommon and the craggy heights above and further on the sweetest forms of reposing beauty in the grassy hillocks and undulating copses of gowbarrowpark fringing the water sometimes over little rocky eminences that project into the stream and at others in shelving bays where the lake transparent as crystal breaks upon the pebbly bank and laves the road that winds there above these pastoral and sylvan landscapes rise broken precipices less tremendous than those of the opposite shore with pastures pursuing the crags to a considerable height speckled with cattle which are exquisitely picturesque as they graze upon the knolls and among the old trees that adorn this finely declining park  leaving the hamlet of watermillock at some distance on the left and passing the seat of mr robinson sequestered in the gloom of beech and sycamores there are fine views over the second reach as the road descends the common toward gowbarrow among the boldest fells that breast the lake on the left shore are hollingfell and swarthfell now no longer boasting any part of the forest of martindale but showing huge walls of naked rock and scars which many torrents have inflicted one channel only in this dry season retained its shining stream the chasm was dreadful parting the mountain from the summit to the base and its waters in winter leaping in foam from precipice to precipice must be infinitely sublime not however even then from their mass but from the length and precipitancy of their descent  the perspective as the road descends into gowbarrowpark is perhaps the very finest on the lake the scenery of the first reach is almost tame when compared with this and it is difficult to say where it can be equalled for alpine sublimity and for effecting wonder and awful elevation the lake after expanding at a distance to great breadth once more loses itself beyond the enormous pile of rock called placefell opposite to which the shore seeming to close upon all further progress is bounded by two promontories covered with woods that shoot their luxuriant foliage to the waters edge the shattered mass of gray rock called yewcrag rises immediately over these and beyond a glen opens to a chaos of mountains more solemn in their aspect and singular in their shapes than any which have appeared point crowding over point in lofty succession among these is stonecrosspike and huge helvellyn scowling over all but though this retains its pre eminence its dignity is lost in the mass of alps around and below it a fearful gloom involved them the shadows of a stormy sky upon mountains of dark rock and heath all this is seen over the woody foreground of the park which soon shrouding us in its bowery lanes allowed the eye and the fancy to repose while venturing toward new forms and assemblages of sublimity  meantime the green shade under which we passed where the sultry low of cattle and the sound of streams hurrying from the heights through the copses of gowbarrow to the lake below were all that broke the stillness these with gleamings of the water close on the left between the foliage and which was ever changing its hue sometimes assuming the soft purple of a pigeons neck at others the silvery tint of sunshine  these circumstances of imagery were in soothing and beautiful variety with the gigantic visions we had lost  the road still pursuing this border of the lake the copses opened to partial views of the bold rocks that form the opposite shore and many a wild recess and solemn glen appeared and vanished among them some showing only broken fells the sides of others shaggy with forests and nearly all lined at their bases with narrow pastures of the most exquisite verdure thus descending upon a succession of sweeping bays where the shades parted and admitted the lake that flowed even with us and again retreating from it over gentle eminences where it glittered only between the leaves crossing the rude bridges of several becks rapid clear and foaming among dark stones and receiving a green tint from the closely shadowing trees but neither precipitous enough in their descent nor ample enough in their course to increase the dignity of the scene we came after passing nearly three miles through the park to lyulphs tower this mansion a square gray edifice with turreted corners battlements and windows in the gothic style has been built by the present duke of norfolk in one of the finest situations of a park abounding with views of the grand and the sublime it stands on a green eminence a little removed from the water backed with wood and with pastures rising abruptly beyond to the cliffs and crags that crown them in front the ground falls finely to the lakes edge broken yet gentle and scattered over with old trees and darkened with copses which mingle in fine variety of tints with the light verdure of the turf beneath herds of deer wandering over the knolls and cattle reposing in the shade completed this sweet landscape  the lake is hence seen to make one of its boldest expanses as it sweeps round placefell and flows into the third and last bend of this wonderful vale lyulphs tower looks up this reach to the south and to the east traces all the fells and curving banks of gowbarrow that bind the second while to the west a dark glen opens to a glimpse of the solemn alps round helvellyn and all these objects are seen over the mild beauty of the park  passing fine sweeps of the shore and over bold headlands we came opposite to the vast promontory called placefell that pushes its craggy foot into the lake like a lions claw round which the waters make a sudden turn and enter patterdale their third and final expanse in this reach they lose the form of a river and resume that of a lake being closed at three miles distance by the ruinous rocks that guard the gorge of patterdale backed by a multitude of fells the water in this scope is of oval form bounded on one side by the precipices of placefell martindalefell and several others equally rude and awful that rise from its edge and show no lines of verdure or masses of wood but retire in rocky bays or project in vast promontories athwart it the opposite shore is less severe and more romantic the rocks are lower and richly wooded and often receding from the water leave room for a tract of pasture meadow land and corn to margin their ruggedness at the upper end the village of patterdale and one or two white farms peep out from among trees beneath the scowling mountains that close the scene pitched in a rocky nook with corn and meadow land sloping gently in front to the lake and here and there a scattered grove but this scene is viewed to more advantage from one of the two woody eminences that overhang the lake just at the point where it forms its last angle and like an opened compass spreads its two arms before the eye these heights are extremely beautiful viewed from the opposite shore and had long charmed us at a distance approaching them we crossed another torrent glencoynbeck or aireyforce which here divides not only the estates of the duke of norfolk and mr hodgkinson but the counties of westmoreland and cumberland and all the fells beyond that enclose the last bend of ullswater are in patterdale here on the right at the feet of awful rocks was spread a gay autumnal scene in which the peasants were singing merrily as they gathered the oats into sheafs woods turfy hillocks and above all tremendous crags abruptly closing round the yellow harvest the figures together with the whole landscape resembled one of those beautifully fantastic scenes which fable calls up before the wand of the magician  entering glencoyn woods and sweeping the boldest bay of the lake while the water dashed with a strong surge upon the shore we at length mounted a road frightful from its steepness and its crags and gained one of the wooded summits so long admired from hence the view of ullswater is the most extensive and various that its shores exhibit comprehending its two principal reaches and though not the most picturesque it is certainly the most grand to the east extends the middle sweep in long and equal perspective walled with barren fells on the right and margined on the left with the pastoral recesses and bowery projections of gowbarrow park the rude mountains above almost seemed to have fallen back from the shore to admit this landscape within their hollow bosom and then bending abruptly appear like miltons adam viewing the sleeping eve to hang over it enamoured  lyulphs tower is the only object of art except the hamlet of watermillock seen in the distant perspective that appears in the second bend of ullswater and this loses much of its effect from the square uniformity of the structure and the glaring green of its painted windowcases this is the longest reach of the lake  placefell which divides the two last bends and was immediately opposite to the point we were on is of the boldest form it projects into the water an enormous mass of gray crag scarred with dark hues thence retiring a little it again bends forward in huge cliffs and finally starts up into a vast perpendicular face of rock as a single object it is wonderfully grand and connected with the scene its effect is sublime the lower rocks are called silverrays and not inaptly for when the sun shines upon them their variegated sides somewhat resemble in brightness the rays streaming beneath a cloud  the last reach of ullswater which is on the right of this point expands into an oval and its majestic surface is spotted with little rocky islets that would adorn a less sacred scene here they are prettinesses that can scarcely be tolerated by the grandeur of its character the tremendous mountains which scowl over the gorge of patterdale the cliffs massy broken and overlooked by a multitude of dark summits with the gray walls of swarth and martindale fells that upheave themselves on the eastern shore form altogether one of the most grand and awful pictures on the lake yet admirable and impressive as it is as to solemnity and astonishment its effect with us was not equal to that of the more alpine sketch caught in distant perspective from the descent into gowbarrowpark  in these views of ullswater sublimity and greatness are the predominating characters though beauty often glows upon the western bank the mountains are all bold gloomy and severe when we saw them the sky accorded well with the scene being frequently darkened by autumnal clouds and the equinoctial gale swept the surface of the lake marking its blackness with long white lines and beating its waves over the rocks to the foliage of the thickets above the trees that shade these eminences give greater force to the scenes which they either partially exclude or wholly admit and become themselves fine objects enriched as they are with the darkest moss  from hence the ride to the village of patterdale at the lakes head is for the first part over precipices covered with wood whence you look down on the left upon the water or upon pastures stretching to it on the right the rocks rise abruptly and often impend their masses over the road or open to narrow dells green rocky and overlooked by endless mountains  about half way to the village of patterdale a peninsula spreads from this shore into the lake where a white house peeping from a grove and surrounded with green enclosures is beautifully placed this is an inn and perhaps the principal one as to accommodation but though its situation on a spot which on each side commands the lake is very fine it is not comparable in point of wildness and sublimity to that of the cottage called the kings arms at patterdale in the way thither are enchanting catches of the lake between the trees on the left and peeps into the glens that wind among the alps toward helvellyn on the right these multiply near the head of ullswater where they start off as from one point like radii and conclude in trackless solitudes  it is difficult to spread varied pictures of such scenes before the imagination a repetition of the same images of rock wood and water and the same epithets of grand vast and sublime which necessarily occur must appear tautologous on paper though their archetypes in nature ever varying in outline or arrangement exhibit new visions to the eye and produce new shades of effect on the mind it is difficult also where these delightful differences have been experienced to forbear dwelling on the remembrance and attempting to sketch the peculiarities which occasioned them the scenery at the head of ullswater is especially productive of such difficulties where a wish to present the picture and a consciousness of the impossibility of doing so except by the pencil meet and oppose each other  patterdale itself is a name somewhat familiar to recollection from the circumstance of the chief estate in it having given to its possessors for several centuries the title of kings of patterdale the last person so distinguished was richer than his ancestors having increased his income by the most ludicrous parsimony to a thousand pounds a year his son and successor is an industrious country gentleman who has improved the sort of farming mansion annexed to the estate and not affecting to depart much from the simple manners of the other inhabitants is respectable enough to be generally called by his own name of mounsey instead of the title which was probably seldom given to his ancestors but in some sort of mockery  the village is very humble as to the conditions and views of the inhabitants and very respectable as to their integrity and simplicity and to the contentment which is proved by the infrequency of emigrations to other districts it straggles at the feet of fells somewhat removed from the lake and near the entrance of the wild vale of glenridding its white church is seen nearly from the commencement of the last reach rising among trees and in the churchyard are the ruins of an ancient yew of remarkable size and venerable beauty its trunk hollowed and silvered by age resembles twisted roots yet the branches that remain above are not of melancholy black but flourish in rich verdure and flaky foliage  the inn is beyond the village securely sheltered under high crags while enormous fells close on the right open to the gorge of patterdale and coldrillbeck issuing from it descends among the corn and meadows to join the lake at a little distance we had a happy evening at this cleanly cottage where there was no want without its recompense from the civil offices of the people among the rocks that rose over it is a station which has been more frequently selected than any other on the lake by the painter and the lover of the bean idee as the french and sir joshua reynolds expressively term what mr burke explains in his definition of the word fine below the point on which we stood a tract of corn and meadow land fell gently to the lake which expanded in great majesty beyond bounded on the right by the precipices of many fells and on the left by rocks finely wooded and of more broken and spiry outline the undulating pastures and copses of gowbarrow closed the perspective round the whole of these shores but particularly on the left rose clusters of dark and pointed summits assuming great variety of shape amongst which helvellyn was still preeminent immediately around us all was vast and gloomy the fells mount swiftly and to enormous heights leaving at their bases only crags and hillock tufted with thickets of dwarfoak and holly where the beautiful cattle that adorned them and a few sheep were picking a scanty supper among the heath  from this spot glens open on either hand that lead the eye only to a chaos of mountains the profile of one near the soreground on the right is remarkably grand shelving from the summit in one vast sweep of rock with only some interruption of craggy points near its base into the water on one side it unites with the fells in the gorge of patterdale and on the other winds into a bold bay for the lake among the highlands seen over the left shore is commonfell a large heathy mountain which appeared to face us somewhat nearer is a lower one called glenridding and above it the nab grassdale has glenridding and the nab on one side toward the water and birksfell and st sundayscrag over that on the other the points that rise above the nab are stridonedge then coves head and over all the precipices of dark helvellyn now appearing only at intervals among the clouds  not only every fell of this wild region has a name but almost every crag of every fell so that shepherds sitting at the fireside can direct each other to the exact spot among the mountains where a stray sheep has been seen  among the rocks on the right shore is martindalefell once shaded with a forest from which it received its name and which spreading to a vast extent over the hills and valleys beyond even as far as hawswater darkened the front of swarthfell and several others that impend over the first and second reach of ullswater of the mountains which tower above the glen of patterdale the highest are hartersfell kidstowpike and the ridge called the high street a name which reminded us of the german denomination berg strasse  the effect of a stormy evening upon the scenery was solemn clouds smoked along the fells veiling them for a moment and passing on to other summits or sometimes they involved the lower steeps leaving the tops unobscured and resembling islands in a distant ocean the lake was dark and tempestuous dashing the rocks with a strong foam it was a scene worthy of the sublimity of ossian and brought to recollection some touches of his gloomy pencil when the storms of the mountains come when the north lifts the waves on high i sit by the sounding shore etc  a large hawk sailing proudly in the air and wheeling among the stormy clouds superior to the shock of the gust was the only animated object in the upward prospect we were told that the eagles had forsaken their aeries in this neighborhood and in borrowdale and are fled to the isle of man but one had been seen in patterdale the day before which not being at its full growth could not have arrived from a great distance  we returned to our lowroofed habitation where as the wind swept in hollow gusts along the mountains and strove against our casements the crackling blaze of a wood fire lighted up the cheerfulness which so long since as juvenals time has been allowed to arise from the contrast of ease against difficulty suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis and however we might exclaim  be my retreat between the groaning forest and the shore beat by the boundless multitude of waves it was pleasant to add where ruddy fire and beaming tapers join to cheer the gloom   brougham castle the next morning we proceeded from ullswater along the vale of emont so sweetly adorned by the woods and lawns of dalemain the seat of mr hassel whose mansion is seen in the bottom one of the most magnificent prospects in the country is when this vale opens to that of eden the mountainous range of crossfell fronted us and its appearance this day was very striking for the effect of autumnal light and shade the upper range bright in sunshine appeared to rise like light clouds above the lower which was involved in dark shadow so that it was a considerable time before the eye could detect the illusion the effect of this was inexpressibly interesting  within view of emont bridge which divides the counties of cumberland and westmoreland is that memorial of ancient times so often described under the name of arthurs round table a green circular spot of forty paces diameter enclosed by a dry ditch and beyond this by a bank each in sufficient preservation to show exactly what has been its form in the midst of the larger circle is another of only seven paces diameter we have no means of adding to or even of corroborating any of the well known conjectures concerning the use of this rude and certainly very ancient monument those not qualified to propose decisions in this respect may however suffer themselves to believe that the bank without the ditch and the enclosure within it were places for different classes of persons interested as parties or spectators in some transactions passing within the inner circle and that these whether religious civil or military ceremonies were rendered distinct and conspicuous for the purpose of impressing them upon the memory of the spectators at a time when memory and tradition were the only preservatives of history  passing a bridge under which the lowther from winding and romantic banks enters the vale of eden we ascended between the groves of birds nest or as it is now called brougham hall a white mansion with battlements and gothic windows having formerly a bird painted on the front it is perched among woods on the brow of a steep but not lofty hill and commands enchanting prospects over the vale the winding emont the ruins of brougham castle on a green knoll of whinsield park surrounded with old groves far beyond this the highlands of crossfell to the north carletonhall the handsome modern mansion of mr wallace amidst lawns of incomparable verdure and luxuriant woods falling from the heights further still the mountain town and beacon of penrith these are the principal features of the rich landscape spread before the eye from the summit of the hill at birds nest  as we descended to brougham castle about a mile further its ruined masses of pale red stone tufted with shrubs and plants appeared between groves of fir beach oak and ash amidst the broken ground of whinfield park a quarter of a mile through which brought us to the ruin itself it was guarded by a sturdy mastiff worthy the office of porter to such a place and a good effigy of the sir porter of a former age brougham castle venerable for its wellcertified antiquity and for the hoary masses it now exhibits is rendered more interesting by having been occasionally the residence of the humane and generous sir philip sydney who had only to look from the windows of this once noble edifice to see his own arcadia spreading on every side the landscape probably awakened his imagination for it was during a visit here that the greatest part of that work was written  this edifice once amongst the strongest and most important of the border fortresses is supposed to have been founded by the romans but the first historical record concerning it is dated in the time of william the conqueror who granted it to his nephew hugh de albinois his successors held it till    0 when hugh de morville one of the murderers of thomas a becket forfeited it by his crime brougham was afterward granted by king john to a grandson of hugh robert de vipont whose grandson again forfeited the estate which was however restored to his daughters one of whom marrying a de clifford it remained in this family till a daughter of the celebrated countess of pembroke gave it by marriage to that of the tuftons earls of thanet in which it now remains  this castle has been thrice nearly demolished first by neglect during the minority of roger de vipont after which it was sufficiently restored to receive james the first on his return from scotland in      secondly in the civil wars of charles the firsts time and thirdly in      when great part of the edifice was deliberately taken down and the materials sold for one hundred pounds some of the walls still remaining are twelve feet thick and the places are visible in which the massy gates were held to them by hinges and bolts of uncommon size a fuller proof of the many sacrifices of comfort and convenience by which the highest classes in former ages were glad to purchase security is very seldom afforded than by the three detached parts still left of this edifice but they show nothing of the magnificence and gracefulness which so often charm the eye in gothic ruins instead of these they exhibit symptoms of the cruelties by which their first lords revenged upon others the wretchedness of the continual suspicion felt by themselves dungeons secret passages and heavy iron rings remain to hint of unhappy wretches who were perhaps rescued only by death from these horrible engines of a tyrants will the bones probably of such victims are laid beneath the damp earth of these vaults  a young woman from a neighboring farmhouse conducted us over broken banks washed by the emont to what had been the grand entrance of the castle a venerable gothic gateway dark and of great depth passing under a square tower sinely shadowed by old elms above are a crossloop and two tier of small pointed windows no battlements appear at the top but four rows of corbells which probably once supported them now prop some tufts of ancient thorn that have roots in their fractures  as we passed under this long gateway we looked into what is still called the keep a small vaulted room receiving light only from loops in the outward wall near a large fireplace yet entire is a trap door leading to the dungeon below and in an opposite corner a doorcase to narrow stairs that wind up the turret where too as well as in the vault prisoners were probably secured one almost saw the surly keeper descending through this doorcase and heard him rattle the keys of the chambers above listening with indifference to the clank of chains and to the echo of that groan below which seemed to rend the heart it burst from  this gloomy gateway which had once sounded with the trumpets and horses of james the first when he visited the earl of cumberland this gateway now serving only to shelter cattle from the storm opens at length to a grassy knoll with bold masses of the ruin scattered round it and a few old ash trees waving in the area through a fractured arch in the rampart some features in the scenery without appear to advantage the emont falling over a weir at some distance with fullingmills on the bank above beyond the pastured slopes and woodlands of carleton park and crossfell sweeping the background  of the three ruinous parts that now remain of the edifice one large square mass near the tower and gateway appears to have contained the principal apartments the walls are of great height and though roofless nearly entire we entered what seemed to have been the great hall now choked with rubbish and weeds it was interesting to look upwards through the void and trace by the many windowcases that appeared at different heights in the walls somewhat of the plan of apartments whose floors and ceilings had long since vanished majestic relics which showed that here as well as at hardwick the chief rooms had been in the second story doorcases that had opened to rooms without this building with remains of passages within the walls were frequently seen and here and there in a corner at a vast height fragments of a winding staircase appearing beyond the arch of a slender doorway  we were tempted to enter a ruinous passage below formed in the great thickness of the walls but it was soon lost in darkness and we were told that no person had ventured to explore the end of this or of many similar passages among the ruins now the dens of serpents and other venomous reptiles it was probably a secret way to the great dungeon which may still be seen underneath the hall for the roof remains though what was called the sweating pillar from the dew that was owing to its damp situation and its seclusion from outward air no longer supports it large iron rings fastened to the carved heads of animals are still shown in the walls of this dungeon not a single loophole was left by the contriver of this hideous vault for the refreshment of prisoners yet were they insulted by some display of gothic elegance for the pillar already mentioned supporting the center of the roof spread from thence into eight branches which descended the walls and terminated at the floor in the heads holding the iron rings  the second mass of the ruin which though at a considerable distance from the main building was formerly connected with it shows the walls of many small chambers with relics of the passages and stairs that led to them but perhaps the only picturesque feature of the castle is the third detachment a small tower finely shattered having near its top a flourishing ash growing from the solid walls and overlooking what was once the moat we mounted a perilous staircase of which many steps were gone and others trembled to the pressure then gained a turret of which two sides were also fallen and at length ascended to the whole magnificence and sublimity of the prospect  to the east spread nearly all the rich vale of eden terminated by the stainmore hills and other highlands of yorkshire to the northeast the mountains of crossfell bounded the long landscape the nearer grounds were whinfieldpark broken toward the emont into shrubby steeps where the deep red of the soil mingled with the verdure of foliage part of sir michael le flemings woods rounding a hill on the opposite bank and beyond a wide extent of low land to the south swelled the upland boundaries of bamptonvale with lowtherwoods shading the pastures and distantly crowned by the fells of hawswater more to the west birds nest bosomed high in tufted trees at its foot lowtherbridge and a little further the neat hamlet and bridge of emont in the low lands still nearer the lowther and emont united the latter flowing in shining circles among the woods and deepgreen meadows of carletonpark beyond at a vast distance to the west and north rose all the alps of all the lakes an horizon scarcely to be equalled in england among these broken mountains the shaggy ridge of saddleback was proudly preeminent but one forked top of its rival skiddaw peeped over its declining side helvellyn huge and misshapen towered above the fells of ullswater the suns rays streaming from beneath a line of dark clouds that overhung the west gave a tint of silvery light to all these alps and reminded us of the first exquisite appearance of the mountains at goodesberg which however in grandeur and elegance of outline united with picturesque richness we have never seen equalled  of the walls around us every ledge marking their many stories was embossed with luxuriant vegetation tufts of the hawthorn seemed to grow from the solid stone and slender saplings of ash waved over the deserted doorcases where at the transforming hour of twilight the superstitious eye might mistake them for specter of some early possessor of the castle restless from guilt or of some sufferer persevering from vengeance  the town and beacon of penrith having pursued the road one mile further for the purpose of visiting the tender memorial of pious affection so often described under the name of countess pillar we returned to emontbridge and from thence reached penrith pronounced peyrith the most southern town of cumberland so far off as the head of ullswater fourteen miles this is talked of as an important place and looked to as the storehouse of whatever is wanted more than the fields and lakes supply those who have lived chiefly in large towns have to learn from the wants and dependencies of a people thinly scattered like the inhabitants of all mountainous regions the great value of any places of mutual resort however little distinguished in the general view of a country penrith is so often mentioned in the neighborhood that the first appearance of it somewhat disappointed us because we had not considered how many serious reasons those who talked of it might have for their estimation which should yet not at all relate to the qualities that render places interesting to a traveller  the town consisting chiefly of old houses straggles along two sides of the high north road and is built upon the side of a mountain that towers to great height above it in steep and heathy knolls unshaded by a single tree eminent on the summit of this mountain stands the old solitary beacon visible from almost every part of penrith which notwithstanding its many symptoms of antiquity is not deficient of neatness the houses are chiefly white with door and window cases of the red stone found in the neighborhood some of the smaller have over their doors dates of the latter end of the sixteenth century there are several inns of which that called old buchanans was recommended to us first by the recollection that mr gray had mentioned it and afterward by the comfort and civility we found there  some traces of the scottish dialect and pronunciation appear as far south as lancashire in westmoreland they become stronger and at penrith are extremely distinct and general serving for one among many peaceful indications of an approach once notified chiefly by preparations for hostility or defense penrith is the most southern town in england at which the guinea notes of the scotch bank are in circulation the beacon a sort of square tower with a peaked roof and openings at the sides is a more perfect instance of the direful necessities of past ages than would be expected to remain in this the circumstances are well known which made such watchfulness especially proper at penrith and the other traces of warlike habits and precautions whether appearing in records or buildings are too numerous to be noticed in a sketch which rather pretends to describe what the author has seen than to enumerate what has been discovered by the researches of others dr burns history contains many curious particulars and there are otherwise abundant and satisfactory memorials as to the state of the debateable ground the regulations for securing passes or fords and even to the public maintenance of slough dogs which were to pursue aggressors with hot trod as the inhabitants were to follow them by horn and voice these are all testimonies that among the many evils inflicted upon countries by war that which is not commonly thought of is not the least the public encouragement of a disposition to violence under the names of gallantry or valor which will not cease exactly when it is publicly prohibited and the education of numerous bodies to habits of supplying their wants not by constant and useful labor but by sudden and destructive exertions of force the mistake by which courage is released from all moral estimation of the purposes for which it is exerted and is considered to be necessarily and universally a good in itself rather than a means of good or of evil according to its application is among the severest misfortunes of mankind tacitus has an admirable reproof of it  ubi manu agitur modestia et probitas nomina superioris sunt   though the situation of penrith looking up the vales of eden and emont is remarkably pleasant that of the beacon above is infinitely finer commanding an horizon of at least an hundred miles diameter filled with an endless variety of beauty greatness and sublimity the view extends over cumberland parts of westmoreland lancashire yorkshire and a corner of northumberland and durham on a clear day the scottish high lands beyond solway firth may be distinguished like faint clouds on the horizon and the steeples of carlisle are plainly visible all the intervening country speckled with towns and villages is spread beneath the eye and nearly eighty miles to the eastward part of the cheviothills are traced a dark line binding the distance and marking the separation between earth and sky on the plains toward carlisle the nearer ridges of crossfell are seen to commence and thence stretch their barren steeps thirty miles toward the east where they disappear among the stainmorehills and the huge moorlands of yorkshire that close up the long landscape of the vale of eden among these the broken lines of ingleborough start above all the broader ones of the moors and that mountain still proclaims itself sovereign of the yorkshire heights  southward rise the wonders of westmoreland shapfells ridge over ridge the nearer pikes of hawswater and then the mountains of ullswater helvellyn preeminent amongst them distinguished by the grandeur and boldness of their outline as well as the variety of their shapes some hugely swelling some aspiring in clusters of alpine points and some broken into shaggy ridges the sky westward from hence and far to the north displays a vision of alps saddleback spreading toward keswick its long shattered ridge and one top of skiddaw peering beyond it but the others of this district are inferior in grandeur to the fells of ullswater more broken into points and with less of contrast in their forms behind saddleback the skirts of skiddaw spread themselves and thence low hills shelve into the plains of cumberland that extend to whitehaven the only level line in the scope of this vast horizon the scenery nearer to the eye exhibited cultivation in its richest state varied with pastoral and sylvan beauty landscapes embellished by the elegancies of art and rendered venerable by the ruins of time in the vale of eden carletonhall flourishing under the hand of careful attention and birds nest luxuriant in its spiry woods opposed their cheerful beauties to the neglected walls of brougham castle once the terror and even in ruins the pride of the scene now halfshrouded in its melancholy grove these objects were lighted up by partial gleams of sunshine which as they fled along the valley gave magical effect to all they touched  the other vales in the home prospect were those of bampton and emont the first open and gentle shaded by the gradual woods of lowtherpark the last closer and more romantic withdrawing in many a lingering bend toward ullswater where it is closed by the pyramidal dunmallard but not before a gleam of the lake is suffered to appear beyond the dark base of the hill at the nearer end of the vale and immediately under the eye the venerable ruins of penrith castle crest a round green hill these are of palered stone and stand in detached masses but have little that is picturesque in their appearance time having spared neither tower or gateway and not a single tree giving shade or force to the shattered walls the ground about the castle is broken into grassy knolls and only cattle wander over the desolated tract time has also obscured the name of the founder but it is known that the main building was repaired and some addition made to it by richard the third when duke of gloucester who lived here for five years in his office of sheriff of cumberland promoting the york interest by artful hospitalities and endeavoring to strike terror into the lancastrians among the ruins is a subterraneous passage leading to a house in penrith above three hundred yards distant called dockwray castle the town lies between the fortress and the beaconhill spreading prettily along the skirts of the mountain with its many roofs of blue slate among which the church rises near a dark grove  penrith from the latter end of the last century till lately when it was purchased by the duke of devonshire belonged to the family of portland to whom it was given by william the third probably instead of the manors in wales which it was one of williams few faulty designs to have given to his favorite companion had not parliament remonstrated and informed him that the crown could not alienate the territories of the principality the church a building of red stone unusually well disposed in the interior is a vicarage of small endowment but the value of money in this part of the kingdom is so high that the merit of independence a merit and a happiness which should always belong to clergymen is attainable by the possessors of very moderate incomes what is called the giants grave in the church yard is a narrow spot enclosed to the length of fourteen or fifteen feet by rows of low stones at the sides and at the ends by two pillars now slender but apparently worn by the weather from a greater thickness the height of these is eleven or twelve feet and all the stones whether in the borders at the sides or in these pillars bear traces of rude carving which show at least that the monument must have been thought very important by those that raised it since the singularity of its size was not held a sufficient distinction we pored intently over these traces though certainly without the hope of discovering any thing not known to the eminent antiquarians who have confessed their ignorance concerning the origin of them  from penrith to keswick the graystock road which we took for the first five or sixmiles is uninteresting and offers nothing worthy of attention before the approach to the castle the seat of the duke of norfolk the appearance of this from the road is good a gray building with gothic towers seated in a valley among lawns and woods that stretch with great pomp of shade to gentlyrising hills behind these saddleback huge gray and barren rises with all its ridgy lines a grand and simple background giving exquisite effect to the dark woods below such is the height of the mountain that though eight or ten miles off it appeared as we approached the castle almost to impend over it southward from saddleback a multitude of pointed summits crowd the horizon and it is most interesting after leaving graystock to observe their changing attitudes as you advance and the gradual disclosure of their larger features perhaps a sudden display of the sublimest scenery however full imparts less emotion than a gradually increasing view of it when expectation takes the highest tone and imagination finishes the sketch  about two miles beyond graystock the moorlands commence and as far as simple greatness constitutes sublimity this was indeed a sublime prospect less so only than that from shapfell itself where the mountains are not so varied in their forms and are plainer in their grandeur we were on a vast plain if plain that may be called which swells into long undulations surrounded by an amphitheatre of heathy mountains that seem to have been shook by some grand convulsion of the earth and tumbled around in all shapes not a tree a hedge and seldom even a stone wall broke the grandeur of their lines what was not heath was only rock and gray crags and a shepherds hut or his flocks browsing on the steep sides of the fells or in the narrow valleys that opened distantly was all that diversified the vast scene saddleback spread his skirts westward along the plain and then reared himself in terrible and lonely majesty in the long perspective beyond were the crowding points of the fells round keswick borrowdale and the vales of st john and leyberthwaite stretching away to those near grasmere the weather was in solemn harmony with the scenery long shadows swept over the hills followed by gleaming lights tempestuous gusts alone broke the silence now and then the suns rays had a singular appearance pouring from under clouds between the tops of fells into some deep vale at a distance as into a focus  this is the very region which the wild fancy of a poet like shakespeare would people with witches and show them at their incantations calling spirits from the clouds and specter from the earth  on the now lonely plains of this vast amphitheatre the romans had two camps and their eagle spread its wings over a scene worthy of its own soarings the lines of these encampments may still be traced on that part of the plain called hutton moor to the north of the high road and over its whole extent toward keswick a roman way has been discovered funereal urns have also been dug up here and an altar of roman form but with the inscription obliterated  nearer saddleback we perceived crags and heath mingling on its precipices and its base broken into a little world of mountains green with cultivation white farms each with its grove to shelter it from the descending gusts corn and pastures of the brightest verdure enlivened the skirts of the mountain all round climbing toward the dark heath and crags or spreading downwards into the vale of threlkeld where the slender lowther shows his shining stream  leaving hutton moor the road soon began to ascend the skirts of saddleback and passed between green hillocks where cattle appeared most elegantly in the mountain scene under the crags or sipping at the clear stream that gushed from the rocks and wound to the vale below such crystal rivulets crossed our way continually as we rose upon the side of saddleback which towers abruptly on the right and on the left sinks as suddenly into the vale of threlkeld with precipices sometimes little less than tremendous this mountain is the northern boundary of the vale in its whole length to keswick the points of whose fells close the perspective rocky heights guard it to the south the valley between is green without wood and with much that is grand has little beautiful till near its conclusion where more fertile and still more wild it divides into three narrower valleys two of which disclose scenes of such sublime severity as even our long view of saddleback had not prepared us to expect  the first of these is the vale of st john a narrow cultivated spot lying in the bosom of tremendous rocks that impend over it in masses of gray crag and often resemble the ruins of castles these rocks are overlooked by still more awful mountains that fall in abrupt lines and close up the vista except where they also are commanded by the vast top of helvellyn on every side are images of desolation and stupendous greatness closing upon a narrow line of pastoral richness a picture of verdant beauty seen through a frame of rock work it is between the cliffs of threlkeldfell and the purple ridge of nadalefell that this vale seems to repose in its most silent and perfect peace no village and scarcely a cottage disturbs its retirement the flocks that feed at the feet of the cliffs and the steps of a shepherd in this office of his mountain watch are all that haunt the dark sequestered nook  the vale of nadale runs parallel with that of st john from which it is separated by the ridge of nadalefell and has the same style of character except that it is terminated by a well wooded mountain beyond this the perspective is overlooked by the fells that terminate the vale of st john  the third valley opening from the head of threlkeld winds along the feet of saddleback and skiddaw to keswick the approach to which with all its world of rocky summits the lake being still sunk below the sight is sublime beyond the power of description within three miles of keswick skiddaw unfolds itself close behind saddleback their skirts unite but the former is less huge and of very different form from the last being more pointed and seldomer broken into precipices it darts upward with a vast sweep into three spiry summits two of which only are seen from this road and shows sides dark with heath and little varied with rock such is its aspect from the penrith road from other stations its attitude shape and coloring are very different though its alpine terminations are always visible  threlkeld itself is a small village about thirteen miles from penrith with a very humble inn at which those who have passed the bleak sides of saddleback and those who are entering upon them may rejoice to rest we had been blown about for some hours in an open chaise and hoped for more refreshment than could be obtained but had the satisfaction which was indeed general in these regions of observing the good intentions amounting almost to kindness of the cottagers toward their guests they have nearly always some fare which less civility than theirs might render acceptable and the hearth blazes in their clean sanded parlours within two minutes after you enter them some sort of preserved fruit is constantly ferved after the repast with cream an innocent luxury for which no animal has died  it is not only from those who are to gain by strangers but from almost every person accidentally accosted by a question that this favorable opinion will be formed as to the kind and frank manners of the people we were continually remarking between lancaster and keswick that severe as the winter might be in these districts from the early symptoms of it then apparent the conduct of the people would render it scarcely unpleasant to take the same journey in the depths of december  in these countries the farms are for the most part small and the farmers and their children work in the same fields with their servants their families have thus no opportunities of temporary insight into the society and luxuries of the great and have none of those miseries which dejected vanity and multiplied wishes inflict upon the pursuers of the higher ranks they are also without the baseness which such pursuers usually have of becoming abject before persons of one class that by the authority of an apparent connection with them they may be insolent to those of another and are free from the essential humiliation of showing by a general and undistinguishing admiration of all persons richer than themselves that the original distinctions between virtue and vice have been erased from their minds by the habit of comparing the high and the low  the true consciousness of independence which labor and an ignorance of the vain appendages falsely called luxuries give to the inhabitants of these districts is probably the cause of the superiority perceived by strangers in their tempers and manners over those of persons apparently better circumstanced they have no remembrance of slights to be revenged by insults no hopes from servility nor irritation from the desire of unattainable distinctions where on the contrary the encouragement of artificial wants has produced dependence and mingled with the fictitious appearance of wealth many of the most real evils of poverty the benevolence of the temper flies with the simplicity of the mind there is perhaps not a more odious prospect of human society than where an ostentatious maneuvering and corrupted peasantry taking those who induce them to crimes for the models of their morality mimic the vices to which they were not born and attempt the coarse covering of cunning and insolence for practices which it is a science and frequently an object of education to conceal by flagitious elegancies such persons form in the country a bad copy of the worst london society the vices without the intelligence and without the assuaging virtues  druidical monument after passing the very small but neatly furnished church of threlkeld the condition of which may be one testimony to the worthiness of the neighborhood and rising beyond the vales before described we came to the brow of a hill called castle rigg on which to the left of the road are the remains of one of those circular monuments which by general consent are called druids temples this is formed of thirtyseven stones placed in a circle of about twentyeight yards diameter the largest being not less than seven feet and a half high which is double the height of the others at the eastern part of this circle and within it smaller stones are arranged in an oblong of about seven yards long and at the greatest breadth four yards wide many of those round the circle appear to have fallen and now remain at unequal distances of which the greatest is toward the north  whether our judgment was influenced by the authority of a druids choice or that the place itself commanded the opinion we thought this situation the most severely grand of any hitherto passed there is perhaps not a single object in the scene that interrupts the solemn tone of feeling impressed by its general characters of profound solitude greatness and awful wildness castle rigg is the central point of three valleys that dart immediately under it from the eye and whose mountains form part of an amphitheatre which is completed by those of derwentwater in the west and by the precipices of skiddaw and saddleback close on the north the hue which pervades all these mountains is that of dark heath or rock they are thrown into every form and direction that fancy would suggest and are at that distance which allows all their grandeur to prevail nearer than the high lands that surround hutton moor and further removed than the fells in the scenery of ullswater  to the south open the rocks that disclose the vale of st john whose verdant beauty bears no proportion to its sublimity to the west are piled the shattered and fantastic points of derwentwater to the north skiddaw with its double top resembling a volcano the cloudy vapors ascending from its highest point like smoke and sometimes rolling in wreaths down its sides and to the east the vale of threlkeld spreading green round the base of saddleback its vast sideskreen opened to the moorlands beyond which the ridge of crossfell appeared its dignity now diminished by distance this point then is surrounded by the three grand rivals of cumberland huge helvellyn spreading saddleback and spiry skiddaw  such seclusion and sublimity were indeed well suited to the deep and wild mysteries of the druids here at moonlight every druid summoned by that terrible horn never awakened but upon high occasions and descending from his mountain or secret cave might assemble without intrusion from one sacrilegious footstep and celebrate a midnight festival by a savage sacrifice   rites of such strange potency as done in open day would dim the sun though throned in noontide brightness caractacus here too the bards robbed in their flowing vests of innocent white descend with harps that glitter to the moon hymning immortal strains the spirits of air of earth of water nay of heaven itself do listen to their lay and often it is said in visible shapes dance they a magic round to the high minstrelsy   as we descended the steep mountain to keswick the romantic fells round the lake opened finely but the lake itself was concealed deep in its rocky cauldron we saw them under the last glow of sunset the upward rays producing a misty purple glory between the dark tops of cawseypikes and the bending peaks of thornthwaite fells soon after the sun having set to the vale of keswick there appeared beyond breaks in its western mountains the rocks of other valleys still lighted up by a purple gleam and receiving strong rays on shaggy points to which their recesses gave soft and shadowy contrast but the magical effect of these sunshine rocks opposed to the darkness of the nearer valley can scarcely be imagined  still as we descended the lake of derwentwater was screened from our view but the rich level of three miles wide that spreads between it and bassenthwaitewater in the same vale lay like a map beneath us chequered with groves and cottages with enclosures of corn and meadows and adorned by the pretty village of crossthwaite its neat white church conspicuous among trees the fantastic fells of derwentwater bordered this reposing landscape on the west and the mighty skiddaw rose over it on the east concealing the lake of bassenthwaite  the hollow dashings of the greta in its rocky channel at the foot of skiddaw and in one of the most wizard little glens that nature ever fancied were heard long before we looked down its steep woody bank and saw it winding away from close inaccessible chasms to the vale of keswick corn and meadows spread at the top of the left bank and the crags of skiddaw scowling over it on the right  at length we had a glimpse of the north end of derwentwater and soon after entered keswick a small place of stone houses lying at the foot of castle rigg near skiddaw and about a quarter of a mile from the lake which however is not seen from the town  we were impatient to view this celebrated lake and immediately walked down to crowpark a green eminence at its northern end whence it is generally allowed to appear to great advantage expectation had been raised too high shall we own our disappointment prepared for something more than we had already seen by what has been so eloquently said of it by the view of its vast neighborhood and the grandeur of its approach the lake itself looked insignificant and however rude or awful its nearer rocks might have appeared if seen unexpectedly they were not in general so vast or so boldly outlined as to retain a character of sublimity from comparison opposed to the simple majesty of ullswater the lake of derwent was scarcely interesting something must indeed be attributed to the force of first impressions but with all allowance for this ullswater must still retain an high preeminence for grandeur and sublimity  derwentwater however when more minutely viewed has peculiar charms both from beauty and wildness and as the emotions excited by disappointed expectation began to subside we became sensible of them it seems to be nearly of a round form and the whole is seen at one glance expanding within an amphitheatre of mountains rocky but not vast broken into many fantastic shapes peaked splintered impending sometimes pyramidal opening by narrow valleys to the view of rocks that rise immediately beyond and are again overlooked by others the precipices seldom overshoot the water but are arranged at some distance and the shores swell with woody eminences or sink into green pastoral margins masses of wood also frequently appear among the cliffs feathering them to their summits and a white cottage sometimes peeps from out their skirts seated on the smooth knoll of a pasture projecting to the lake and looks so exquisitely picturesque as to seem placed there purposely to adorn it the lake in return faithfully reflects the whole picture and so even and brilliantly translucent is its surface that it rather heightens than obscures the coloring its mild bosom is spotted by four small islands of which those called lords and st herberts are well wooded and adorn the scene but another is deformed by buildings stuck over it like figures upon a twelfthcake  beyond the head of the lake and at a direct distance of three or four miles from crowpark the pass of borrowdale opens guarded by two piles of rock the boldest in the scene overlooked by many rocky points and beyond all by rude mountain tops which come partially and in glimpses to the view among the most striking features of the eastern shore are the woody cliffs of lowdore then nearer to the eye wallowcrags a title used here as well as at hawswater of dark brown rock loosely impending nearer still castlehill pyramidal and richly wooded to its point the most luxuriant feature of the landscape cawseypike one of the most remarkable rocks of the western shore has its ridge scolloped into points as if with a row of corbells  the cultivated vale of newland slopes upward from the lake between these and thornthwaite fells northward beyond crowpark rises skiddaw at its base commences the beautiful level that spreads to bassenthwaitewater where the rocks in the west side of the perspective soon begin to soften and the vale becomes open and cheerful  such is the outline of derwentwater which has a much greater proportion of beauty than ullswater but neither its dignity nor grandeur its fells broken into smaller masses do not swell or start into such bold lines as those of ullswater nor does the size of the lake accord with the general importance of the rocky vale in which it lies the water is too small for its accompaniments and its form being round and seen entirely at once leaves nothing for expectation to pursue beyond the stretching promontory or fancy to transform within the gloom and obscurity of the receding fell and thus it loses an ample source of the sublime the greatest breadth from east to west is not more than three miles it is not large enough to occupy the eye and it is not so hidden as to have the assistance of the imagination in making it appear large the beauty of its banks also contending with the wildness of its rocks gives opposite impressions to the mind and the force of each is perhaps destroyed by the admission of the other sublimity can scarcely exist without simplicity and even grandeur loses much of its elevating effect when united with a considerable portion of beauty then descending to become magnificence the effect of simplicity in assisting that high tone of mind produced by the sublime is demonstrated by the scenery of ullswater where very seldom a discordant object obtrudes over the course of thought and jars upon the feelings  but it is much pleasanter to admire than to examine and in derwentwater is abundant subject for admiration though not of so high a character as that which attends ullswater the soft undulations of its shores the mingled wood and pasture that paint them the brilliant purity of the water that gives back every landscape on its bank and frequently with heightened coloring the fantastic wildness of the rocks and the magnificence of the amphitheatre they form these are circumstances the view of which excites emotions of sweet though tranquil admiration softening the mind to tenderness rather than elevating it to sublimity we first saw the whole beneath such sober hues as prevailed when the gray hooded even like a sad votarist in palmers weed rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain   the wildness seclusion and magical beauty of this vale seem indeed to render it the very abode for miltons comus deep skilled in all his mothers witcheries and while we survey its fantastic features we are almost tempted to suppose that he has hurled his dazzling spells into the air of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion and give it false presentiments nay more to believe all the sage poets taught by the heavenly muse storied of old in high immortal verse of dire chimaeras and enchanted isles and to fancy we hear from among the woody cliffs near the shore the sound of riot and ill managed merriment succeeded by such strains as often in pleasing slumbers lull the sense and in sweet madness rob it of itself   skiddaw on the following morning having engaged a guide and with horses accustomed to the labor we began to ascend this tremendous mountain by a way which makes the summit five miles from keswick passing through bowery lanes luxuriant with mountain ash holly and a variety of beautiful shrubs to a broad open common a road led us to the foot of latrigg or as it is called by the country people skiddaws cub a large round hill covered with heath turf and browsing sheep a narrow path now wound along steep green precipices the beauty of which prevented what danger there was from being perceived derwentwater was concealed by others that rose above them but that part of the vale of keswick which separates the two lakes and spreads a rich level of three miles was immediately below crossthwaitechurch nearly in the center with the white vicarage rising among trees more under shelter of skiddaw where the vale spreads into a sweet retired nook lay the house and grounds of dr brownrigg  beyond the level opened a glimpse of bassenthwaitewater a lake which may be called elegant bounded on one side by wellwooded rocks and on the other by skiddaw  soon after we rose above the steeps which had concealed derwentwater and it appeared with all its enamelled banks sunk deep amidst a chaos of mountains and surrounded by ranges of fells not visible from below on the other hand the more cheerful lake of bassenthwaite expanded at its entire length having gazed a while on this magnificent scene we pursued the path and soon after reached the brink of a chasm on the opposite side of which wound our future track for the ascent is here in an acutely zigzag direction the horses carefully picked their steps along the narrow precipice and turned the angle that led them to the opposite side  at length as we ascended derwentwater dwindled on the eye to the smallness of a pond while the grandeur of its amphitheatre was increased by new ranges of dark mountains no longer individually great but so from accumulation a scenery to give ideas of the breaking up of a world other precipices soon hid it again but bassenthwaite continued to spread immediately below us till we turned into the heart of skiddaw and were enclosed by its steeps we had now lost all track even of the flocks that were scattered over these tremendous wilds the guide conducted us by many curvings among the heathy hills and hollows of the mountain but the ascents were such that the horses panted in the slowest walk and it was necessary to let them rest every six or seven minutes an opening to the south at length showed the whole plan of the narrow vales of st john and of nadale separated by the dark ridge of rock called st johnsrigg with each its small line of verdure at the bottom and bounded by enormous gray fells which we were however now high enough to overlook  a white speck on the top of st johns rigg was pointed out by the guide to be a chapel of ease to keswick which has no less than five such scattered among the fells from this chapel dedicated to st john the rock and the vale have received their name and our guide told us that nadale was frequently known by the same title  leaving this view the mountain soon again shut out all prospect but of its own valleys and precipices covered with various shades of turf and moss and with heath of which a dull purple was the prevailing hue not a tree or bush appeared on skiddaw nor even a stone wall any where broke the simple greatness of its lines sometimes we looked into tremendous chasms where the torrent heard roaring long before it was seen had worked itself a deep channel and fell from ledge to ledge foaming and shining amidst the dark rock these streams are sublime from the length and precipitancy of their course which hurrying the sight with them into the abyss act as it were in sympathy upon the nerves and to save ourselves from following we recoil from the view with involuntary horror of such however we saw only two and those by some departure from the usual course up the mountain but every where met gushing springs till we were within two miles of the summit when our guide added to the rum in his bottle what he said was the last water we should find in our ascent  the air now became very thin and the steeps still more difficult of ascent but it was often delightful to look down into the green hollows of the mountain among pastoral scenes that wanted only some mixture of wood to render them enchanting  about a mile from the summit the way was indeed dreadfully sublime laying for nearly half a mile along the ledge of a precipice that passed with a swift descent for probably near a mile into a glen within the heart of skiddaw and not a bush or a hillock interrupted its vast length or by offering a midway check in the descent diminished the sear it inspired the ridgy steeps of saddleback formed the opposite boundary of the glen and though really at a considerable distance had from the height of the two mountains such an appearance of nearness that it almost seemed as if we could spring to its side how much too did simplicity increase the sublime of this scenery in which nothing but mountain heath and sky appeared  but our situation was too critical or too unusual to permit the just impressions of such sublimity the hill rose so closely above the precipice as scarcely to allow a ledge wide enough for a single horse we followed the guide in silence and till we regained the more open wild had no leisure for exclamation after this the ascent appeared easy and secure and we were bold enough to wonder that the steeps near the beginning of the mountain had excited any anxiety  at length passing the skirts of the two points of skiddaw which are nearest to derwentwater we approached the third and loftiest and then perceived that their steep sides together with the ridges which connect them were entirely covered near the summits with a whitish shivered slate which threatens to slide down them with every gust of wind the broken state of this slate makes the present summits seem like the ruins of others a circumstance as extraordinary in appearance as difficult to be accounted for  the ridge on which we passed from the neighborhood of the second summit to the third was narrow and the eye reached on each side down the whole extent of the mountain following on the left the rocky precipices that impend over the lake of bassenthwaite and looking on the right into the glens of saddleback far far below but the prospects that burst upon us from every part of the vast horizon when we had gained the summit were such as we had scarcely dared to hope for and must now rather venture to enumerate than to describe  we stood on a pinnacle commanding the whole dome of the sky the prospects below each of which had been before considered separately as a great scene were now miniature parts of the immense landscape to the north lay like a map the vast tract of low country which extends between bassenthwaite and the irish channel marked with the silver circles of the river derwent in its progress from the lake whitehaven and its white coast were distinctly seen and cockermouth seemed almost under the eye a long blackish line more to the west resembling a faintly formed cloud was said by the guide to be the isle of man who however had the honesty to confess that the mountains of down in ireland which have been sometimes thought visible had never been seen by him in the clearest weather  bounding the low country to the north the wide solway firth with its indented shores looked like a gray horizon and the double range of scottish mountains seen dimly through mist beyond like lines of dark clouds above it the solway appeared surprisingly near us though at fifty miles distance and the guide said that on a bright day its shipping could plainly be discerned nearly in the north the heights seemed to soften into plains for no object was there visible through the obscurity that had begun to draw over the furthest distance but toward the east they appeared to swell again and what we were told were the cheviot hills dawned feebly beyond northumberland we now spanned the narrowest part of england looking from the irish channel on one side to the german ocean on the other which latter was however so far off as to be discernible only like a mist  nearer than the county of durham stretched the ridge of crossfell and an indistinct multitude of the westmoreland and yorkshire highlands whose lines disappeared behind saddleback now evidently preeminent over skiddaw so much so as to exclude many a height beyond it passing this mountain in our course to the south we saw immediately below the fells round derwentwater the lake itself remaining still concealed in their deep rocky bosom southward and westward the whole prospect was a turbulent chaos of dark mountains all individual dignity was now lost in the immensity of the whole and every variety of character was overpowered by that of astonishing and gloomy grandeur  over the fells of borrowdale and far to the south the northern end of windermere appeared like a wreath of gray smoke that spreads along the mountains side more southward still and beyond all the fells of the lakes lancaster sands extended to the faintly seen waters of the sea then to the west duddon sands gleamed in a long line among the fells of high furness immediately under the eye lay bassenthwaite surrounded by many ranges of mountains invisible from below we overlooked all these dark mountains and saw green cultivated vales over the tops of lofty rocks and other mountains over these vales in many ridges whilst innumerable narrow glens were traced in all their windings and seen uniting behind the hills with others that also sloped upwards from the lake  the air on this summit was boisterous intensely cold and difficult to be inspired though the day was below warm and serene it was dreadful to look down from nearly the brink of the point on which we stood upon the lake of bassenthwaite and over a sharp and separated ridge of rocks that from below appeared of tremendous height but now seemed not to reach half way up skiddaw it was almost as if the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight   under the lee of an heaped up pile of slates formed by the customary contribution of one from every visitor we found an old man sheltered whom we took to be a shepherd but afterward learned was a farmer and as the people in this neighborhood say a statesman that is had land of his own he was a native and still an inhabitant of an adjoining vale but so laborious is the enterprise reckoned that though he had passed his life within view of the mountain this was his first ascent he descended with us for part of our way and then wound off toward his own valley stalking amidst the wild scenery his large figure wrapped in a dark cloak and his steps occasionally assisted by a long iron pronged pike with which he had pointed out distant objects  in the descent it was interesting to observe each mountain below gradually reassuming its dignity the two lakes expanding into spacious surfaces the many little valleys that sloped upwards from their margins recovering their variegated tints of cultivation the cattle again appearing in the meadows and the woody promontories changing from smooth patches of shade into richly tufted summits at about a mile from the top a great difference was perceptible in the climate which became comparatively warm and the summer hum of bees was again heard among the purple heath  we reached keswick about four oclock after five hours passed in this excursion in which the care of our guide greatly lessened the notion of danger why should we think it trivial to attempt some service toward this poor man we have reason to think that whoever employs at keswick a guide of the name of doncaster will assist him in supporting an aged parent  bassenthwaite water in a gray autumnal morning we rode out along the western bank of bassenthwaite to ouse bridge under which the river derwent after passing through the lake takes its course toward the sea the road on this side being impassable by carriages is seldom visited but it is interesting for being opposed to skiddaw which rises in new attitudes over the opposite bank beyond the land that separates the two lakes the road runs high along the sides of hills and sometimes at the feet of tremendous fells one of which rises almost spirally over it showing a surface of slates shivered from top to bottom further on the heights gradually soften from horror into mild and graceful beauty opening distantly to the cheerful country that spreads toward whitehaven but the road soon immerges among woods which allow only partial views of the opposite shore inimitably beautiful with copses green lawns and pastures with gently sweeping promontories and bays that receive the lake to their full brims  from the house at ouse bridge the prospect is exquisite up the lake which now losing the air of a wide river reassumes its true character and even appears to flow into the chasm of rocks that really enclose derwentwater skiddaw with all the mountains round borrowdale form a magnificent amphitheatrical perspective for this noble sheet of water the valleys of the two lakes extending to one view which is therefore superior to any exhibited from derwentwater alone the prospect terminates in the dark fells of borrowdale which by their sublimity enhance the beauty and elegance united to a surprising degree in the nearer landscape  beyond ouse bridge but still at the bottom of the lake the road passes before armithwaitehouse whose copsy lawns slope to the margin of the water from a mansion more finely situated than any we had seen it then recedes somewhat from the bank and ascends the skirt of skiddaw which it scarcely leaves on this side of keswick on the opposite shore the most elegant features are the swelling hills called wythopbrows flourishing with wood from the waters edge and below the meadows of the eastern bank by which we were returning two peninsulae the one pastoral yet well wooded and embellished by a white hamlet the other narrow and bearing only a line of trees issuing far into the lake but the shores of bassenthwaite though elegant and often beautiful are too little varied to be long dwelt upon and attention is sometimes unpleasantly engaged by a precipice from which the road is not sufficiently secured so that the effect of the whole upon the imagination is much less than might be expected from its situation at the foot of skiddaw and its shape which is more extended than that of derwentwater  borrowdale a serene day with gleams of sunshine gave magical effect to the scenery of derwentwater as we wound along its eastern shore to borrowdale under cliffs parts of which already fallen near the road increased the opinion of danger from the rest sometimes near the edge of precipices that bend over the water and at others among pleasuregrounds and copses which admit partial views over the lake these with every woody promontory and mountain were perfectly reflected on its surface not a pathway not a crag or scar that sculptured their bold fronts but was copied and distinctly seen even from the opposite shore in the dark purple mirror below now and then a pleasureboat glided by leaving long silver lines drawn to a point on the smooth water which as it gave back the painted sides and gleaming sail displayed a moving picture  the coloring of the mountains was this day surprisingly various and changeful surpassing every thing of the same nature that we had seen the effect of the atmosphere on mountainous regions is sometimes so sublime at others so enchantingly beautiful that the mention of it ought not to be considered as trivial when their aspect is to be described as the sunbeams fell on different kinds of rock and distance colored the air some parts were touched with lilac others with light blue dark purple or reddish brown which were often seen at the same moment contrasting with the mellow green of the woods and the brightness of sunshine then slowly and almost imperceptibly changing into other tints skiddaw itself exhibited much of this variety during our ride as we left keswick its points were overspread with pale azure on our return a tint of dark blue softened its features which were however soon after involved in deepest purple  winding under the woods of barrowside we approached lowdore and heard the thunder of his cataract joined by the sounds of others descending within the gloom of the nearer rocks and thickets the retrospective views over the lake from barrowside are the finest in the ride and when the road emerges from the woods a range of rocks rises over it where many shrubs and even oaks ash yew grow in a surprising manner among the broken slates that cover their sides beyond at some distance from the shore appear the awful rocks that rise over the fall of lowdore that on the right shooting up a vast pyramid of naked cliff above finely wooded steeps while on the opposite side of the chasm that receives the waters impends gowdarcrag whose trees and shrubs give only shagginess to its terrible masses with fragments of which the meadows below are strewn there was now little water at lowdore but the breadth of its channel and the height of the perpendicular rock from which it leaps told how tremendous it could be yet even then its sublimity is probably derived chiefly from the cliff and mountain that tower closely over it  here borrowdale begins its rocks spreading in a vast sweep round the head of the lake at the distance perhaps of half a mile from the shore which bears meadow land to the waters brink the aspect of these rocks with the fragments that have rolled from their summits and lie on each side of the road prepared us for the scene of tremendous ruin we were approaching in the gorge or pass of borrowdale which opens from the center of the amphitheatre that binds the head of derwentwater dark rocks yawn at its entrance terrific as the wildness of a maniac and disclose a narrow pass running up between mountains of granite that are shook into almost every possible form of horror all above resembles the accumulations of an earthquake splintered shivered piled amassed huge cliffs have rolled down into the glen below where however is still a miniature of the sweetest pastoral beauty on the banks of the river derwent but description cannot paint either the wildness of the mountains or the pastoral and sylvan peace and softness that wind at their base  among the most striking of the fells are glaramara showing rock on rock and eaglecrag where till lately that bird built its nest but the depredations annually committed on its young have driven it from the place hence we pursued the pass for a mile over a frightful road that climbs among the crags of a precipice above the river having frequently glimpses into glens and chasms where all passage seemed to be obstructed by the fallen shivers of rock and at length reached the gigantic stone of bowther that appears to have been pitched into the ground from the summit of a neighboring fell and is shaped like the roof of a house reversed  this is one of the spectacles of the country its size makes it impossible to have been ever moved by human means and if it fell from the nearest of the rocks it must have rolled upon the ground much further than can be readily conceived of the motion of such a mass the side toward the road projects about twelve feet over the base and serves to shelter cattle in a penn of which it is made to form one boundary a small oak plant and a sloe have found soil enough to flourish in at the top and the base is pitched on a cliff over the river whence a long perspective of the gorge is seen with a little level of bright verdure spreading among more distant fells and winding away into trackless regions where the mountains lift their ruffian heads in undisputed authority below the shrunk derwent serpentized along a wide bed of pebbles that marked its wintry course and left a wooded island flourishing amidst the waste the stillness around us was only feebly broken by the remote sounds of many unseen cataracts and sometimes by the voices of mountaineer children shouting afar off and pleasing themselves with rousing the echoes of the rocks  in returning the view opened with great magnificence from the jaws of this pass over the lake to skiddaw then seen from its base with the upper steeps of saddleback obliquely beyond and rearing itself far above all the heights of the eastern shore at the entrance of the gorge the village or hamlet of grange lies picturesquely on the bank of the derwent among wood and meadows and sheltered under the ruinous fell called castlecrag that takes its name from the castle or fortress which from its crown once guarded this important pass  borrowdale abounds in valuable mines among which some are known to supply the finest wadd or black lead to be found in england iron slate and free stone of various kinds are also the treasures of these mountains  from keswick to windermere the road from keswick to ambleside commences by the ascent of castlerigg the mountain which the penrith road descends and which on that side is crowned by a druids temple the rise is now very laborious but the views it affords over the vale of keswick are not dearly purchased by the fatigue all bassenthwaite its mountains softening away in the perspective and terminating on the west in the sister woods of wythorpbrows extends from the eye and immediately beneath the northern end of derwentwater with cawseypike thornthwaitefell the rich upland vale of newland peeping from between their bases and the spiry woods of foepark jutting into the lake below but the finest prospect is from a gate about halfway up the hill whence you look down upon the head of derwentwater with all the alps of borrowdale opening darkly  after descending castlerigg and crossing the top of st johns vale we seemed as if going into banishment from society the road then leading over a plain closely surrounded by mountains so wild that neither a cottage or a wood soften their rudeness and so steep and barren that not even sheep appear upon their sides from this plain the road enters legberthwaite a narrow valley running at the back of borrowdale green at the bottom and varied with a few farms but without wood and with fells of gray precipices rising to great height and nearly perpendicular on either hand whose fronts are marked only by the torrents that tumble from their utmost summits and perpetually occur we often stopped to listen to their hollow sounds amidst the solitary greatness of the scene and to watch their headlong fall down the rocky chasms their white foam and silver line contrasting with the dark hue of the clefts in sublimity of descent these were frequently much superior to that of lowdore but as much inferior to it in mass of water and picturesque beauty  as the road ascended toward helvellyn we looked back through this vast rocky vista to the sweet vale of st john lengthening the perspective and saw as through a telescope the broad broken steeps of saddleback and the points of skiddaw darkly blue closing it to the north the grand rivals of cumberland were now seen together and the road soon winding high over the skirts of helvellyn brought us to leatheswater to which the mountain forms a vast sideskreen during its whole length this is a long but narrow and unadorned lake having little else than walls of rocky fells starting from its margin continuing on the precipice at some height from the shore the road brought us after three miles to the poor village of wythburn and soon after to the foot of dunmail rays which though a considerable ascent forms the dip of two lofty mountains steelfell and seat sandle that rise with finelysweeping lines on each side and shut up the vale  beyond dunmail rays one of the grand passes from cumberland into westmoreland helmcrag rears its crest a strange fantastic summit round yet jagged and splintered like the wheel of a watermill overlooking grasmere which soon after opened below a green spreading circle of mountains embosoms this small lake and beyond a wider range rises in amphitheatre whose rocky tops are rounded and scolloped yet are great wild irregular and were then overspread with a tint of faint purple the softest verdure margins the water and mingles with corn enclosures and woods that wave up the hills but scarcely a cottage any where appears except at the northern end of the lake where the village of grasmere and its very neat white church stand among trees near the shore with helmcrag and a multitude of fells rising over it and beyond each other in the perspective  the lake was clear as glass reflecting the headlong mountains with every feature of every image on its tranquil banks and one green island varies but scarcely adorns its surface bearing only a rude and now shadeless hut at a considerable height above the water the road undulates for a mile till near the southern end of grasmere it mounts the crags of a fell and seemed carrying us again into such scenes of ruin and privation as we had quitted with legberthwaite and leatheswater but descending the other side of the mountain we were soon cheered by the view of plantations enriching the banks of rydalwater and by thick woods mingling among cliffs above the narrow lake which winds through a close valley for about a mile this lake is remarkable for the beauty of its small round islands luxuriant with elegant trees and shrubs and whose banks are green to the waters edge rydalhall stands finely on an eminence somewhat withdrawn from the east end in a close romantic nook among old woods that feather the fells which rise over their summits and spread widely along the neighboring eminences this ancient white mansion looks over a rough grassy descent screened by groves of oak and majestic planes toward the head of windermere about two miles distant a small glimpse of which is caught beyond the wooded steeps of a narrow valley in the woods and in the disposition of the ground round rydalhall there is a charming wildness that suits the character of the general scene and wherever art appears it is with graceful plainness and meek subjection to nature  the taste by which a cascade in the pleasuregrounds pouring under the arch of a rude bridge amidst the green tint of woods is shown through a darkened gardenhouse and therefore with all the effect which the opposition of light and shade can give is even not too artificial so admirably is the intent accomplished of making all the light that is admitted fall upon the objects which are chiefly meant to be observed  the road to ambleside runs through the valley in front of rydalhall and for some distance among the grounds that belong to it where again the taste of the owner is conspicuous in the disposition of plantations among pastures of extraordinary richness and where pure rivulets are suffered to wind without restraint over their dark rocky channels woods mantle up the cliffs on either side of this sweet valley and higher still the craggy summits of the fells crowd over the scene two miles among its pleasant shades near the banks of the murmuring rotha brought us to ambleside a black and very ancient little town hanging on the lower steeps of a mountain where the vale opens to the head of  windermere which appeared at some distance below in gentle yet stately beauty but its boundaries showed nothing of the sublimity and little of the romantic wildness that charms or elevates in the scenery of the other lakes the shores and the hills which gradually ascend from them are in general richly cultivated or wooded and correctly elegant and when we descended upon the bank the road seemed leading through the artificial shades of pleasuregrounds it undulates for two miles over low promontories and along spacious bays full to their fringed margin with the abundance of this expansive lake then quitting the bank it ascends gradual eminences that look upon the vast plain of water and rise amidst the richest landscapes of its shores the manners of the people would have sufficiently informed us that windermere is the lake most frequented and with the great sublimity of the more sequestered scenes we had to regret the interesting simplicity of their inhabitants a simplicity which accorded so beautifully with the dignified character of the country the next day we visited several of the neighboring heights whence the lake is seen to great advantage and on the following skirted the eastern shore for six miles to the ferry  windermere above twelve miles long and generally above a mile broad but sometimes two sweeps like a majestic river with an easy bend between low points of land and eminences that shaded with wood and often embellished with villas swell into hills cultivated to their summits except that for about six miles along the middle of the western shore a range of rocky fells rise over the water but these have nothing either picturesque or fantastic in their shape they are heavy not broken into parts and their rudeness softens into insignificance when they are seen over the wide channel of the lake they are neither large enough to be grand or wooded enough to be beautiful to the north or head of windermere however the tameness of its general character disappears and the scene soars into grandeur here over a ridge of rough brown hills above a woody shore rise at the distance of a mile and half or two miles a multitude of finely alpine mountains retiring obliquely in the perspective among which langdalepikes hardknot and wrynose bearing their bold pointed promontories aloft are preeminent the coloring of these mountains which are some of the grandest of cumberland and westmoreland was this day remarkably fine the weather was showery with gleams of sunshine sometimes their tops were entirely concealed in gray vapors which drawing upwards would seem to ascend in volumes of smoke from their summits at others a few scattered clouds wandered along their sides leaving their heads unveiled and effulgent with light these clouds disappearing before the strength of the sun a fine downy hue of light blue overspread the peeping points of the most distant fells while the nearer ones were tinged with deep purple which was opposed to the brown heath and crag of the lower hills the olive green of two wooded slopes that just tinted by autumn seemed to descend to the margin and the silver transparency of the expanding water at their feet this view of windermere appears with great majesty from a height above culgarth a seat of the bishop of landaff while to the south the lake after sweeping about four miles gradually narrows and disappears behind the great island which stretches across the perspective  at the distance of two or three miles beyond culgarth from a hill advancing toward the water the whole of windermere is seen to the right is the white mansion at culgarth among wood on a gentle eminence of the shore with the lake spreading wide beyond crowned by the fells half obscured in clouds to the south the hills of the eastern shore sloping gradually run out in elegant and often well wooded points into the water and are spotted with villas and varied above with enclosures the opposite shore is for about a mile southward a continuation of the line of rock before noticed from which rawlinsonsnab pushes a bold headland over the lake the perspective then sinks away in low hills and is crossed by a remote ridge that closes the scene  the villages of rayrig and bowness which are passed in the way to the ferry both stand delightfully one on an eminence commanding the whole lake and the other within a recess of the shore nearly opposite the large island the winding banks of windermere continually open new landscapes as you move along them and the mountains which crown its head are as frequently changing their attitudes but langdalepikes the boldest features in the scene are soon lost to the eye behind the nearer fells of the western shore  the ferry is considerably below christians island and at the narrowest span of the lake where two points of the shore extend to meet each other this island said to contain thirty acres intermingled with wood lawn and shrubberies embellishes without decreasing the dignity of the scene it is surrounded by attendant islets some rocky but others beautifully covered with  seem to coronet the flood  in crossing the water the illusions of vision give force to the northern mountains which viewed from hence appear to ascend from its margin and to spread round it in a magnificent amphitheatre this was to us the most interesting view on windermere  on our approaching the western shore the range of rocks that form it discovered their cliffs and gradually assumed a consequence which the breadth of the channel had denied them and their darkness was well opposed by the bright verdure and variegated autumnal tints of the isles at their base on the bank under shelter of these rocks a white house was seen beyond the tall boles of a most luxuriant grove of planetrees which threw their shadows over it and on the margin of the silver lake spreading in front from hence the road ascends the steep and craggy side of furnessfell on the brow of which we had a last view of windermere in its whole course to the south its tame but elegant landscapes gliding away into low and long perspective and the lake gradually narrowing to the north its more impressive scenery but the finest features of it were now concealed by a continuation of the rocks we were upon  windermere is distinguished from all the other lakes of this country by its superior length and breath by the gentle hills cultivated and enclosed nearly to their summits that generally bind its shores by the gradual distance and fine disposition of the northern mountains by the bold sweeps of its numerous bays by the villas that speckle and rich plantations that wind them and by one large island surrounded by many islets which adds dignity to its bosom on the other lakes the islands are prettinesses that do not accord with the character of the scene they break also the surface of the water where vast continuity is required and the mind cannot endure to descend suddenly from the gigantic sublimity of nature to her fairy sports yet on the whole windermere was to us the least impressive of all the lakes except to the north where the retiring mountains are disposed with uncommon grandeur of outline and magnificence of coloring its scenery is tame having little of the wild and nothing of the astonishing energy that appears on the features of the more sequestered districts the characters of the three great lakes may perhaps be thus distinguished  windermere diffusiveness stately beauty and at the upper end magnificence  ullswater severe grandeur and sublimity all that may give ideas of vast power and astonishing majesty the effect of ullswater is that awful as its scenery appears it awakens the mind to expectation still more awful and touching all the powers of imagination inspires that fine phrensy descriptive of the poets eye which not only bodies forth unreal forms but imparts to substantial objects a character higher than their own  derwentwater fantastic wildness and romantic beauty but inferior to ullswater in greatness both of water and rocks for though it charms and elevates it does not display such features and circumstances of the sublime or call up such expectation of unimaged and uncertain wonder a principal defect if we may venture to call it so of derwentwater is that the water is too small in proportion for the amphitheatre of the valley in which it lies and therefore loses much of the dignity that in other circumstances it would exhibit the fault of windermere is perhaps exactly the reverse where the shores not generally grand are rendered tamer by the ample expanse of the lake the proportions of ullswater are more just and though its winding form gives it in some parts the air of a river the abrupt and tremendous height of its rocks the dark and crowding summits of the fells above the manner in which they enclose it together with the dignity of its breadth empower it constantly to affect the mind with emotions of astonishment and lofty expectation  from windermere to hawkshead thurstonlake and ulverston after ascending the laborious crags and precipices of furnessfell enlivened however by frequent views of the southern end of windermere the road immediately descends the opposite side of the mountain which shuts out the beautiful scenery of the lake but the prospect soon after opens to other mountains of furness in the distance which revive the expectation of such sublimity as we had lately regretted and to esthwaitwater in the valley below this is a narrow pleasant lake about half a mile broad and two miles long with gradual hills green to their tops rising round the margin with plantations and pastures alternately spreading along the easy shores and white farms scattered sparingly upon the slopes above the water seems to glide through the quiet privacy of pleasuregrounds so sine is the turf on its banks so elegant its copses and such an air of peace and retirement prevails over it a neat white village lies at the feet of the hills near the head of the lake beyond it is the gray town of hawkshead with its church and parsonage on an eminence commanding the whole valley steep hills rise over them and more distant the tall heads of the conistonfells dark and awful with a confusion of other mountains  hawkshead thus delightfully placed is an ancient but small town with a few good houses and a neat townhouse lately built by subscriptions of which the chief part was gratefully supplied by london merchants who had been educated at the free school here and this school itself is a memorial of gratitude having been founded by archbishop sandys for the advantage of the town which gave him birth near hawkshead are the remains of the house where the abbot of furness kept residence by one or more monks who performed divine service and other parochial duties in the neighborhood there is still a courtroom over the gateway where the bailiff of hawkshead held court and distributed justice in the name of the aboot  from the tremendous steeps of the long fell which towers over hawkshead astonishing views open to the distant vales and mountains of cumberland overlooking all the grotesque summits in the neighborhood of grasmere the fells of borrowdale in the furthest distance langdalepikes and several small lakes seen gleaming in the bosom of the mountains before us rose the whole multitude of conistonfells of immense height and threatening forms their tops thinly darkened with thunder mists and on the left furness fells sinking toward the bay which ulverston sands form for the sea  as we advanced conistonfells seemed to multiply and became still more impressive till having reached at length the summit of the mountain we looked down upon thurstonlake immediately below and saw them rising abruptly round its northern end in somewhat of the sublime attitudes and dark majesty of ullswater a range of lower rocks nearer to the eye exhibited a very peculiar and grotesque appearance colored scars and deep channels marking their purple sides as if they had been rifted by an earthquake  the road descends the flinty steeps toward the eastern bank of the lake that spreads a surface of six miles in length and generally three quarters of a mile in breadth not winding in its course yet much indented with bays and presenting nearly its whole extent at once to the eye the grandest features are the fells that crown its northern end not distantly and gradually like those of windermere nor varied like them with magnificent coloring but rising in haughty abruptness dark rugged and stupendous within a quarter of a mile of the margin and shutting out all prospect of other mountainsummits at their feet pastures spread a bright green to the brim of the lake nearly in the center of these fells which open in a semicircle to receive the lake a cataract descends but its shining line is not of a breadth proportioned to the vastness of its perpendicular fall the village of coniston is sweetly seated under shelter of the rocks and at a distance beyond on the edge of the water the ancient hall or priory shows its turret and ivyed ruins among old woods the whole picture is reflected in the liquid mirror below the gay convivial chorus or solemn vesper that once swelled along the lake from these consecrated walls and awakened perhaps the enthusiasm of the voyager while evening stole upon the scene is now contrasted by desolation and profound repose and as he glides by he hears only the dashing of his oars or the surge beating on the shore  this lake appeared to us one of the most charming we had seen from the sublime mountains which bend round its head the heights on either side decline toward the south into waving hills that form its shores and often stretch in long sweeping points into the water generally covered with tufted wood but sometimes with the tender verdure of pasturage the tops of these woods were just embrowned with autumn and contrasted well with other slopes rough and heathy that rose above or fell beside them to the waters brink and added force to the coloring which the reddish tints of decaying fern the purple bloom of heath and the bright golden gleams of broom spread over these elegant banks their hues the graceful undulations of the marginal hills and bays the richness of the woods the solemnity of the northern fells and the deep repose that pervades the scene where only now and then a white cottage or a farm lurks among the trees are circumstances which render thurstonlake one of the most interesting and perhaps the most beautiful of any in the country  the road undulates over copsy hills and dips into shallow valleys along the whole of the eastern bank seldom greatly elevated above the water or descending to a level with it but frequently opening to extensive views of its beauties and again shrouding itself in verdant gloom the most impressive pictures were formed by the fells that crowd over the upper end of the lake and which viewed from a low station sometimes appeared nearly to enclose that part of it the effect was then astonishingly grand particularly about sunset when the clouds drawing upwards discovered the utmost summits of these fells and a tint of dusky blue began to prevail over them which gradually deepened into night a line of lower rocks that extend from these are independently of the atmosphere of a dull purple and their shaggy forms would appear gigantic in almost any other situation even here they preserve a wild dignity and their attitudes somewhat resemble those at the entrance of borrowdale but they are forgotten when the eye is lifted to the solemn mountains immediately above these are rich in slate quarries and have some copper mines but the latter were closed during the civil wars of the last century having been worked as we are told in the descriptive language of the miners from the day to the evening end forty fathom and to the morning end seven score fathom a sigurative style of distinguishing the western and eastern directions of the mine the lake toward the lower end narrows and is adorned by one small island but here the hills of the eastern shore soar into fells some barren craggy and nearly perpendicular others entirely covered with coppicewood two of these rising over the road gave fine relief to each other the one showing only precipices of shelving rock while its rival aspired with woods that mantled from the base to the summit consisting chiefly of oak ash and holly not any lake that we saw is at present so much embellished with wood as thurston all the mountains of high and the valleys of low furness were indeed some centuries ago covered with forests part of which was called the forest of lancaster and these were of such entangled luxuriance as to be nearly impenetrable in many tracts here wolves wild boars and a remarkably large breed of deer called leghs the heads of which have frequently been found buried at a considerable depth in the soil abounded so secure an asylum did these animals find in the woods of high furness that even after the low lands were cleared and cultivated shepherds were necessary to guard the flocks from the ravages of the wolves toward the end of the thirteenth century the upper forests also were nearly destroyed  in winter the shepherds used to feed their flocks with the young sprouts of ash and holly a custom said to be still observed the sheep coming at the call of the shepherd and assembling round the hollytree to receive from his hand the young shoots cropped for them wests antiquities of furness  whenever the woods are felled which is too frequently done to supply fuel for the neighboring furnaces the holly is still held sacred to the flocks of these mountains  soon after passing the island the road enters the village of nibthwaite rich only in situation for the cottages are miserable the people seemed to be as ignorant as poor a young man knew not how far it was to ulverston or as he called it ulson though it was only five miles  on the point of a promontory of the opposite shore embosomed in ancient woods the chimnies and pointed roof of a gray mansion look out most interestingly the woods open partially to the north and admit a view of the swiss scenery at the head of the lake in its finest position on the other sides the oaks so embower the house and spread down the rocks as scarcely to allow it a glimpse of the water bickering between the dark foliage below  at nibthwaite the lake becomes narrow and gradually decreases till it terminates at lowickbridge where it glides away in the little river crake which descends to ulverston sands we stopped upon the bridge to take a last view of the scene the distant fells were disappearing in twilight but the gray lake gleamed at their base from the steeps of a lofty mountain that rose near us on the right cattle were slowly descending for the night winding among the crags sometimes stopping to crop the heath or broom and then disappearing for a moment behind the darker verdure of yews that grew in knots upon the cliffs  it was night before we reached ulverston the wind sounded mournfully among the hills and we perceived our approach to the sea only by the faint roaring of the tide till from a brow whence the hills open on either hand with a grand sweep we could just discern the gray surface of the seabay at a distance below and then by lights that glimmered in the bottom the town of ulverston lying not far from the shore and screened on the north by the heights from which we were to descend  ulverston is a neat but ancient town the capital and chief port of furness the road from it to the majestic ruin of furness abbey lies through low furness and loses the general wildness and interest of the country except where now and then the distant retrospect of the mountains breaks over the tame hills and regular enclosures that border it  about a mile and a half on this side of the abbey the road passes through dalton a very ancient little town once the capital of low furness and rendered so important by its neighborhood to the abbey that ulverston the present capital could not then support the weekly market for which it had obtained a charter dalton however sunk with the suppression of its neighboring patrons and is now chiefly distinguished by the pleasantness of its situation to which a church built on a bold ascent and the remains of a castle advantageously placed for the command of the adjoining valley still attach some degree of dignity what now exists of the latter is one tower in a chamber of whichthe abbot of furness held his secular court and the chamber was afterward used as a gaol for debtors till within these few years when the dead ruin released the living one the present churchyard and the site of this castle are supposed to have been included within the limits of a castellum built by agricola of the fosse of which there are still some faint vestiges  beneath the brow on which the church and tower stand a brook flows through a narrow valley that winds about a mile and a half to the abbey in the way thither we passed the entrance of one of the very rich iron mines with which the neighborhood abounds and the deep red tint of the soil that overspreads almost the whole country between ulverston and the monastery sufficiently indicates the nature of the treasures beneath  in a close glen branching from this valley shrouded by winding banks clumped with old groves of oak and chestnut we found the magnificent remains of  furness abbey the deep retirement of its situation the venerable grandeur of its gothic arches and the luxuriant yet ancient trees that shadow this forsaken spot are circumstances of picturesque and if the expression may be allowed of sentimental beauty which fill the mind with solemn yet delightful emotion this glen is called the vale of nightshade or more literally from its ancient title bekangsgill the glen of deadly nightshade that plant being abundantly found in the neighborhood its romantic gloom and sequestered privacy particularly adapted it to the austerities of monastic life and in the most retired part of it king stephen while earl of mortaign and bulloign founded in the year      the magnificent monastery of furness and endowed it with princely wealth and almost princely authority in which it was second only to fontainsabbey in yorkshire  the windings of the glen conceal these venerable ruins till they are closely approached and the bye road that conducted us is margined with a few ancient oaks which stretch their broad branches entirely across it and are sinely preparatory objects to the scene beyond a sudden bend in this road brought us within view of the northern gate of the abbey a beautiful gothic arch one side of which is luxuriantly festooned with nightshade a thick grove of planetrees with some oak and beech overshadow it on the right and lead the eye onward to the ruins of the abbey seen through this dark arch in remote perspective over rough but verdant ground the principal features are the great northern window and part of the eastern choir with glimpses of shattered arches and stately walls beyond caught between the gaping casements on the left the bank of the glen is broken into knolls capped with oaks which in some places spread downwards to a stream that winds round the ruin and darken it with their rich foliage through this gate is the entrance to the immediate precincts of the abbey an area said to contain sixtyfive acres now called the deerpark it is enclosed by a stone wall on which the remains of many small buildings and the faint vestiges of others still appear such as the porters lodge mills granaries ovens and kilns that once supplied the monastery some of which seen under the shade of the fine old trees that on every side adorn the broken steeps of this glen have a very interesting effect  just within the gate a small manor house of modern date with its stables and other offices breaks discordantly upon the lonely grandeur of the scene except this the character of the deserted ruin is scrupulously preserved in the surrounding area no spade has dared to level the inequalities which fallen fragments have occasioned in the ground or shears to clip the wild fern and underwood that overspread it but every circumstance conspires to heighten the solitary grace of the principal object and to prolong the luxurious melancholy which the view of it inspires we made our way among the pathless fern and grass to the north end of the church now like every other part of the abbey entirely roofless but showing the lofty arch of the great window where instead of the painted glass that once enriched it are now tufted plants and wreaths of nightshade below is the principal door of the church bending into a deep round arch which retiring circle within circle is rich and beautiful the remains of a winding staircase are visible within the wall on its left side near this northern end of the edifice are seen one side of the eastern choir with its two slender gothic window frames and on the west a remnant of the nave of the abbey and some lofty arches which once belonged to the belfry now detached from the main building  to the south but concealed from this point of view are the chapter house some years ago exhibiting a roof of beautiful gothic sretwork and which was almost the only part of the abbey thus ornamented its architecture having been characterised by an air of grand simplicity rather than by the elegance and richness of decoration which in an after date distinguished the gothic style in england over the chapter house were once the library and scriptorium and beyond it are still the remains of cloisters of the refectory the locutorium or conversationroom and the calefactory these with the walls of some chapels of the vestry a hall and of what is believed to have been a schoolhouse are all the features of this noble edifice that can easily be traced winding staircases within the surprising thickness of the walls and doorcases involved in darkness and mystery the place abounds with  the abbey which was formerly of such magnitude as nearly to fill up the breadth of the glen is built of a palered stone dug from the neighboring rocks now changed by time and weather to a tint of dusky brown which accords well with the hues of plants and shrubs that every where emboss the mouldering arches  the finest view of the ruin is on the east side where beyond the vast shattered frame that once contained a richlypainted window is seen a perspective of the choir and of distant arches remains of the nave of the abbey closed by the woods this perspective of the ruin is antiquities of furness said to be two hundred and eightyseven feet in length the choir part of it is in width only twentyeight feet inside but the nave is seventy the walls as they now stand are fiftyfour feet high and in thickness five southward from the choir extend the still beautiful though broken pillars and arcades of some chapels now laid open to the day the chapter house the cloisters and beyond all and detached from all is the schoolhouse a large building the only part of the monastery that still boasts a roof  as soothed by the venerable shades and the view of a more venerable ruin we rested opposite to the eastern window of the choir where once the high altar stood and with five other altars assisted the religious pomp of the scene the images and the manners of times that were past rose to reflection the midnight procession of monks clothed in white and bearing lighted tapers appeared to the minds eye issuing to the choir through the very doorcase by which such processions were wont to pass from the cloisters to perform the matin service when at the moment of their entering the church the deep chanting of voices was heard and the organ swelled a solemn peal to fancy the strain still echoed feebly along the arcades and died in the breeze among the woods the rustling leaves mingling with the close it was easy to image the abbot and the officiating priests seated beneath the richlyfretted canopy of the four stalls that still remain entire in the southern wall and high over which is now perched a solitary yewtree a black funereal memento to the living of those who once sat below  of a quadrangular court on the west side of the church three hundred and thirtyfour feet long and one hundred and two feet wide little vestige now appears except the foundation of a range of cloisters that formed its western boundary and under the shade of which the monks on days of high solemnity passed in their customary procession round the court what was the belfry is now a huge mass of detached ruin picturesque from the loftiness of its shattered arches and the high inequalities of the ground within them where the tower that once crowned this building having fallen lies in vast fragments now covered with earth and grass and no longer distinguishable but by the hillock they form  the schoolhouse a heavy structure attached to the boundary wall on the south is nearly entire and the walls particularly of the portal are of enormous thickness but here and there a chasm discloses the staircases that wind within them to chambers above the schoolroom below shows only a stone bench that extends round the walls and a low stone pillar in the eastern corner on which the teachers pulpit was formerly fixed the lofty vaulted roof is scarcely distinguishable by the dusky light admitted through one or two narrow windows placed high from the ground perhaps for the purpose of consining the scholars attention to his book  these are the principal features that remain of this once magnificent abbey it was dedicated to st mary and received a colony of monks from the monastery of savigny in normandy who were called gray monks from their dress of that color till they became cistercians and with the severe rules of st bernard adopted a white habit which they retained till the dissolution of monastic orders in england the original rules of st bernard partook in several instances of the austerities of those of la trapp and the society did not very readily relinquish the milder laws of st benedict for the new rigours imposed upon them by the parent monastery of savigny they were forbidden to taste flesh except when ill and even eggs butter cheese and milk but on extraordinary occasions and denied even the use of linen and fur the monks were divided into two classes to which separate departments belonged those who attended the choir slept upon straw in their usual habits from which at midnight they rose and passed into the church where they continued their holy hymns during the short remainder of the night after this first mass having publicly confessed themselves they retired to their cells and the day was employed in spiritual exercises and in copying or illuminating manuscripts an unbroken silence was observed except when after dinner they withdrew into the locutorium where for an hour perhaps they were permitted the common privilege of social beings this class was consined to the boundary wall except that on some particular days the members of it were allowed to walk in parties beyond it for exercise and amusement but they were very seldom permitted either to receive or pay visits like the monks of la trapp however they were distinguished for extensive charities and liberal hospitality for travelers were so scrupulously entertained at the abbey that it was not till the dissolution that an inn was thought necessary in this part of furness when one was opened for their accommodation expressly because the monastery could no longer receive them  to the second class were assigned the cultivation of the lands and the performance of domestic affairs in the monastery  this was the second house in england that received the bernardine rules the most rigorous of which were however dispensed with in      by sixtus the fourth when among other indulgences the whole order was allowed to taste meat on three days of the week with the rules of st benedict the monks had exchanged their gray habit for a white cassock with a white caul and scapulary but their choir dress was either white or gray with caul and scapulary of the same and a girdle of black wool over that a mozet or hood and a rochet antiquities of furness  when they went abroad they wore a caul and full black hood  the privileges and immunities granted to the cistercian order in general were very abundant and those to the abbey of furness were proportioned to its vast endowments the abbot it has been mentioned held his secular court in the neighboring castle of dalton where he presided with the power of administering not only justice but injustice since the lives and property of the villain tenants of the lordship of furness were consigned by a grant of king stephen to the disposal of my lord abbot the monks also could be arraigned for whatever crime only by him the military establishment of furness likewise depended on the abbot every mesne lord and free homager as well as the customary tenants took an oath of fealty to the abbot to be true to him against all men excepting the king every mesne lord obeyed the summons of the abbot or his steward in raising his quota of armed men and every tenant of a whole tenement furnished a man and horse of war for guarding the coast for the borderservice or any expedition against the common enemy of the king and kingdom the habiliments of war were a steel coat or coat of mail a falce or falchion a jack the bow the bill the crossbow and spear the furness legion consisted of four divisions  one of bowmen horsed and harnessed bylmen horsed and harnessed bowmen without horse and harness bylmen without horse and harness ibid   the deep forests that once surrounded the abbey and overspread all furness contributed with its insulated situation on a neck of land running out into the sea to secure it from the depredations of the scots who were continually committing hostilities on the borders on a summit over the abbey are the remains of a beacon or watchtower raised by the society for their further security it commands extensive views over low furness and the bay of the sea immediately beneath looking forward to the town and castle of lancaster appearing faintly on the opposite coast on the south to the isles of wanley foulney and their numerous islets on one of which stands peelcastle and on the north to the mountains of high furness and coniston rising in grand amphitheatre round this inlet of the irish channel description can scarcely suggest the full magnificence of such a prospect to which the monks emerging from their concealed cells below occasionally resorted to sooth the asperities which the severe discipline of superstition inflicted on the temper or freed from the observance of jealous eyes to indulge perhaps the sigh of regret which a consideration of the world they had renounced thus gloriously given back to their sight would sometimes awaken  from hawcoat a few miles to the west of furness the view is still more extensive whence in a clear day the whole length of the isle of man may be seen with part of anglesey and the mountains of caernarvon merionethshire denbighshire and flintshire shadowing the opposite horizon of the channel  the sum total of all rents belonging to the abbey immediately before the dissolution was    l  s  0d collected from lancashire cumberland and even from the isle of man a sum which considering the value of money at that period and the woods meadows pastures and sisheries retained by the society in their own hands the quantity of provisions for domestic use brought by the tenants instead of rent and the shares of mines mills and saltworks which belonged to the abbey swells its former riches to an enormous amount  pyle the last abbot surrendered with twentynine monks to henry the eighth april the  th      and in return was made rector of dalton a situation then valued at thirtythree pounds six shillings and eightpence a year  from ulverston to lancaster from the abbey we returned to ulverston and from thence crossed the sands to lancaster a ride singularly interesting and sublime from the carters house which stands on the edge of the ulverston sands and at the point whence passengers enter them to lancaster within the furthest opposite shore is fifteen miles this noble bay is interrupted by the peninsula of cartmel extending a line of white rocky coast that divides the leven and ulverston sands from those of lancaster the former are four miles over the latter seven  we took the early part of the tide and entered these vast and desolate plains before the sea had entirely left them or the morning mists were sufficiently dissipated to allow a view of distant objects but the grand sweep of the coast could be faintly traced on the left and a vast waste of sand stretching far below it with mingled streaks of gray water that heightened its dreary aspect the tide was ebbing fast from our wheels and its low murmur was interrupted first only by the shrill small cry of seagulls unseen whose hovering flight could be traced by the sound near an island that began to dawn through the mist and then by the hoarser croaking of seageese which took a wider range for their shifting voices were heard from various quarters of the surrounding coast the body of the sea on the right was still involved and the distant mountains on our left that crown the bay were also viewless but it was sublimely interesting to watch the heavy vapors beginning to move then rolling in lengthening volumes over the scene and as they gradually dissipated discovering through their veil the various objects they had concealed  fishermen with carts and nets stealing along the margin of the tide little boats putting off from the shore and the view still enlarging as the vapors expanded the main sea itself softening into the horizon with here and there a dim sail moving in the hazy distance the wide desolation of the sands on the left was animated only by some horsemen riding remotely in groups toward lancaster along the winding edge of the water and by a musclefisher in his cart trying to ford the channel we were approaching  the coast round the bay was now distinctly though remotely seen rising in woods white cliffs and cultivated slopes toward the mountains of furness on whose dark brows the vapors hovered the shore falls into frequent recesses and juts out in promontories where villages and country seats are thickly strewn among the latter holkerhall deep among woods stands in the north the village and hall of bardsea once the site of a monastery with a rocky background and in front meadows falling toward the water and conishead priory with its spiry woods the paragon of beauty lie along the western coast where the hills swelling gently from the isle of walney nearly the last point of land visible on that side the bay and extending to the north sweep upwards toward the fells of high furness and the whole assemblage of westmoreland mountains that crown the grand boundary of this arm of the sea  we set out rather earlier than was necessary for the benefit of the guide over part of these trackless wastes who was going to his station on a sand near the first ford where he remains to conduct passengers across the united streams of the rivers crake and leven till the returning tide washes him off he is punctual to the spot as the tides themselves where he shivers in the dark comfortless midnights of winter and is scorched on the shadeless sands under the noons of summer for a stipend of ten pounds a year and he said that he had fulfilled the office for thirty years he has however perquisites occasionally from the passengers in early times the prior of conishead who established the guide paid him with three acres of land and an annuity of fifteen marks at the dissolution henry the eighth charged himself and his successors with the payment of the guide by patent  near the first ford is chapel isle on the right from ulverston a barren sand where are yet some remains of a chapel built by the monks of furness in which divine service was daily performed at a certain hour for passengers who crossed the sands with the morning tide the ford is not thought dangerous though the sands frequently shift for the guide regularly tries for and ascertains the proper passage the stream is broad and of formidable appearance spreading rapidly among the sands and when you enter it seeming to bear you away in its course to the sea the second ford is beyond the peninsula of cartmel on the lancaster sands and is formed by the accumulated waters of the rivers ken and winster where another guide waits to receive the traveller  the shores of the lancaster sands fall back to greater distance and are not so bold or the mountains beyond so awful as those of ulverston but they are various often beautiful and arnsidefells have a higher character the town and castle of lancaster on an eminence gleaming afar off over the level sands and backed by a dark ridge of rocky heights look well as you approach them thither we returned and concluded a tour which had afforded infinite delight in the grandeur of its landscapes and a reconciling view of human nature in the simplicity integrity and friendly disposition of the inhabitants  finis
