the school for lovers a comedy  as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  by william whitehead esquire poet laureat  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall and sold by j hinxman in paternoster row  mdcclxii  price one shilling and sixpence  advertisement the following comedy is formed on a plan of monsieur de fontenelles never intended for the stage and printed in the eighth volume of his works under the title of le testament  the scene of that piece is laid in greece and the embarrassing circumstances depend on some peculiarities in the customs of that country slaves likewise as is usual in the grecian comedy act as confidantes to the principal personages the author therefore hopes he may be excused for having made the story english and his own for having introduced a new character and endeavored to heighten those he found already sketched out the delicacy of the sentiments in philonoe and eudamidas he has inviolably adhered to wherever he could insert them properly in his caelia and sir john dorilant and would willingly flatter himself that he has made great and not contemptible additions to their characters as well as to the others  those who will give themselves the trouble to read both pieces will see where the author is or is not indebted to that elegant french writer  to the memory of monsieur de fontenelle this comedy is inscribed by a lover of simplicity  the author  prologue as it was intended to have been spoken success makes people vain  the maxims true we all confess it  and not over new the veriest clown who stumps along the streets and doffs his hat to each grave cit he meets some twelvemonths hence bedaubd with livery lace shall thrust his saucy flambeau in your face not so our bard though twice your kind applause has on this fickle spot espoused his cause he owns with gratitude the obliging debt has twice been favored and is modest yet plain tragedy his first adventurous care spoke to your hearts and found an echo there plain comedy tonight with strokes refined would catch the coyest features of the mind would play politely with your hopes and fears and sometimes smiles provoke and sometimes tears your giant wits like those of old may climb olympus high and step over space and time may stride with sevenleagud boots from shore to shore and nobly by transgressing charm you more alas our author dares not laugh at schools plain sense confines his humbler muse to rules formed on the classic scale his structures rise he shifts no scenes to dazzle and surprise in one poor gardens solitary grove like the primaeval pair his lovers rove and in due time will each transaction pass  unless some hasty critic shakes the glass prologue as it is spoken by mr garrick success makes people vain  the maxims true  we all confess it  and not over new the veriest clown who stumps along the streets and doffs his hat to each grave cit he meets some twelvemonths hence bedaubd with livery lace shall thrust his saucy flambeau in your face not so our bard  though twice your kind applause has on this fickle spot espoused his cause he owns with gratitude the obliging debt has twice been favored and is modest yet your giant wits like those of old may climb olympus high and step over space and time may stride with sevenleagud boots from shore to shore and nobly by transgressing charm ye more alas our author dares not laugh at schools  plain sense confines his humbler muse to rules he shifts no scenes  but here i stopped him short  not change your scenes said i  i am sorry for it my constant friends above around below have english tastes and love both change and show without such aids even shakespeare would be flat  our crowded pantomimes are proofs of that what eager transport stares from every eye when pullies rattle and our genii fly when tin cascades like falling waters gleam or through the canvas  bursts the real stream while thirsty islington laments in vain half her newriver rolled to drury lane lord sir said i for gallery boxes pit i will back my harlequin against your wit  yet still the author anxious for his play shook his wise head  what will the critics say as usual sir  abuse you all they can  and what the ladies  he is a charming man a charming piece  one scarce knows what it means but that is no matter  where there is such sweet scenes still he persists  and let him  enter nous  i know your tastes and will indulge em too change you shall have so set your hearts at ease write as he will well act it as you please persons represented sir john dorilant a man of nice honor guardian to caelia mr garrick modely men of the town mr palmer belmour men of the town mr obrien an old steward to sir john dorilant mr castle footman to sir john dorilant mr fox lady beverley a widow lady mother to caelia mrs clive caelia daughter to lady beverley and ward to sir john mrs cibber araminta sister to sir john dorilant mrs yates scene a garden belonging to sir john dorilants house in the country with an arbor garden chairs etc  the school for lovers act i scene the garden enter araminta with an affected carelessness and knotting modely following modely but madam   araminta but sir what can possibly have alarmed you thus you see me quite unconcerned i only tell you in a plain simple narrative manner  this plaguey thread  and merely by way of conversation that you are in love with caelia and where is the mighty harm in all this   modely the harm in it madam have i not told you a thousand and a thousand times that you were the only woman who could possibly make me happy   araminta why aye to be sure you have and sworn a thousand and a thousand oaths to confirm that assertion   modely and am not i here now expressly to marry you   araminta why that too is true  but  you are in love with caelia   modely bless me madam what can i say to you if it had not been for my attendance upon you i had never known caelia or her mother either though they are both my relations the mother has since indeed put some kind of confidence in me she is a widow you know    araminta and wants consolation the poor orphan too her daughter well charity is an excellent virtue i never considered it in that light before you are vastly charitable mr modely   modely it is impossible to talk with you  if you will not do me justice do it to yourself at least is there any comparison betwixt you and caelia could any man of sense hesitate a moment she has yet no character one does not know what she is or what she will be a chit a green girl of fourteen or fifteen   araminta seventeen at least  i cannot undo this knot    modely well let her be seventeen would any man of judgment attach himself to a girl of that age of my soul if one was to make love to her she would hardly understand what one meant   araminta girls are not quite so ignorant as you may imagine mr modely caelia will understand you take my word for it and does understand you as to your men of judgment and sense here is my brother now i take him to be full as reasonable as yourself and somewhat older and yet with all his philosophy he has brought himself to a determination at last to fulfill the fathers will and marry this green girl i am sorry to tell you so mr modely but he will certainly marry her   modely let him marry her i should perhaps do it myself if i was in his place he was an intimate friend of her fathers she is a great fortune and was given to him by will but do you imagine my dear araminta that if he was left to his own choice without any bias he would not rather have a woman nearer his own years he might almost be her father   araminta that is true but you will find it difficult to persuade me that youth in a woman is so insurmountable an objection i fancy mr modely it may be got over suppose i leave you to think of it  i cannot get this right  going   modely stay dear araminta why will you plague me thus your own charms my earnestness might prove to you    araminta i tell you i dont want proofs   modely well well you shall have none then but give me leave to hope since you have done me the honor to be a little uneasy on my account    araminta uneasy  i uneasy  what does the man mean i was a little concerned indeed to give you uneasiness by informing you of my brothers intended marriage with caelia but  this shuttle bends so abominably   modely thou perplexing tyrant nay you shall not go  may i continue to adore you you must not forbid me that   araminta for my part i neither command nor forbid any thing only this i would have you remember i have quick eyes your servant  i wish this knotting had never come in fashion   exit araminta modely quick eyes indeed i thought my cunning here had been a master piece the girl cannot have told sure and the mother is entirely on my side they certainly were those inquisitive eyes she speaks of which have found out this secret well i must be more cautious for the future and act the lover to araminta ten times stronger than ever one would not give her up till one was sure of succeeding in the other place   enter belmour from behind with a book in his hand belmour ha ha ha well said modely   modely starting belmour how the duce came you here   belmour how came i here  how came you here  if you come to that a man cannot retire from the noise and bustle of the world to admire the beauties of the spring and read pastoral in an arbor but impertinent lovers must disturb his meditations  thou art the errantest hypocrite modely    throwing away the book modely hypocrite  my dear friend we men of gallantry must be so  but have a care we may have other listeners for aught i know who may not be so proper for confidantes looking about   belmour you may be easy on that head we have the garden to ourselves the widow and her daughter are just gone in and sir john is busy with his steward   modely the widow and her daughter why were they in the garden   belmour they just came into it but upon seeing you and araminta together they turned back again   modely on seeing me and araminta i hope i have no jealousies there too however i am glad caelia knows i am in the garden because it may probably induce her to fall in my way by chance you know and give me an opportunity of talking to her   belmour do you think she likes you   modely she does not know what she does   belmour do you like her   modely why faith i think i do   belmour why then do you pursue your affair with araminta and not find some honorable means of breaking off with her   modely that might not be quite so expedient i think araminta the finest woman and caelia the prettiest girl i know now they are both good fortunes and one of them i am resolved to have but which    belmour your great wisdom has not yet determined thou art undoubtedly the vainest fellow living  i thought you brought me down here now to your wedding   modely egad i thought so too but this plaguey little rustic has disconcerted all my schemes sir john you know by her fathers will may marry her if he pleases and she forfeits her estate if she marries any one else now i am contriving to bring it about that i may get her and her fortune too   belmour a very likely business truly so you modestly expect that sir john dorilant should give up his mistress and then throw her fortune into the batgain as an additional reward to the obliging man who has seduced her from him   modely hum why i dont expect quite that but you know belmour he is a man of honor and would not force her inclinations though he loved her to distraction  come come he is quite a different creature from what you and i are   belmour speak for yourself good sir yet why should you imagine that her inclinations are not as likely to fix upon him as you he has a good person and is scarce older than yourself   modely that shows your ignorance i am ten years younger than he is my dress and the company i keep give a youth and vivacity to me which he must always want ant i a man of the town o that town belmour could i but have met these ladies there i had done the business   belmour were they never there   modely never  sir harry beverley the father of this girl lived always in the country and divided his time between his books and his hounds his wife and daughter seldom mixed with people of their own rank but at a horserace or a rural visit and see the effects the girl though she is naturally genteel has an air of simplicity   belmour but does not want sense   modely no no  she has a devilish deal of that kind of sense which is acquired by early reading i have heard her talk occasionally like a queen in a tragedy or at least like a sentimental lady in a comedy much above your misses of thirty in town i assure you  as to the mother  but she is a character and explains herself   belmour yes yes i have read her but pray how came it to pass that the father who was of a different way of thinking in regard to party should have left sir john guardian to his daughter with the additional clause too of her being obliged to marry him   modely why that is somewhat surprising but the truth of the case was they were thoroughly acquainted and each considered party as the foible of the other sir harry thought a good husband his daughters best security for happiness and he knew it was impossible sir john dorilant should prove a bad one   belmour and yet this prospect of happiness would you destroy   modely no no i only see farther than sir harry did and would increase that happiness by giving her a better husband   belmour o your humble servant sir   modely besides the mother is entirely in my interest and by the by has a hankering after sir john herself he is a sober man and should have a woman of discretion for his wife not a hoydening girl  egad belmour suppose you attacked the widow the woman is young enough and has an excellent jointure   belmour and so became your fatherinlaw   modely you will have an admirable opportunity tonight we are to have the fiddles you know and you may dance with her  when music softens and when dancing fires eh belmour   belmour you are vastly kind to sir john and would ease him i find of both his mistresses but suppose this man of honor should be fool enough to resign his mistress may not another kind of honor oblige him to run you through the body for deserting his sister   modely why faith it may however it is not the first duel i have fought on such an occasion so i am his man not that it is impossible but he may have scruples there too   belmour you dont think him a coward   modely i know he is not but your reasoning men have strange distinctions they are quite different creatures as i told you from you and i   belmour you are pleased to compliment but suppose now as irrational as you think me i should find out a means to make this whole affair easy to you   modely how do you mean   belmour not by attacking the widow but by making my addresses in good earnest to araminta   modely i forbid that absolutely   belmour what do you think it possible i should succeed after the accomplished mr modely   modely why faith between you and i i think not but i dont choose to hazard it   belmour then you love her still   modely i confess it   belmour and it is nothing upon earth but that insatiable vanity of yours with a little tincture of avarice that leads you a gadding thus   modely i plead guilty but be it as it will i am determined to pursue my point and see where the little rogue comes most opportunely i told you she would be here go go belmour you must not listen to all my love scenes exit belmour now for a serious face a little upon the tragic young girls are mighty fond of despairing lovers   enter caelia caelia with an affected surprise mr modely  are you here  i am come to meet my mama  i did not think to find you here   modely are you sorry to find me here madam   caelia why should i be sorry mr modely   modely may i hope you are pleased with it   caelia i have no dislike to company   modely but is all company alike surely one would choose ones companions would it have been the same thing to you if you had met sir john dorilant here   caelia i should be very ungrateful if i did not like sir john dorilants company i am sure i have all the obligations in the world to him and so had my poor papa sighing   modely whatever were your papas obligations his gratitude i am sure was unbounded  o that i had been his friend   caelia why should you wish that mr modely  you would have had a great loss in him   modely i believe i should but i might likewise have had a consolation for that loss which would have contained in it all earthly happiness   caelia i dont understand you   modely he might have left his caelia to me   caelia dear how you talk   modely talk madam  o i could talk for ever would you but listen to my hearts soft language nor cruelly affect to disbelieve when i declare i love you   caelia love me mr modely  are not you in love with araminta   modely i once thought i was   caelia and do lovers ever change   modely not those who feel a real passion but there are false alarms in love which the unpractised heart sometimes mistakes for true ones   caelia and were yours such for araminta   modely alas i feel they were looking earnestly at her   caelia you dont intend to marry her then i hope   modely do you hope i should not marry her   caelia to be sure i do i would not have the poor lady deceived and i would willingly have a better opinion of mr modely than to believe him capable of making false protestations   modely to you he never could   caelia to me  i am out of the question  but i am sorry for araminta for i believe she loves you   modely if you can pity those who love in vain why am not i an object of compassion   caelia dear mr modely why will you talk thus my hand you know is destined to sir john dorilant and my duty there does not even permit me to think of other lovers   modely happy happy man yet give me leave to ask one question madam  i dread to do it though my last glimpse of happiness depends upon your answer   caelia what question  nay pray speak i entreat it of you   modely then tell me lovely caelia sincerely tell me were your choice left free and did it depend upon you only to determine who should be the master of your affections might i expect one favorable thought   caelia after some hesitation it  it does not depend upon me   modely i know it does not but if it did   caelia come come mr modely i cannot talk upon this subject impossibilities are impossibilities  but i hope you will acquaint araminta instantly with this change in your inclinations   modely i would do it but i dare not   caelia you should break it first to sir john   modely my difficulty does not lie in the breaking it but if i confess my passion at an end i must no longer expect admittance into this family and i could still wish to talk to caelia as a friend   caelia indeed mr modely i should be loath myself to lose your acquaintance but  o here comes my mama she may put you in a method   enter lady beverley lady in any method my dear which decency and reserve will permit your servant cousin modely what you are talking strangely to this girl now  o you men   modely your ladyship knows the sincerity of my passion here   caelia with surprise knows your sincerity   lady well well what signifies what i know  you was mentioning some method i was to put you in   caelia mr modely madam has been confessing to me that he no longer loves araminta   lady hum  why such things may happen child we are not all able to govern our affections but i hope if he breaks off with her he will do it with decency   modely that madam is the difficulty   lady what  is it a difficulty to be decent fie fie mr modely   modely far be it from me even to think so madam before a person of your ladyships reserved behavior but considering how far i have gone in the affair    lady well well if that be all i may perhaps help you out and break it to sir john myself  not that i approve of roving affections i assure you   modely you bind me ever to you  but there is another cause which you alone can promote and on which my eternal happiness    lady leave us  leave us cousin modely i must not hear you talk in this extravagant manner  pushing him toward the scene and then aside to him  i shall bring it about better in your absence go go man go exit modely a pretty kind of a fellow really  now caelia come nearer child i have something of importance to say to you  what do you think of that gentleman   caelia of mr modely madam   lady ay mr modely my cousin modely   caelia think of him madam   lady ay think of him child you are old enough to think sure after the education i have given you well what answer do you make   caelia i really dont understand your ladyships question   lady not understand me child why i ask you how you like mr modely what should you think of him as a husband   caelia mr modely as a husband why surely madam sir john    lady fiddle faddle sir john sir john knows better things than to plague himself with a wife in leading strings   caelia is your ladyship sure of that   lady o ho would you be glad to have me sure of it   caelia i dont know what i should be glad of i would not give sir john a moments pain to be mistress of the whole world   lady but if it should be brought about without giving him pain hey caelia  patting her cheek with her fan   caelia i should be sorry for it   lady hey day   caelia for then he must think lightly of me   lady what does the girl mean come come i must enter roundly into this affair here here sit down and tell me plainly and honestly without equivocation or reservation is modely indifferent to you nay nay  look me in the face turn your eyes toward me one judges greatly by the eyes especially in a woman your poor papa used to say that my eyes reasoned better than my tongue  well and now tell me without blushing is modely indifferent to you   caelia i fear he is not madam and it is that which perplexes me   lady how do you feel when you meet him   caelia fluttered   lady hum  while you are with him   caelia fluttered   lady hum  when you leave him   caelia fluttered still   lady strong symptoms truly   caelia when sir john dorilant talks to me my heart is softened but not perplexed my esteem my gratitude overflows toward him i consider him as a kinder father with all the tenderness without the authority   lady but when mr modely talks   caelia my tranquillity of mind is gone i am pleased with hearing what i doubt is flattery and when he grasps my hand    lady well well i know all that  be decent child  you need say no more mr modely is the man rising   caelia but dear madam there are a thousand obstacles  i am afraid sir john loves me i am sure he esteems me and i would not forfeit his esteem for the universe i am certain i can make him an affectionate and an humble wife and i think i can forget mr modely   lady forget a fiddle dont talk to me of forgetting i order you on your duty not to forget mr modely is and shall be the man you may trust my prudence for bringing it about i will talk with sir john instantly  i know what you are going to say but i will not hear a word of it can you imagine caelia that i shall do any thing but with the utmost decency and decorum   caelia i know you will not madam but there are delicacies    lady with which i am unacquainted to be sure and my daughter must instruct me in them pray caelia where did you learn this nicety of sentiments who was it that inspired them   caelia but the maxims of the world    lady are altered i suppose since i was of your age poor thing what world have thou seen notwithstanding your delicacies and your maxims sir john perhaps may be wiser than you imagine and choose a wife of somewhat more experience   caelia may he be happy wherever he chooses  but dear madam    lady again dont make me angry i will positively not be instructed ay you may well blush  nay no tears  come come caelia i forgive you i had idle delicacies myself once lard i remember when your poor papa  he he he  but we have no time for old stories what would you say now if sir john himself should propose it and persuade the match and yet continue as much your friend as ever nay become more so a nearer friend   caelia in such a case madam    lady i understand you and will about it instantly bye caelia o how its little heart flutters   exit lady caelia it does indeed a nearer friend i hardly know whether i should wish her success or not  sir john is so affectionate would i had never seen mr modely  araminta too what will she say  o i see a thousand bad consequences i must follow her and prevent them   end of the first act act ii scene continues lady beverley and modely lady prithee dont teize me so i vow cousin modely you are almost as peremptory as my daughter she truly was teaching me decorum just now and plaguing me with her delicacies and her stuff i tell you sir john will be in the garden immediately this is always his hour of walking and when he comes i shall lay the whole affair before him with all its concatenation of circumstances and i warrant you bring it about   modely i have no doubt madam of the transcendency of your ladyships rhetoric it is on that i entirely rely but i must beg leave to hint that araminta already suspects my passion and should it be openly declared would undoubtedly prevail that instant with her brother to forbid me the house   lady why that might be   modely and though i told your daughter i did not care how soon it came to an eclaircisment yet a woman of your ladyships penetration and knowledge of the world must see the necessity of concealing it at least for a time i beg pardon for offering what may have even the distant appearance of instruction but it is sir johns delicacy which must be principally alarmed with apprehensions of her disregard for him and i am sure your ladyships manner of doing it will show him where he might much better place his affections and with an undoubted prospect of happiness   lady ay now you talk to the purpose  but stay is not that sir john coming this way  it is i vow and araminta with him well turn down this walk and reason the affair a little more and then i will come round the garden upon him  modely takes her hand to lead her out you are very gallant cousin modely exeunt   enter sir john dorilant and araminta araminta what do you drag me into the garden for we were private enough where we were  and i hate walking   sir john forgive me my dear sister i am restless every where my head and heart are full of nothing but this lovely girl   araminta my dear dear brother you are enough to spoil any woman in the universe i tell you again and again the girl is a good girl an excellent girl and will make an admirable wife you may trust one woman in her commendations of another we are not apt to be too favorable in our judgments especially when there is beauty in the case   sir john you charm me when you talk thus if she is really all this how happy must the man be who can engage her affections but alas araminta in every thing which regards me it is duty not love which actuates her behavior she steals away my very soul by her attentions but never once expresses that heartfelt tenderness those sympathetic feelings   araminta ha  ha  ha  o my stars  sympathetic feelings  why would you have a girl of her age have those sympathetic feelings as you call them if she had take my word for it she would coquet it with half the fellows in town before she had been married a twelvemonth besides sir john you dont consider that you was her fathers friend she has been accustomed from her infancy to respect you in that light and our fathers friends you know are always old people gray beards philosophers enemies to youth and the destruction of gayety   sir john but i was never such   araminta you may imagine so but you always had a grave turn i hated you once myself   sir john dear araminta   araminta i did as i hope to live for many a time has your aversion to dancing hindered me from having a fiddle  by the by remember we are to have the fiddles tonight  but let that pass as the case now stands if i was not already so near akin to you you have the temper in the world which i should choose in a husband   sir john that is obliging however   araminta not so very obliging perhaps neither it would be merely for my own sake for then would i have the appearance of the most obedient sympathetic wife in the universe and yet be as despotic in my government as an eastern monarch and when i grew tired as i probably should do of a want of contradiction why i should find an easy remedy for that too  i could break your heart in about a month   sir john dont trifle with me it is your serious advice i want give it me honestly as a friend and tenderly as a sister   araminta why i have done it fifty times what can i say more if you will have it again you must this then it is in plain terms  but you are sure you are heartily in love with her   sir john pshaw   araminta well then that we will take for granted and now you want to know what is right and proper for you to do in the case why was i in your place i should make but short work with it she knows the circumstances of her fathers will therefore would i go immediately to her tell her how my heart stood inclined and hope she had no objections to comply with what it is not in her power to refuse   sir john you would not have me talk thus abruptly to her   araminta indeed i would it will save a world of trouble she will blush perhaps at first and look a little awkward and by the by so will you too but if she is the girl i take her for after a little irresolute gesture and about five minutes conversation she will drop you a curtesy with the demure humility of a vestal and tell you it shall be as you and her mama pleases   sir john o that it were come to that   araminta and pray what hinders it nothing upon earth but your consummate prudence and discretion   sir john i cannot think of marrying her till i am sure she loves me   araminta lud lud  why what does that signify if she consents is not that enough   sir john her gratitude may induce her to consent rather than make me unhappy   araminta you would absolutely make a woman mad   sir john why could you think of marrying a man who had no regard for you   araminta the case is widely different my good casuistical brother and perhaps i could not  unless i was very much in love with him   sir john and could you then   araminta yes i could  to tell you the truth i believe i shall   sir john what do you mean   araminta i shall not tell you  you have business enough of your own upon your hands   sir john have you any doubts of modely   araminta i shall keep them to myself if i have for you are a wretched counselor in a love case   sir john but dear araminta    araminta but dear sir john dorilant you may make yourself perfectly easy for you shall positively know nothing of my affairs as to your own if you do not instantly resolve to speak to caelia i will go and talk to her myself   sir john stay lady beverley is coming toward us   araminta and has left my swain yonder by himself   sir john suppose i break it to her   araminta it is not a method which i should advise but do as you please  i know that horrid womans sentiments very exactly and i shall be glad to have her teized a little aside  i will give you an opportunity by leaving you and so adieu my dear sentimental brother  well change partners if you please madam  to lady beverley as she enters  and then exit to modely   lady beverley poor mistaken creature how fond the thing is   aside and looking after araminta your servant sir john   sir john your ladyships most obedient  after some irresolute gesture on both sides  lady beverley speaks   lady i  i  have wanted an opportunity of speaking to you sir john a great while   sir john and i madam have long had an affair of consequence to propose to your ladyship   lady an affair of consequence to me  o lud  you will please to speak sir   sir john not till i have heard your ladyships commands   lady what must women speak first fie sir john  looking languishingly  well then the matter in short is this i have been long thinking how to dispose of my girl properly she is grown a woman you see and though i who am her mother say it has her allurements   sir john uncommon ones indeed   lady now i would willingly consult with you how to get her well married before she is tainted with the indecorums of the world   sir john it was the very subject which i proposed speaking to you upon  i am sorry to put your ladyship in mind of a near and dear loss  but you remember sir harrys will   lady yes yes i remember it very well poor man it was undoubtedly the only weak thing he was ever guilty of   sir john madam   lady i say sir john we must pardon the sailings of our deceased friends indeed his affection for his child excuses it   sir john excuses it   lady yes indeed does it his fondness for her might naturally make him wish to place her with a person of your known excellence of character for my own part had i died i should have wished it myself  i dont believe you have your equal in the world  nay dear sir john it is no compliment  this i say might make him not attend to the impropriety of the thing and the reluctance a gentleman of your good sense and judgment must undoubtedly have to accede to so unsuitable a treaty especially as he could not but know there were women of discretion in the world who would be proud of an alliance where the prospect of felicity was so inviting and unquestionable   sir john who had appeared uneasy all the time she was speaking what women madam i know of none   lady sir john  that is not quite so complaisant methinks  to our sex i mean   sir john i beg your pardon madam i hardly know what i say your ladyship has disconcerted every thing i was going to propose to you   lady bless me sir john  i disconcerted every thing how pray i have been only talking to you in an open friendly manner with regard to my daughter our daughter indeed i might call her for you have been a father to her the girl herself always speaks of you as such   sir john speaks of me as a father   lady why more unlikely things have happened sir john   sir john than what madam   lady dear sir john  you put such peremptory questions you might easily understand what one meant methinks   sir john i find madam i must speak plain at once  know then my heart my soul my every thought of happiness is fixed upon that lovely girl   lady o astonishing well miracles are not ceased that is certain but every body they say must do a foolish thing once in their lives  and can you really and seriously think of putting sir harrys will in execution   sir john would i could   lady to be sure the girl has a fine fortune   sir john fortune i despise it i would give it with all my soul to any one who could engage me her affections  fortune dirt   lady i am thunderstruck    sir john turning eagerly to her o madam tell me sincerely tell me what method can i possibly pursue to make her think favorably of me you know her inmost soul you know the tender moments of address the easy avenues to her unpractised heart be kind and point them out grasping her hand   lady i vow sir john i dont know what to say to you  let go my hand  you talked of my disconcerting you just now i am sure you disconcert me with a witness  aside i did not think the man had so much rapture in him he squeezed my hand with such an emphasis i may gain him perhaps at last   sir john why will you not speak madam can you see me on the brink of desperation and not lend a friendly hand to my assistance   lady i have it  aside  alas sir john what signifies what i can do can i answer for the inclinations of a giddy girl   sir john you know she is not such her innocent mind is yet untainted with the follies of her sex and if a life devoted to her service without a wish but what regards her happiness can win her to be mine    lady why that might go a great way with an unprejudiced mind but when a first passion has taken place   sir john with amazement what do you mean   lady to tell you the truth i am afraid the girl is not so untainted as you imagine   sir john you distract me  how  when  whom can she have seen   lady undoubtedly there is a man   sir john tell me who that i may  no that i may give her to him and make her happy whatever becomes of me   lady that is generous indeed  so  so aside   sir john but it is impossible i have observed all her motions all her attentions with a lovers eye incapable of erring  yet stay  has any body written to her   lady there are no occasion for letters when people are in the same house together   sir john confusion   lady i was going to offer some proposals to you but your strange declaration stopped me short   sir john you proposals  you  are you her a better in the affair  o madam what unpardonable crime have i committed against you that you should thus conspire my ruin have not i always behaved to you like a friend a brother  i will not call you ungrateful   lady mercy on us  the man raves  how could it possibly enter into my head or the girls either that you had any serious thoughts of marrying her but i see you are too much discomposed at present to admit of calm reasoning so i shall take some other opportunity  friend  brother  ungrateful  marry come up  i hope at least you will not think of forcing the poor girls inclinations ungrateful indeed exit in a passion   sir john not for the universe  stay madam  she is gone  but it is no matter i am but little disposed for altercation now heigh ho  good heaven can so slight an intercourse have effected all this  i have scarce ever seen them together o that i had been born with belmours happy talents of address  address  it is absolute magic it is fascination  alas it is the rapidity of real passion  why did modely bring him hither to his wedding every thing has conspired against me he brought him and the delay of the lawyers has kept him here had i taken aramintas advice a poor fortnight ago it had not been in the power of fate to have undone me  and yet she might have seen him afterward which would at least have made her duty uneasy to her  heigh ho   enter araminta and modely araminta entering i tell you i heard them very loud and i will see what is the matter o here is my brother alone   sir john taking her tenderly by the hand o araminta  i am lost beyond redemption   araminta dear brother what can have happened to you   sir john turning to modely mr modely you could not intend it but you have ruined me   modely alarmed i sir john   sir john you have brought a friend with you who has pierced me to the very soul   modely belmour   sir john he has stolen my caelias affections from me   araminta looking slyly at modely belmour   modely this must he a mistake but i will humor it aside it cannot be who can have told you so   sir john her mother has been this instant with me to make proposals on the subject   modely for belmour   sir john she did not absolutely mention his name but i could not mistake it for she told me the favored lover was under the same roof with us   modely a little disconcerted i could not have believed it of him   araminta nor do i yet  looking slyly again at modely   modely there must certainly be some mistake in it at the worst i am sure i can prevail so far with belmour as to make him drop his pretensions   sir john you cannot make her cease to love him sighing   modely time may easily get the better of so young a passion   sir john never never she is too sincere too delicately sensible   modely come come you must not think so it is not yet gone so far but that it may be totally forgotten  now for a masterstroke to clench the whole  aside in the mean time sir john i have the satisfaction of acquainting you that my affair with aramintas leave draws very near a conclusion the lawyers have finished their papers and i only now wait for your perusal of them   araminta aside well said   modely i ordered the writings to be laid upon your table   araminta aside what does he mean   sir john dear mr modely you shall not wait a moment for me i will dispatch them instantly i feel the want of happiness too severely myself to postpone it in others i leave you with my sister when she names the day you may depend upon my concurrence exit sir john  modely and araminta look at one another for some time then he speaks i hope madam you are now convinced of my sincerity   araminta i am absolutely struck dumb with your assurance   modely with an affected surprise madam   araminta you cannot mean all this   modely why not madam   araminta why dont you know that i know    modely i cannot help a ladys knowledge or imaginations all i know is that it is in your power to make me either the happiest or most miserable man in the whole creation   araminta well this is astonishing   modely i am sorry madam that any unguarded behavior of mine any little playful gallantries should have occasioned surmises which    araminta serious as i hope to live   modely is it not enough to make one serious when the woman one has pursued for years almost with adoration is induced by mere appearances to doubt the honourableness of ones intentions have you not heard me this moment apply to your brother even in the midst of his uneasiness  i little expected where the difficulty would lie   araminta well well poor thing i will not teize it any longer here there take my hand   modely duped by jupiter  aside  o my everlasting treasure and when and when shall i be happy   araminta it shall depend upon yourself   modely tomorrow then my angel be the day o araminta i cannot speak my transport  and did you really think that i was in love with caelia   araminta why as a proof of my future sincerity i must confess i did   modely i wonder how you could   araminta come come there were grounds enough for a woman in love to go upon   modely taking her by the hand but you are now perfectly easy   araminta pulling her hand from him why yes i think i am  but what can my brother mean about belmour   modely it is some trick of the widows   araminta i dare say she meant you   modely possibly she might you know her motives   araminta yes yes her passion for my brother is pretty notorious but the wretch will be mistaken  tomorrow you say   modely tomorrow my adorable   araminta it shall be as you please  but my situation is so terribly awkward that i must break from you adieu exit araminta   modely upon my soul she is a fine woman and loves me to distraction and what is still more i most undoubtedly love her  i have a good mind to take her  yet not to have it in my power to succeed in the other place would call my parts in question  no no  i must not disparage my parts neither  in order to be a great character one should go as near being a rogue as possible i have a philosophers opinion on my side in that and the practice of half the heroes and politicians in europe   end of the second act act iii scene continues belmour alone caelia in love with me egad the thing is not impossible my friend modely may have been a little mistaken sir john was very serious when he told me of it and though i protested to him that i had never made the least advances he still persisted in his opinion  the girl must have have told him so herself  let me recollect a little  she is always extremely civil to me but that indeed she is to every body  i do not remember any thing particular in her looks but i shall watch them more narrowly the next time i see her  she is very handsome and yet in my opinion notwithstanding modelys infidelity araminta is much the finer woman  suppose  no that will not do   enter modely modely so so mr belmour i imagined i should find you here this is the lovers corner we have all had our reveries in it but why dont you talk louder man you ought at least to give me my revenge in that my soliloquies you know are easily overheard   belmour i never designedly overheard them mr modely nor did i make any improper use of the accident   modely grave very grave and perfectly moral and so this is all i am to have for the loss of my mistress  heigh ho  then i must be content to see her bless yon happier youth   belmour your raillery is a little unseasonable mr modely for to speak plainly i begin to suspect that this is some trick of yours to dupe me as well as sir john dorilant   modely upon my honor no if we must be serious it may be a mistake but not intended on my side i can assure you come come if the girl really likes you take her if i should prove the happy man give me joy and there is an end of it   belmour i fancy you are used to disappointments in love they sit so easy upon you or rather i should suppose in this case you are pretty sure of your ground   modely neither upon my soul but a certain je ne scai quoy a gayete de coeur which carries me above misfortunes some people call it vanity   belmour and are not absolutely mistaken but what becomes of araminta all this while   modely yawning i shall marry her i believe tomorrow   belmour marry her   modely yes sir john is at this very moment looking over the settlements   belmour i dont understand you   modely and yet it is pretty plain methinks i tell you i am to be married tomorrow was it not time to make sure of one mistress when you was running away with the other   belmour you know i have no such intentions  but are you really serious have you laid aside your designs upon caelia   modely not so neither   belmour what do you mean then by your marriage with araminta why will not you unriddle this affair to me   modely because it is at present a riddle to myself and i expect lady beverley here every moment to resolve the enigma   belmour was it a scheme of here is   modley certainly and i partly guess it but will not unbosom till i know it fully  come come with all that gravity of countenance and curiosity you must leave me instantly the lady will be here and the plot unravelled and then    belmour i shall expect to be satisfied exit   modely ha ha ha or else you fight me i suppose why so you may and so may sir john dorilant too and faith with some color of reason but my comfort is that i have experience on my side and if i survive the rencounter i shall be a greater hero than ever amongst the ladies and be esteemed in all companies as much a man of honor as the best of you   enter lady beverley lady dear cousin modely i am all over in an agitation we shall certainly be discovered that devil araminta    modely what of her madam   lady is now with her brother talking so eagerly  oh i saw the villainous changes in her countenance i would have given the world to have overheard their conversation  come come you must advise me instantly   modely your ladyship must first let me into the secret i am absolutely in a wood with regard to the whole affair what is all this of caelia and belmour   lady nothing nothing at all an errant dilemma of the foolish mans own making which his impertinent sister will immediately clear up to him and then all must out   modely but how came belmour ever to be mentioned in the case   lady dear dear he never was mentioned i must confess that i was so provoked with sir johns unnatural behavior that i could not help telling him that caelia had a lover and in the house too your situation with regard to araminta made him never dream of you and consequently all his suspicions turned on belmour   modely but you did not say that that lover had made his addresses to caelia   lady i dont know what i might say for he used me like a turk but whatever i said i can unsay it again   modely why if i might venture to advice a person of your ladys sagacity    lady o ay with all my heart cousin modely for though i may say it without vanity that nobody has a more clear apprehension of things when the mental faculty is totally undisturbed yet when i am in a trepidation nobody upon earth can be more glad of advice   modely why then madam to speak with reverence i should hope your ladyship would see the necessity of keeping me as concealed as possible it is the young ladys passion not mine which must have the principal influence sir john dorilants peculiarity of temper is such    lady yes yes he has peculiarity enough that is certain   modely and it is there madam as the weakest part that our attack will be the surest if she confesses an inclination for me not both the indies added to her fortune could induce him to marry her   lady that is honorable however cousin modely but he is a horrid creature notwithstanding   modely i grant it madam but a failure in an improper pursuit may recall his reason and as he does not want understanding teach him to search for happiness where only it is to be expected   lady he he i am so angry with him at present that i really believe i should refuse him   modely your ladyship must not be too cruel   lady why i confess it is not in my nature but  bless me here they come  let us run down this walk directly for they must not see us together exeunt   enter araminta and sir john dorilant araminta come along i say you dragged me into the garden just now and i will command in my turn talk to her you must and shall the girl has sense and spirit when she is disengaged from that horrid mother of here is and i have told her you wanted her and in this very spot   sir john you cannot feel araminta what you make me suffer but sooner or later it must come to this and therefore i will assume a resolution and be rid of all my doubts at once   araminta i tell you this nonsense about belmour is merely a phantom of her mothers raising to sound your intentions and promote her own   sir john thus far is certain that belmour disclaims all knowledge of the affair and with an appearance of sincerity but even that is doubtful besides they are not his but her inclinations which give me any concern it is the heart i require the lifeless form beauteous as it is would only elude my grasp the shadow of a joy not the reality   araminta dear dear that men had but a little common sense or that one could venture to tell them what one knows of ones own sex i have a good mind to be honest  as i live the girl is coming  i will speed her on the way courage brother voila exit   sir john how shall i begin with her  what idiots are men when they have a real passion ridiculous beneath contempt  walks about the stage  suppose  i will not suppose the honest heart shall speak its faithful dictates and if it fails  why let it   enter caelia caelia with timidity araminta tells me sir that you had something to say to me   sir john i have madam  come forward miss beverley  would you choose to sit  they sit down  after some irresolute gesture you are not afraid of catching cold   caelia not in the least sir   sir john i know sitting in the open air has that effect upon some people  but your youth and constitution  did my sister say any thing concerning the subject i would speak to you upon   caelia she only told me sir that it was of moment   sir john it is of moment indeed caelia  but you must not think that i am angry   caelia angry sir   sir john i dont mean angry  i am a little confused but i shall recover myself presently  rises and caelia rises too  nay pray sit miss beverley  whatever i feel myself i would not disturb you  returns to his seat then after a pause goes on  the affair i would speak to you upon is this  you remember your father perfectly   caelia and ever shall   sir john indeed he was a good man miss beverley a virtuous man and felt tenderly for your happiness  those tears become you and yet methinks i would not provoke them  when he died he left you to my care   caelia which alone made his loss supportable   sir john are you sincere in what you say   caelia i should be ungrateful indeed if i was not   sir john turning toward her nay you are sincerity itself  o caelia taking her by the hand  but i beg your pardon i am assuming a liberty i have no right to take till you allow it   caelia sir   sir john i see i have alarmed you  retire miss beverley  i will speak to you some other time  she is going  caelia miss beverley  pray come back my dear  i am afraid my behavior is rather too abrupt  perhaps too it may displease you   caelia i can be displeased with nothing from you sir and am ready to obey you be your commands what they will   sir john command caelia  that is a hard word   caelia i am sorry it offends you   sir john you know best caelia whether it ought to offend me  would i could read the sentiments of your heart mine are but too apparent  in short my dear you know the purport of your fathers will  dare you fulfill it   caelia to the minutest circumstance  it is my duty   sir john ah caelia that word duty destroys the obligation   caelia sir    sir john i dont know how it is but i am afraid to ask you the only question which sincerely answered could make me happy  or miserable half aside   caelia let me beg of you sir to ask it freely   sir john well then  is your heart your own  o caelia that hesitation confirms my fears you cannot answer in the affirmative and have too much humanity for what i feel to add to my torments  good god  and is it possible that an acquaintance of a few days should entirely obliterate the attentive assiduity the tender anxieties which i have shown for years  but i understand it all too well mine were the aweful though heartfelt attentions of a parent his the sprightly address of a presuming lover his easy assurance has won upon your affections and what i thought my greatest merit has undone me   caelia you were so good sir a little while ago to pity my confusion pity it now and whilst i lay my heart open before you be again that kind that generous friend which i have always found you   sir john go on   caelia it is in vain for me to dissemble an ignorance of your meaning nor would i if i could i own i have been too much pleased with mr modelys conversation   sir john modelys   caelia let me go on  his intended marriage with araminta gave him a freedom in this family which it was not my business to restrain his attentions to my mother and the friendly manner in which he executed some commissions of consequence to her gave him frequent opportunities of talking to me i will confess too that his appearance and his manner struck me but i was so convinced of his real passion for araminta that i never dreamt of the least attachment to me till    sir john till what when  modely  why he is to be married to my sister tomorrow or next day   caelia i know it was so intended but his behavior this morning and the intercessions of my mother had i own won upon me strangely and induced me to believe that i only was the object of his pursuits   sir john i am thunderstruck    caelia my mother made me clearly perceive that the completion of his marriage would be an injury to araminta she told me too sir that you yourself would be my adviser in the affair and even persuad me to accept it   sir john o the malicious woman   caelia in that indeed i perceive she greatly erred and i only mean this as a confession of what is past and of what is now at an end for ever  for the future i give myself to your guidance alone and am what you direct  giving her hand to him   sir john thou amiable softness  no caelia however miserable i may be myself i will not make you so it was your heart not your hand i aspired to as the former has been seduced from me it would be an injustice to us both to accept of the latter as to mr modely and lady beverley i have not deserved this treachery from them and they shall both feel my resentment   caelia sir   sir john she told me indeed there was a favored lover and my suspicions fell very naturally upon belmour nay even now nothing but that lovely sincerity  which undoes me  could make me credit this villainy of modely  o caelia what a heart have i lost   caelia you cannot shall not lose it worthless as it is it is yours and only yours my father guardian lover husband hangs upon him weeping   enter araminta araminta hey day what a scene is here what is the matter with ye both   sir john o sister that angel goodness that mirror of her sex has ruined me   araminta ruined you how   sir john nay i am not the only sufferer modely is as false to you as her mother is to all of us   araminta i dont understand you   sir john you will too soon my suspicions of belmour were all a chimaera it is your impious modely who has possession of her heart  to me she is lost irrecoverably  going   araminta stay brother   sir john i cannot my souls too full exit   araminta pray miss beverley what is the meaning of all this   caelia i cannot speak  throwing herself into a chair   araminta i will be hanged if this fellow modely has not talked you into an opinion that he is in love with you indeed my dear your youth and inexperience may lead you into strange scrapes and that mother of yours is enough to turn any girls head in the universe come come unriddle this affair to me   caelia alas madam all i know is that the only man i ever did or ever can esteem despises me and i fear hates me   araminta hates you he doats upon you to distraction  but pray did modely ever make any serious addresses to you   caelia alas but too often   araminta the hypocrite but i will be even with him  and your mother i suppose encouraged him an infamous woman but i know her drift well enough    enter lady beverley lady where is my poor girl i met sir john dorilant in such a furious way that he seems to have lost all common civility what have they done to you child   araminta done to her what has your ladyship done to her i knew your little artifices long ago but    lady my artifices mrs araminta   araminta your artifices lady beverley but they are all to no purpose the girl has too good an understanding to be imposed upon any longer and your boasted machinations are as vain and empty in their effect as in their contrivance   lady what does the woman mean but the loss of a lover i suppose is an excuse for illbreeding poor creature if the petulancy of thy temper would let me i could almost pity thee the loss of a lover is no agreeable thing but women at our time of life mrs araminta must not expect a lasting passion   araminta scarce any at all i believe if they go a wooing themselves for my part i have had the satisfaction of being solicited however and i am afraid my rustic brother never gave your ladyships solicitations even the slightest encouragement how was it did you find him quite hardhearted no bowels of compassion for so accomplished a damsel   caelia interposing dear madam dear araminta   lady stand away child  desert madam is not always attended with success nor confidence neither there are some women so assured of their conquest as even to disgust a lover on the very day of marriage   araminta was my behavior ever such   lady i really cannot say mrs araminta but the world you know is censorious enough when a match is broken off so near its conclusion as generally to charge the inconstancy of the lover on some defect in his mistress   araminta i defy him to produce any   lady and yet he has certainly left you never ah never to return   araminta insolent   caelia interposing again dear araminta   araminta but your ladyship may be mistaken even in that too i may find him at his solicitations again and if i do    lady you will take him   araminta take him  daggers and poison sooner   lady poor creature  come caelia words do but aggravate her misfortune we only disturb her you see my dear what are the effects of too violent a passion it may be a lesson for your future conduct   araminta look you lady beverley dont provoke me   lady why what will you do   caelia interposing for heavens sake madam    lady i fancy mrs araminta instead of quarrelling we had better join forces if we could but get this girl out of the way we might both succeed   araminta you are a wicked woman    lady poor creature shall i say any thing to my cousin modely for you you know i have weight with him   araminta yes madam you may tell him that his connections with you have rendered him ridiculous and that the revenge of an injured woman is never contemptible exit araminta   lady leading off caelia on the other side poor creature  come along child   end of the third act act iv scene continues sir john dorilant alone this fatal spot which draws me to it almost involuntarily must be the scene of another interview  thank heaven i have recovered myself nor shall any misery which i may suffer much less any prospect of a mean revenge make me act unbecoming my character   enter araminta araminta well brother i hope you are resolved to marry this girl   sir john marry her my dear araminta can you think it possible that i should have so preposterous a thought no my behavior shall deserve her but not overruled her inclinations were i to seize the tender opportunity of her present disposition the world would ascribe it to her fortune and i am sure my deceased and valuable friend however kindly he meant to me in the affair never intended that i should make his daughter unhappy   araminta but i tell you she loves you and you must and shall marry her   sir john ah sister you are willing to dispose of her any way that worthless lover of yours still hangs about your heart and i have avoided seeing him on your account as well as caelias   araminta to show how mistaken you are in all this i have given him up totally i despise and hate him nay i am upon the brink of a resolution to give myself to another sir john shakes his head i am i assure you his friend mr belmour is by no means indifferent on my subject   sir john and is this revenge on yourself a proof of your want of passion for him  ah araminta  come come my dear i own i think him unworthy of you and would resent his usage to the utmost did not i clearly perceive that it would appear mercenary in myself and give real pain both to you and caelia   aramintha i actually dont know what to say to you   sir john you had better say nothing your spirits at present are too much alarmed  i have sent for caelia hither a short hour may determine the fates of all of us i know my honorable intentions will give her great uneasiness but it is my duty which exacts them from me  you had better take a turn or two in some other part of the garden  i see my steward coming this way  i may want your assistance but too soon exit araminta enter steward have you brought those papers i bad you look out   steward yes sir but there is the gentleman within to wait upon your honor concerning the estate you intended to purchase it seems a mighty good bargain   sir john i cannot speak to him now   steward your honor always used to be punctual   sir john alas jonathan i may be punctual again tomorrow  give me the papers did miss beverley say she would come to me   steward immediately sir but i wish your honor would consider such bargains as these do not offer every day   sir john heigh ho   steward it joins so conveniently too to your honors own estate within a hedge as i may say   sir john prithee dont plague me   steward nay it is not my interest but your honors though that indeed i may call my interest for i am sure i love your honor   sir john i know thou do jonathan and i am too hasty  but leave me now  if the gentleman will do me the favor of staying all night i may satisfy him in the morning my head and heart are too full now for any business which concerns my fortune   steward something goes very wrong with my poor master some love nonsense or other i suppose  i wish all the women were in the bottom of the sea for my part exit steward   enter lady beverley and caelia lady i thought it requisite sir john as i heard you had something of importance to transact with my daughter to wait upon you with her   sir john was that necessary madam  i begged the favor of miss beverleys company only   lady but a mother you know sir john who has a tender concern for her child    sir john should show it upon every occasion   lady i find sir john there is some misunderstanding at present which a woman of prudence and experience might be much better consulted upon than a poor young thing whose    sir john not at all madam caelia has all the prudence i require and our present conversation will soon be over   lady nay sir john to be sure i am not afraid of trusting my daughter alone with you a man of your discretion will undoubtedly be guilty of no impropriety but a third person sometimes where the parties concerned are a little too much influenced by their passions has occasioned very substantial and very useful effects i have known several instances of it in the course of my experience   sir john this madam will not be one of them  how teizing walking aside   lady i find sir john that you are determined to have your own way and therefore i shall show you by my behavior that i know what good manners require though i do not always meet with the same treatment from other people exit lady   sir john now caelia we are alone and i have many excuses to make to you for the impassioned sallies of our late conversation which i do most sincerely  can you pardon them   caelia alas sir it is i who ought to entreat for pardon   sir john not in the least madam i have no blame to cast upon you for any part of your conduct your youth and inexperience joined to the goodness of your heart are sufficient apologies for any shadow of indiscretion which might appear in your behavior i am afraid mine was not so irreproachable however caelia i shall endeavor to make you all the amends in my power and to show you that it is your happiness not my own which is the object of my anxiety  your fathers will is but too clear in its intentions but the purity of his heart never meant to promote my felicity at the expense of yours you are therefore madam entirely at liberty from this moment to make your choice where you please this paper will entitle you to that authority and this will enable you to bestow your fortune where you bestow your hand  take them my dear  why are you so disturbed  alas caelia i see too plainly the cause of these emotions you only wish the happy man to whom you have given your heart loved you as i do   but i beg pardon and will only add one caution which my duty demands of me as your guardian your protector and your fathers friend  you have been a witness of modelys transactions with my sister have a care therefore caelia be sure of his firm attachment before you let your own hurry you into a compliance these papers give you up all power on my part but as an adviser i shall be always ready to be consulted   caelia my tears and my confusion have hitherto hindered me from answering not the invidious suggestion which you have so cruelly charged me with what friend what lover have i to engross my attentions i never had but one and he has cast me off for ever  o sir give me the papers and let me return them where my soul longs to place them   sir john no caelia to accept them again would impeach the justice of my whole proceeding it would make it look like the mean artifice of a mercenary villain who attempted to gain by stratagem what his merits did not entitle him to  i blush to think of it  i have performed my office be mistress of yourself and let me fly from a combat to which i find myself unequal exit sir john   caelia sits down leaning her head upon her hand enter modely and belmour modely hist hist he has just left her and in a fine situation for my approaches  if you are not yet satisfied i will make up all differences with you another time  get into the arbor and be a witness of my triumph you shall see me like another caesar come see  and overcome  belmour goes into the arbor modely comes forward walks two or three turns by her bowing as he passes without being taken notice of then speaks if it is not an interruption madam when i find you thus alone    caelia rising i would choose to be alone   modely madam   caelia after a little pause in short mr modely your behavior to me of late is what i can by no means approve of it is unbecoming your character as a man of honor and would be a stain to the ingenuous modesty of my sex for me to suffer it   modely you surprise me madam can the adoration of an humble love the timid advances of a man whom you beauty has undone be such unpardonable offenses   caelia looks with indignation at him and is going off modely catching hold of her and falling upon his knees nay madam you must not leave me   caelia rise sir or i am gone this moment  i thought of flying from you but my soul disdains it  know then sir that i am mistress of myself mistress of my fortune and may bestow my hand wherever my heart directs it   modely my angel  coming eagerly up to her   caelia what do you mean   modely that you make the most sincere of lovers the happiest of mankind the addition of your fortune will add splendour to our felicity and the frowns of disappointed love only heighten our enjoyments   caelia oh thou vile one  how does that cruel generous man who has rejected me rise on the comparison   modely rejected you  sir john dorilant   caelia yes mr modely that triumph at least is yours i have offered myself and been refused my hand and fortune equally disdained but may perpetual happiness attend him wherever his honest honest heart shall fix   modely o madam your inexperience deceives you he knows the integrity of your mind and trusts to that for recompense his seeming disinterestedness is but the surer method of completing his utmost wishes   caelia blasphemer stop thy tongue the purity of his intentions is as much above thy malice as thy imitation   she walks to one side of the stage and modely stands disconcerted on the other enter lady beverley lady well child what has the man said to thee cousin modely your servant you find our plot would not take they were too quick upon us  hey day what has been doing here   modely o

decorum require it  tell me child is it so   caelia sir john dorilant madam with a generosity peculiar to himself cruel generosity has cancelled every obligation which could confine my choice these papers confirm the freedom he has given me  and rob me of all future comfort   lady indeed i did not expect this of him but i am heartily glad of it give me the papers child   caelia no madam  useless as they are they are yet my own   lady useless  what do you mean has the base man laid any other embargo on thee child   caelia i cannot bear madam even from you to hear sir john dorilant treated with

and let them come together they must and shall be man and wife and i will even go back to araminta   belmour thou have a most astonishing assurance   modely hush  she is coming this way  get into your hole again and be dumb  now you shall see a scene of triumph indeed   belmour have a care caesar you have the britons to deal with retires   enter araminta araminta what are they gone and my wretch

seize my charmer   araminta agreeable rascal  be quiet cannot you you think one so forward now   modely i cannot will not be restrained when the dear object of my wishes meets me with kind compliance in her eyes and voice  tomorrow  it is an age why should we wait for that tonight my angel tonight may make us one and the fair prospect of our halcyon days even from this hour begin   araminta who would not think this fellow with his blank verse now was in earnest but i know him thoroughly  indeed mr modely you are too pressing marriage is a serious thing besides you know this idle bustle betwixt my brother and caelia which you seem to think me ignorant of and which you in some measure though undesignedly i dare say have occasioned may obstruct us a little   modely not at all my dear an amusement en passant the mere raillery of gallantry on my side to oblige her impertinent mother who you know has a penchant for sir john herself was the whole insignificant business perhaps indeed i was something blameable in it   araminta why really i think so in your situation but are you sure it went no farther nothing else passed between you   modely nothing in nature   araminta dear me how mistaken people are i cannot say that i believed it but they told me that you had actually proposed to marry her that the girl was near consenting and that the mother was your friend in the affair   modely the mere malice and invention of lady beverley   araminta and there is not a word of truth in it then   modely not a syllable  you know my soul is yours   araminta o thou villain  i thought to have kept my temper and to have treated you with the contempt you deserve but this insolence is intolerable can you imagine that i am a stranger to your proceedings a deaf blind idiot  o i could tear this foolish heart which cheated by its passion has encouraged such an insult  how how have i deserved this treatment bursting into tears   modely greatly alarmed by holy faith  by every power above you and you only are the passion of my soul  may every curse    araminta away deceiver  these tears are the tears of resentment my resolution melts not in my eyes it is fixed unalterable you might imagine from the gayety of my temper that it had its levity too but know sir that a woman who has once been duped defies all future machinations   modely hear me madam  nay you shall hear me    araminta shall  insufferable insolence  go sir for any thing which regards me you are free as air free as your licentious principles nor shall a thought of what i once esteemed you disturb my future quiet there are men who think me not contemptible and under whose protection i may shelter my disgrace  unhand me  this is the last time i shall probably ever see you and i may tell you in parting that you have used me cruelly and that caelia knows you as perfectly as i do   exit araminta modely stands confounded enter belmour belmour caesar ashamed  and well he may in faith why man what is the matter with you quite dumb quite confounded did not i always tell you that you loved her   modely i feel it sensibly   belmour and i can tell you another secret   modely what is that   belmour that she loves you   modely o that she did   belmour did  every word every motion of passion through her whole conversation betrayed it involuntarily i wish it had been otherwise   modely why   belmour because i had some thoughts of circumventing you but i find it will be in vain therefore pursue her properly and she is yours   modely o never belmour never  i have sinned beyond a possibility of pardon that she did love me i have had a thousand proofs which like a brainless idiot i wantonly trifled with what a pitiful rascal have i made myself   belmour why in that i agree with you but dont despair man you may still be happier than you deserve   modely with what face can i approach her every circumstance of her former affection now rises in judgment against me o belmour she has taught me to blush   belmour and i assure you it becomes you mightily   modely where can i apply  how can i address her all that i can possibly do will only look like a mean artificial method of patching up my other disappointment   belmour more miracles still she has not only taught you to blush but has absolutely made a man of honor of you   modely raillery is out of season   enter a servant servant mrs araminta sir desires to speak with you   modely eagerly with me   servant no sir with mr belmour   belmour with me   servant yes sir   belmour where is she   servant in the close walk by the house sir   belmour and alone   servant entirely sir   belmour i wait upon her this instant exit servant   modely belmour you shall not stir   belmour by my faith but i will sir   modely she said there were men to whom she could fly for protection by my soul she intends to propose herself to you   belmour and if she does i shall certainly accept her offer   modely i will cut your thtoat if you do   belmour and do you think to fright me by that i fancy i can cut throats as well as other people your servant if i cannot succeed for myself i will speak a good word for you exit belmour   modely what can this mean  i am upon thorns till i know the event i must watch them  no that is dishonest  dishonest how virtuous does a real passion make one  heigh ho  walks about in disorder he seems in great haste to go to her he has turned into the walk already  that abominable old fashioned cradle work makes the hedges so thick there is no seeing through them  an open lawn has ten thousand times the beauty and is kept at by less expense by half  these cursed unnatural chairs are always in the way too  stumbling against one of the garden chairs what a miserable dog am i  i would give an arm to know what they are talking about  we talk of female coquettes by my soul we beat them at their own weapons  stay  one stratagem i may yet put in practice and it is an honest one  the thought was lucky  i will about it instantly poor modely  how has thy vanity reduced thee   end of the fourth act act v scene continues araminta and belmour araminta you find mr belmour that i have seen your partialities and like a woman of honor i have confessed my own your behavior to your friend is generous beyond comparison and i could almost join in the little stratagem you propose merely to see if he deserves it   belmour indeed madam you mistake him utterly vanity is his ruling vice an idle affectation of success among the ladies which makes fools admire and boys envy him is the master passion of his giddy heart the severe checks he has met with today have sufficiently opened his understanding and the real possession of one valuable woman whom he dreads to lose will soon convince him how despicable his folly has made him   araminta i am afraid mr belmour a man who has half his life been pursuing bubbles without perceiving their insignificance will be easily tempted to resume the chase the possession of one reality will hardly convince him that the rest were shadows and a woman must be an idiot indeed who thinks of fixing a man to herself after marriage whom she could not secure before it to begin with insensibility o fie mr modely   belmour you need not fear it madam his heart    araminta is as idle as our conversation on the subject i beg your pardon for the comparison as i do for having sent for you in this manner but i thought it necessary that both you and mr modely should know my real sentiments undisguised by passion   belmour and may i hope you will concur in my proposal   araminta i dont know what to say to it it is a piece of mummery which i am ill suited for at present but if an opportunity should offer i must confess i have enough of the woman in me not to be insensible to the charms of an innocent revenge  but this other intricate business if you can assist me in that you will oblige me beyond measure there are two hearts mr belmour worthy to be united had my brother a little less honor and she a little less sensibility  but i know not what to think of it   belmour in that madam i can certainly assist you   araminta how dear mr belmour   belmour i have been a witness unknown to caelia to such a conversation as will clear up every doubt sir john can possibly have entertained   araminta you charm me when you say so  as i live here comes my brother  stay is not that wretch modely with him he is actually what can his assurance be plotting now  come this way mr belmour we will watch them at a distance that no harm may happen between them and talk to the girl first the monster  exeunt   enter sir john dorilant and modely modely entering and looking after araminta and belmour they are together still   but let me resume my nobler self   sir john why will you follow me mr modely i have purposely avoided you  my heart swells with indignation  i know not what may be the consequence   modely upon my honor sir john    sir john honor mr modely it is a sacred word you ought to shudder when you pronounce it honor has no existence but in the breast of truth it is the harmonious result of every virtue combined  you have sense you have knowledge but i can assure you mr modely though parts and knowledge without the dictates of justice or the feelings of humanity may make a bold and mischievous member of society even courted by the world they only in my eye make him more contemptible   modely this i can bear sir john  because i have deserved it   sir john you may think perhaps it is only an idle affair with a lady what half mankind are guilty of and what the conceited wits of your acquaintance will treat with raillery faith with a woman ridiculous  but let me tell you mr modely the man who even slightly deceives a believing and a trusting woman can never be a man of honor   modely i own the truth of your assertions i feel the aweful superiority of your real virtue nor should any thing have dragged me into your presence so much i dreaded it but the sincerest hope of making you happy   sir john making me happy mr modely  you have put it out of your own power  walks from him then turns to him again  you mean i suppose by a resignation of caelia to me   modely not of caelia only but her affections   sir john vain and impotent proposal   modely sir john it is not a time for altercation  by all my hopes of bliss here and hereafter you are the real passion of her soul  look not so unbelieving by heaven it is true and nothing but an artful insinuation of your never intending to marry her and even concurring in our affair could ever have made her listen one moment to me   sir john why do i hear you  o mr modely you touch my weakest part   modely cherish the tender feelings and be happy   sir john is it possible that amiable creature can think and talk tenderly of me i know her generosity but generosity is not the point   modely believe me sir it is more it is real unaffected passion her innocent soul speaks through her eyes the honest dictates of her heart in our last conference notwithstanding her mothers commands notwithstanding what i blush to own my utmost ardent solicitations to the contrary she persisted in her integrity tore the papers which left her choice free and treated us with an indignation which added charms to virtue   sir john o these flattering sounds  would i could believe them   modely belmour as well as myself and lady beverley was a witness of the truth of them i thought it my duty to inform you as i know your delicacy with regard to her and indeed i would in some measure endeavor to repair the injuries i have offered to your family before i leave it for ever  o sir john let not an illjudged nicety debar you from a happiness which stands with open arms to receive you think what my folly has lost in araminta and when your indignation at the affront is a little respited be blessed yourself and pity me  as he goes out he still looks after araminta and belmour  they are together still but i will go round that way to the house   exit modely sir john what can this mean  he cannot intend to deceive me he seems too sincerely affected  i must i will believe him the mind which suspects injustice is half guilty of it itself  talks tenderly of me tore the parpers treated them with indignation heavens what a flow of tender joy comes over me  shall caelia then be mine how my heart dances o i could be wondrous foolish  well jonathan   enter steward steward the gentleman sir    sir john what of the gentleman i am ready for any thing   steward will wait upon your honor tomorrow as you are not at leisure   sir john with all my heart now or then whenever he pleases   steward i am glad to see your honor in spirits   sir john spirits jonathan i am light as air  make a thousand excuses to him  but let it be tomorrow however for i see lady beverley coming this way   steward heaven bless his good soul i love to see him merry exit   enter lady beverley lady if i dont interrupt you sir john    sir john interrupt me madam it is impossible   lady for i would not be guilty of an indecorum even to you   sir john come come lady beverley these little bickerings must be laid aside give me your hand lady now we are friends kissing it  how does your lovely daughter   lady you are in mighty good humor sir john perhaps every body may not be so   sir john every body must be so madam where i come i am joy itself  the jolly god that leads the jocund hours   lady what is come to the man  whatever it is i shall damp it presently  aside  do you choose to hear what i have to say sir john   sir john you can say nothing madam but that you consent and caelia is my own  yes you yourself have been a witness to her integrity come indulge me lady beverley declare it all and let me listen to my happiness   lady i shall declare nothing sir john on that subject what i have to say is of a very different import  in short without circumlocution or any unnecessary embarrassment to entangle the affair i and my daughter are of an opinion that it is by no means proper for us to continue any longer in your family   sir john madam   lady this is what i had to declare sir john   sir john does caelia madam desire to leave me   lady it was a proposal of her own   sir john confusion   lady and a very sensible one too in my opinion for when people are not so easy together as might be expected i know no better remedy than parting   sir john aside sure this is no trick of modelys to get her away from me  he talked too himself of leaving my family immediately  i shall relapse again   lady i find sir john you are somewhat disconcerted but for my part    sir john o torture   lady i say for my part sir john it might have been altogether as well perhaps if we had never met   sir john i am sorry madam my behavior has offended you but    enter araminta caelia and belmour araminta to caelia as she enters leave the house indeed come come you shall speak to him  what is all this disorder for pray brother has any thing new happened  that wretch has been beforehand with us  aside to belmour   lady nothing at all mrs araminta i have only made a very reasonable proposal to him which he is pleased to treat with his and your usual incivility   sir john you wrong us madam with the imputation  after a pause and some irresolution he goes up to caelia  i thought miss beverley i had already given up my authority and that you were perfectly at liberty to follow your own inclinations i could have wished indeed to have still assisted you with my advice and i flattered myself that my presence would have been no restraint upon your conduct but i find it is otherwise my very roof is grown irksome to you and the innocent pleasure i received in observing your growing virtues is no longer to be indulged to me   caelia o sir put not so hard a construction upon what i thought a blameless proceeding can it be wondered at that i should fly from him who has twice rejected me with disdain   sir john with disdain caelia   caelia who has withdrawn from me even his parental tenderness and driven me to the hard necessity of avoiding him lest i should offend him farther  i know how much my inexperience wants a faithful guide i know what cruel censures a malicious world will pass upon my conduct but i must bear them all for he who might protect me from myself protect me from the insults of licentious tongues abandons me to fortune   sir john o caelia  have i have i abandoned thee  heaven knows my inmost soul how it did rejoice but a few moments ago when modely told me that your heart was mine   araminta modely  did modely tell you so  do you hear that mr belmour   sir john he did my sister with every circumstance which could increase his own guilt and her integrity   araminta that was honest however   sir john i thought it so and respected him accordingly o he breathed comfort to a despairing wretch but now a thousand thousand doubts crowd in upon me he leaves my house this instant nay may be gone already caelia too is flying from me  perhaps to join him and with her happier lover smile at my undoing  leans on araminta   caelia i burst with indignation  can i be suspected of such treachery can you sir who know my every thought harbor such a suspicion  o madam this contempt have you brought upon me a want of deceit was all the little negative praise i had to boast of and that is now denied me   leans on lady beverley lady come away child   caelia no madam i have a harder task still to perform comes up to sir john to offer you my hand again under these circumstances thus despicable as you have made me may seem an insult but i mean it not as such  o sir if you ever loved my father in pity to my orphan state let me not leave you shield me from the world shield me from the worst of misfortunes your own unkind suspicions   araminta what fooling is here help me mr belmour  there take her hand  and now let it go if you can   sir john grasping her hand o caelia may i believe modely is your heart mine   caelia it is and ever shall be   sir john transporting extacy  turning to caelia   lady i should think sir john a mothers consent  though mrs araminta i see has been so very good to take that office upon herself   sir john i beg your pardon madam my thoughts were too much engaged  but may i hope for your concurrence   lady i dont know what to say to you i think you have bewitched the girl amongst you   araminta indeed lady beverley this is quite preposterous  ha  he here again  protect me mr belmour   enter modely modely madam you need fly no where for protection you have no insolence to fear from me i am humbled sufficiently and the postchaise is now at the door to banish me for ever  my sole business here is to unite that virtuous man with the most worthy of her sex   araminta half aside thank you for the compliment  now mr belmour   lady you may spare yourself that trouble cousin modely the girl is irrecoverably gone already   modely may all the happiness they deserve attend them going then looks back at araminta i cannot leave her   sir john mr modely is there nobody here besides whom you ought to take leave of   modely i own my parting from that lady to araminta should not be in silence but a conviction of my guilt stops my tongue from utterance   araminta i cannot say i quite believe that but as our affair may make some noise in the world for the sake of my own character i must beg of you to declare before this company whether any part of my conduct has given even a shadow of excuse for the insult i have received if it has be honest and proclaim it   modely none by heaven the crime was all my own and i suffer for it justly and severely  with shame i speak it notwithstanding the appearances to the contrary my heart was ever yours and ever will be   araminta i am satisfied and will honestly confess the sole reason of my present appeal was this that where i had destined my hand my conduct might appear unblemished gives her hand to belmour   modely confusion  then my suspicions were just   sir john sister   caelia araminta   araminta what do ye mean what are ye surprised at  the insinuating mr modely can never want mistresses any where can he mr belmour you know him perfectly   modely distraction  knows me yes he does know me the villain though he triumphs in my sufferings knows what i feel  you madam are just in your severity from you i have deserved every thing the anguish the despair which must attend my future life comes from you like heavens avenging minister  but for him  sir john interposes o for a sword  but i shall find a time and a severe one  let me go sir john    araminta i will carry on the farce no longer  rash inconsiderate madman the sword which pierces mr belmours breast would rob you of the best of friends  this pretended marriage for it is no more was merely contrived by him to convince me of your sincerity  embrace him as your guardian angel and learn from him to be virtuous   belmour o madam let me still plead for him surely when a vain man feels himself in the wrong you cannot desire him to suffer a greater punishment   araminta i have done with fooling  you told me today lady beverley that he would never return to me   lady and i told you at the same time madam that if he did  you would take him   araminta in both you were mistaken  mr modely your last behavior to caelia and my brother shows a generosity of temper i did not think you capable of and for that i thank you but to be serious on our own affair whatever appearance your present change may carry with it your transactions of today have been such that i can never hereafter have that respect for you which a wife ought to have for her husband   sir john i am sorry to say it mr modely her determination is i fear too just trust to time however at least let us part friends and not abruptly we should conceal the failings of each other and if it must come to that endeavor to find out specious reasons for breaking off the match without injuring either party   araminta to show how willing i am to conceal every thing now i have had my little female revenge as my brother has promised us the fiddles this evening mr modely as usual shall be my partner in the dance   modely i have deserved this ridicule madam and am humbled to what you please   araminta why then brother as we all seem in a strange dilemma why may not we have one dance in the garden it will put us in good humor   sir john as you please madam  call the fiddles hither  dont despair mr modely half aside to him   lady i will not dance positively   belmour indeed but you shall madam do you think i will be the only disconsolate swain who wants a partner besides you see there are are so few of us that we must call in the butler and the ladies maids even to help out the figure   sir john come lady beverley you must lay aside all animosities if i have behaved improperly to you today i most sincerely ask your pardon and hope the anxieties i have been under will sufficiently plead my excuse my future conduct shall be irreproachable turning to caelia  here have i placed my happiness and here expect it o caelia if the seriousness of my behavior should hereafter offend you impute it to my infirmity it can never proceed from want of affection  a heart like mine its own distress contrives and feels most sensibly the pain it gives then even its frailties heartily approve for if it errs it errs from too much love  a dance epilogue spoken before the dance by mrs yates and mr palmer in the characters of araminta and modely araminta well ladies am i right or am i not should not this foolish passion be forgot this fluttering something scarce to be expressed which pleads for coxcombs in each female breast how mortified he looked  and looks so still turning to modely he really may repent  perhaps he will   modely will araminta  ladies be so good mans made of frail materials flesh and blood we all offend at some unhappy crisis have whims caprices vanities  and vices your happier sex by nature was designed her last best work to perfect humankind no spot no blemish the fair frame deforms no avarice taints no naughty passion warms your firmer hearts no love of change in you ever taught desire to stray   araminta all this is true yet stay the men perchance will call it sneer and some few ladies think you not sincere for your petition whether wrong or right whatever it be withdraw it for tonight another time if i should want a spouse i may myself report it to the house at present let us strive to mend the age let justice reign at least upon the stage where the fair dames who like to live by rule may learn two lessons from the lovers school while caelias choice instructs them how to choose and my refusal warns them to refuse  the end errata page   l  0 for you and i read you and me  0 l   for you and i read you and
