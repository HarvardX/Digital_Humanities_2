an account of the manner of inoculating for the small pox in the east indies  price one shilling  an account of the manner of inoculating for the small pox in the east indies with some observations on the practice and mode of treating that disease in those parts  inscribed to the learned the president and members of the college of physicians in london  by j z holwell frs  london printed for t becket and p a de hondt near surry street in the strand  mdcclxvii  an account of the manner of inoculating for the small pox in the east indies on perusing lately some tracts upon the subject of inoculation i determined to put together a few notes relative to the manner of inoculation practiced time out of mind by the bramins of indostan to this i was chiefly instigated by considering the great benefit that may arise to mankind from a knowledge of this foreign method which so remarkably tends to support the practice now generally followed with such mavelous success  by dr schultzs account of inoculation page    note   it should seem that the world has been already obliged with a performance of the kind which i have now undertaken by a dutch author a friend of mr chais but as this is all i know of that work it shall not discourage my proceeding with my own the more especially as that performance is in a foreign language and may not much benefit my country  as many years are elapsed since a theme of this nature has employed my thoughts and attention i will hope for every favorable indulgence from the candor of that learned and respectable body to whose judgment i most readily submit the following history and observations  it has been lately remarked by a learned and judicious ornament of the college of physicians that the art of medicine has in several instances been greatly indebted to accident and that some of its most valuable improvements have been received from the hands of ignorance and barbarism a truth remarkably exemplified in the practice of inoculation of the small pox  however just in general this learned gentlemans remark may be he will as to his particular reference be surprised to find that nearly the same salutary method now so happily pursued in england howsoever it has been seemingly blundered upon has the sanction of remotest antiquity but indeed with some variations that will rather illustrate the propriety of the present practice and promote the obvious very laudable intention with which that gentleman published his late essay on this interesting subject  the general state of this distemper in the provinces of bengall to which these observations are limited is such that for five and sometimes six years together it passes in a manner unnoticed from the few that are attacked with it for the complexion of it in these years is generally so benign as to cause very little alarm and notwithstanding the multitudes that are every year inoculated in the usual season it adds no malignity to the disease taken in the natural way nor spreads the infection as is commonly imagined in europe every seventh year with scarcely any exception the small pox rages epidemically in these provinces during the months of march april and may and sometimes until the annual returning rains about the middle of june put a stop to its fury on these periodical returns to four of which i have been a witness the disease proves universally of the most malignant confluent kind from which few either of the natives or europeans escaped that took the distemper in the natural way commonly dying on the first second or third day of the eruption and yet inoculation in the east has natural fears and superstitious prejudices to encounter as well as in the west the usual resource of the europeans is to fly from the settlements and retire into the country before the return of the small pox season  it is singularly worth remarking that there hardly ever was an instance of a native of the island of st helena man or woman that was seized with this distemper in the natural way when resident in bengall who escaped with life although it is a known fact the disease never yet got footing upon that island clearly to account for this is not an easy matter i will venture however a few conjectures on the occasion these people rarely migrate from the island before they arrive at years of maturity the basis of their diet there from their infancy is a root called yam of a skranshee kind a term they use to express its acrid unwholesome qualities which frequently subjects them to epidemic and dangerous dysenteries and sometimes epidemic putrid sore throats the blood thus charged must necessarily constitute a most unlucky habit of body to combat with any acute inflammatory disease whatsoever but more especially of the kind under consideration so frequently attended with a high degree of putrefaction always fatal to these people even in those seasons when the disease is mild and favorable to others but indeed it is a general remark that a st helenian rarely escapes when seized with the small pox in whatsoever part of the globe he happens to reside the same has been observed of the african coffries although i know not what cause to ascribe it to unless we suppose one similar to that above mentioned to wit some fundamental aggravating principle in their chief diet be this as it may that these two portions of the human species seem peculiarly marked as victims to this disease is a fact indisputable let the cause be what it will  having thus far premised touching the general state of this distemper in the provinces of bengall which i believe is nearly applicable to every other part of the empire i will only add a few words respecting the duration of it in indostan and then hasten to the principal intention of this short essay  the learned doctor friend in his history of physic from the time of galen has this remarkable passage by the earliest account we have of the small pox we find it first appeared in egypt in the time of omar successor to mahomet though no doubt since the greeks knew nothing of it the arabians brought it from their own country and might derive it originally from some of the more distant regions of the east the sagacity of this conclusion later times and discoveries has fully verified at the period in which the aughtorrah bhade scriptures of the gentoos were promulged according to the bramins three thousand three hundred and sixty six years ago this disease must then have been of some standing as those scriptures institute a form of divine worship with poojahs or offerings to a female divinity styled by the common people gootee ka tagooran the goddess of spots whose aid and patronage are invoked during the continuance of the small pox season also in the measles and every cutaneous eruption that is in the smallest degree epidemical due weight being given to this circumstance the long duration of the disease in indostan will manifestly appear and we may add to the sagacious conjecture just quoted that not only the arabians but the egyptians also by their early commerce with india through the red sea and gulf of mocha most certainly derived originally the small pox and probably the measles likewise from that country where those diseases have reigned from the earliest known times  inoculation is performed in indostan by a particular tribe of bramins who are delegated annually for this service from the different colleges of bindoobund eleabas banaras etc over all the distant provinces dividing themselves into small parties of three or four each they plan their traveling circuits in such wise as to arrive at the places of their respective destination some weeks before the usual return of the disease they arrive commonly in the bengall provinces early in february although they some years do not begin to inoculate before march deferring it until they consider the state of the season and acquire information of the state of the distemper  the year in bengall can properly be divided into three seasons only of four months each from the middle of june to the middle of october is the rainy season from the middle of october to the middle of february is the cold season which never rises to a degree of freezing the whole globe does not yield a more desirable or delightful climate than bengall during these four months but the freedom of living which the europeans fall into at this season sow the seeds of those diseases which spring up in all the succeeding months of the year from the middle of february to the middle of june is the hot windy dry season during which no rain falls but what comes in storms of fierce winds and tremendous thunder and lightning called north westers the quarter they always rise from and the provinces particularly bengall is more or less healthy in proportion to the number of these storms when in this season the air is frequently agitated and refreshed with these north westers accompanied with rain for they are often dry and the inhabitants do not expose themselves to the intense sun and violent hot winds that blow in march april and may it is generally found to be the most healthy of the year otherwise as in the year      when we had no rain from the twentieth of october to the twentieth of june this season produces high inflammatory disorders of the liver breast pleura and intestines with dysenteries and a deplorable species of the smallpox  from the middle of july the second month of the rainy season there is little or no wind a stagnation of air follows and during the remainder of this month and the months of august and september the atmosphere is loaded with suffocating heat and moisture the parents of putrefaction and nervous putrid fevers approaching sometimes to pestilential take the lead and mark the dangerous season from these fevers the natives frequently recover but the europeans seldom especially if they in the preceding may and june indulged too freely in those two bewitching delicacies mangos and mango fish indiscriminately with the free use of flesh and wine for these all together load the whole habit with impurities and never fail of yielding death a plentiful harvest in the three last months of this putrid season if any are seized with the smallpox in these months it is ever of the most malignant kind and usually fatal it will not i hope be deemed a useless digression if i bestow a few remarks on the nature of this bengall fever  a day or two before the seizure the patient finds his appetite fall off feels an unaccountable lassitude and failure in the natural moisture of the mouth is low spirited without any apparent cause and cannot sleep as usual but having no acute complaint whatsoever nor preternatural heat that should indicate a fever he attributes the whole to the heat of the season is satisfied with fasting and confinement to his house or goes abroad amongst his friends to shake it off as the common phrase is but on the third day finding every one of these symptoms increase he begins to think something is really the matter with him and the physician is called in thus the only period is lost wherein art might be of any use for in the course of eighteen years practice i never knew an instance of recovery from this genuine fever where the first three days had elapsed without assistance and the patient in this case dyed on the fifth or seventh day in some this fever is attended with a full equal undisturbed pulse but obviously greatly oppressed in others with a low and depressed one but equal and undisturbed also and yet both required the same treatment new comers in the profession have been often fatally misled by the full pulse which they thought indicated the loss of blood they followed the suggestion the pulse suddenly fell and when that happens from this cause the art of man can never raise it again the patient dies on the fifth or seventh day and the consequence was exactly the same if nature being overloaded attempted to free herself of part of the burden by a natural haemorrhage or by the intestines on the second or third day which i have often seen they proved equally fatal as the launcet until the close of the sixth day the skin and urine preserved a natural state but if at this period of the fever the skin suddenly acquired an intense heat and the urine grew crude and limpid it was a sure presage of death on the seventh the natural crisis of this fever when attacked in the very beginning and treated judiciously was regularly on the eleventh day and appeared in a multitude of small boils chiefly upon the head or in small watery bladders thrown out upon the surface of the skin but in the greatest abundance on the breast neck throat and forehead both of these critical appearances are constantly preceded on the tenth day by a copious sediment and separation in the urine if by any inadvertent exposure to the cold air these critical eruptions were struck in the repelled matter instantly fell upon the brain and convulsions and death followed in a few hours and small purple spots remained in the places of the eruptions such is the genuine putrid nervous fever of bengall which never gave way properly to any treatment but that of blisters applied universally supported by the strongest alexipharmics sometimes i have seen the crisis by unskilful management spun out to the twentyfirst day but it has been ever imperfect and the patient is harrassed with intermittents or diarrhoeas and commonly dies in the beginning of the cold season but if he is of a strong constitution he lingers on in a dying way until the month of february which usually gives some turn in his favor but his health is hardly ever reestablished before the salutary mango season which fruit eaten with milk proves an effectual and neverfailing restorative but to resume our subject  the inhabitants of bengall knowing the usual time when the inoculating bramins annually return observe strictly the regimen enjoined whether they determine to be inoculated or not this preparation consists only in abstaining for a month from fish milk and ghee a kind of butter made generally of buffalos milk the prohibition of fish respects only the native portuguese and mahomedans who abound in every province of the empire  when the bramins begin to inoculate they pass from house to house and operate at the door refusing to inoculate any who have not on a strict scrutiny duly observed the preparatory course enjoined them it is no uncommon thing for them to ask the parents how many pocks they choose their children should have vanity we should think urged a question on a matter seemingly so uncertain in the issue but true it is that they hardly ever exceed or are deficient in the number required  they inoculate indifferently on any part but if left to their choice they prefer the outside of the arm midway between the wrist and the elbow for the males and the same between the elbow and the shoulder for the females previous to the operation the operator takes a piece of cloth in his hand which becomes his perquisite if the family is opulent and with it gives a dry friction upon the part intended for inoculation for the space of eight or ten minutes then with a small instrument he wounds by many slight touches about the compass of a silver groat the instrument they make use of is of iron about four inches and a half long and of the size of a large crow quill the middle is twisted and the one end is steeled and flatted about an inch from the extremity and the eighth of an inch broad this extremity is brought to a very keen edge and two sharp corners the other end of the instrument is an earpicker and the instrument is precisely the same as the barbers of indostan use to cut the nails and depurate the ears of their customers for in that country we are above performing either of these operations ourselves the operator of inoculation holds the instrument as we hold a pen and with dextrous expedition gives about fifteen or sixteen minute scarifications within the compass abovementioned with one of the sharp corners of the instrument and to these various little wounds i believe may be ascribed the discharge which almost constantly flows from the part in the progress of the disease i cannot help thinking that too much has been said pro and con about nothing respecting the different methods preferred by different practitioners of performing the operation provided the matter is thrown into the blood it is certainly a consideration of most trivial import by what means it is effected if any claims a preference i should conclude it should be that method which bids fairest for securing a plentiful discharge from the ulcer  just making the smallest appearance of blood then opening a linen double rag which he always keeps in a cloth round his waist takes from thence a small pledgit of cotton charged with the variolous matter which he moistens with two or three drops of the ganges water and applies it to the wound fixing it on with a slight bandage and ordering it to remain on for six hours without being moved then the bandage to be taken off and the pledget to remain until it falls off itself sometimes but rarely he squeezes a drop from the pledget upon the part before he applies it from the time he begins the dry friction to the tying the knot of the bandage he never ceases reciting some portions of the worship appointed by the aughtorrah bhade to be paid to the female divinity beforementioned nor quits the most solemn countenance all the while the cotton which he preserves in a double callico rag is saturated with matter from the inoculated pustules of the preceding year for they never inoculate with fresh matter nor with matter from the disease caught in the natural way however distinct and mild the species he then proceeds to give instructions for the treatment of the patient through the course of the process which are most religiously observed these are as follow  he extends the prohibition of fish milk and ghee for one month from the day of inoculation early on the morning succeeding the operation four collons an earthen pot containing about two gallons of cold water are ordered to be thrown over the patient from the head downwards and to be repeated every morning and evening until the fever comes on which usually is about the close of the sixth day from the inoculation then to defist until the appearance of the eruptions which commonly happens at the close of the third complete day from the commencement of the fever and then to pursue the cold bathing as before through the course of the disease and until the scabs of the pustules drop off they are ordered to open all the pustules with a fine sharp pointed thorn as soon as they begin to change their color and whilst the matter continues in a fluid state confinement to the house is absolutely forbid and the inoculated are ordered to be exposed to every air that blows and the utmost indulgence they are allowed when the fever comes on is to be laid on a mat at the door but in fact the eruptive fever is generally so inconsiderable and trifling as very seldom to require this indulgence their regimen is ordered to consist of all the refrigerating things the climate and season produces as plantains sugarcanes watermelons rice gruel made of white poppyseeds and cold water or thin rice gruel for their ordinary drink these instructions being given and an injunction laid on the patients to make a thanksgiving poojah or offering to the goddess on their recovery the operator takes his fee which from the poor is a pund of cowries equal to about a penny sterling and goes on to another door down one side of the street and up on the other and is thus employed from morning until night inoculating sometimes eight or ten in a house the regimen they order when they are called to attend the disease taken in the natural way is uniformly the same there usually begins to be a discharge from the scarification a day before the eruption which continues through the disease and sometimes after the scabs of the pock fall off and a few pustules generally appear round the edge of the wound when these two circumstances appear only without a single eruption on any other part of the body the patient is deemed as secure from future infection as if the eruption had been general  when the before recited treatment of the inoculated is strictly followed it is next to a miracle to hear that one in a million fails of receiving the infection or of one that miscarries under it of the multitudes i have seen inoculated in that country the number of pustules have been seldom less than fifty and hardly ever exceeded two hundred since therefore this practice of the east has been followed without variation and with uniform success from the remotest known times it is but justice to conclude it must have been originally founded on the basis of rational principles and experiment  although i was very early prejudiced in preference of the cool regimen and free admission of air in the treatment of this disease yet on my arrival in bengall i thought the practice of the bramins carried both to a bold rash and dangerous extreme but a few years experience gave me full conviction of the propriety of their method this influenced my practice and the success was adequate and i will venture to say that every gentleman in the profession who did not adopt the same mode making a necessary distinction and allowance between the constitutions of the natives and europeans have lost many a patient which might otherwise have been saved as i could prove in many instances where i have been called in too late to be of any assistance but to form a judgment of the propriety of this eastern practice with more precision it will be best to analyze it from the period of the enjoined preparation to the end of the process as thereby an opportunity presents itself of displaying the principles on which the bramins act and by which they justify their singular method of practice  it has been already said that the preparative course consists only in abstaining from fish milk and ghee respecting the first it is known to be a viscid and inflammatory diet tending to foul and obstruct the cutaneous glands and excretory ducts and to create in the stomach and first passages a tough slimy phlegm highly injurious to the human constitution as these are the generally supposed qualities of this diet it seems forbid upon the justest grounds  touching milk which is the basis next to rice of all the natives food i confess i was surprised to find it one of the forbidden articles until i was made acquainted with their reasoning on the subject they say that milk becomes highly nutritious not only from its natural qualities but principally from its ready admission into the blood and quick assimulation with it and that it consequently is a warm heating diet and must have a remote tendency to inflammation whenever the blood is thrown into any preternatural ferment and therefore that milk is a food highly improper at a season when the preternatural fermentation that produces the small pox ought to be feared and guarded against by every person who knows himself liable to the disease or determined to prepare himself for receiving it either from nature or art upon this principle and reasoning it is that their women during the course of their periodical visitations are strictly forbid and religiously abstain from the use of milk lest it should upon any accidental cold dispose the uterus to inflammation and ulceration and from the same apprehension the use of it is as strictly prohibited during the flow of the lochia and is avoided as so much poison our european women resident in india have adopted the same precaution from experience of the effect and will not on any consideration at those times mix the smallest quantity with their tea a lesson they derive from their midwives who are all natives and generally are instructed in their calling by the bramins and other practitioners in physic  concerning the third interdicted article they allege that under that is implied a prohibition of all fat and oily substances as their qualities are nearly similar with those of fish and similar in their effects of fouling the first passages in a high degree above any other aliment that is taken into them that they soon acquire an acrimony in the course of digestion and convey the same into the blood and juices these premises being granted which i think can hardly be denied there appears sufficient cause for prohibiting the use of the whole tribe the more especially as ghee and oil are the essential ingredients used in cooking their vegetable diet  thus far the system of practice pursued by the bramins will i imagine appear rational enough and well founded but they have other reasons for particularly prohibiting the use of these three articles which to some may appear purely speculative if not chimerical they lay it down as a principle that the immediate or instant cause of the small pox exists in the mortal part of every human and animal form in an epidemic season of the confluent small pox turkeys chittygong fowls madrass capons and other poultry are carried off by the disease in great numbers and have the symptoms usually accompanying every stage of the distemper i had a favorite parrot that died of it in the year      in him i had a fair opportunity of observing the regular progress of the disorder he sickened and had an ardent fever full two days before the eruption and died on the seventh day of the eruption on opening him we found his throat stomach and whole channel of the first passages lined as thick with the pustules as the surface of his body where for the most part they rose contiguous but in other places they ran together  that the mediate or second acting cause which stirs up the first and throws it into a state of fermentation is multitudes of imperceptible animalculae floating in the atmosphere that these are the cause of all epidemical diseases but more particularly of the small pox that they return at particular seasons in greater or lesser numbers that these bodies imperceptible as they are to the human organs of vision imprison the most malignant tribes of the fallen angelic spirits that these animalculae touch and adhere to every thing in greater or lesser proportions according to the nature of the surfaces which they encounter that they pass and repass in and out of the bodies of all animals in the act of respiration without injury to themselves or the bodies they pass through that such is not the case with those that are taken in with the food which by mastication and the digestive faculties of the stomach and intestines are crushed and assimulated with the chyle and conveyed into the blood where in a certain time their malignant juices excite a fermentation peculiar to the immediate or instant cause which ends in an eruption on the skin that they adhere more closely and in greater numbers to glutinous fat and oily substances by which they are in a manner taken prisoners that fish milk and ghee have these qualities in a more eminent and dangerous degree and attach the animalculae and convey them in greater quantities into the blood and for these reasons added to those before assigned they are forbid to be taken in food during the preparative course they add that the small pox is more or less epidemical more mild or malignant in proportion as the air is charged with these animalculae and the quantity of them received with the food that though we all receive with our aliment a portion of them yet it is not always sufficient in quantity to raise this peculiar ferment and yet may be equal to setting the seeds of other diseases in motion hence the reason why any epidemical disorder seldom appears alone that when once this peculiar ferment which produces the small pox is raised in the blood the immediate instant cause of the disease is totally expelled in the eruptions or by other channels and hence it is that the blood is not susceptible of a second fermentation of the same kind that inoculating for this disease was originally hinted by the divinity presiding over the immediate instant cause the thought being much above the reach of human wisdom and foresight that the great and obvious benefit accruing from it consists in this that the fermentation being excited by the action of a small portion of matter similar to the immediate cause which bad already passed through a state of fermentation the effects must be moderate and benign whereas the fermentation raised by the malignant juices of the animalculae received into the blood with the aliment gives necessarily addiditional force and strength to the first efficient cause of the disease  that noxious animalculae floating in the atmosphere are the cause of all pestilential and other epidemical disorders is a doctrine the bramins are not singular in however some of the conclusions drawn from it are purely their own a speculative genius may amuse itself by assigning this or that efficient cause or first principle of this disease but the best conjecture which the wisdom of man can frame will appear vague and uncertain nor is it of much moment in the present case to puzzle the imagination by a minute enquiry into the essence of a cause hidden from us when the effects are so visible and chiefly call for our regard but if we must assign a cause why every part of the globe at particular seasons is more liable to peculiar malignant epidemical diseases than at others which experience manifests i see no one that so much wears the complexion of probability as that of pestilent animalculae driven by stated winds or generated on the spot by water and air in a state of stagnation and consequently in a state of putrefaction favorable to their propagation and received into the habit with our food and respiration we yearly see in a greater or lesser degree the baneful effects of these insects in blights although at their first seizure of a plant they are invisible even with the assistance of the best glasses and i hope i shall not be thought to refine too much on the argument if i give it as my opinion that epidemical blights and epidemical diseases of one kind or other may be observed to go often hand in hand with each other from the same identical cause but to proceed in our analysis  the mode by which the eastern inoculators convey the variolous taint into the blood has nothing uncommon in it unless we except the preceding friction upon the part intended for inoculation and moistening the saturated pledget before the application of it for this practice they allege the following reasons that by friction the circulation in the small sanguinary vessels is accelerated and the matter being diluted by a small portion of ganges water is from both causes more readily and eagerly received and the operation at the same time sanctified the friction and dilution of the matter has certainly the sanction of very good common sense and the ganges water i doubt not may have as much efficacy as any other holy water whatsoever this last circumstance however keeps up the piety and solemnity with which the operation is conducted from the beginning to the end of it it tends also to give confidence to the patient and so far is very laudable the reasons they assign for giving the preference to matter of the preceding year are singular and judicious they urge it is more certain in its effects that necessity first pointed out the fact the variolous matter some years not being procurable and experience confirmed it they add that when the matter is effectually secured from the air it undergoes at the return of the season an imperceptible fermentation which gives fresh vigor to its action it is no uncommon thing to inoculate with matter four or five years old but they generally prefer that of a year old conceiving that the fermentation which constitutes its superiority over fresh matter is yearly lessened and consequently the essential spirit of action weakened after the first year  the next article of the eastern practice which offers in the course of our discussion is their sluicing their patients over head and ears morning and evening with cold water until the fever comes on in which the inoculating bramins are beyond controversy singular but before we can penetrate the grounds and reasons for this practice it becomes necessary to bestow a few words on the usual manner of cold bathing in the east when medically applied which is simply this the water is taken up over night in three four or five vessels before described according to the strength of the patient and left in the open air to receive the dews of the night which gives it an intense coldness then in the morning before the sun rises the water is poured without intermission by two servants over the body from the distance of six or twelve inches above the head this mode of cold bathing has been adopted from the eastern professors of physic by all the european practitioners and by constant experience found abundantly more efficacious than that by immersion in all cases where that very capital remedy was indicated notwithstanding it has been ever the received opinion that the success of cold bathing is as much or rather more owing to the weight and pressure of the circumambient body of water than the shock the remarkable superior efficacy of this eastern method of cold bathing can only be accounted for from the shock being infinitely greater and of longer continuance than that received by immersion which is a fact indisputable as will be acknowledged by every one who goes through a course of both methods the severity of the one being nothing comparable to the other this i assert from my own personal feelings and i never had a patient that did not aver the same who had undergone both trials indeed the shock of this eastern method is so great that in many cases when the subject was deeply exhausted and relaxed i have found it absolutely necessary to begin the course only with a quart of water  if the known effects of cold bathing are attended to and its sovereign virtues duly considered in the very different circumstances of palsies rheumatisms general relaxation of the solids and particular relaxation of the stomach and intestines we shall not be long at a loss to account for this part of the eastern practice in the course of inoculation they allege in defense of it that by the sudden shock of the cold water and consequent increased motion of the blood all offensive principles are forcibly driven from the heart brain and other interior parts of the body toward the extremities and surface and at the same time the intended fermentation is thereby more speedily and certainly promoted hence it probably is that the fever generally commences so early as about the close of the sixth day when the fever appears they desist from the use of the cold water because when the fermentation is once begun the blood should not they say receive any additional commotion until the eruption appears when they again resume the cold water and continue it to the end of the disease asserting that the use of it alone by the daily fresh impetus it gives to the blood enables it utterly to expel and drive out the remainder of the immediate cause of the disease into the pustules i have been myself an eyewitness to many instances of its marvelous effect where the pustules have sunk and the patient appeared in imminent danger but almost instantly restored by the application of three or four collans of cold water which never fails of filling the pock as it were by enchantment and so great is the stress laid by the eastern practitioners on this preparative for as the three interdicted articles in food is preparative to the inoculation so this may be deemed preparative to the eruption that when they are called in and find upon enquiry that circumstance and opening the pustules has not been attended to they refuse any further attendance  the next and last article of the eastern practice which falls under our consideration is that just abovementioned viz the opening of the pustules whilst the matter continues in a fluid state that a circumstance so important so selfevidently rational and essential should have been so long unthought of appears most wonderful and if my memory fails me not helvetius is the only writer upon the subject of the small pox that hinted it in practice before doctor tissot this accurate and benevolent physician has enforced it with such strength of judgment and argument that he leaves little room except facts to add to his pathetic persuasive in this he is supported by his learned and elegant commentator and translator doctor kirkpatrick page     and     and i am not without hopes it will contrary to doctor tissots expectation become a general practice the more especially when it is found to have invariable success and venerable antiquity for its sanction  so great is the dependence which the eastern practitioners have on opening the pustules in every malignant kind of the disease that where the fluid state of the matter has been suffered to elapse without being evacuated they pronounce the issue fatal and it generally proves so they order it in every kind even the most distinct for although in these it should seem scarcely necessary yet they conceive it effectually prevents inflammation and weakness of the eyes biles and other eruptions and disorders which so commonly succeed the disease however benign in very critical cases they will not trust the operation of opening the pustules to the nurses or relations but engage in it themselves with amazing patience and solicitude and i have frequently known them thus employed for many hours together and when it has been zealously persevered in i hardly ever knew it fail of either entirely preventing the second fever or mitigating it in such sort as to render it of no consequence in various instances which i have been a witness to in my own and others practice i have seen the pustules in the contiguous kind upon being successively opened fill again to the fourth and fifth and in the confluent to the sixth seventh and eighth time in the very distinct sort they will not fill again more than once or twice and sometimes not at all which was a plain indication that the whole virus of the disease was expelled in the first eruption  the eastern practitioners with great modesty arraign the european practice of phlebotomy and cathartics in any stage of the disease but more particularly when designed to prevent or mitigate the second fever alleging that the first weakens the natural powers and that the latter counteracts the regular course of nature which in this disease invariably tends to throw out the offending cause upon the skin that she often proves unequal to the entire expulsion of the enemy in which case her wise purposes are to be assisted by art in that track which she herself points out and not by a diversion of the usual crisis into another chanel that this assistance can only be attempted with propriety by emptying the pustules as thereby fresh room is given in them for the reception of the circulating matter still remaining in the blood and which could not be contained in the first eruption by which means every end and purpose of averting or subduing the second fever is obtained with a moral certainty whilst phlebotomy and cathartics administered with this view are both irrational and precarious as being opposite to the constant operation of nature in her management of this dreadful disease  it remains only that i add a word or two upon the eastern manner of opening the pustules which as before mentioned is directed to be done with a very fine sharp pointed thorn experience has established the use of this natural instrument in preference to either the scissars launcet or needle the practitioners perforate the most prominent part of the pustule and with the sides of the thorn press out the pus and having opened about a dozen they absorb the matter with a callico rag dipped in warm water and milk and proceed thus until the whole are discharged the orifice made by the thorn is so extremely small that it closes immediately after the matter is pressed out so that there is no admission of the external air into the pustule which would suddenly contract the mouths of the excretory vessels and consequently the further secretion of the variolous matter from the blood would be thereby obstructed for this consideration the method recommended by doctor tissot of clipping the pustules with sharp pointed scissars is certainly liable to objection as the aperture would be too large when in the true confluent kind no distinct pustules present they perforate the most prominent and promising parts in many places at the distance of a tenth of an inch usually beginning at the extremities and i have often seen the pustules in the contiguous and the perforated parts in the confluent kind fill again before the operation has been half over yet they do not repeat the opening until a few hours elapse conceiving it proper that the matter should receive some degree of concoction in the pustules before it is again discharged  if the foregoing essay on the eastern mode of treating the small pox throws any new and beneficial lights upon this cruel and destructive disease or leads to support and confirm the present successful and happy method of inoculation in such wise as to introduce into regular and universal practice the cool regimen and free admission of air the contrary having proved the bane of millions i shall in either case think the small time and trouble bestowed in putting these facts together most amply recompensed  chilton lodge wilts september        finis
