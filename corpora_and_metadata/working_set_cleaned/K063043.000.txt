the maid of kent a comedy  price one shilling and sixpence  act  th scene  d    the maid of kent  a comedy acted at the theater royal in drury lane  london printed for g robinson no    paternoster row and p norbury brentford  mdcclxxviii  advertisement three or four years having elapsed since the representation of the following trifle it will no doubt be thought extraordinary that it should make its appearance in print just at the time when so capital a production as the school for scandal engrosses all theatrical attention in some degree to excuse the illtiming of this publication the author assures the public that the copyright was disposed of and some sheets of it in the press before that comedy appeared otherwise they would never have been troubled with this apology or the cause of it  to the ladies and gentlemen who by their admirable performance of this first essay and excellent delivery of the prologue and epilogue to it obtained such applause to them as in themselves they could not merit the maid of kent is most gratefully inscribed by their much obliged servant  the author jan         prologue spoken by mr king when a melodious lark ascending sings the wide expanse with shrilly echoes rings till strongly winging his aerial way to sight he is lost warbling his heavntund lay not so when the young bird first ttempts a flight emerging from his nest to dazzling light  with fluttering pinions halfformd notes dimmed eyes from the too powerful glare he trembling hies to some thick wood low copse or shady grove where he secure from birds of prey may rove where safely he may try his feeble wings there flits from spray to spray and faintly sings patient remains till strength and art are won then soars and warbles against the noonday sun but when he ventures first texplore the sky should criticbuzzard hawk or kite be nigh skimming and winding round then on him dart his beak and talons dig into his heart no more he sings no more can ever fly his artless song and self together die so will it fare with our greenbird or sparrow if groveling found you over him draw the harrow no more he will chirrup his insipid note or vainly gurgle his discordant throat o loss of losses  never to be recovered  a greenbird in a furrow you have smothered but say youre merciful and stead of killing the venurous fool to rear him should be willing pleased he will crack rapeseed bucket raise of water to amuse yourself spouse son and pretty daughter and while he grunsell picks or chickweed eats will chirping thank each generous heart that treats may learn the linnets larks canarys song his tuneful life if kindly you prolong and strive each hour timprove his simple lay in clearer strains your favors to repay  dramatis personae lord sealand mr davies sir thomas richacre

bradshaw scene  sir thomas richacres seat near the seacoast in kent  time  an afternoon  the maid of kent act i scene a study in sir thomas richacres house doctor goodman and emily are discovered sitting the doctor shutting a book they presently rise dr goodman here madam if you please well conclude the labor of the day   emily call it rather the pleasure of the day sir  for such it is to me i assure you  to you indeed sir i fear it must be otherwise  the instruction of a silly girl no doubt is painful and tedious   dr good pardon me madam i did not call it labor in that sense so far am i from thinking it irksome the hours i pass in this our every mornings exercise and the duties of my holy function are the happiest of my life  for believe me were you my own child instead of my honored patrons i could not love you better   emily nor do i think sir thomass affection although the best of fathers exceeds the very paternal regard you have ever been pleased to express for me  and  i know not why  i think i feel not a more filial love for him than for yourself sir   dr good dear madam say not so  the many hours we pass together in our delightful studies beget in you a customary regard  think it no more   emily perhaps it is no more sir nay it cannot  for never had a child a kinder parent   dr good nor ever had a man a truer friend indeed so general is his goodness he might be a pattern for mankind  he never saw an infant without a parents fondness or a gray head but like a child he honored it   sir thomas richacre enters sir thom ha ha what hard at it  what is it  ethics or mathematics astrology or theology  it is a thousand pities doctor your pupil is a girl otherwise she would certainly be a bishop in time   emily perhaps not papa  you see dr goodman with as much piety learning good sense and i am sure as good a heart as any has hitherto attained to no greater dignities than rector of this parish your chaplain sir and my tutor   dr good were i madam what you are pleased to say of me it does not at all follow i should ever be so exalted  there are no doubt an infinitely greater number of deserving ministers than there are mitres or even inferior dignities but whoever has attained to that of an honest man will feel that church or state can never raise him higher   sir thom i think so too doctor and in that respect there is not a more exalted character than yourself   dr good heaven forbid sir   sir thom but all this while i forget your boy doctor  i made my mornings airing shorter than usual that i might be in the way when he arrived  he is not come yet i suppose   dr good no sir   emily does young mr goodman come home from oxford to day sir   dr good yes madam i expect him   emily bless me i thought he was not to have come till next week sir   sir thom yes yes he will be here to day and then you may have a new tutor for i suppose you have almost tired your old one  i warrant by this time he can speak greek as well as his father what think you doctor   dr good i not only think that of him sir but were he not my own i could be bold to say he is the most accomplished youth i ever saw and add to that  the best   sir thom ay ay george is a good boy  ay and a clever one too  every body says so as well as yourself  but if they did not the crow you know always thinks her own young whitest ha ha ha  let me see looking at his watch it is past one  will the rogue be here to dinner think you   dr good i expect him every moment sir   sir thom od i wish he was come i have not seen him this age  and are not you glad he is coming emily   emily yes indeed sir very glad  for i think him a most amiable young man and have often thought it a thousand pities he is not heir to a good fortune as this idolatrous world of ours still worshipping a golden calf would value him much more for inheriting a fund of wealth than virtues  and a rich coxcomb is oftener proposed to us poor girls than the most deserving of our affections whose merits are not backed with that powerful recommendation  a great estate   sir thom it is very true my dear  too often the case i must confess   emily and i make no doubt but even our ridiculous worthless neighbor lord sealands addresses would be esteemed an honor and plain george goodmans an affront to most great families in the kingdom   sir thom why he is a peer of the realm you know   emily true papa and there are very few so illbred as to think a coronet may sometimes cover a weak head or a glittering star a bad heart   sir thom ha ha well said my little satirist  we are to be honored with his lordships company to day at dinner on purpose to see george   dr good his lordship has been always kind enough to take great notice of my poor boy   emily that is the only proof of understanding he ever gave  and but for that he would be intolerable with his unaccountable whims and caprices  now own papa dont you think it a strange amusement he has lately taken to keeping sailing vessels to be so often tossing about on the sea as he is   sir thom why ay child i think it rather too boisterous to be called pleasure but he seldom makes a much longer trip than just across to calais to furnish himself with some of their knicknacks and fopperies   emily right papa for such a finical waterfly is he that when on shore he lays out more money in powder and perfumes in a week than i fear he gives to the poor in a year  i never see him papa but i think of beau mizen in the play ha ha ha   sir thom well but emily my dear you of all people in the world should not be so severe upon him he is a very warm admirer of you you know and has almost asked my consent to marry you   emily he is not a bit more in my good graces for that i assure you papa for could he obtain your consent i believe he would care very little whether he had mine or not   dr good but sir thomas i am persuaded madam will never grant one without the other   emily that i confide in sir  i suppose i shall be teizd to death with his supercilious nonsense to day which he gives me to understand he means for courtship   sir thom and are not you delighted at the very idea of being his lady  countess of sealand   emily not i indeed papa lud lud what a character a foppish sailor a compound of tar and civet faugh  i would sooner marry our honest old meter yonder and be dame to the clerk of the parish   sir thom ha ha ha here comes the old psalmsinger as fast as he can hobble   emily poor good old man he is worth a courtcalendar full of such lords   meter enters meter your reverence your reverence  goodlack i most humbly crave your worships pardon for my abrupt intrusion to sir thomas but i come a joyful harbinger as i am a sinner sir your wellbeloved son is just arrived to the doctor   dr good indeed   sir thom is he faith old sternhold   meter yes in truth your worship or may i never set another stave   emity looking out o lud ay he is just stepping out of the postchaise  bless me  what a figure i am  i  i beg pardon sir but indeed i cannot stay  i must go and make myself a little more fit to be seen   exit emily sir thom did you observe the girl doctor   dr good most heedfully sir  and fear    meter he approaches your honors he approaches   sir thom ay here he comes sure enough   george enters george your blessing sir kneeling to dr goodman   dr good heaven grant thee grace   george my honored patron my second father to sir thomas i cannot resist an impulse that throws me at your feet and bids me beg your blessing too   sir thom heaven bless and preserve you my good lad   george my dear father forgive this transport  i fear it hurries me into a neglect i would sooner die than willingly be guilty of  but  this meeting overpowers me  dont be offended sir to sir thomas at the frankness of a poor lad like me  indeed i am very happy to see you sir i hope both you sir and my dear father are as well as    sir thom well odzookers who can be ill and look such a ruddycheekd rogue as you in the face  faith you look bravely my lad  and a devilish handsome young dog you are grown rare work i warrant he has made at oxford doctor how many dozen have you left crying their eyes out eh george   george you are merry sir   sir thom well but  joking apart  have you left never a little tender soul breaking her heart after you  a sweetheart eh george for i will engage you have got one boy   george to what end sir so young and unprovided for as i am  but excuse me sir for interrupting you by hoping miss richacre is well   sir thom ay emily is pure hearty and as reserved as yourself  she wont confess the power of the little blind boy any more than you   george the longer she is sir before she makes her choice we may reasonably hope the better it will be  but i believe sir she may wait long indeed before she finds one to deserve her   sir thom odzookers george that is a civiler thing than ever i heard lord sealand say of her with all his courtship   george lord sealand aside i  i hope sir i do not offend in speaking my sentiments so freely   sir thom offend no no boy  i like you the better for speaking your thoughts  i wish all mankind did so they would not be the worse for it   meter then with your worships indulgence i can withhold no longer  as i am an unworthy sinner sir to george i am more delighted to behold you than a full congregation and that is the delight of my old heart   george what my good old friend nothing but my extreme joy at seeing my honored parent and protector could have made me overlook you  i am very glad to see you  i hope you are well taking meter kindly by the hand   meter in troth the better for seeing you well sir wiping his eyes   george ah my old playfellow thou have born me on this back a thousand times   meter and a pleasant load thou were my ever gentle taskmaster he he he  and in like sportful sort although i am waxen old i hope to live to bear your tender offspring   george no my poor yorick time will i fear bear you away first   sir thom not so neither george  for as my mother used to say to me those eyes of yours will make many a pretty girls heart ach  so dont be timorous lad but look about you and if you take a liking to a girl let her be who she may attack her boldly  i am a whimsical old fellow and if i take it into my head may make you worth her having   dr good sir i fear your goodness will    sir thom pho pho be quiet doctor  you know i am not like too many in the world easily talked out of a good design or into a bad one  but tell us george sincerely now we are upon the subject have you really never a sweetheart at oxford   george no i assure you sir  i never saw a face there that made the least impression on me   sir thom and you are heartwhole ha   george as when i left this house sir sighing aside   sir thom why how have you passed your time lad always at your studies   george pretty constantly sir  the only return in my power for your great bounty to me was the making a proper use of it  but if i may be so bold sir i think you mentioned something of lord sealands having paid his addresses to miss richacre   sir thom ay george i believe i might    george but i think sir you said too that miss emily had not hitherto confessed any particular inclination    sir thom why no  but he is very rich  and when a suitor is both wealthy and noble you know    george very true sir   metre talks apart with dr goodman sir thom not that i believe emily likes him a jot better for those accidental advantages as she calls them  she and i are much of a mind about him for in my opinion he is but a frothy kind of a spark like too many of the present age  and it is paying you no compliment george to say such a lad as you are is worth a score such as lord sealand george bows respectfully   dr good i fear sir what you are pleased to say of my poor boy will make him vain   sir thom vain of what such an old fellow as i say no no  if emily had said as much indeed  but doctor i must rob you of georges company a little  come boy  you must go and ask my girl how she is  she will be glad to see you i am sure  she just saw you alight and scamperd away to set her cap strait or some such important matter  come along my boy and i will promise you a kiss for your pains   exit sir thomas richacre george will you excuse me a few moments my dear sir while i pay my respects to miss richacre   dr good ay ay attend sir thomas by all means  meantime i will step and see a poor cottager hard by who meter has just been telling me is very ill   george you are as humane as ever sir heaven bless you   dr good and you too my dear boy   exeunt dr goodman and george severally meter amen and heaven be with you both for such a father and such a son are hardly to be paralleled  no marvel his good worship is so well pleased in ye  he whese benignity extends even unto my unworthy self and my poor child martha whom he has most benevolently reared as waitingmaid unto his fair daughter from childhood even unto womanhood  and in commiseration of my forlorn condition when my loving helpmate rebecca departed this transitory life bountifully took me to end my days in peace in his most hospitable mansion   going emily and patty enter patty lord maam there is nobody here but my father    meter whom seeks her good ladyship martha   emily i thought mr goodman had been here   meter no madam  his reverence is gone to visit the afflicted   emily o no  i dont mean the doctor but george goodman  i met his father this moment and he said he was this way   meter good madam i most humbly crave forgiveness for my misapprehension  my dearly beloved young master departed hence but even now indeed to accompany his worship in order to pay his most dutiful respects unto your ladyship

peep at him as he passed through the hall and he did look so handsome you cannot think   emily i wish you are not in love with him girl   patty ah madam if i was as much his betters as he is mine i would soon tell him a piece of my mind   emily why really the youths not amiss  i had a glimpse of him myself and think him considerably improved i must confess  his complexion more florid and air more lively than when he left us   patty ay maam that he is more lively and more lovely too than ever and so you would say maam i am sure if you spoke your thoughts   emily indeed and pray how came you so well acquainted with my thoughts   patty why maam the dressing glass discovered them to me  for you have looked more in it since you knew young mr goodman was arrived than ever i knew you in all my life before  and i will be whipped if you dont wish to appear as handsome in his eyes as he does in yours   emily o you wicked girl how can you say so   patty indeed maam if i was as rich as your ladyship and we were both at our own disposal i fancy we should puzzle the poor young gentleman which to choose  for his choice he might have that is certain   emily and in that case you think he would be puzzled which to choose   smiling patty o dear maam i had quite forgot one thing  that is  if i was as beautiful as your ladyship   curtsying emily o your ladyships most obedient curtsying and so you have quite forgot your sweetheart william   patty william  yes  no maam  that is  o gemini maam here the sweet gentleman comes as sure as a gun   emily eh what where   confused sir thomas

so desirous now of seeing him that i gave her leave to come with me   meter enters meter so please your worship the right honorable the earl of sealand is just alighting from his gilded chariot   sir

what a whimsical old soul it is   george but exceeding kind and honest  at least to me  he knows no bounds to his good wishes for my welfare  which is all i can say in extenuation of his freedom now to you madam   emily o the wellmeaning good creature cannot easily offend me   george have a care dear madam your condescension dont destroy the respect i should preserve    emily let me beg of you to forget those distant words respect and madam  our compliments are over though with much difficulty smiling let us now resume that innocent familiarity we were bred together in and ever were delighted with  when we parted last you was less ceremonious then instead of madam you called me your emily  nay more your dear emily   george that i still might without a crime for sure there can be nothing dearer to me   emily then why this distance  this reserve   george o emily think but of your condition your rank in life and think of mine   emily and shall that lay a restraint upon our lips  must they be denied to express what our hearts will feel forgetful of distinction   george what my heart feels they cannot express  gratitude love admiration all the most susceptible can feel or eloquent describe is there  my dearest emily still i must call you so  why are you thus kind  thus condescending    emily in what  prithee now where is the mighty difference between us is not your father in every respect but the lowest of all considerations riches as good as mine and wherein can i pretend to vie with thee who art an abstract of both their virtues  but we grow serious  besides you have to dress and see that odious sealand which this detains you from so till we meet at dinner dear george adieu   exit emily george adieu sweet emily lovely engaging bewitching emily o that i were but rich enough to dare aspire to thee never did i repine at want of fortune but on thy account and when i find that the only bar to my success i must repine since were i not the child of poverty and dependence what might i not hope  her partiality for me i think is evident  and my determination to conquer this illsuited passion she has in one moment utterly destroyed he stands musing   patty enters patty i gave my father the slip nicely  and here he is yet  and alone too that is charming now who knows but i may have better luck than i had before aside  pray sir is not my young lady here george does not observe her hoity toity why he is speechless again  may be he is always so when he wants to kiss a pretty girl  i wish sir thomas would pop in his head and cry as he did just now kiss her boy kiss her again aside  sir sir  pray is not madam emily here   george starting from his reverie ha emily what of emily   patty nothing sir  only i thought she had been here    george yes no  she has just left me  the happiest yet most wretched of mankind aside   exit george patty not one kiss by jingo i could cry for madness i suppose he is proud and thinks himself too much above me  marry come up and yet  he is a pretty gentleman and if i was as rich as a jew i would marry him directly  stay  let me consider  i have got a little money by me that my father knows nothing of if i dont buy a lotteryticket i will be burnt  and if i get the twentythousandpoundprize nay if i am so unlucky as to get only the tenthousand i will tell him my mind directly  and sure then he will not think himself above me i have heard say that in london the gentry  ay even your lords and dukes now and then marry poor girls that are pretty  like me for love  nay though i hardly know how to believe it folks say they will sometimes take up with their own ay or other peoples keptmadams and i am sure it would not be a quarter so bad as that for a parsons son to marry a clerks daughter   exit patty end of the first act act ii scene sir thomas richacres garden  a summer house in view  meter comes out of the summer house william meets him carrying a chair william here master meter here be another chair and now it be all right i believe  there be two for madam emily and young master goodman  two elbowones for sir thomas and his reverence and this gilded damask one you bid me fetch for my lord  but ecod if i was his worship i would set upon it myself   meter ha ha ha  well put it into the summer house with the rest that is my good lad   william never stir if i dont believe it be made of lead it feels so plaguey heavy  thof i suppose i only think so cause i fetched it with an ill will  for to be sure i did grudge my labor most confoundedly   meter why so william i never knew thee idle yet  why so   william why because i dont like un  and it goes mortally again the grain with me to do any thing for such a scapegrace  for as the old saving be  he is like the wind at east good to neither man nor beast   meter for shame william for shame you should not speak so disrespectfully of a nobleman   william nobleman why i hope master meter you dont think such a whiffling chap as lord sealand deserves to be called noble i will be judged by yourself now if he be one crumb like his worship or a quarter so noble  thof he be no more but a knightbarrowknight   meter i profess william i do not think this light young lord so deserving of his dignity as our nobles in general are said to be which makes me most heartily wish he was more like his worships honor than he is   william more like un i will be shot an he be a bit like un  no more than a crabapple be like a goldenpippin i wonder for my part nay for that matter so do the whole neighborhood why such a good gentleman as sir thomas keeps company with him and lets him come dangling here for ever ater young madam like a tantonypig   meter why thou know william his lordship has a great estate adjoining to his worships  and although he has it not in his will i fear to do much good it is in his power to do a great deal of harm therefore i conjecture his worship holds it prudent to keep friends with him   william more the pity i say master meter that what few good men there be in the world should be obligated to truckle to the bad  or that any one should have a good estate that has not a good heart likewise   meter william thou art an honest righteous lad i verily believe and although it has pleased heaven to place thee in so humble a station the uprightness of thy heart would adorn the princes and the rulers of the land more than their costly raiment precious stones purple and fine linen   william thanks to your kind opinion master meter  i do hope i shall never prove no otherwise   meter i am morally certain thou will not  hold forth thy hand  there is a shilling for thee  and i will bestow upon thee too a donation of good books particularly the old and new testament the liturgy with thereunto annexed the old and new version of the psalms of david done into english meter   william thank you kindly  odsbobs i shall be quite set up    meter moreover i will recommend thee unto his reverence to succeed me in my holy office upon my demise    william what me to be clerk and sexton oh lord   meter to qualify thee for which important undertaking i will instruct thee in every thing appertaining unto a clerkship  particularly in psalmody  likewise how to adapt as well as set a stave  and eke also both audibly and emphatically to cry amen   william i shall soon learn for i know all the notches already and can give the key with the pitchpipe and sing fol fa with ever a he in the parish  and as to amen  no offense master meter i hope  but i could say it twice as laudable as you do   meter audible thou would say william  and audibly did i use to say it  but alackaday i am waxen old and my voice is impaired  but when i was thy age  hem a  a  men   speaking as loud as he can william puts

only be so good to tell patty i want to speak with her   meter i will communicate your ladyships pleasure unto her incontinently  ah when young i had a voice like any bell  and as the old song says could dig a grave and set a stave and say amen full well aside as he goes off   exit meter  william returns and is following meter emily calls him emily william   william maam   emily step to the cottage below our gardendoor in the greenlane i am told the poor labourer there is ill and the family in great distress  give this to the poor woman  gives money and be careful not to mention it to any body else i charge you   william no indeed maam i will never open my lips about it but when i am praying heaven to bless and preserve your ladyships goodness   emily run then william as fast as you can and go out at the gardendoor that none of our family may see you   william yes maam i will  i am sure i should not think this a heavy load if it weighed as much again as the gilt chair for i should like to be so employed from one weeks end to the other   exit william emily what a humane creature such goodness must not go unrewarded  how different are our natures this uninstructed boy possessing virtues too seldom met with in the most exalted  what then avail a pompous title wealth and illustrious ancestry since the meanest peasant possessing but humanity has no superior while the heart that cannot feel for others woes disgraces not only a distinguished rank but even our very nature   patty enters patty did you want me maam my father said    emily yes patty my papa intends passing the afternoon in the summer house so order coffee and tea to be served there   patty yes maam   going emily patty  have you seen any thing of young mr goodman since dinner   patty yes maam i saw him steal slily by the hall windows a little while ago  i dont know where he went but i have a notion he has seen some trollop in the neighborhood as he came along in the postchaise that he has taken a liking to and is gone in search of  and i am sure that is a shame when he might pick and choose out of the two prettiest in the whole county   emily why patty this is love in downright earnest  i will be whipped if you have not quite forgot poor william and are jealous of this young gentleman   patty jealous not i indeed maam  william is worth a dozen of him  young gentleman he dont behave like one that is what he dont for he has not once had the good manners to offer to salute me since he came home   emily poor patty that is provoking indeed    patty yes maam  i believe you would think it was if he had served you so   emily indeed ha ha ha why i wish you are not jealous of me next   patty no maam i am pretty secure there if i really did like him well enough to care about him  for your ladyship being heiress to so many thousand pounds a year he would never dare to make love to you maam  and i hope maam setting case you was weak enough to like the poor lad you would never demean yourself so much as to tell him so   emily i dont know that patty for setting case as you phrase it i liked him i should make very little scruple of confessing it   patty indeed lord lord how little pride some people have if i was a baronets daughter i would never think of taking up with a poor clergymans son when i might marry a lord and be a countess   emily a mind like his would reflect a luster upon the meanest origin and i desire patty you would restrain this freedom nor make so free with mr goodmans name again   patty dear heart maam i did but just speak  and i should not have said what i have had not your ladyship asked me about him  if i am a little jealous of him there is somebody to the full as jealous of me   emily how i am tormented with this silly girl while my mind is

puzzled a stranger to tell which of the two ailed most young gentleman looked so piteously   emily indeed was young mr goodman there   william yes indeed maam    emily my minds at rest again aside   william and the poor woman told me he had been there a good while and had writ a description to be made up at pottecarys for her husband and had guve em money to pay for it and more to buy victuals with and kissed the sweet babes and was so kind to em nothing could be like it   emily the dear the amiable youth how could i wrong him by my late ungenerous fears aside   william and when i came out

like that    emily what the cottage you had just come out of   william yes indeed maam  into poor quicksets little hut  but i could not see lord sealand thof i looked all about  and if he had gone

again to the cottage the other way and watch till their honors be gone in at garden door then make the poor souls have the money whether they will or not   exit william emily married to lord sealand i shudder to hear it mentioned whence could such a report take rise from himself or from sir thomas sure my dear father kind to all besides will never single me out to be cruel to and as he does nothing without his worthy friends advice surely the good the pious doctor goodman never can approve it  why should i fear then  and yet i do  the bare idea that it is possible makes me tremble  gracious heaven how dreadful is my present situation demanded by a worthless insolent i detest hopeless of him i cannot choose but love oh george where is the spot or what the condition i should not think a paradise with thee rather than share a kingdom with lord sealand lord sealand sings without heavens here comes the hateful wretch  let me endeavor to conceal my agitation   lord sealand enters l sealand emily my divine creature how could you be so cruel to leave me to mope and grow stupid for want of your animating brilliancy and vivacity twas abolutely barbarous carissima mia   emily those are qualities my lord i am not happy enough to possess  but surely it is impossible for lord sealand ever to be grave whose animating brilliancy and vivacity would dispel the gloom of a greenland winter   l sealand o you flatterer but perhaps you really think so  do you my adorable make me happy by confessing it   emily i dare say your lordship has not the least doubt but every body thinks so   l sealand mia bella signora i see you do  i read it in those eyes whose brightness i adore more than the beacons on the southforeland when i am returning from calais in a hazy evening   emily calais bless me does your lordship ever venture so far   l sealand far o child that is nothing to me who have even had thoughts of sailing up the baltic or crossing the bay of biscay merely to kiss the empresss fair hand and the popes great toe and for a kiss of those divine lips i would explore the northeastpassage nor think i flatter you my angel when i swear that neither flip when i am aboard or capillaire ashore are half so dear to me   emily you do me great honor indeed my lord  but does your lordship ever taste the liquor they call flip   l sealand taste it ay many a can do i toss off when i have my watchcoat and trowsers on and am turning to windward in a brisk gale  but the flip i drink is not like the vile stuff commonly so called for mine has a most delicate flavor as i always mix it with capillaire   emily well it is amazing to me what could induce a person of your lordships delicacy to venture upon this dangerous amusement you have lately taken a fancy to   l sealand why faith mia cara i commenced sailor merely to avoid the imputation of effeminacy  though if we meet with any bad weather at sea i immediately retire to my cabin and order my pilot oconnor to make for land with all convenient speed   emily ha ha ha you are perfectly in the right upon my word my lord   l sealand but let us change the coarse indelicate subject  i am almost tired of the scheme and another seasickness will make me drop it i believe  pray what is become of george first he walked off  then you mia crudel deserted us  and soon after sir thomas asked me to go with him to see the sick fellow old goodman was speaking of  as if i had been a physician  which i declining he took away domine and left me to indulge in soliloquy just as i was concluding our marriage ma chere upon honor i have not been treated so politely ever since i lodged with mynheer vanderdunder the fat burgomaster at rotterdam   emily concluding our marriage did you say my lord   l sealand si signora  we were on the very brink of settling the preliminaries   emily why does your lordship really suppose we are to be married   l sealand is it possible you can still make that a question have not i told you repeatedly i would marry you my angel   emily but did i ever consent to marry your lordship   l sealand consent egad i dont recollect i ever asked you  on purpose to spare your confusion in consenting as i am sure my adorable will taking her by the hand   emily perhaps your lordship may be deceived   george enters george what do i see emily and lord sealand hand in hand distraction now i am lost indeed  but she seems averse to him  why then should i tamely give her up what is his fortune title birth to me i have a mind as noble name as fair though unadorned with honors and possessions  but i rave  and if perceived shall be thought a mean listner to their converse retiring   l sealand ha george where have you been you runaway in some dull arbor i suppose poring over your musty greek   george i beg pardon my lord for this accidental intrusion    l sealand o you are come quite opportunely to help me soften the rigor of this obdurate fair one   george i shall be but an indifferent advocate for love my lord  it is a language i have not been used to talk   l sealand pho pho tell me something monstrous tender now out of your ovid catullus tibullus or any of the soft amorous dogs suited to the extreme violence of my passion   george were i in your place my lord i should rather follow their example than barely repeat their words  they never said any thing to the object of their wishes but what was dictated and inspired by love itself   l sealand ay that is true  but a rough tar as i am cannot be supposed to have so many fine expressions ready on these occasions as you studying rhyming sonneteers and lady sealand like a tender mother would never suffer me to read or study much for fear of spoiling my eyes or making my head ache  come do now say something monstrous clever for me  and in the mean time as i fancy my dad that is to be is returned by this i shall go and make you happy my angel by concluding the treaty with him   emily my lord  be not so precipitate i entreat your lordship   l scaland he i am sure will be no less proud of the honor of having me for a soninlaw than you my charmer are to have me for a husband  therefore mia cara sposa think what day will be most agreeable to you for the celebration of our nuptials but for your own sake as well as mine let me entreat you not to delay our felicity too long  addio jusquau revoir addio mia

miserable  oh georgel do not think lightly of me for this declaration  i would sooner beg with thee than shine in all the splendour this wretchs utmost power could place me   george dearest emily think not of me  had providence designed us for each other my lot in life had been more suited to your birth  as it is though i have presumed to love i never cherished hope  for not even to gain thee emily would i abuse my honored patrons confidence may you sweet maid but meet one more deserving while i pray heaven to bless and to protect you   emily do not talk so  thee only can i love to thee only will i ever give my hand  i am sure my father will never force me to marry sealand or any one against my will  and perhaps some blessed moment may incline him to prefer my poor but virtuous george   george no more no more sweet emily i cannot bear it   emily well well drop the subject  pray did you see sir thomas just now where you have been   george where i have been    emily yes at the cottage down the lane  william told me all   george did he  but it is no great matter for the poor woman told me all too when she returned from the door whither william had taken her to deliver your benefaction  and likewise that sir thomas and my father were talking with him in the lane  whereon suspecting they were coming there i quitted the cot immediately and returned another way unperceived by them   sir thomas richacre and dr goodman enter sir thom why george where have been lad i have been seeking you   george sir i was only  hesitating   sir thom come come never blush at a good action

 and so is yours my dear good girl  but pray have you seen nothing of my lord lately emily i expected to have found him here for when i asked him to go with me he declined it saying he would walk a turn or two in the garden with you till i returned   emily he was here just now papa and after addressing me in a most insolent manner saying he was sure both you sir and myself would be proud of his alliance he left me as he said to conclude the treaty with you   sir thom he did ha o come along i will conclude it presently   emily sir i hope  dear sir to dr goodman speak to my papa  for heavens

duke in the land if he had no better a heart than lord sealand   emily then i am happy   george and i aside   patty enters patty maam lord sealand sent me to beg the favor of your ladyship to come and play a tune upon your harpsichord till sir thomas returned  which as you came in the garden way his lordship did not know you was sir   sir thom a tune eh  ay ay well go play him a tune directly  i will soon put you out of your pain i warrant you  for when he hears what must be known before you marry any one and what i believe i shall now tell him i fancy he will give over the chase of his own accord   george heavens what can that be aside to emily   sir thom if he does not you will perhaps think better of him than you do at present and willingly be lady sealand   emily never sir i am certain   sir thom well well there is no knowing  we shall see  go children go before us   george come my sweet emily   emily what can my father mean aside to each other   george i know not what to think whether to with or dread an explanation   emily nor i  but be it what it may assure yourself dear george i never will be lady sealand   exeunt george and emily sir thom i believe my good old friend no better time than now for the discovery   dr good i think so too dear sir  heaven prosper the event   sir thom shall she be sealands if he holds his purpose   dr good by no means sir and

gemini i am in great hopes she will have my lord and if she does i think i stand no bad chance of having young mr goodman oh lud the very thoughts of it make me almost out of my wits  but hang this

better of his modesty and ask me i must even try if i cannot conquer mine and ask him   william enters william ecod here she be  i have found the little baggage at last  why patty love i thought i

forget yourself so much   william why patty you be only joking sure  come gi us a buss you little crosspatch you   patty why william you have been drinking sure or you could never be so bold   william drinking patty  i dont know what you mean by such an insinivation as that  i believe ay and you knows it too as well as i do there bent a soberer lad in all the parish  drinking  lord help me  if i have swallowed a drop or a crumb of any thing since breakfast but one horn of ale and a bit of meat as big as my three fingers i am a drunkard and a glutton into the bargain and i would as lief be thought a thief as either  so you should not say that of me patty   patty bless me mr william i said nothing about your eating  it is nothing to me what you eat or drink either  what do you think i care or whether you ever eat or drink again or not   william indeed  if i thought you was in earnest patty i dont think i ever should   patty well that is none of my business you know  i dont concern myself about inferior servants  all i desire of you is that you will not make so free with me for the future as you have had the confidence to do lately for i am determined i will not put up with it   william why i am sure you cannot say i ever behaved uncivil to you patty  and if so be i have made bold to tell you i loved you i said naught but truth  ay and you have said as much to me more than once for all youre so scornful now   patty i say i loved you no william  i own i had a sort of friendship for you because i thought you an honest young man and so forth  but love o no william i am very sorry you mistook my civility  i never had such a thought i assure you  i have very different views   william patty  eh  what do you say  dont you go to  dear patty  odrabbit it my hearts so full i cannot speak to her  and if i could help it i would never speak to her again   patty i should be very glad of it  and i desire nay i insist upon it that you never offer to open your lips to me again for if you do i shant answer you and so your servant   william stay patty  one word more before we break off our courtship  for a courtship it has been say what you will  ay and a tender one too or else when i set off for oxford so long ago with master george    patty george you make very free with your betters methinks  it might be mr goodman in your mouth   william ay bless his dear soul there is no name too kind for him  but as i was going to say  if so be you was not in love with me as well as i in love with you why did you break this bit of gold with me which i have worn next my heart ever since but i will be hanged if i wear it any longer  come off rot thee  there there is your keepsake your lovetoken again and youre a falsehearted girl  and if you will promise never to speak to me again i never will to you while i have breath in my body   patty i believe there is no great need of promising on my side i shall not be the first to break the silence i dare say   william why then fare thee well patty my hearts my own again   patty ay and a good riddance take up with a footman indeed when i have such a prospect of being a gentlewoman  i wonder whod be fool then i am sure i will not be such a one and so your servant mr william   exit patty william and your servant mrs patt if you go to that  a murrain take her for a scornful young toad bawls after her i dont care a brass thimble for you no nor a pins point  and youre a base deceitful falsehearted  bursts out a crying odrabbit it i dont think i shall get the better of this the longest day i have to live   exit william the contrary way end of the second act act iii scene the summer house  lord sealand sir thomas richacre doctor goodman george and emily discovered seated lord sealand and now the decks are cleared of the tea equipage if you please sir thomas well resume our topic   sir thom with all my heart my lord the sooner we come to the point the better   george rising you have some private business with his lordship i believe sir    sir thom o no there are no secrets going forward george at least none that are to remain so  you need not stir boy   george with your leave sir i will take a turn or two in the garden the while  aside i dread the event nor dare i stay to hear it  heaven preserve you my dear  lost emily   exit george lord sealand now sir if you please  for i wait with as much impatience as a becalmed vessel for a brisk gale to drive her safe into port   sir thom a brisk gale quotha ecod i have a notion there will blow such a breeze presently as will go near to overset you my lord  or that your vessel not being heart of oak will spring a leak for our discourse will take a turn you little think of   emily dear papa permit me to retire rising   sir thom by no means my dear  there is a particular reason why you should be present otherwise indeed it might be deemed a solecism in forms  but dont be alarmed for i have not the most distant idea that this will come to any thing   l sealand what a savage  o sir well dispense with a little form  to the point if you please lady sealand and i are all attention   emily aside insolent and cruel   sir thom to begin then  your lordship has addressed this young woman    l sealand this angel this goddess whom i adore   sir thom plain english if you please my lord  and demanded her of me in marriage  pray now if i may be so bold what is your lordships motive for it   l sealand what can it be but the most ardent passon   sir thom for her   l sealand for her who else dear sir could i possibly    sir thom say rather what else   l sealand i dont understand you sir   sir thom why your lordship being no doubt pretty well informed of the value of my rentroll is that or this taking emily by the hand the goddess you adore   l sealand this is mighty strange sir thomas    sir thom no offense i hope my lord  but as i must be assured that whoever marries her has no other motive than a real a disinterested affection for herself this is the single question upon your answer to which depends the event   l sealand propose it dear sir propose it   sir thom if instead of being daughter to a baronet and heiress to a very considerable estate she had no other recommendation or endowment than her own beauty and virtue would you my lord or would you not raise her to the rank of lady sealand   l sealand is it possible sir you can have a doubt of it what is the condition i would not raise her from   sir thom emily my dear come hither  i am going to lose thee my little cherub   emily sir is it possible    sir thom the time is come sweet child i must resign thee   emily to dr goodman good sir support me  i cannot  oh faints   dr good to sir thomas dear sir her spirits are quite overcome    l sealand dont be alarmed gentlemen  nothing but the mauvaise honte usual on these occasions  or perhaps the excess of joy may have been too powerful for her  where the devil is my eaudeluce  look up carissima mia sposa   emily reviving o my dear father    sir thom one kiss sweet girl and i resign that name  for i am not your father    emily gracious heaven    l sealand what do you say sir thomas   sir thom i am not her father  and now my lord determine  here she is as rich in personal and mental gifts as she is poor in fortune for she has none   l sealand the devil what a narrow escape i had like to have weighed anchor and hoisted sale for that damned long roundtheworldvoyage of matrimony in a vessel without either ballast or provision aside  why undoubtedly sir thomas fortune was my least consideration  but if the young lady is not your daughter it is proper i should first know who is her father  it may be somebody whose family it would be improper for me to marry into   emily kneeling to sir thomas most honored sir    sir thom rise rise my dear you must kneel no more to me raising her   emily where shall i kneel where seek my father if you are not   dr good turn hither my hearts darling and behold him    emily did i hear right are you sir are you my father   dr good i am i am embracing her i have endured a long constraint but at length am free to boast  i am your father    l sealand heyday here is a turn the wind has chopped about with a vengeance  one minute south and the next due north as ever it can blow   emily to sir thom o sir forgive me nor think this an ill return for your paternal goodness  i love  i honor you most highly sir and ever must revere you but nature pleads most strongly in my breast  i love my father too kneeling to dr goodman who raises and embraces her   sir thom why that is my brave girl i never yet knew half your goodness and love you if possible better now than ever   l sealand well upon honor this is the most whimsical adventure i ever met with  what in the name of oddity sir thomas could induce you to bring up the young gentlewoman as yours   sir thom that is my concern my lord  i had my reasons for it which time perhaps may show  the only question necessary at present is whether if she is willing you will or will not marry her   l sealand a moments pause i beg sir thomas    sir thom pho pho come  speak boldly man  was it the girl or the estate you adored in plain english are you a man of honor or are you a    l sealand sir thomas  you are really so precipitate  i beg the indulgence of a few moments reflection  i will  think a little madam and let you know my determination presently    emily my lord you need not trouble yourself to think about it for rest assured that fallen as you may think me nothing can induce me ever to be your lordships   l sealand aside i never met with such a cursed embarras before   exit lord sealand sir thom ha ha ha so much for modern love  emily you have lost your countessship my dear    emily his refusal has made me happy sir beyond expression  and so i flatter myself it will make george  ha  george  merciful heaven the thought occurred not till this moment  he is my brother   sir thom and i fancy you had conceived more than a sisterly affection for him  eh emily    emily i had indeed sir for to confess what now is needless to conceal i loved him ardently and ignorant of my birth had i been mistress of the world he must have shared it with me or i had been a beggar   sir thom ay i thought as much  well well times a good physician and cures more ills than half the doctors living  it will wear off i warrant you  no sign of my lord weathercocks turning about again no  i believe it is in vain to expect him  we had better seek for george and inform him of what has passed   dr good come my delight my only pride my sweet child come    emily excuse me a little my dear father i will follow you directly  i will but dry these tears and  oh in a burst of grief   sir thom pho pho never take on so about it emily  you shant go without a husband yet if there is one in the kingdom that deserves you  what say you to a richacre my girl   emily oh sir that i respect revere and love you with a most filial affection i think you do not boubt  but  most honored sir my other parent  let me stop there  my hearts too full  be not offended sir  i can no more  oh george george   sir thom well well well talk no more about it at present  but upon my word you must not remain single emily  for to tell you the truth i should have been sadly balked and my whole scheme frustrated had my lord behaved otherwise as i have all along had hopes which i flatter myself will yet be accomplished of prevailing on you to accept for ever that name you have so long honored by the using  come along my old friend  friend quotha ecod who knows how nearly we may be related soon eh  ha ha ha   exit sir thomas richacre and dr goodman emily what a reverse of fate how am i bereft of all my fond vain hopes of happiness and love  had i been reduced to the most abject poverty  had i lost him i thought my father and found no other  had every calamity our woefilld lives are fraught with but this at once besel me i had still been happy but now oh george oh brother i am sunk ten thousand times more deep than wretch ever plunged before   george enters george alone emily where are sir thomas and my father i saw my lord go down the yewtree walk so thinking the conference over i returned to learn how it had ended  what was the important secret on which so much depended   emily oh george    george how weeping then i know enough and now am nothing o fortune title how powerful are your charms that can betray goodness itself and make it err   emily forbear forbear  you know not why i grieve  you cannot conceive the exquisite distress of my present situation   george not conceive how dreadful to be given to those we hate as i am persuaded you do sealand   emily oh george there now needs no disguise  the doom irrevocables past did you indeed ever love me   george love you do i breathe do i exist  could i but to love you   emily then we both are truly wretched   george we are indeed but if as i have fondly thought our love was mutual how doubly wretched is your fate  doomed thus to marry one that you detest   emily no that is not my grief  thank heaven he has refused me   george refused you   emily you will not wonder when i can tell you why  sir thomas richacre  is  not my father bursting into tears   george not your father amazing  yet most happy sound then i may hope  and the first gleam i ever knew now shoots into my soul   emily no there is no hope  an eternal barrier is fixed between us for you are  i cannot speak it   george i am  gracious heaven  what   emily my brother   george your brother   emily my dear dear brother   george support me or i fall   emily with my very life weeping and embracing him   patty enters patty so so here is fine work going forward  kissing and hugging at a rare rate it is more than he ever offered to me  by jingo i dont half like this she will never have my lord nor i him if they go on thus  it is well i did not buy the lotteryticket seeing how matters are going aside   emily look up dear george   patty dear george lord how loving we are aside   george am i indeed so near to you   patty yes you cannot be much nearer i think in her very arms how near would you be i wonder aside   george your brother   patty what aside   george then there is no hope indeed   patty no i hope not  but what can this mean aside   emily patty  how long have you been here   patty i am but this moment come madam  sir thomas sent me to desire your ladyship    emily o patty you must forget those words  i am no lady now    patty no maam how so   emily no longer heiress to a splendid fortune but sister to this much loved youth  the virtues of a reverend parent must be now our joint inheritance   george but to what purpose emily was you bred up as daughter to sir thomas   emily he told lord sealand there was a reason for it which time perhaps would show  and in addition to my misery after my lord had left us said he was pleased at his refusal of me having all along intended i should still keep the name of richacre  meaning no doubt with my concurrence to marry me himself   george astonishing yet that accounts for all   patty good gracious i hardly know how to believe all this  i am afraid she is only joking aside  lord maam i hope you ant serious all this time  are nt you sir thomass daughter indeed   emily no patty you have lost your mistress   patty aside i have found a husband in the stead though and that is ten times better  but i must seem sorry  dear heart maam i am vastly concerned to hear this for you was very good to me and i must never expect to have so many nice clothes given me again unless his worship should really be so kind as to marry you himself maam   emily happy happy girl would i had no greater grief than thine   patty why to be sure maam the black ox has trod upon your foot a little as the saying is  and one misfortune seldom comes alone as the other saying is  you have been very unlucky indeed maam to lose a great fortune and your sweetheart too both at once  for i do verily believe you had a kindness for mr goodman before you knew he was your brother  but now that is all over  aside thank my kind stars and i shall be mrs goodman as sure as fate   george no patty it is not all over    emily nor will be but with life   patty lord maam why sure you would not love your own brother   emily not love him who shall debar me that   patty nay maam i only just spoke  for brothers and sisters did formerly marry i grant or the world could not have been peopled  but that is quite out of fashion now you know maam  unless indeed you had been romancatholicpapishes and were lucky enough to be sir thomass children instead of dr goodmans because i have heard say if people have but money enough the pope will grant a  compensation  i think they call it or some such hard name i suppose it means an act of parliament for a man to marry his own grandmother but indeed maam if i was you i would think no more of my brother but take sir thomas at his word and marry my father  that is as he is not your father   emily prithee have done patty i am not yet reconciled enough unto my fate to bear this illtimed mirth  i might nay perhaps i shall find refuge in a cloister and dedicate my future wretched life to heaven   george no emily it is i should be sequestered from the world you have been taught to look for happiness and by accepting of sir thomass most worthy hand and noble fortune yet may find it   emily impossible oh name it not again  never will i basely take the hand and fortune i cannot in return for give my heart   george forgive me dearest maid nor think i had any view in what i said but your repose and welfare for what little patrimony my honored father may have gathered for us both shall now be wholly yours as i will immediately enter into holy orders devote my life to a religious celibacy nor ever think again of love or womankind   patty o goodness heart that will be a great pity sir for there is many a pretty girl i dare say would be proud to have you   emily come my dear brother let us attend sir thomas and our father i promised to follow them directly   george our father oh emily  my sister  i cannot bear the thought  it shocks  it overpowrs  it mads me  my sweet emily  go you while i endeavor to compose this agitation of my spirits before i see them   emily may heaven restore you to your peace of mind  but mine  is lost for ever   exit emily george sits down musing patty after some little pause sir  sir  sir   george what do you say child peevishly   patty why sir  i hope you will not be angry at such a simple girl as me offering to advise you  but really i would not have you think of living single for to my certain knowledge there is a girl in the world ay and a good pretty girl too that is not far off would be very sorry you should die a bachelor   george which i most surely shall sighing   patty mercy forbid sir  for indeed you are a very pretty gentleman and seeing as how you and your sister cannot conveniently come together if i was in your place i should look about me a little  and if such a thing was to happen that you even took a fancy to me sir i dont think i could find in my heart to be cruel to you  and though i am not your equals you might go farther and fare worse  for i have a little money by me and a prospect of getting a very large sum soon  and you know sir i am a sort of an heiress as i may call it besides and i dare say my father has saved something worth having she stands curtsying and simpering to him   george how this silly girl torments me i had better check her or the giddy creature may suppose i know not what  i thank you patty for your good will to me    patty thank you patty o gemini i believe he will come to at last aside   george but hope you will not deceive yourself into what might hereafter prove a trouble to you   patty no indeed sir it never would  so far from it every thing i did for you would be a pleasure to me   george still you mistake me my good girl    patty good girl o the dear soul i shall have him as sure as a gun aside no indeed sir i dont    george pray hear me without interruption    patty yes sir that i will curtsying for to be sure i could hear you talk for ever   george i am afraid you have conceived something like love for me    patty like love indeed sir if a poor bashful girl must speak out  it is love in downright earnest curtsying very low   george pray dont interrupt me  you have entertained i say a partiality for me you mistake for love and which a return to might possibly confirm in you but as that can never be i entreat you for your own repose in time to check it and never think again of what is impossible  oh love thou tyrant over the heart how contradictory are thy decrees   exit george patty impossible why is it impossible sure i am not his fister too  lord lord that any body should stand so in their own light  well  it dont signify fretting about it  if i cannot have him i must have somebody else  and as he will not marry me i think i will even behave kinder to poor william for i am sure he loves me dearly  and if i can but coax him to forget how i used him to day and ask me the question as he often has before again if i dont have him i will be whipped  as i live here he comes and a likely lad he is as any in the parish  george goodman with all his airs ant half so handsome  i will pretend not to see him to try if he will break his resolution and speak first   william enters william ay there she stands a sulky thing what can have made the little puss so plaguey crossgrained to day  she will not take a bit of notice of me  a stubborn young baggage and i will be hanged if i speak to her first

patty but i could not though william  for i have too great a regard for you to hurt a hair of your head   william have you indeed  well now that is kind to tell it me   patty i should be very ungrateful to behave otherwise than kind to you william who have always professed so much love to me  nay more than once even asked me to marry you   william ay more than twenty times patty  and if you were but willing i would axe your father leave to get mr liturgy our curate to publish the banns for us next sabbath and as soon as ever we were outaxd i would marry you and love you to my dying

made with what he had before of mine fortyfour pounds twelve shillings and fixpence  that is in even money fortytwo golden guineas and a half  so you see patty i be somebody and have gotten a good round sum to begin the world  but if we had not a sixpennypiece between us a young couple that have health and limbs to work a good heart and a sound conscience have enough to begin twenty worlds   patty that is very true william  and i dont think there is a heartier young couple in the county than we are  besides i have a very handsome sum of money by me too and a power of good clothes miss

but will most humbly solicit the sanction and permission of his reverence and sir thomas which i am prone to think at my entreaty will not be withheld   patty no i hope not   william and then father when i am pattys spouse i will keep the bible you said to day you would give me as choice as old gold to write the names of all our children in if so be that we increase and multiply which i do hope

find safe harbor from all the storms of fortune  pretty and poetical that i dont think ovid or any of the lovesick tribe ever said a better thing aside   emily o my lord pardon me i beseech you for

other  going   oconnor speaks without oconnor hilli ho my hearts  what cheer honies  what all under hatches tumble up tumble up my jewels  he enters by my soul this is the strangest vessel i ever stuck foot aboard  the devil a hand is there walking deck to keep watch so fait i even made bold to take a peep into the cabin   sir thom who the devil are you sir what do you want here   oconnor arrah be easy my jewel dont put yourself out of your latitude and you will know who i am presently  but why will not you station a hand upon deck yonder to keep a bit of a look out or you may be boarded by a landpirate honey   meter go martha and make fast the door child   patty dear heart i am almost afraid this strange man is come to run away with me aside   exit patty sir thom what is your business what do you want of me   oconnor what do i want with you the devil a toothful do i want of you but a little civil discourse nor that neither unless you are the commander here   sir thom well sir i am the commander as you call it  what then   oconnor why then  i will lower my topsail to you honey pulling off his hat   sir thom but  what is your business for i am in haste    oconnor why you are to know joy i am just come full sail upon the outside of a horse with another in tow from the saltseashore to bring you advice of a sweet cratur a female young woman belonging here and my master lord sealand    sir thom lord scoundrel    oconnor indeed you may say that  more pity the two words should ever be splicd together   dr good but your news sir your news   oconnor why you must know i received orders from mounseer powderpuff my lords walleydeshaver to have our skiff ready to carry my lord and the young woman i mentioned aboard our cutter the tarquin  but i soon found by her unwillingness that she was not a volunteer of her own accord but had been pressed into the sarvice without giving her consent to it  so faith i began to be a little queer with my lord about it for the sweet cratur looked as innocent as a sucking dove ay or a newborn doves egg and i determined not to aid and assist at making her otherwise   dr good eternal blessings on you for your goodness   oconnor devil a goodness in the case honey  twas no more than the duty of every honest man that is not a rogue   sir thom give me your hand my heart of oak i am your friend for ever   oconnor so while we were raving and squabbling within half a cables length of land a good clever likely young jontleman and a carrottypated liveryservant came galloping and splashing into the saltsea as if they were riding post over to france or holland for their horses were fairly afloat and half way to the skiff in the turning of a handspike   sir thom so friend    oconnor hollo you young harebrains says i  have a care you dont run foul of our little nutshell and spill us all upon which the poor girl cried out it was her brother   meter her brother   oconnor devil fire me says little brian oconnor that is myself if their beasts shall board us and send us to the bottom if he was your brother and sister too but do you hear young jontleman says i have a little wit in your folly and dont fink your friends and your foes together but take in a reef a two and well be alongside you presently   sir thom that was right friend that was right   oconnor upon which you may take your swear my bugofalord did all he could to prevent my carrying the boat ashore  and at last when he found nothing else would do nor that neither was trying to hussle me overboard    meter was it possible   oconnor indeed it was not  for as soon as i perceavd it oho thinks little brian are you for that fun i will be bound i match you to a tittle my jewel so upon my conscience i made no more ceremony but gave him as pretty a genteel lift as you shall see in a summers day and capsizd him souse headlong into the wet ocean where he looked for all the world like the gold and filver fish folks keep in glass washingrubs   sir thom ha ha ha well done well done in faith   meter but notwithstanding his demerits he was not drowned sir i hope   sir thom there we differ old stave for once  for i hope he was   oconnor no faith sir as ill luck would have it he was not drowned   sir thom the more the pity say i   oconnor upon my conscience sir you say very right  it was gods mercy and a thousand pities sure enough but i take it he was a little damp or so for when he scrambled ashore the salt brine ran from him by pailfuls   sir thom ha ha ha ha i shall burst i shall burst upon second thoughts i am glad the dog was not drowned for if he had i should have been killed outright   oconnor yes fait and so would he too   dr good but how ended the matter pray sir   oconnor o it was soon over honey for when i had thrown the whale into jonass belly    meter jonas into the whales belly i apprehend you mean sir   oconnor well the whale into jonas or jonas into the whale it is all one ant it  when i had given my lord a summerset i say and spilt him into the ocean we got ashore presently  but as the young jontleman was hoisting his sister out of the boat his draggletaild lordship lent him such a pat of the cheek as was enough to break his handsome face or put one of his forecastle lights out   sir thom the cowardly villain but he repaid it i hope   oconnor och i will be bound he did  and with interest too  for he had the honor of horsewhipping his lordship to his hearts content and by way of premium i divarted myself the mean time with beating his impudent french walleydeshaver   sir thom bravo bravo ha ha ha but what became of the liveryservant all this while sure he was not idle   oconnor what the lad with the bunch of carrots growing on his head indeed he was not  for he had no sooner handed the poor frighted girl out of the gangway and brought the two horses they went and i came upon to an anchor but the tight lad beseagd the coachbox took it by storm and is now piloting the young jontleman and lady safe into port here aboard my lords own chariot fait leaving him and his rascally companions to pad the hoof and trudge home upon their ten toes   sir thom odso then let us go meet em they cannot be far off by this and i long to see the dear rogues again  going  hark sure i hear a carriage stop   patty enters hastily patty my ladys come back sir my ladys come back young mr goodman and william have found her and they are all come back together   meter rejoice and sing kill the fatted calf and be merry for the lost sheep is found   george and emily enter she runs to dr goodman sir thomas richacre catches george in his arms sir thom my dear dear brave boy you are welcome home again   emily to dr goodman o my loved sire scarce did i know my father ere i was torn from him but am restored thank heaven to his paternal arms   dr good thanks gracious providence i see my child again   meter amen    sir thom odzookers george i have been in a plaguey pucker about you you rogue   george sir i am eternally bound to you for this solicitude and was not my dear father exceedingly alarmed to dr goodman   sir thom alarmed why i tell you i have been almost out of my wits about you both   george sir i am bound to you for ever but my dear father  to dr goodman  is not he happy too that my sister his sweet daughter is safe restored   sir thom ay that he is i will answer for him  and as you have so bravely helped to recover a daughter for him the least he can do in return is to provide you with a father by restoring me my son   george sir what does my patron say   sir thom say  ecod i dont know what to say  only that in having you for my heir i am father to one of the best and bravest lads in the kingdom   george father    sir thom yes my dear boy i am indeed  your father george your father embracing him odzookers doctor i could contain myself no longer faith   dr good dear sir he is your own and truly worth the claiming   emily indulgent powers is it possible aside   patty o good gracious maam here is good news for you aside to emily   meter wonderful wonderful most wonderful   george am i in a dream    oconnor upon my conscience i cannot tell  but if you are you have had a very pleasant ride in your sleep   george dear sirs what am i to think  within these few hours i thought myself the son of this worthy divine and this sweet maid your daughter sir  to sir thomas richacre we then were wretched beyond idea supposing ourselves the issue of one parent and now sir    sir thom and now my dear boy all is set right  you are my son my own flesh and blood at least your mother lady richacre who was a pattern of conjugal fidelity told me so  and emily is as surely dr goodmans daughter george kneels to sir thomas who raises and embraces him   emily transporting sounds then we may yet be happy aside   oconnor devil burn me but this makes out the old saying good  that it is a wise father knows his own child  o no fait i dont mean so neither  though that may be true too but it is a wise child knows it is own father   george most honored parent to sir thomas if i really am so blessed may i presume to ask why we have both been bred in such a mutual error   sir thom i will tell thee george  i had observed with great concern how seldom young men bred in the insolent pride of inheriting great estates deserved them  i am a whimsical old fellow you know  and therefore proposed to and prevailed on my respected friend as we became widowers almost together to join with me in a project i had formed in imitation of the spectators leontine and eudoxus of exchanging children for a time  hoping thereby to render you more worthy than you might otherwise have been of the fortune and title you was born to  the experiment was a singular one i own but the event has fully justified it george bows   george and sir  if i dare ask one question more  what recompense did you purpose to this young lady for being deluded with such an imaginary grandeur   emily bless me what is he saying aside   george was it to realize the golden dream   sir thom why i had some such notion indeed george    george if i remember right the story you alluded to sir the good the generous eudoxus joined the young and loving pair is that my sires intention or which i dread to ask  is it to  marry her yourself   sir thom ha what marry emily myself bless her dear little heart heaven forbid no no i had a younger spark in my eye for her    emily benignity itself he means my george i am certain and i shall yet be blessed aside   george then sir i may speak plainer    emily what will the dear youth say aside   george and declare that i am vet a beggar if you add not to my late acquisition of fortune the supreme delight of restoring this loved maid to the station she was bred in by permitting me still to call this best of men my father   sir thom what do you ask me for she is none of mine you fool why dont you ask the doctor   george to sir thomas my indulgent father to dr goodman o sir either my behavior has hitherto been unfilial or you will kindly receive me for your son again   dr good my ever dearest son  take her and may heaven shower down eternal blessings on you both   meter amen    oconnor ay and so be it too say i   george now if my emily thinks me not unworthy    emily o talk not so it is i that am unworthy  yet wherefore  if desert consisted but in riches then i were indeed deficient but conscious of a mind superior to the distinctions of birth and fortune i feel that i deserve your love for had our conditions really been as we imagined preferring thee the worthiest to the most wealthy i should have gloried in my acquisition more than in a conquest of the most exalted   george i know it my sweet emily i know it   emily and if my preserver loves like me he will not ask but take my trembling hand assured that he possesses wholly my fond my beating heart   george thus then i take thy snowy hand here seal my faith kissing her hand and henceforth we are one   oconnor ay and a very pretty splice you have both made on it   emily to sir thomas i have so full a sense sir of your most unexampled goodness in first adopting your poor girl and now confirming thus your favor i cannot thank you as i ought  let these duteous grateful tears speak for me falling on her knee   sir thom rise rise my sweet child you are my daughter now indeed raises and kisses her   oconnor wiping his eyes well i wish i may never taste another cheekful of beef and biscuit or a sup of grog again if this is not as pretty a piece of business    george my good friend the preserver of my emily amid these several transports i have too long overlooked you   oconnor och no offense gra i have been overlooking you too till i dont know what ails me fait but i have a notion the salt water that spalpeen of a lord splashd in my face when i tilted him overboard had not got out of the corners of my eyes before for some drops trickled down the scuppers of my cheeks into my mouth just now that tasted quite brackish they could not be tears sure for though we irishmen are apt to make blunders a weatherbeaten chap like myself would not cry sure at what he is so well pleased with   george you have a double title to my gratitude as i received assistance from you against your own master not fearing in the cause of virtue to offend the wretch you served   oconnor i will tell you what honey  saint patrick be thankful i am never afraid of doing what is right  for though i am but a menial man of low degree i am sprung from a very great offspring and have got the thick blood of the kings of ireland bubbling in my veins joy  and in my foolish way of thinking so far from offending i sarvd my master most faithfully by not sarving him at all at all in such an unjontlemanlike undertaking   sir thom you are a right honest tar and shall never serve any one again while you live   oconnor indeed and i will always sarve both you and yours with all the blood in my bones   emily how or in what words shall i express my very fervent thanks to you for having saved a helpless creature from what i dread to think of to oconnor   oconnor i will tell you how you shall thank me jewel by holding your sweet tongue and never saying another word about it   emily generous man my deeds shall then speak for me   patty dear father now every thing else is settled so nicely do pray put in a word for poor william   meter and yourself eh martha   patty if you please father   meter well i will adventure to address their honors  hem hem good your worship  and good your reverence  this seeming an auspicious hour your poor old servant has an humble boon to crave   sir thom what is it old silverlocks   meter that it may please your honors when the bans of matrimony are published between my dear and honorable young master and mistress as i trust his reverence will not approve they should be married by license the names of my poor child martha meter spinster  and her chosen spouse and helpmate william strongbow bachelor both of this parish may be permitted most humbly to follow   sir thom william strongbow what young carrottypoll where is the redheaded rogue i have not seen him since he scaled the coachbox   patty he is in the hall i believe father aside to him   meter william strongbow approach his worships presence   william enters william did your worship please to want me   sir thom ay come hither william  i am told you have behaved like a man of kent to day in helping to rescue my maid of kent here from lord sealand and his

patty a little portion   patty thank you kindly sir and may you and my dear young lady be as happy together as you deserve   emily i thank you patty  may you to patty and william and every virtuous pair be no less so   meter amen    william and now patty we shall be as merry as grigs or as midsummerday is long   patty that we shall william and i long for the wedding to be over that instead of plain patty i may hear myself called mrs strongbow   sir thom now i believe all parties are rewarded and satisfied except the poor quicksets and they too shall partake the happiness they by the timely alarm given us were in great measure the means of and never be poor or want for any thing again unless it be health and that the richest of us cannot bestow and so every thing is settled and we are all happy are we not old boy shake hands my heart of oak what say you   oconnor why sir i say  the honor of wagging a fist with you would make the happy if i was ever so miserable but i am after thinking the young jontleman and his little sweetlips there ay and the other young couple too will not be quite easy till they have shook hands and been splicd together in church fait   george the idea transports me  my emily  my destined bride we now approach the height of human bliss blessed as we are in the paternal care of these our best of fathers the affections of our faithful friends and servants and the fruition of our mutual disinterested love  the vices of that miscreant lord you happily was delivered from are punished by an indelible disgrace while the virtues of this circle are rewarded with a perfect and i hope twill prove a lasting felicity   meter amen   the end epilogue spoken by miss young our silly author fain would have me speak something i understand no more than greek his epilogue  which he sure thinks as fine as if inspired by phoebus and the nine such moral lessons  sage instructive rules  drawn from learned folios and the ancient schools morals said i the schools and huge dull folios why sir these sort of things should be quite olios composed of choice tidbits culled up and down from the gay fancies that amuse this town  with scavoirvivres let your scene be laid tell us of coteries or a masquerade of such materials epilogues are made yet still he begs that i would plead his cause and say the piece conforms to critic laws in scene time action and his further plan to draw men as they are not more than man some good some bad  thus tritely on he ran preach this yourself for me sir i replied an epilogue i want where may be tried my comic talents after this dull part which was not worth the getting off by heart  give me a taste of gay thalias art in witty verse to satirize the beaux and swear they know no bliss beyond fine clothes while smirking  leering  playing with my fan  i may attract each modish ape of man and make him feel  if feel such beings can speak scandal of the ladies  say the cits have hearty stomachs and but puny wits nay any thing to please and to amuse this generous circle  politics or news  joyful i would come on such an errand sent and you still more approved the maid of kent
