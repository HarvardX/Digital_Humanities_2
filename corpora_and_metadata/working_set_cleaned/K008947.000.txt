thespis or a critical examination into the merits of all the principal performers belonging to drury lane theater  london printed for g kearsly no   in ludgate street mdcclxvi  thespis bold is his task in this discerning age when every witling prates about the stage and some pert title arrogantly brings to trace up nature through her noblest springs bold in such times his task must be allowed who seeks to form a judgment for the crowd presumes the public sentiment to guide and speaks at once to prejudice and pride of all the studies in these happier days by which we soar ambitiously to praise of all the fine performances of art which charm the eye or captivate the heart none like the stage our admiration draws or gains so high and proper an applause yet has this art unhappily no rules to check the vain impertinence of fools to point out rude deformity from grace and strike a linetwixt acting and grimace high as the town with reverence we may name and stamp its general sentiments to fame loud as perhaps we echo to its voice and pay a boundless homage to its choice still if we look minutely we shall find each single judge so impotent or blind that even the actor whom we most admire for ease or humor dignity or fire shall often blush to meet the illearnd bays and pine beneath an infamy of praise how ost soulsearching garrick have i hung on every accent of that wondrous tongue when in old lear returning into sense and faintly guessing at some past offense to gain cordelias pardon thou have prayed and knelt by instinct with that suffering maid how has my breast then labored with its sigh and the big sorrow deluged all my eye while keen delight performed a traytors part and achd intensely round my struggling heart yet in those moments when i sought to find an equal transport in the public mind when i believed a sympathy would shine in every eye as honestly as mine a lifeless pause perhaps has gloomd along and drowsy dullness sat upon the throng enormous curls have slept on empty blocks or wellbred curtsies shot from box to box whereas when prisoner and in fetters bound a peal of praise has thundered all around and every hand employed its utmost pains to clap the mighty merit of the chains when things like these for ever give offense and empty show is listed over sense when men throw nature negligently by and judge not from the feelings but the eye nay when our actors in their busiest parts while fear or hope stand beating at our hearts from the warm scene may scandalously run and feast the galleries with an instant pun then keeneyd satire consciously should rise and hold a mirror to the public eyes alike regardless of her foe or friend with candor blame with honesty commend applaud if right the man she may detest and strike if wrong the brother of her breast it is on the stage as it is in life we find no single man quite excellent in mind nor do we meet a bosom so depraved so lost in vice and utterly enslaved but what at times some transient spark of grace has beamed his eye and flushed upon his face with pitying warmth intuitively stole and pierced the stygian sable of his soul therefore unlike some brothers of the pen who judged of actors as they judged of men in wild extremes ridiculously trod and drew by turns a demon or a god my tints from life shall regularly glow and paint both faults and beauties as they grow convinced the truest pictures must be made where light is blended properly with shade long in the annals of theatric fame has truth graced garrick with a foremost name long in a wide diversity of parts allowed his double empire over our hearts either in mirth to laugh us to excess or where he weeps to load us with distress  nor is it strange that even in partial days he gains so high an eminence of praise when his united requisites are more than ever centred in one mind before say if we search minutely from the age in which old thespis first began the stage and range through all the celebrated climes in which it flourished to the present times where shall we find an actor who has pressed with such extensive force upon the breast filled such opposing characters for years unmatched alike in laughter or in tears others perhaps the greatest of their hour whom fame extolled as prodigies of power have yet to scanty limits been confined and shown but one dull tendency of mind on bold blankverse heroically rose or meanly ambled upon humbler prose  othellos form a btterton might wear and rend the soul with horror and despair booth might with conscious majesty declaim and build on cato a substantial name in wildair wilkes most certainly might soar and cibbers sop set millions in a roar but which of these like garrick could appear in romeo sharp in drugger and in lear fill the wide rounds of passion as they fall and shine with equal excellence in all yet though thus warm i freely pour my thoughts i still must think that garrick has his faults some casual errors in his parts which run as specks sometimes will fasten on the sun even in his lear where desperately wild he stabs the ruffians to preserve his child and quite worn out with tenderness and rage leans wholly spent and breathless on the stage then while the tide of sympathy has rose and every bosom labored with his woes then have i seen him negligently fall full with his face against the prison wall snatch every feature strangely from our sight and check the flood of exquisite delight though famed apelles at a touch could give the warming canvass almost how to live though scarce to less than deity when grown he called out new creations of his own yet when the weakness of his art he saw the grecian fathers agony to draw twas wise a veil upon his face to throw whose pangs he found impossible to show but when even shakespeare never could possess too big a grief for garrick to express when his sharp eye so piercingly can roll and dart such instant passions through the soul it is doubly wrong the tenderer the case to hide the wondrous workings of his face to check our hopes or play upon our fears and damp the richsould luxury of tears for five long years in dark oblivion thrown has lee remained neglected and unknown unless when chance on some capricious start has kindly blessed him with a decent part yet was this lee at one auspicious hour allowed to boast a little share of power was thought in various characters to please and famed no less for energy than ease for me who feel a tenderness of breast wherever a dawn of merit seems oppressed i may perhaps be partial to his faults and do him more than justice in my thoughts but when i see the genuine passions rise which flame in aboans red resenting eyes when i behold in vernishs disgrace the struggling soul so stamped upon the face or meet in belmont with that dangerous art which even for crimes can plead about the heart i own it wounds my temper and my taste to find him still so despicably placed sent on in frenchmen raleighs and glendowers while things like packer surfeit us for hours it is true that lee has fatally imbibed a mode of speech not easily described a nice affected drawlingness of phrase a wiredrawn tone in every thing he plays with which too often most execrably fine he racks a word and tortures out a line yet still has lee a consequence of form a voice and look so capable to warm a stage struck heat so vehemently strong with such a piercing consciousness of wrong that even when barry in his noblest course some few weeks since exerted all his force strained every nerve to draw the scattering crown and crammed his mooneyd idiot on the town then did this lee burst on us in a blaze and wake us all to wonder and to praise give vile iagos deeply scheming ire the boldest touches of dramatic fire and swell the generous pierre with a flame that left even jaffier but a second fame hence mean soever as managers may prize i look on lee with very different eyes and freely place however they disdain his chair next garricks high in drury lane the greatest charge our little judges lay when hollands worth they critically weigh is that in all the characters he tries his master garrick ever fills his eyes that meanly servile in his walk of parts he strives to shine by imitative arts and now so dull a copiest is grown to want all sense and feeling of his own in this nice age when fatally disgraced poor sense falls martyred at the shrine of taste when a mere word indefinite and vain the random coinage of the coxcombs brain by truth and judgment wholly unconsind and differing still in every different mind usurps the air of sentiment to pass for sterling gold her despicable brass then imitation certainly must fall and raise the general enmity of all must own the pridetaught sentence to be just and lick the foot that tramples it in dust yet sure if garrick hitherto has ran by reasons line and justly laid his plan on that exalted principle of art which knocks with truths bold hand against the heart if in the various characters he plays the genuine form of nature he conveys and hits in short upon that happy right which gives the finest essence of delight those who affect to turn away the head when holland seeks his vestiges to tread must argue less from judgment than from whim since copying nature is to copy him but why at all should critics proudly start and seem to frown on imitative art where worth or fame our admiration raise a wish to copy is a kind of praise  say in this age some genius should we find so rich in thought and vigorous in mind as gave the fury of a stage desire even the pale glimmering of a shakespeares fire should we not all inevitably throng to hail the glowing wonders of his song and with a wild munificence reward the faintest traces of our deathless bard for me unapt to criticize in haste and little guilty of a modern taste i own this holland ever my offense but where he draws from garrick and from sense while he does this i patiently attend and often find no little to commend with honest warmth his plaudit i can hear and join myself the tribute of a tear but when some airborn fancy to pursue he lets his master once escape his view when much too great for imitation grown he boldly seeks a manner of his own sententious dull and heavy he appears his words like weights hang dragging on our cars fatigues to death in spite of all our power and drawl the minutes sentence to an hour  nor is this all a stupid sort of stare a starched stiff stalking aukwardness of air absorb at once his figure and his face and scorn all marks of nature and of grace while the pursd lips to wind up every pause important swell and bully for applause few for so short an interval have gained a higher rank than powell has obtained and few in fact at present on the stage deserve a warmer notice from the age formed with some lines that happily express no little sense of pity and distress and formed with tones that frequently impart no little share of softness to the heart on many minds he tenderly can steal and teach a drowsy auditor to feel hence in those parts where wretchedness and years alarm alike our pity and our fears where the poor lusignan from prison led shakes the white honors of his sacred head over his sweet pagan tenderly complains and calls again for darkness and for chains or where old henry sickening with despair upbraids the wildness of his madcap heir in parts like these to powell i attend a strong admirer and a steady friend  but when in gay lothario he would show the sprightly airs of libertine and beau or give in townly to a modish wie the nicer touches of superior life not all the scrapes or cringes which he tries those paltry arts of little men to rise the scorn of sense and judgment can remove or teach one honest blockhead to approve as yet two raw young striplings on the stage unfit for fight though burning to engage led on by hope courageously to press yet taught by sense to practice for success no judgment now of cautherly i frame nor settle benslys title to a name  where first essays are diffidently tried a candid mind must cautiously decide nor rashly risque opinions which in time the muse herself may censure as a crime where the gay muse in laughter loves to sport and brisk thalia holds her humrous court yates with high rank for ever must be placed who blends such strict propriety with taste from natures fount so regularly draws and never seeks to trick us of applause mark when he plays no vacancy of face no wandering eye or ignorant grimace is rudely suffered once to intervene or check the growing business of a scene nay in his silence happily employed he looks continual meaning on the void bids every glance with character be fraught and swells each muscle with a burst of thought hence in those cruder sections of a part where want of humor must be filled by art where the poor poet in some luckless fit mistakes a dull prolixity for wit his merit shines with undiminishd rays and lifts whole troops of restlesss to praise  yet there are times when spite of all his care our taste must bristle and our sense must stare when a new part unhappily he plays a thousand doubts perplex him and amaze fast from himself he tremblingly retires nor trusts that worth which all the world admires but on a sea of causeless terror tossed allows both mind and memory to be lost but though on yates the comic muse may shower an ample fund of humor and of power though in his walk of characters he claims so high a place among theatric names still there are others in her smiles who share and prove her generous as they know her fair often in some whim the buxom nymph will try to pass for king upon the public eye on tom or ranger wantonly will seize and give us all his spirit and his ease again in prattle physically prim she steals each look and attitude from him and like a virgin whose unpracticed breast some blooming youth entirely has possessed who if mischance unhappily should start to wound the face that captivates her heart feels no unkind propensity to rove but throbs all pitying with a soster love so when emaciate with disease and years her favorite king in ogleby appears the comic muse exerts unusual force to call down laughter from its richest source glows with a flame additionally warm and seems in more than raptures with his form  o that the goddess in some lucky hour would wisely try the utmost of her power would tell her king that in the wellbred smart too great a pertness quite destroys the part and when a bassets habit he would wear dismiss the saucy smatter from his air vernon to favor never can have pretense a singer truly  and disgacd with sense why should a fellow blessed with such a strain as still can charm us to the verge of pain the melting soul in ecstasy absorb and almost pluck a planet from its orb why should he strive in such a singsong age to soar by sterling merit on the stage or seek by knowledge in dramatic laws to reach a vulgar masculine applause did he indeed never generously rise beyond the tomtale or the london cries with which of late so dead to every shame he meanly pimpd for prostituted fame some room for easy pardon might be found and dullness join most lovingly with sound but when pharnaces or macheath we see so nervd with thought so spirited and free when even his flimsiest characters of song can strike our minds so wonderfully strong our honest rage eternally must live and prudence make it madness to forgive palmer from playing almost every night has grown so long familiar to our sight that even in scenes scarce possible to bear we kindly rate him as a decent player yet since the stage its first existence drew an odder compound never struck our view nor did the drama ever yet produce so bad an actor half so fit for use mark with what grace his person is designed for parts of life and characters refined yet that strange shambling of deportment see though easy stiff and manacled though free though strait yet doubled tortured though in form awkward though bred and spiritless though warm  though fraught with tones articulate and clear he keeps an endless screaming on the ear howls out young oakley in such hideous strains as midnight wolves might use upon the plains and strangles poor sir brilliant in a note too nicely horrid for a human throat but though in wide and capital respects i see in palmer manifest defects though that address so terrible must seem and that vile voice excruciate with its scream yet ever ready in the heaviest parts he scorns all aid from despicable arts and ever master of his authors aim just to his sense and cautious of his same with secret pleasure i behold him rise and cry peace always to my ears and eyes  if strong good sense and latitude of mind a keen conception and a taste refined a long acquaintance with those nicer arts that read through life and study through our hearts an actors name with certainty might raise or bind his temples with the generous bays who against love a syllable could breathe or once dispute his title to a wreathe but it is not taste or judgment which can give an actors name eternally to live or even the widest knowledge of mankind which stamps through time his image on the mind  hence though in falstaff love has often expressed a nice observance of the human breast though in his bays we readily admire the critics clearness and the actors fire yet when we see him on granadas throne the dupe of zaras fury and his own or mark in gloucester with what nerveless rage he drives poor shore to wander from the stage we all lament the cruelty of fate which damns so good an actor into state and find these sceptres quite as dangerous things to mimic monarchs as to actual kings  in foreign footmen baddely alone preserves the native nasilness of tone and in his manner strongly shows allied their genuine turn of abjectness and pride if proofs are wanting on canton i call and ask the general sentiments of all  here then secure of competence and name he ought to rest his fortune and his fame and not in buckish epilogues which spring with real life from nobody but king at random risque the favor which we shower on scenes more suited to his taste and power  blessed with the happiest nothingness of form which nature ever with being strove to warm on lifes just scale scarce capable to stand a kind of mandrake in creations hand see dodd in all his tininess of state resist his stars and counteract his fate on actual wants preposterously shine absurdly great and despicably fine  framed at his birth a coxcomb for the stage he soars the foremost fribble of the age and struck by chance on some egregious plan a mere nice prim epitome of man in every coinage of the poets brain who blends alike the worthless and the vain who in such parts as faddle has designed a foplings figure for a villains mind there dodds fine want of all exterior weight new points our laugh or doubly whets our hate hangs the vile slave more openly in morn and brands him still with aggravated scorn  but when at wildairs elegance he tries or seeks in wellbred novelty to rise when on those parts he fatally will strike which urge no scorn and furnish no dislike there all his price inanity misplaced disgusts alike our judgment and our taste there he provokes our ridicule or rage and melts poor wildair down into a page  it is true in life we frequently behold a daring spirit in the smallest mould and never from face or person think to find the latent turn of principle or mind but in the drama with creative fire we give each part the person we desire expect all grace in bevils should be seen but ask for sneaks diminutive and mean  hence if deceived that fascinating rage which nerves the scene and vivifies the stage calls out illusion through the roar of strife and warms the moral fiction into life that instant flags no more to be possessed and spreads one torpid dullness through the breast  born to delight a laughterloving age and give fresh sunds of humor to the stage mark with what strength of unaffected ease that happy weston commonly can please though bold yet simple forcible though cool fine without trick and finished without rule  in those still scenes of scarce existing life where sneak breathes only to oby a wife or where poor drugger publicly displayed hangs out the mere dull animal of trade there westons worth with certainty may rest nor fear the strictest rigidness of test there a sublime stupidity of face as dead to sense as destitute of grace a fixed relaxless vacancy of lines with such true genius generally shines that quite surpised though satisfied we gaze and all is mirth astonishment and praise of all the walks in which the humorous power of comic wit can exercise an hour perhaps that cold inanimated way in which an actor never seems to play in which the chiefest merit of a part exists entirely in the want of art the strongest force of requisites may claim and prove the hardest avenue to fame  to westons praise then generously true the muse shall raise him publicly to view a first rate actor of the nokess kind best when least shown and happiest when confined  but when by some fatality misled a rage for praise has overset his head when grown quite arch he madly quits his place and seeks to soar by pertness and grimace when in attempting at some paltry joke the fine dry dullness of his face is broke with just disdain i turn my head aside and damn alike his ignorance and pride  to say that havard never has a claim to some small portion of theatric fame to say quite roundly that we never shed some transient gleams of favor on his head the public knowledge grossly would abuse and fix a lasting stigma on the muse yet when our eye upon his claim we throw and see what lifeless plaudits we bestow when through his round of requisites we trace think on his voice his figure and his face and find plain sense and memory at most are all the mighty merits he can boast we steal in pity from our stricter plan to praise his private virtues as a man and while the charms of genuine worth engage detest the hour he first beheld a stage hurst with his talents for lifes ancient scenes must rise in time if mindful of the means but when with years and with diseases bowed what need of tones extravagantly loud laurence may counsel and express his fears yet show some kind attention to our ears and woeworn adam may exclaim for bread without once splitting a spectators head  he who would seize an andience by the heart should always judge the nature of his part and in proportion as the scene requires suppress the talentworking of his fires since too much force propriety destroys and whitehaird grief is never marked by noise should poor old lear forget his tottering gait to ape young ammons majesty and state or godlike cato from his seat advance to treat the grinning gallery with a dance with what a wild amazement would we stare and check the madning progress of the player if then with hurst we mildly would engage and ask the various properties of age would palsied limbs be all he wished to own or would he give it feebleness of tone but mark with what vulgarity of stare what low unmeaning impudence of air that mudeyd moody whose relentless face no blush ever crimsoned with a moments grace gapes round the house regardless of his part all brass in front and marble all in heart for him no scene however it may flow with highwrought wit or agonizing woe once on his breast can fortunately steal or teach that ruthless bosom how to feel  yet tho cut off from every just pretense to taste to nature decency and sense though no blessed beam of sympathy ever stole to rouse the deep stagnation of his soul still while ocutter happily can please with brainless bravery and with brutal ease while every human principle of breast falls vily martyred to an irish jest there his wide want of sentiment and shame so nicely tallies with the poets aim that truth herself must combat in his cause and yield the crown of infamous applause  not so the modest ackman strikes our view whose parts though neither eminent nor new still from his strict propriety and care must here be ranked a tolerable player small as his round of characters appear he never offends our vision or our ear but always decent perfect and in place fills his short walk with judgment and with grace  it is not a circuit of five hundred lines through which a hero rants away or whines that ever an actors merit can decide or serve the candid critic for a guide  the poor plain soldier while the battle glows who darts courageous on his gathering foes with dauntless breast beholds his danger rise and nobly scorns to shudder though he dies is in my thought a much more worthy name than he who dead to honor and to shame however hung round with title or command entrenched in dastard discipline can stand on doubtful orders hesitate to fight and rush on noonday error to be right bransby to greatness never makes pretense yet seldom strikes at decency or sense but humbly careful through the round he plays avoids all censure if he meets no praise  aickin has various requisites to please a handsome person and an inborn case a manly accent forcible and clear a ready memory and a happy ear  and if the poet with prophetic verse through fates dark womb can accurately pierce an hour will come when times improving hand shall teach his taste and judgment to expand and in dramatic annals mark him fair though not a great a serviceable player burton is one of those unnoticd things who make good lords or secondary kings the liveliest mind to stupefaction lull so wisely flat and rationally dull  and yet with all that wondrous weight of lead which bounteous fate has given him for a head he still possesses such amazing arts to rise quite perfect in the heaviest parts that all with me must highly praise his pains and own his memory though they doubt his brains but now let justice doubly arm the muse and tenfold candor consecrate her views for now her genuine equity of breast must stand a keen unmitigating test and those who think that friendship or offense are yet unmingled in the poets sense may fear when female characters he draws lest truth should suffer from a softer cause indeed where female merit must be tried it is hard to judge and dangerous to decide a secret something in our breasts will warm where eyes can lauguish and where lips can charm and age itself instinctively will glow to press a ball of animated snow but yet through all the pleadings we can trace the wondrous pleadings of a heavenly face the bard still mindful of desert alone all partial ties will honestly disown from sacred conscience shudder to depart and speak his judgment though he wounds his heart vincent and wright for what the poet cares may warble sweetly through some trifling airs but till some ray of kind perception rests with genial heat upon their mindless breasts they still must raise our pity or offense whenever they claim an intercourse with sense not so the gentle baddeley whose form sweet as her voice can never fail to charm whose melting strain no arnes eccentric skill as yet has tortured into modern thrill she if our bosoms are not wholly steel in poor ophelia forces us to feel from envys self roots up the lingering sigh and spreads red anguish over her madning eye  yet of such gifts though happily possessed she rather grows than rushes on the breast and rather wins the passions to her course than strives to storm them by immediate force hence in the soft and tender walks alone her latent fund of talents must be shown and here a just distinction she must bear if trained with proper nicety and care  barry has tones which instantly impart an aching sense of pleasure to the heart but where a firstrate eminence we claim how small a title is a voice to fame hopkins in millwood and the thirdrate cast to public favor rushes on so fast that though unequal widely to engage with many first class parts upon the stage still if her rank we accurately trace and give her worth due eminence of place not six perhaps through britain we shall find but what she leaves considerably behind  formed for those coarse and vulgar scenes of life where lowbred rudeness always breathes in strife where in some blessed unison we find the deadliest temper with the narrowest mind the boldest front that never knew a fear the flintiest eye that never shed a tear there not an actress certainly alive can ever dispute preeminence with clive there boldly warm yet critically true the actual woman blazes on our view from self struck feeling nobly draws her praise and soars in act the character she plays  but when to taste she makes the least pretense or madly aims at elegance and sense when at high life she despicably tries and flares her frowsy tissue on our eyes there the wide waddle and the ceaseless bawl provoke the general ridicule of all and naught but newgate lucy we can know tricked out and dizend for some city show  pope though undamnd with any casual part of  weak head or execrable heart yet with almost her readiness enjoys a coarse wrote scene of turbulence and noise and like clive too in those superior spheres where ease delights and elegance endears that shapeless form to grace so unallyd that roaring laugh and manliness of stride in spite of pity force us to be just and all we feel is hatred of disgust  is it not odd that still upon the stage so few attend to person or to age that awkward clumsy or distorted shapes like new caught bears or badly tutored apes fast from those parts ridiculously crowd in which their honest merits are allowed to stain some high and educated place which asks the finest polishes of grace is it not odd too that the hoary head by some strange demon ludicrously led from those grave casts eternally withdraws in which it still can totter with applause to mumble quite insensible of shame some scene all youthful energy and flame  but such alas is ignorance or pride that self still kindly will for self decide and while the passions rule the giddy hour we all mistake our wishes for our power  but see where sprightly abington appears happy alike in person and in years pleasing though pert familiar though polite nervous though free and spirited though light as long as ease vivacity or fire can find a cheerful audience to admire with just regard her talents it will rate strong if not fine and various if not great pritchard though now unequal to her prime and withering swiftly on the stalk of time yet still retains a magic kind of art to charm the eye and twist about the heart throws some refined delusion over the stage and quite absorbs infirmity and age yet formed perhaps the moment of her birth for humor chiefly elegance and mirth her tragic parts are less replete with life than estifania or the jealous wife hence though i always honestly admire her macbeths madness and her zaras fire still when i see her obviously distressed to hurl the passion strongly on my breast when i behold her in this dangerous course struggling for strength and straining after force i wish her kindly in that walk of ease where every line instructed how to please springs from her lips superlatively warm sure to delight and positive to charm  o that the hour whenever it is designed to bless the well known virtues of her mind on palmers breast might charitably shower some distant dawnings of the mothers power one casual gleam of pritchard might dispense and wake the beauteous statue into sense that no just censure on our favrites race may brand her name with relative disgrace yates with such wondrous requisites to charm such powers of face and majesty of form such genuine grandeur with such sweetness joined so clear a voice and accurate a mind in fames first feat must certainly be placed while britain boasts of judgment or of taste say in what walk of greatness or of grace this matchless woman justly shall we place in which she still possesses not an art to melt to fire to agonize the heart if in cordelia to our minds we raise the more than magic softness she displays will not a gush of instant pity spring to mourn the father and lament the king or when the hapless belvideras tale of brutal renault turns the husband pale does not the force with which she then exclaims light every eyeball into instant flames rage with a fire too big to be expressed and rend the coldest fibers of the breast but though unequalled in those tragic parts which fall with weight and hang about our hearts it is not on these she wholly rests her name or builds a title to dramatic fame  mark in the gayer polished scenes of life the sprightly mistress or the highbred wife what wondrous grace and dignity unite to fill us still with exquisite delight mark how that nameless elegance and ease can teach even murphys ribaldry to please with actual life his cold belinda warm and tell that whining lovemore how to charm  peace to thy shade and may the laurel bloom with deathless green o cibber on thy tomb peace wondrous oldfield ever wait thy shrine thou once chosn priestess of the sacred nine for while this yates the utmost reach can show of comic grace or souldistracting woe we find no reason for the sorrowing tear which else would fall incessant on your bier curse on that bards malignity of heart how fraught soever with energy or art who once through yatess requisites could trace yet find no dawn of meaning in her face  often churchill often when bellarios fears his says his wrongs have plunged us into tears  has the sweet anguish of this yatess sighs forced that stern bosom instantly to rise often as her fine ductility of breast some newborn passion on the bosom pressed taught the soft ball more meltingly to roll and drew out every feature into soul then have i seen this censor who could find no glance whatever vivified with mind lost in a storm of unaffected woe till pitying nature bid the torrent flow relieved the tortured bosom through the eye and gave his sentence publicly the lie  yet high soever as the poet rates the wellknown worth and excellence of yates he cannot give perfection to her share nor say she is wholly faultless as a player  sometimes her sense too exquisitely strong by needless force will deviate into wrong and sometimes too to throw this fault aside she blends too little tenderness with pride what need calista entering on the stage exclaim be dumb for ever in a rage her faithful woman gives her woes relief and justice calls for temper though for grief  again when modely stands revealed to view and comes all suppliant to a last adieu what need that cold indifference of air that stiff unbending haughtiness of stare it is true the wretch deserves our utmost scorn  yet her resentment is but newly born and we should read distinctly in her eyes that still she loves however she may despise  where women once a passion have professed they may resent but never can detest nor where the basest favorite they discard conceal all marks of pity and regard  thus has the poet on old drury tried with care to judge and candor to decide and should the kind indulgence of the times approve thus far his motley string of rhimes his aim he yet more widely may pursue and beards light squadrons in their turn review  through all the pomp of coronations pierce and give their best maneuvers in his verse  here for the present then he drops his plan puts off the critic and assumes the man convinced if truth should only warm his muse the public smile will still promote her views and conscious too should prejudice or pride appear alone her sentiments to guide the public scorn her pen must cease to brand the sooner justice strikes it from her hand finis errata page line      for fatigues read fatigue
