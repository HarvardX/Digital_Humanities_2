an appendix in answer to the reasons for not replying to mr waltons full answer by a paper entitled reasons for not replying to mr walton s full answer i find that the author of the minute philosopher still persists in his mistakes concerning sir isaac newtons doctrine of fluxions he declares he can honestly say that the more i explain the more he is puzzled and i can as honestly say that i believe him for a person who does not understand what sir isaac means by velocity must necessarily be ignorant of his doctrine of fluxions deduced from the nature of velocity and be puzzled with all true explications of that doctrine what sir isaac newton means by the word velocity i shall explain in the following propositions  i the velocity of a body is the ratio of the quantity of motion to the quantity of matter in the body and is as the ratio of the quantity of the action of the moving force to the weight of the body or as the ratio of the quantity of that action to the density and magnitude of the body taken together that is putting v for the velocity of a body m for the quantity of its motion f for the quantity of the action of the force which generates that motion d for the density of the body b for its bulk or magnitude and w for its weight v is m  q and is as f  w or as f  db  for the quantity of motion is the quantity of matter and velocity taken together that is m is qv and consequently v is m  q but the motion of a body is as the quantity of the action of the force which generates it effects being always proportional to their adequate causes that is m is as f and at a given distance from the center of the earth the quantity of matter in a body is as its weight or as its denfity and magnitude taken together that is q is as w or as db and therefore v is as f  w or as f  db  the forces which generate motion in bodies may be of different kinds as a blow pressure weight all which may be conceived and density and bulk may likewise be conceived consequently the two measures of velocity f  w and f  db may both be conceived and yet neither of them includes time and space this author therefore has been grossly mistaken in asserting that velocity necessarily implies both time and space and cannot be conceived without them  and that there is no measure of velocity except time and space the proportion of velocities being only compounded of the direct proportion of the spaces and the reciprocal proportion of the times  ii the velocity of a body exists in the body it self while it continues in motion  for the velocity of a body is an effect of some cause acting upon it but this effect can exist no where except in the body acted upon for could it exist any where else an effect might exist where there is no cause to produce it or in other words an effect might exist without a cause which is absurd and therefore the velocity of a body exists in the body it self while it continues in motion  hence it appears that a body in motion will have a velocity inherent in it self during the whole time of its motion and consequently there must be a velocity wherever the body is exclusive of time and space if instead of a body the thing moved be a point its velocity will exist in a point and successively will exist in every point of space through which the point moves  here i may properly take notice of this authors objection against my proof that velocity can exist in a point my argument for it was conceived in these words if a cause acts continually upon a given body or thing in order to move it without any interruption there must ensue a continual increase of its velocity and consequently no two points of the space described however near to each other can be assigned in which the velocity is the same for that would manifestly suppose a cessation of the action of the moving cause during the passage of the body or thing through the interval comprehended between the two points now he thinks that from the continual action of a moving force and from the generated velocity not being the same in any two different points of the described space it will not follow that velocity can exist in a point of space but in this he is mistaken for the continual action of the moving force necessarily preserves a continual velocity and if the generated velocity be not the same in any two different points of the described space a velocity must of consequence exist in every point of that space  iii the velocity of a body is the rate or degree of its tendency forward  for the velocity of a body is a part of its motion by the first proposition and exists in the body by the second but there is nothing existing in a body moved or translated from one place to another besides its quantity of matter and the rate or degree of its tendency forward and therefore the velocity of a body is the rate or degree of its tendency forward  iv the account of velocity given in the two preceding propositions is agreeable to sir isaac newtons notion of velocity who constantly excludes described space from his idea of that term  for as i remember whenever he uses the word velocity in his principles of philosophy he speaks of the velocity of a body existing in some one certain place by which it appears that he confines velocity to the place of the body but there is no space described by a moving body existing in one and the same place and therefore he excludes all space described from his idea of velocity and he expressly does it in his doctrine of fluxions for he calls velocities fluxions and by fluxions declares that he does not understand any increments generated and consequently not any spaces described whence it necessarily follows that velocities in his doctrine of fluxions do not imply any spaces described therefore the proposition is true  the velocity of a body is an effect communicated to the body by the action of some moving force or cause and is retained in it by the inertness of matter till destroyed by the action of some contrary force or resistance and by being retained in it becomes a cause of the bodys going forward or of its being translated continually into a new place so that the continual translation of a body into a new place is really an effect of velocity which velocity may be conceived to exist in the body prior to the progress of that body as all causes may be conceived to exist prior to the effects produced by them  v if the velocity of a body or thing moved be given or increase with the time of the motion it will be measured by the space described applied to the time of its description and if it increases any how either regularly or irregularly it will be measured by the first ratio of the space to be described in a given particle of time if s denotes the space described in the time t and s the first ratio of the space to be described in a given particle of time then v will be as s  t when the velocity is either given or increases with the time of the motion and as s when it increases any how regularly or irregularly  case   if the velocity be given that is if the body constantly goes on at the same rate the space described reckoning from the beginning of the motion will be as the time of its description and consequently the ratio of the space described to the time of its description that is s  t will be a given quantity but one given quantity may be the measure of another and therefore v will be measured by s  t  case   if the velocity increases with the time of the motion the space described must increase with the square of the time whence s  t will be as t that is as v and consequently in this case also v will be measured by s  t  case   if the velocity increases any how either regularly or irregularly the space to be described in a given particle of time will begin to exist no part of it being yet described with the ratio of the velocity but the ratio with which that space begins to exist or to be described is its first ratio and therefore the velocity will be measured by the first ratio of the space to be described in a given particle of time consequently v in all cases will be measured by s  the two first cases of this proposition are particular ones and obtain only when the force which generates the motion acts either by one single impulse or continually with the same degree of strength during the whole time of motion the last is a general one and obtains in all cases whatever this general measure of velocity sir isaac newton uses in his doctrine of fluxions it continually exists in the final limits or extremities of quantities actually generated by motion and just beginning to be increased by a continuance of that motion though as yet no parts of their isochronal increments are described for those increments must begin to exist in the ratio of the velocities which the generating quantities have in the final limits of the quantities generated which are the initial limits of their increments if the ratio of the velocities existing in any two points be    or    the first ratio of isochronal increments commencing from those points will be    or     having shown what sir isaac newton means by the word velocity and given an account of its measures i will now by way of inference show the weakness of this authors objections against the several parts of the foregoing answer and in doing of this i shall be less methodical because i intend to pursue him in the order of his reasons  first then in sect   he takes notice of my freedom in calling his analyst a libel i am sorry my free manner should offend him but i must continue to call it a libel till he produces proofs to the contrary he tells me i well know a bad vindication is the bitterest libel i cannot say i know it but i know that defaming one of the greatest and best men who had nothing at heart besides the promotion of true philosophy and true religion is a most bitter libel a bad vindication may proceed from a good mind and an honest intention but defamation and detraction can arise from neither  in sect     he finds fault with my proof that velocity can exist in a point of space but i have shown the justness of that proof under the second proposition to which i refer him that proof may perhaps appear more evident to some by considering the motion of a body in falling from a state of rest by the force of its own weight for setting aside the resistance of the air and supposing the weight of the body to be the same at all near distances from the surface of the earth its velocity from the continued action of that weight will increase continually as the time of falling increases or as the square root of the length described increases reckoning that length from the beginning of the motion and therefore velocity will exist and be different in every different point of the described space both these are necessary and inevitable consequences of the continued action of the weight of the body during the time of its falling and of the velocitys being proportional to the square root of the space described  in sect     he charges me with giving an account of motion different from sir isaac newton who distinguishes two sorts of motion absolute and relative the former he defines to be a translation from absolute place to absolute place the latter from one relative place to another mine which exists in a point which may be conceived without space described he says is plainly neither of these sorts of motion but some third kind which he is at a loss to comprehend but he can clearly comprehend that if we admit motion without space then sir isaac newton s account of it must be wrong for place by which he defines motion is according to him a part of space now in answer to this i say that all motion which can neither be generated nor changed but by forces impressed on a body necessarily exists in the body it self while it continues to change its place and is the quantity of matter moved and its velocity or degree of tendency forward taken together the continual translation of a body therefore into a new place is as i have before observed an effect of this tendency forward in the body and not the tendency itself consequently space described is an effect of velocity and not the velocity itself velocity according to sir isaac newton does not necessarily imply any space described and therefore considered as an effect existing in the body can be nothing but the rate or degree of its tendency forward as i have proved it to be in prop iii consequently i have not given a different account of motion from sir isaac newton but an account every way consistent with his principles  in sect   i find the following passage transcribed from the analyst velocity necessarily implies both time and space and cannot be conceived without them and if the velocities of nascent and evanescent quantities that is abstracted from time and space may not be comprehended how can we comprehend and demonstrate their proportions or consider their rations primae and ultimae for to consider the proportion or ratio of things implies that such things have magnitude that such their magnitudes may be measured and their relations to each other known but as there is no measure of velocity except time and space the proportion of velocities being only compounded of the direct proportion of the spaces and the reciprocal proportion of the times does it not follow that to talk of investigating obtaining and considering the proportions of velocities exclusively of time and space is to talk unintelligibly this passage i have fully answered in having proved that there are other measures of velocity besides time and space i have given two general measures of it in the first proposition and one in the fifth all of which may be clearly conceived and yet not one of them includes or implies either space described or time and i know no general measure of it which does i agree with him that to consider the proportion or ratio of things implies that such things have magnitude but to consider the first or last proportions of quantities does not at all imply that such quantities have magnitudes these are not the proportions of first or last quantities or of any generated magnitudes whatever but the proportions of the velocities with which quantities begin or cease to have magnitudes  the next two sections relate to the moment of a rectangle if the rectangle cdk be generated by the motions of two right lines and from a continuance of their motions be increased by the gnomon cgk and if a and b are put for the sides dk and dc and a  b for the first ratio of their isochronal increments df  dh which first ratio is equal to the ratio of the velocities in d toward f and h the moment or mutation of the rectangle cdk will be abba as i have fully proved in the foregoing answer in the augmentation of a rectangle no motions exist but the motions of its sides which motions according to sir isaac newton constitute its moment or mutation and if the sides of the rectangle egl flow back till they coincide with those of the rectangle cdk and the generated gnomon cgk vanishes i have proved that the motion subsisting in the instant of its evanescence which is also the moment of the rectangle cdk is the sum of the motions of the sides of that rectangle or abba and he ought either to allow it or prove the contrary to say that a and b must denote the magnitudes of the increments df and dh and not their first ratio or the ratio of the velocities in d toward f and h is to assert a manifest falsehood for the velocities during the passage of the moving quantities from d to f and h may be so changed that the magnitudes of the increments df and dh shall have a proportion very different from that of the velocities in d toward f and h and therefore df and dh how small soever cannot measure the fluxions of dk and dc and consequently cannot be the things expressed by a and b  in the next place he charges me with explaining fluxions by the ratio of magnitudes infinitely diminished although i had expressly told him that they are not measured or expounded by the proportions of any generated magnitudes whatever but by the first or last proportions of isochronal increments generated or destroyed by motion the passage which occasioned this senseless notion is contained in the  th page of the vindication and stands in these words to obtain the last ratio of synchronal increments the magnitudes of those increments must be infinitely diminished for their last ratio is the ratio with which they vanish and become nothing to which may be added a like passage in the   th page of the same vindication in these words the magnitudes of synchronal increments must be infinitely diminished and become evanescent in order to obtain their first or last ratios to which ratios the ratios of their corresponding fluxions are equal now a fair and ingenuous reader who had nothing at heart but the establishing of truth and science would easily have collected from either of these passages that i did not explain or expound fluxions by the ratio of magnitudes infinitely diminished but by the first or last ratios of increments generated or destroyed in equal times that is by the ratios of the velocities with which those increments begin or cease to exist  in the  0th page of the foregoing answer i have asserted that the first or last proportions of isochronal increments subsist when the increments themselves have no magnitudes forasmuch as the motions subsist with which those increments just now in this very instant begin or cease to exist to which motions these ratios are proportional in answer to this the author of the reasons asks his reader whether the isochronal increments themselves subsist when they have no magnitude whether there can be an increment where there is no increase or increase where there is no magnitude whether if magnitudes be not generated by motion in equal times what else is generated therein or what else is it that mr walton calls isochronal to the two first of these questions i reply in the negative and to the last in the affirmative and would fain know what he infers from thence i did not say that isochronal increments subsist when they have no magnitudes but that the first and last ratios of such increments subsist when the increments themselves have no magnitudes and gave him the reason why they subsist which according to his usual candor he has taken no notice of  if the lines ac and be be generated by the motions of two points setting out from a and b and be increased in equal times from a continuance of their motions by the increments cd and of these increments will begin to exist with the velocities which the moving points have in their initial limits at c and e and the ratio of those velocities will be the ratio with which the increments begin to exist that is their first ratio consequently the first ratio of cd and of subsists when the increments themselves do not subsist that is before they have acquired any magnitude whatever the first ratio of the increments cd and of is not the ratio of those increments nor of any parts of them it is not their ratio considered as existing and having finite magnitudes but the ratio with which they begin to exist and have magnitudes if the velocities in c and e be as   and   the first ratio of the isochronal increments cd and of will be the ratio of   to   and may be expounded by any two lines which are as   to   but those lines are not the increments themselves nor any parts of them for the velocities may perpetually vary in the progress of the moving points from c and e to d and f and their variation may be such that cd and of however small may be in a very different proportion from that of   to   as i have observed above so that the fluxions of lines cannot be measured or expounded by any proportions of their isochronal increments except their first or last proportions  in order to assist the understanding of his correspondent he says that in the genesis of a rectangle by motion i have supposed two points to exist at the same time in one point and to be moved different ways without stirring from that point this he is pleased to call a riddle and says that i have the conscience to call it a full and clear answer to part of his catechism i do not indeed profess much skill in making or explaining of riddles but i can see it will not be very difficult to clear this affair let any two lines kf and ch intersecting each other in d be described by the motions of two points setting out from k and c  see the figure in p  0 and let the velocities of the moving points be such that they arrive at d exactly at the same instant of time upon their arrival in d it is plain the two points will exist in the point d which he may venture to allow since mathematical points have no magnitude so far the riddle is clear and since the two points can exist in d as they certainly may without any absurdity they must preserve their respective velocities or tendencies forward to f and h and go on in the directions df and dh by virtue of those velocities or tendencies there being nothing to change or destroy them but they cannot go on in those directions without stirring from the point d and therefore he has been mistaken in saying i supposed two points to be moved different ways in the same point without stirring from that point farther from the genesis of the rectangle cdk it is obvious that the common intersection of the moving lines ib and ia in which the two points are supposed to exist at the same time will continually go forward with the lines themselves but it cannot continually go forward with the lines themselves unless it continually goes into a new place surely this authors friends must be ashamed of him for calling this a riddle which is plain to any one who has in the least considered these things  in sect    he honestly confesses he does not understand sir isaac s doctrine so far as to frame a positive idea of his fluxions and yet from certain negative conceptions thereof he takes upon him to say that by the genesis of a cube i have not explained the nature of second third and fourth fluxions in a way agreeable to that doctrine but in this he is mistaken for by lem   l   princip newt if a flows with an uniform velocity expressed by a  aa  is the moment of a   a a the moment of  aa   a  the moment of  a a and o the moment of  a  but according to sir isaac the moment of the moment of a  is the second moment of a  the moment of that second moment is its third moment and the moment of the third moment is its fourth moment and therefore  aa   a  a  a  and o are the first second third and fourth moments of a  farther i have shown that all these moments or motions exist and may be clearly and distinctly conceived in the instant that a cube generated by an uniform motion begins to be increased by a continuance of that motion and therefore in the system of motion whereby a cube begins to be augmented i have given an explanation of first second and third fluxions every way agreeable to sir isaacs doctrine and he ought either to allow it or show the contrary  he tells his reader sect    that in saying there can be no fourth fluxion of a cube i make it my business directly to overthrow sir isaac newton s doctrine for if there can be no fourth fluxion of a cube there can be no second fluxion of a line and a fortiori no third fourth or fifth fluxion here it must be observed that one circumstance which i particularly supposed has not been attended to and by not attending to it the reader is made to believe that according to the account i have given of fluxions there can be no second third or fourth fluxion of a line now in the   th page of the foregoing answer i supposed the cube to be generated by an unform motion in which case the velocity expressed by a will be a given quantity but there can be no kind of mutation or change of a velocity which is given and consequently no second fluxion of a line nor any fourth fluxion of a cube which increases with such a velocity in this therefore i have not endeavored directly to overthrow sir isaac s doctrine i have not to the great relief of the learned world destroyed an indefinite rank of fluxions of different orders nor have i given an account of them any way inconsistent with sir isaacs doctrine as this author has falsely asserted  he says sect    that i give up sir isaac s doctrine of fluxions and instead thereof humorously substitute what all the world knew before he was born to wit the three dimensions of a cube and the genesis thereof by motion but this is a mistake for i neither give up the doctrine of fluxions nor substitute the genesis of a cube by motion instead of it i did not introduce that genesis in order to set aside the doctrine of fluxions but to exhibit a system of motion which might explain and illustrate first second and third fluxions so as to make their existence conceivable to the meanest capacity and thereby to expose the weakness and ignorance of this writer and i have succeeded in both although to his discerning eye it may seem to be a disguising and betraying and giving up the doctrine according to that doctrine the fluxions and moments of generated quantities are the velocities and motions with which the isochronal increments of those quantities begin or cease to exist and though the generation of a cube by motion might be known before ever sir isaac thought of his fluxions yet it was not known before he published the principles of that doctrine that three distinct orders of fluxions or moments depending upon each other existed in and might be clearly and distinctly conceived by attending to that well known and obvious system of motion which exists in the instant a generated cube begins to be augmented  in sect  0 he entreats me to explain whether sir isaac s momentum be a finite quantity or an infinitesimal or a mere limit i tell him that sir isaacs momentum is a finite quantity it is a product contained under the moving quantity and its velocity or under the moving quantity and first ratio of the space described by it in a given particle of time the velocity being measured by the first ratio of that space now the velocity of the moving quantity and first ratio of the space described by it in a given particle of time being both of them finite quantities may both be expressed by one and the same line of a finite magnitude but that line does not exist in the quantity generated or augmented by motion the moving quantity exists both in the fluent and in the increment of that fluent being the final limit of the former and the initial limit of the latter but the line which expresses the velocity or first ratio of the space described by the moving quantity in a given particle of time does not exist either in the fluent or in its increment by moments therefore he is not to understand generated increments of fluents but certain finite products or quantities of a very different nature from generated increments expressing only the motions with which those increments begin or cease to exist  to conclude if this author intends to give himself or me any farther trouble he must consider these principles a little better than he has hitherto done if he expects a reply for i shall scarce think it worth my while for the future to bestow a serious thought on any writer who shall dare to say that sir isaac newton had no clear and steady notions of his moments and fluxions and yet leave what has been offered by philalethes cantabrigiensis and me in defense of that great man without a fair and candid answer  finis
