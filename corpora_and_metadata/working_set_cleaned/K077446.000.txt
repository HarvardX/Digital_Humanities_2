reverence have thou born from the consecrated chest the golden sickle scrip and vest whilom by old belinus worn  semichorus druid these in order meet are all prepared  semichorus but tell me yet from the grot of charms and spells where our matron sister dwells brennus has thy holy hand safely brought the druid wand and the potent adderstone genderd before the autumnal moon when in undulating twine the foaming snakes prolific join when they hiss and when they bear their wondrous egg aloof in air thence before to earth it fall the druid in his hallowed pall receives the prize and instant flys followed by the envenomed brood till he cross the crystal flood  semichorus druid these in order meet are all prepared  semichorus then all is complete and now let nine of the selected band whose greener years befit such station best with wary circuit pace around the grove and guard each inlet watchful lest the eye of busy curiosity profane pry on our rites which now must be as close as done in the very central womb of earth occasion claims it for caractacus this night demands admission to our train he once our king while ought his power availed to save his country from the rod of tyrants that duty past does wisely now retire to end his days in secrecy and peace druid with druids in this chief of groves even in the heart of mona see he comes how awful is his port mark him my friends he looks as does the tower whose nodding walls after the conflict of heavens angry bolts frown with a dignity unmarked before even in it is prime of strength health to the king  caractacus evilina chorus this holy place methinks does this night wear more than it is wonted gloom druid these groves have caught the dismal coloring of my soul changing their dark dun garbs to very sable in pity to their guest hail hallowed oaks hail british born who last of british race hold your primaeval rights by natures charter not at the nod of caesar happy foresters ye wave your bold heads mid the liberal air nor ask for privilege a praetors edict ye with your tough and intertwisted roots grasp the firm rocks ye sprung from and erect in knotty hardihood still proudly spread your leafy banners against the tyrannous north who roman like assails you tell me druid is it not better to be such as these than be the thing i am  chorus to be the thing eternal wisdom wills is ever best  caractacus but i am lost to that predestined use eternal wisdom willed and fitly therefore may wish a change of being i was born a king and heaven who bade these warrior oaks lift their green shields against the fiery sun to fence their subject plain did mean that i should with as firm an arm protect my people against the pestilent glare of romes ambition i failed and how i failed thou know too well so does the babbling world and therefore druid i would be any thing save what i am  chorus see to thy wish the holy rites prepared which if heaven frown not consecrate thee druid see to the altars base the victims led from whose freegushing blood ourself shall read its high behests which if assenting found these hands around thy chosen limbs shall wrap the vest of sanctity while at the act yon whiterobd bards sweeping their solemn harps shall lift their choral warblings to the skies and call the gods to witness meanwhile prince bethink thee well if ought on this vain earth still holds too firm an union with thy soul estranging it from peace  caractacus i had a queen bear with my weakness druid this tough breast must heave a sigh for she is unrevenged and can i taste true peace she unrevenged so chaste so loved a queen ah evilina hang not thus weeping on the feeble arm that could not save thy mother  evilina to hang thus softens the pang of grief and the sweet thought that a fond father still supports his child sheds on my pensive mind such soothing balm as does the blessing of these pious seers when most they wish our welfare would to heaven a daughters presence could as much avail to ease her fathers woes as his does mine  caractacus ever most gentle come unto my bosom dear pattern of the precious prize i lost lost so inglorious lost my friends these eyes did see her torn from my defenseless camp whilst i hemmed round by squadrons could not save her my boy still nearer to the darling pledge beheld her shrieking in the ruffians arm beheld and fled  evilina ah sir forbear to wound my brothers fame he fled but to recall his scattered forces to pursue and save her  caractacus daughter he fled now by yon gracious moon that rising saw the deed and instant hid her blushing face in twilights dusky veil the flight was parricide  evilina indeed indeed i know him valiant and not doubt he fell mid slaughtered thousands of the haughty foe victim to filial love arviragus thou had no sister near the bloody field whose sorrowing search led by yon orb of night might find thy body wash with tears thy wounds and wipe them with her hair  chorus peace virgin peace nor thou sad prince reply whatever he is be he a captive fugitive or corse he is what heaven ordained these holy groves permit no exclamation against heavens will to violate their echoes patience here her meek hands folded on her modest breast in mute submission lifts the adoring eye even to the storm that wrecks her  evilina holy druid if ought my erring tongue has said pollutes this sacred place i from my soul abjure it and will these lips bar with eternal silence rather than speak a word or act a deed unmeet for thy sage daughters blessing first this hallowed hour that takes me from the world and joins me to their sober sisterhood  chorus it is wisely said see prince this prudent maid now while the ruddy flame of sparkling youth glows on her beauteous cheek can quit the world without a sigh whilst thou   caractacus would save my queen from a base ravisher would wish to plunge this falchion in his breast and so avenge insulted royalty o holy men ye are the sons of piety and peace ye never felt the sharp vindictive spur that goads the injured warrior the hot tide that flushes crimson on the conscious cheek of him who burns for glory else indeed ye much would pity me would curse the fate that coops me here inactive in your groves robs me of hope tells me this trusty steel must never cleave one roman helm again never avenge my queen nor free my country  chorus it is heavens high will   caractacus i know it reverend fathers it is heavens high will that these poor aged eyes shall never more behold that virtuous woman to whom my youth was constant twas heavens will to take her from me at that very hour when best her love might sooth me that black hour may memory ever raze it from her records when all my squadrons fled and left their king old and defenseless him who nine whole years had stemmed all rome with their firm phallanx yes for nine whole years my friends i bravely led the valiant veterans often to victory never till then to shame bear with me druid i have done begin the rites  chorus o would to heaven a frame of mind more fitted to these rites possessed thee prince that resignation meek that doveeyd peace handmaid of sanctity approached this altar with thee stead of these see i not gaunt revenge ensanguind slaughter and mad ambition clinging to thy soul eager to snatch thee back to their domain back to a vain and miserable world whose misery and vanity though tried thou still holdst dearer than these solemn shades where quiet reigns with virtue try we yet what holiness can do for much it can much is the potency of pious prayer and much the sacred influence conveyed by sage mysterious office when the soul snatched by the power of music from her cell of fleshly thraldom feels herself upborn on plumes of ecstasy and boldly springs mid swelling harmonies and pealing hymns up to the porch of heaven strike then ye bards strike all your strings symphonious wake a strain may penetrate may purge may purify his yet unhallowed bosom call ye hither the airy tribe that on yon mountain dwell even on majestic snowdon they who never deign visit mortal men save on some cause of highest import but fublimely shrind on it is hoar top in domes of crystaline ice hold converse with those spirits that possess the skies pure sapphire nearest heaven itself  ode i   mona on snowdon calls hear thou king of mountains hear hark she speaks from all her strings hark her loudest echo rings king of mountains bend thine ear send thy spirits send them soon now when midnight and the moon meet upon thy front of snow see their gold and ebon rod where the sober sisters nod and greet in whispers sage and slow snowdon mark it is magics hour now the muttered spell has power power to rend thy ribs of rock and burst thy base with thunders shock but to thee no ruder spell shall mona use than those that dwell in musics secret cells and lie steeped in the stream of harmony i   snowdon has heard the strain hark amid the wondering grove other harpings answer clear other voices meet our ear pinnions flutter shadows move busy murmurs hum around rustling vestments brush the ground round and round and round they go through the twilight through the shade mount the oaks majestic head and gild the tufted misseltoe cease ye glittering race of light close your wings and check your flight here arrangd in order due spread your robes of saffron hue for lo with more than mortal fire mighty mador smites the lyre hark he sweeps the masterstrings listen all   chorus break off a sullen smoke involves the altar the central oak does shake i hear the sound of steps profane caractacus retire bear off the victims mona is polluted  semichorus father as we did watch the eastern side we spied and instant seized two stranger youths who in the bottom of a shadowy dell held earnest converse britons do they seem and of brigantian race  chorus haste drag them hither  vellinus elidurus chorus o spare ye sage and venerable druids your countrymen and sons  chorus and are ye britons unheard of profanation rome herself even impious rome whom conquest makes more impious would not have dared so rashly o for words big with the fiercest force of execration to blast the deed and doers  elidurus spare the curse oh spare our youth  chorus is it not now the hour the holy hour when to the cloudless height of yon starrd concave climbs the fullorbd moon and to this nether world in solemn stillness gives sign that to the listening ear of heaven religions voice should plead the very babe knows this and chance awaked his little hands lifts to the gods and on his innocent couch calls down a blessing shall your manly years plead ignorance and impiously presume to press with vile unconsecrated feet on monas hallowed plain know wretches know at any hour such boldness is a crime at this it is sacrilege  vellinus were monas plain more hallowed still hallowed as is heavens self the cause might plead our pardon  elidurus mighty druid true we have rashly dared yet forced by duty our sovreigns mandate   vellinus elder by my birth brother i claim in right of eldership to open our high embassy  chorus speak then but see thy words answer in honest weight to this proud prelude youth they must be weighty to atone for such a crime  vellinus if then to give new nerves to vanquished valor if to do what with the blessing of the gods may save a bleeding country from oppressions sword be weighty business know on our commission and on it is hoped success that weight depends  chorus declare it then at once briefly and boldly  vellinus caractacus is here  chorus say thou proud boy it is boldly said and grant twere truly said think thou he were not here from fraud or force as safe as midst a camp of conquerors here youth he would be guarded by the gods their own high hostage and each sacred hair of his selected head would in these caverns sleep with the unsunnd silver of the mine as precious and as safe record the time when mona ever betrayed the hapless wretch that made her groves his refuge  vellinus holy druid think not so harshly of our enterprise can force alas dwell in our unarmed hands can fraud in our young bosoms no dread seer our business told i trust thou wilt soon disclaim the vain suspicion and thy holy ear be brave caractacus or here or absent shall instant learn it from the north we come the sons of her whose heavnintrusted sway blesses the bold brigantes men who firmly have three long moons withstood those roman powers which led by fell ostorius still assail our frontiers yet so often have our stout swords repelled their hot assault that now like falcons they hang suspended loath to quit their prey nor daring yet to seize it such the state of us and rome mid which our prudent mother revolving what might to her peoples weal best sink the dubious scale gave us swift charge to seek the great caractacus and call his valor to her aid to lead her bands to fight the cause of liberty and britain and quell these ravagers caractacus starts from behind the altar caractacus vellinus elidurus chorus and ye have found me friends ye have found me lead me to your queen and the last purple drop in these old veins shall fall for her and britain  chorus rash rash prince  vellinus ye blessed immortal powers is this the man the more than man who for nine bloody years withstood all rome he is that warlike front seamd over with honest scars proclaims he is kneel brother kneel while in his royal hand we lodge the signet this in pledge of faith great cartismandua sends and with it tells thee she has a nobler pledge than this behind thy queen   caractacus guideria  vellinus safely with our mother  caractacus how when where rescued mighty gods i thank ye for it is true this signet speaks it true o tell me briefly  vellinus in a sally prince which wanting abler chiefs my gracious mother committed to my charge our troops assailed one outwork of the camp the mask of night favored our arms and there my happy hand was doomed mid other prisoners to release the captive matron  caractacus let me clasp thee youth and thou shall be my son i had one stranger just of thy years he looked like thee right honest had just that freeborn boldness on his brow and yet he failed me were it not for him who as thou see even at this hour of joy draws tears down mine old cheek i were as blessed as the great gods oh he has all disgraced his highborn ancestry but i will forget him haste evelina barb my knotty spear bind fast this trusty falchion to my thigh my bow my target   chorus rash caractacus what have thou done what do thou mean to do  caractacus to save my country  chorus to betray thyself that thou have done the rest thou can not do if heaven forbids and of it is awful will thy fury recks not has the bleeding victim poured a propitious stream the milkwhite steeds unreind and neighing prancd with favoring steps say when these youths approached did not a gust of livid smoke involve the bickering flame did not the forest tremble every omen led thee to doubt their honesty of purpose and yet before their tongues could tell that purpose ere i had tendered as our laws ordain their test of faith thy rudeness rushed before me infringing my just rights  caractacus druid methinks at such a time in such a cause reproof might bait it is sternness now by heaven i feel beyond all omens that within my breast that marshals me to conquest something here that snatches me beyond all mortal fears lifts me to where upon her jasper throne sits flamerobd victory who calls me son and crowns me with a palm whose deathless green shall bloom when caesars fades  chorus vain confidence  caractacus yet i submit in all   chorus it is meet thou should thou art a king a sovereign over frail man i am a druid servant of the gods such service is above such sovreignty as well thou know if they should prompt these lips to interdict the thing thou dare to do what would avail thy daring  caractacus holy man but thou will bless it heaven will bid thee bless it thou know that when we fight to save our country we fight the cause of heaven the man that falls falls hallowed falls a victim for the gods for them and for their altars  chorus valiant prince think not we lightly rate our countrys weal or thee our countrys champion well we know the glorious meed of those exalted souls who flame like thee for freedom mark me prince the time will come when destiny and death throned in a burning car the thundering wheels armed with gigantic scythes of adamant shall scour this field of life and in their rear the fiend oblivion kingdoms empires worlds melt in the general blaze when lo from high andraste darting catches from the wreck the roll of fame claps her ascending plumes and stamps on orient stars each patriot name round her eternal dome  caractacus speak ever thus and i will hear thee till attention faint in heedless ecstasy  chorus this though we know let man beware with headlong zeal to rush where slaughter calls it is not courage prince no nor the pride and practiced skill in arms that gains this meed the warrior is no patriot save when obsequious to the will of heaven he draws the sword of vengeance  caractacus surely druid such fair occasion speaks the will of heaven   chorus monarch perchance thou have a fair occasion but if thou have the gods will soon declare it their sovereign will thou know not this to learn demands our search ye mortals all retire leave ye the grove to us and inspiration nor let a step or even one glance profane steal from your caverns stay my holy brethren ye timeennobled seers whose reverend brows full eighty winters whiten you ye bards leoline cadwall hoel cantaber attend upon our slumbers wondrous men ye whose skilled fingers know how best to lead through all the maze of sound the wayward step of harmony recalling often and often permitting her unbridled course to rush through dissonance to concord sweetest then even when expected harshest mador thou alone shall lift thy voice no choral peal shall drown thy solemn warblings thou best know that opiate charm which lulls corporeal sense thou have the key great bard that best can open the portal of the soul unlock it strait and lead the pensive pilgrim on her way through the vast regions of futurity exeunt caractacus vellinus etc etc ode i   hail thou harp of phrygian frame in years of yore that camber bore from troys sepulchral flame with ancient brute to britains shore the mighty minstrel came sublime upon the burnished prow he bad thy manly modes to flow britain heard the descant bold she flung her white arms over the sea proud in her leafy bosom to unfold the freight of harmony i   mute till then was every plain save where the flood mid mountains rude tumbled his tide amain and echo from the impending wood resounded the hoarse strain while from the north the sullen gale with hollow whistlings shook the vale dismal notes and answered soon by savage howl the heaths among what time the wolf does bay the trembling moon and thin the bleating throng i   thou spakst imperial lyre the rough roar ceased and airs from high lapt the land in ecstasy fancy the fairy with thee came and inspiration brighteyd dame often at thy call would leave her sapphire sky and if not vain the verse presumes even now some chaste divinity is near for lo the sound of distant plumes pants through the pathless desert of the air it is not the flight of her it is sleep her dewy harbinger change my harp o change thy measures cull from thy mellifluous treasures notes that steal on even feet ever slow yet never pausing mixed with many a warble sweet in a lingering cadence closing while the pleased power sinks gently down the skies and seals with hand of down the druids slumbering eyes ii   thrice i pause and thrice i sound the central string and now i ring by measured lore profound a sevenfold chime and sweep and swing above below around to mix thy music with the spheres that warble to immortal ears inspiration hears the call she rises from her throne above and sudden as the glancing meteors fall she comes she fills the grove ii   high her port her waving hand a pencil bears the days the years arise at her command and each obedient coloring wears so where times pictured band in hues ethereal glide along o mark the transitory throng now they dazzle now they die instant they flit from light to shade mark the blue forms of faint futurity o mark them ere they fade ii   whence was that inward groan why bursts through closed lids the tear why uplifts the bristling hair it is white and venerable shade why down the consecrated head courses in chilly drops the dews of fear all is not well the paleeyd moon curtains her head in clouds the stars retire save from the sultry south alone the swart star flings his pestilential fire even sleep herself will fly if not recalled by harmony wake my lyre thy softest numbers such as nurse ecstatic slumbers sweet as tranquil virtue feels when the toil of life is ending while from earth the spirit steals and on newborn plumes ascending hastens to lave in the bright fount of day till destiny prepare a shrine of purer clay the druid waking speaks chorus it may not be avaunt terrific ax why hangs thy bright edge glaring over the grove o for a giants nerve to ward the stroke it bows it falls where am i hush my soul twas all a dream resume no more the strain the hour is past my brethren what ye saw if what ye saw as by your looks i read bore like illomend shape hold it in silence the midnight air falls chilly on my breast and now i shiver now a fevrish glow scorches my vitals hark some step approaches  evelina chorus thus with my wayward fears to burst unbidden on your dread synod rousing as ye seem from holy trance appears a desperate deed even to the wretch who dares it  chorus virgin quickly pronounce the cause  evelina bear with a simple maid too prone to fear perchance my fears are vain  chorus but yet declare them  evelina i suspect me much the faith of these brigantes  chorus say thou virgin heed what thou say suspicion is a guest that in the breast of man of ireful man too often his welcome finds yet seldom sure in that submissive calm that smooths the mind of maiden innocence  evelina i know it well yet must i still distrust the elder stranger for while he talks and much the flatterer talks his brothers silent carriage gives disproof of all his boast indeed i marked it well and as my father with the elder held bold speech and warlike as is still his wont when fired with hope of conquest often i saw a sigh unbidden heave the youngers breast half checked as it was raised sometimes methought his gentle eye would cast a glance on me as if he pitied me and then again would fasten on my father gazing there to veneration then he would sigh again look on the ground and hang his modest head most pensively  chorus this may demand my brethren more serious search virgin proceed  evelina it is true my father rapt in high heroic zeal his every thought big with his countrys freedom heeds not the different carriage of these brethren the elder takes him wholly yet methinks the youngers manners have i know not what that speaks him far more artless this besides is it not strange if as the tale reports my mother sojourns with this distant queen she should not send or to my sire or me some fond remembrance of her love ah none with tears i speak it none not her dear blessing has reached my longing ears  chorus the gods my brethren have waked these doubts in the untainted breast of this mild maiden often to female softness often to the purity of virgin souls does heaven it is voluntary light dispense when victims bleed in vain they must be spies hie thee good cantaber and to our presence summon the young brigantian  evilina do not that or if ye do yet treat him nothing sternly the softest terms from such a tender breast will draw confession and if ye shall find the treason ye suspect forbear to curse him not that my weakness means to guide your wisdom yet as i think he would not wittingly ever do a deed of baseness were it granted that i might question him my heart forbodes it more could gain by gentleness and prayers than will the fiercest threats  chorus perchance it may and quickly shall thou try but see the king and with him both the youths  evilina alas my fears forewent my errand else had i informed thee that therefore did i come and from my father to gain admission mark the younger druid how sad he seems often did he in the cave so fold his arms   chorus we mark him much and much the elders free and dreadless confidence virgin retire a while in yonder vale nor till thy royal father quits the grove resume thy station here exit evilina caractacus chorus vellinus elidurus forgive me druid my eager soul no longer could sustain the pangs of expectation hence i sent the virgin innocence of evilina safest to break upon your privacy she not returned o pardon that uncalled i follow the great cause i trust absolves me it is yours it is freedoms it is the cause of heaven and sure heaven owns it such  chorus caractacus all that by sage and sanctimonious rites might of the gods be asked we have essayed and yet nor to our wish nor to their wont gave they benign assent  caractacus death to our hopes  chorus while yet we lay in sacred slumber trancd sullen and sad to fancys frighted eye did shapes of dun and murky hue advance in train tumultuous all of gesture strange and passing horrible starting we waked yet felt no waking calm

licentious mood to interupt our speech ill suits thy years and worse our sanctity  caractacus it is his distress makes him forget what else his reverent zeal would pay ye holily think what he feels poor youth who fears yon moon before she wanes may see his country conquered see his mother the victors slave her royal blood debased dragging her chains through the thronged streets of rome to grace oppressions triumph horrid thought say can it be that he whose strenuous youth adds vigor to his virtue ever can bear this patiently he comes to ask my aid and that witheld as now he needs must fear what means alas are left search britain round what chief dares cope with rome what king but holds his loan of power at a proconsuls will at best a sceptered slave  vellinus yes monarch yes if heaven

fear makes virtue vain tears from yon ministering regents of the sky their right plucks from firmhanded providence the golden reins of sublunary sway and gives them to blind chance if this be so if tyranny must lord it over the earth there is anarchy in heaven nay frown not druid i do not think it is thus  chorus we trust thou do not  caractacus masters of wisdom no my soul confides in that allhealing and allforming power who on the radiant day when time was born cast his broad eye upon the wild of ocean and calmed it with a glance then plunging deep his mighty arm plucked from it is dark domain this throne of freedom lifted it to light girt it with silver cliffs and called it britain he did and will preserve it  chorus pious prince in that allhealing and allforming power still let thy soul confide but not in men no not in these ingenuous as they seem till they are tried by that high test of faith our ancient laws ordain  vellinus illustrious seer methinks our sovreigns signet well might plead her envoys faith thy pardon mighty druid not for ourselves but for our queen we plead mistrusting us ye wound her honor  chorus peace our will admits no parley thither youths turn your astonished eyes behold yon huge and unhewn sphere of living adamant which poised by magic rests it is central weight on yonder pointed rock firm as it seems such is it is strange and virtuous property it moves obsequious to the gentlest touch of him whose breast is pure but to a traitor tho even a giants prowess nervd his arm it stands as fixed as snowdon no reply the gods command that one of you must now approach and try it in your snowy vests ye priests involve the lots and to the younger as is our wont tender the choice of fate  elidurus heavens is it fallen on me  chorus young prince it is prepare thee for thy trial  elidurus gracious gods who may look up to your tremendous thrones and say his breast is pure allsearching powers ye know already how and what i am and what ye mean to publish me in mona to that i yield and tremble  caractacus rouse thee youth and with that courage honest truth supplies for sure ye both are true haste to the trial behold i lead thee on  chorus prince we arrest thy hasty step to witness this high test pertains to us alone awhile retire and in yon cave his brother be thy charge the trial past again will we confer touching that part which heavens deciding choice wills thee to act exeunt caractacus and vellinus chorus elidurus now be the rites prepared and now ye bards chaunt ye that customd hymn the prelude of this famed solemnity  ode i   thou spirit pure that spreadst unseen thy pinions over this ponderous sphere and breathing through each rigid vein fillst with stupendous life the marble mass and bidst it bow upon it is base when sovereign truth is near spirit invisible to thee we swell the solemn harmony hear us and aid thou that in virtues cause oerrulest natures laws o hear and aid with influence high the sons of peace and piety i   firstborn of that ethereal tribe called into birth ere time or place whom wave nor wind can circumscribe heirs of the liquid liberty of light that float on rainbow pennons bright through all the wilds of space yet thou alone of all thy kind can range the regions of the mind thou only know that dark meandring maze where wayward falsehood strays and seizing swift the lurking sprite forces her forth to shame and light i   thou can enter the dark cell where the vulture conscience slumbers and unarmed by charming spell or magic numbers can rouse her from her formidable sleep and bid her dart her raging talons deep yet ah too seldom does the furious fiend thy bidding wait vindictive selfprepard she knows her torturing time too sure to rend the trembling heart when virtue quits her guard pause then celestial guest and brooding on thine adamantine sphere if fraud approach spirit that fraud declare to conscience and to mona leave the rest  chorus heardst thou the awful invocation youth wrapped in those holy harpings  elidurus sage i did and it came over my soul as does the thunder while distant yet it with expected burst threatens the trembling ear now to the trial  chorus ere that bethink thee well what rigrous doom threatens thine act if failing certain death so certain that in our absolving tongues rests not that power may save thee thou must die  evilina elidurus chorus die say thou druid  elidurus evilina here lead to the rock  chorus no youth a while we spare thee and in our stead permit this royal maiden to urge thee first with virgin gentleness respect our clemency and meet her questions with answers prompt and true so may thou scape a sterner trial  elidurus rather to the rock   evilina do thou disdain me prince lost as i am methinks the daughter of caractacus might merit milder treatment i was born to royal hopes and promise nursed in the lap of soft prosperity alas the change i meant but to address a few brief words to this young prince and he does turn his eye and scorns to answer me  elidurus scorn thee sweet maid no it is the fear   evilina and can thou fear me youth even while i led a life of royalty i bore myself to all with meek deportment in nothing harsh or cruel and however misfortune works upon the minds of men for some they say it turns to very stone mine i am sure it softens were thou guilty yet i should pity thee nay were thou leagued to load this suffering heart with more misfortunes still should i pity thee nor ever believe thou would on free and voluntary choice betray the innocent  elidurus indeed i would not  evilina no gracious youth i do believe thou would not for on thy brow the liberal hand of heaven has portrayd truth as visible and bold as were the pictured suns that decked the brows of our brave ancestors say then young prince for therefore have i wished to question thee bring ye no token of a mothers fondness to her expecting child gentle thou seem and sure that gentleness would prompt thine heart to visit and to sooth with courteous office distress like here is a captive and a queen has more than common claim for pity prince and even the ills of venerable age were cause enough to move thy tender nature the tears oercharge thine eye alas my fears sickness or sore infirmity had seized her before thou leftst the palace else her lips had to thy care entrusted some kind message and blessed her hapless daughter by thy tongue would she were here  elidurus would heaven she were  evilina ah why  elidurus because you wish it  evilina thanks ingenuous youth for this thy courtesy yet if the queen thy mother shines with such rare qualities as late thy brother boasted she will calm her woes and i shall clasp her aged knees again in peace and liberty  alas he speaks not all my fears are just  elidurus what fears the queen guideria is not dead  evilina not dead but is she in that sacred state of freedom which we were taught to hope why sighst thou youth thy years have yet been prosperous did thy father ever lose his kingdom did captivity ever seize thy shrieking mother thou can go to yonder cave and find thy brother safe he is not lost as mine is youth thou sighst again thou have not sure such cause for sorrow but if thou have give me thy griefs i pray thee i have a heart can softly sympathize and sympathy is soothing  elidurus o gods gods she tears my soul what shall i say  evilina perchance for all in this bad world must have their woes thou too have thine and may like me be wretched happily amid the ruinous waste of war mid that wild havoc which these sons of blood bring on our groaning country some chaste maid whose tender soul was linked by love to thine might fall the trembling prey to roman rage even at the golden hour when holy rites had sealed your virtuous vows if it were so indeed i pity her  elidurus not that not that never till now did beautys matchless beam  but i am dumb  evilina why that dejected eye and why this silence that some weighty grief oerhangs thy soul thy every look proclaims why then refuse it words the heart that bleeds from any stroke of fate or human wrongs loves to disclose itself that listening pity may drop a healing tear upon the wound it is only when with inbred horror smote at some base act or done or to be done that the recoiling soul with conscious dread shrinks back into itself but thou good youth   elidurus cease royal maid permit me to depart   evilina yet hear me stranger truth and secrecy though friends are seldom necessary friends   elidurus i go to try my truth   evilina o go not hence in wrath think not that i suspect thy virtue yet ignorance may often make virtue slide and if   elidurus in pity spare me  evilina if thy brother  nay start not do not turn thine eye from mine speak i conjure thee is his purpose honest i know the guilty price that barbarous rome sets on my fathers head and gold vile gold has now a charm for britons bribed by this should he betray him  yes i see thou shudderst at the dire thought yet not as if twere strange but as our fears were mutual ah young stranger that open face scarce needs a tongue to utter what works within come then ingenuous prince and instant make discovery to the druid while yet it is not too late  elidurus ah what discover say whom must i betray  evilina thy brother  elidurus ha  evilina who is no brother if his guilty soul teems with such perfidy o all ye stars can he be brother to a youth like thee who would betray an old and honored king that king his countryman and one whose prowess once guarded britain against the assailing world can he be brother to a youth like thee who from a young defenseless innocent maid would take that king her father make her suffer all that an orphan suffers more perchance the ruffian foe  o tears ye choke my utterance can he be brother to a youth like thee who would defile his soul by such black deeds it cannot be  and yet thou still are silent turn youth and see me weep ah see me kneel i am of royal blood not wont to kneel yet will i kneel to thee o save my father save a distressful maiden from the force of barbarous men be thou a brother to me for mine alas hah sees arviragus entering arviragus evilina elidurus chorus evilina rise know maid i never will tamely see thee kneel even at the foot of caesar  evilina it is himself and he will prove my fathers fears were false false as his son is brave thou best of brothers come to my arms where have thou been thou wanderer how were thou saved indeed arviragus i never shed such tears since thou were lost for these are tears of rapture  arviragus evelina fain would i greet thee as a brother ought but wherefore did thou kneel  evelina o ask not now  arviragus by heaven i must and he must answer me whoer he be what art thou sullen stranger  elidurus a briton  arviragus brief and bold  evelina ah spare the taunt he merits not thy wrath behold the druids lo they advance with holy reverence first thou must address their sanctity  arviragus i will but see proud boy thou do not quit the grove till time allows us parley  elidurus prince i mean not  arviragus sages and sons of heaven illustrious druids abruptly i approach your sacred presence yet such dire tidings   chorus on thy peril peace thou standst accused and by a fathers voice of crimes abhorred of cowardice and flight and therefore may not in these sacred groves utter polluted accents quickly say wherefore thou fledst for that base fact uncleard we hold no further converse  arviragus o ye gods am i the son of your caractacus and could i fly  chorus waste not or time or words but tell us why thou fledst  arviragus i fled not druid by the great gods i fled not save to stop our dastard troops that bafely turned their backs i stopped i rallied them when lo a shaft of random cast did level me with earth where pale and senseless as the slain around me i lay till midnight then as from long trance awoke i crawled upon my feeble limbs to a lone cottage where a pitying hind lodged me and nourished me my strength repaired it boots not that i tell what humble arts compelled i used to screen me from the foe how now a peasant from a beggarly scrip i sold cheap food to slaves that named the price nor after gave it now a minstrel poor with illtund harp and uncouth descant shrill i plied a thriftless trade and by such shifts did win obscurity to shroud my name at length to other conquests in the north ostorius led his legions safer now yet not secure i to some valiant chiefs whom war had spared discovered what i was and with them pland how surest we might draw our scattered forces to some rocky fastness in rough caernarvon there to breathe in freedom if not with brave incursion to oppress the thinlystationd foe and soon our art so well availed that now at snowdons foot full twenty troops of hardy veterans wait to call my sire their leader  chorus valiant youth   evelina he is  i said he was a valiant youth nor has he shamed his race  chorus we do believe thy modest tale and may the righteous gods thus ever shed upon thy noble breast discretions cooling dew when nurtured so then only then does valor bloom mature  arviragus yet vain is valor howsoeer it bloom druid the gods frown on us all my hopes are blasted i shall never rejoin my friends never bless them with my father holy men i have a tale to tell will shake your souls your mona is invaded rome approaches even to these groves approaches  semichorus horror horror  arviragus late as i landed on you highest beach where nodding from the rocks the poplars fling their scattered arms and dash them in the wave there were their vessels moored as if they sought concealment mid the shade and as i past up you thickplanted ridge i spied their helms mid brakes and boughs trenchd in the heath below where like a nest of nightworms did they glitter sprinkling the plain with brightness on i sped with silent step yet often did pass so near twas next to prodigy i scapd unseen  chorus their number prince  arviragus few if mine hasty eye did find and count them all  chorus o brethren brethren treason and sacrilege worse foes than rome have led rome hither instant seize that wretch and bring him to our presence  chorus elidurus arviragus say thou false one what doom befits the slave who sells his country  elidurus death sudden death  chorus no lingering peacemeal death and to such death thy brother and thyself we now devote villain thy deeds are known it is known ye led the impious romans hither to slaughter us even on our holy altars  elidurus that on my soul does lie some secret grief these looks perforce will tell it is not fear druids it is not fear that shakes me thus the great gods know it is not ye can never for what though wisdom lifts ye next those gods ye cannot like to them unlock mens breasts and read their inmost thoughts ah that ye could  arviragus what have thou done  elidurus what prince i will not tell  chorus wretch there are means   elidurus i know and terrible means and it is both fit that you should try those means and i endure them yet i think my patience will for some space baffle your torturing fury  chorus be that best known when our inflicted goads harrow thy flesh  arviragus stranger ever this is tried confess the whole of thy black perfidy so black that when i look upon thy youth read thy mild eye and mark thy modest brow i think indeed thou durst not  elidurus such a crime indeed i durst not and would rather be the very wretch thou see i will speak no more  chorus brethren it is so the virgins thoughts were just this youth has been deceived  elidurus yes one word more you say the romans have invaded mona give me a sword and twenty honest britons and i will quell those romans vain demand alas you cannot ye are men of peace religions self forbids lead then to torture  arviragus now on my soul this youth does move me much  chorus think not religion and our holy office does teach us tamely like the bleating lamb to crouch before oppression and with neck outstretchd await the stroke mistaken boy did not strict justice claim thee for her victim we might full safely send thee to these romans inviting their hot charge know when i blow that sacred trumpet bound with sable fillets to yonder branching oak the awful sound calls forth a thousand britons trained alike in holy and in martial exercise not by such mode and rule as romans use but of that fierce potentous horrible sort as shall appall even romans  elidurus gracious gods then there are hopes indeed o call them instant this prince will lead them on i will follow him though in my chains and some way dash them round to harm the haughty foe  arviragus a thousand britons and armed o instant blow the sacred trump and let me head them yet methinks this youth   chorus i know what thou would say might join thee prince true were he free from crime or had confessed  elidurus confessed ah think not i will ever   arviragus reflect either thyself or brother must have wronged us then why conceal   elidurus have thou a brother no else had thou spared the word and yet a sister lovely as thine might more than teach thee prince what it is to have a brother hear me druids though i would prize an hour of freedom now before an age of any after date though i would seize it as the gift of heaven and use it as heavens gift yet do not think i so will purchase it give it me freely i yet will spurn the boon and hug my chains till you do swear by your own hoary heads my brother shall be safe  chorus excellent youth thy words do speak thy soul and such a soul as wakes our wonder thou art free thy brother shall be thine honors pledge so will we use him as thou art false or true  elidurus i ask no other  arviragus thus then my fellow soldier to thy clasp i give the hand of friendship noble youth well speed or die together  chorus hear us prince mona permits not that he fight her battles till duly purified for tho his soul took up unwittingly this deed of baseness yet is lustration meet learn that in vice there is a noisome rankness unperceived by gross corporeal sense which so offends heavens pure divinities as us the stench of vapor wafted from sulphurous pool or poisonous weed obscene hence does the man who even converses with a villain need as much purgation as the pallid wretch scapd from the walls where frowning pestilence spreads wide her livid banners for this cause ye priests conduct the youth to yonder grove and do the needful rites exeunt priests with elidurus mean while ourself will lead thee prince unto thy fathers presence  but hold the king comes forth  caractacus arviragus chorus evelina my son my son what joy what transport does thine aged sire feel in these filial foldings speak not boy nor interrupt that heartfelt ecstacy should strike us mute i know what thou would say yet prithee peace thy sisters voice has cleared thee and could excuse find words at this blessed moment trust me i would give it vent but it is enough thy father welcomes thee to him and honor honor that now with rapturous certainty calls thee his own true offspring do thou weep ah if thy tears swell not from joys free spring i beg thee spare them i have done thee wrong can make thee no atonement none alas thy father scarce can bless thee as he ought unblest himself beset with foes around bereft of queen of kingdom and of soldiers he can but give thee portion of his dangers perchance and of his chains yet droop not boy virtue is still thine own  arviragus it is my father pure as from thine illustrious fount it came and that unsullied let the world oppress us let fraud and falsehood rivet fetters on us still shall our souls be free yet hope is ours as well as virtue  caractacus spoken like a briton true hope is ours and therefore let us prepare the moments now are precious tell us druid is it not meet we see the bands drawn out and mark their due array  chorus monarch even now they skirt the grove  caractacus then let us to their front   chorus but is the traitoryouth in safety lodged  caractacus druid he fled   chorus o fatal flight to mona  caractacus but what of that arviragus is here my son is here then let the traitor go by this he has joined the romans let him join them a single arm and that a villains arm can lend but little aid to any powers opposed to truth and virtue come my son let us to the troops and marshall them with speed that done we from these venerable men will claim their ready blessing then to battle and the swift sun even at his purple dawn shall spy us crowned with conquest or with death exeunt caractacus and arviragus chorus evelina what may his flight portend say evelina how came this youth to scape  evelina and that to tell will fix much blame on my impatient folly for ere your hallowed lips had given permission i flew with eager haste to bear my father news of his sons return enflamed with that think how a sisters zealous breast must glow your looks give mild assent i glowed indeed with the dear tale and sped me in his ear to pour the precious tidings but my tongue scarce named arviragus ere the false stranger as i bethink me since with stealthy pace fled to the caverns mouth  chorus the king pursued  evelina alas he marked him not for twas the moment when he had all to ask and all to fear touching my brothers valor hitherto his safety only which but little moved him had reached his ears but when my tongue unfolded the story of his bravery and his peril o how the tears coursd plenteous down his cheeks how did he lift unto the heavens his hands in speechless transport yet he soon bethought him of romes invasion and with fiery glance surveyed the cavern round then snatched his spear and menaced to pursue the flying traitor but i with prayers o pardon if they erred witheld his step for to the left the youth had winged his way where the thick underwood afforded sure retreat besides if found was age a match for youth  chorus maiden enough better perchance for us if he was captive but in the justice of their cause and heaven do monas sons confide  bard chorus elidurus evelina druid the rites are finished all save that which crowns the rest and which pertains to thy blessed hand alone for that he kneels before thee  chorus take him hence we may not trust him forth to fight our cause  elidurus now by andrastes throne   chorus nay swear not youth the tie is broke that held thy fealty thy brothers fled  elidurus fled  chorus to the romans fled yes thou have cause to tremble  elidurus ah vellinus does thus our love does thus our friendship end was i thy brother youth and have thou left me yes and how left me cruel as thou art the victim of thy crimes  chorus true thou must die  elidurus i pray ye then on your best mercy fathers it may be speedy i would fain be dead if this be life yet i must doubt even that for falsehood of this strange stupendous sort sets firmeyd reason on a gaze mistrusting that what she sees in palpable plain form the stars in yon blue arch these woods these caverns are all mere tricks of cozenage nothing real the vision of a vision if he is fled i ought to hate this brother  chorus yet thou do not  elidurus but when astonishment will give me leave perchance i shall  and yet he is my brother and he was virtuous once yes ye vile romans yes i must die before my thirsty sword drinks one rich drop of vengeance yet ye robbers yet will i curse you with my dying lips twas you that stole away my brothers virtue  chorus now then prepare to die  elidurus i am prepared yet since i cannot now what most i wished by manly prowess guard this lovely maid permit that on your holiest earth i kneel and pour one fervent prayer for her protection allow me this for though you think me false the gods will hear me  evelina i can hold no longer o druid druid at thy feet i fall yes i must plead away with virginblushes for such a youth must plead i will die to save him o take my life and let him fight for mona  chorus virgin arise his virtue has redeemed him and he shall fight for thee and for his country youth thank us with thy deeds the time is short and now with reverence take our high lustration thrice do we sprinkle thee with daybreak dew shook from the maythorn blossom twice and thrice touch we thy forehead with our holy wand now thou art fully purged now rise restored to virtue and to us hence then my son hie thee to yonder altar where our bards shall arm thee duly both with helm and sword for warlike enterprise exit elidurus caractacus chorus arviragus evelina it is true my son bold are their bearings and i fear me not but they have hearts will not belie their looks i like them well yet would to righteous heaven those valiant veterans that on snowdon guard their scanty pittance of bleak liberty were here to join them we would teach these wolves though we permit their rage to prowl our coasts that vengeance waits them ere they rob our altars druid all hail we find thy valiant guards accoutred so as well bespeaks the wisdom that framed their phalanx we but wait thy blessing to lead them against the foe  chorus caractacus behold this sword the sword of old belinus stained with the blood of giants and its name trifingus many an age its charmed blade has slept within you consecrated trunk lo i unsheath it king i wave it over thee mark what portentous streams of scarlet light flow from the brandished falchion on thy knee receive the sacred pledge  and mark our words by the bright circle of the golden sun by the brief courses of the errant moon by the dread potency of every star in the mysterious zodiacs burning girth by each and all of these supernal signs we do adjure thee with this trusty blade to guard yon central oak whose holy stem involves the spirit of high taranis this be thy charge to which in aid we join ourselves and our sage brethren with our vassals thy son and the brigantian prince shall make incursion on the foe  caractacus in this and all your holy will be done yet surely druid the fresh and active vigor of these youths might better suit with this important charge not that my heart shrinks at the glorious task but will with ready zeal pour forth its blood upon the sacred roots my firmest courage might fail to save think fathers i am old and if i fell the foremost in the onset should leave a son behind might still defend you  chorus the sacred adjuration we have uttered may never be recalled  caractacus then be it so yet do not think i counsel this through fear old as i am i trust with half our powers i could drive back these romans to their ships dastards that come as does the cowring fowler to tangle me with snares and take me tamely slaves they shall find that ere they gain their prey they have to hunt it boldly with barbd spears and meet such conflict as the chafed boar gives to his stout assailants o ye gods that i might instant face them  chorus be thy sons the onset  arviragus from his soul that son does thank ye blessing the wisdom that preserves his father thus to the last o if the favoring gods direct this arm if their high will permit i pour a prosperous vengeance on the foe i ask for life no longer than to crown the valiant task steel then ye powers of heaven steel my firm soul with your own fortitude free from alloy of passion give me courage that knows not rage revenge that knows not malice let me not thirst for carnage but for conquest and conquest gained sleep vengeance in my breast ere in its sheath my sword  caractacus o hear his father if ever rashness spurred me on great gods to acts of danger thirsting for renown if ever my eager soul pursued its course beyond just reasons limit visit not my faults on him i am the thing you made me vindictive bold precipitate and fierce but as you gave to him a milder mind o bless him bless him with a milder fate  evelina nor yet unheard let evelina pour her prayers and tears o hear a hapless maid that even through half the years her life has numbered even nine long years has dragged a trembling being beset with pains and perils give her peace and to endear it more be that blessed peace won by her brothers sword o bless his arm and bless his valiant followers one and all  elidurus entering armed hear heaven and let this pure and virgin prayer plead even for elidurus whose sad soul cannot look up to your immortal thrones and urge his own request else would he ask that all the dangers of the approaching fight might fall on him alone that every spear the romans wield might at his breast be aimed each arrow darted on his rattling helm that so the brother of this beauteous maid returning safe with victory and peace might bear them to her bosom  chorus now rise all and heaven that knows what most ye ought to ask grant all ye ought to have the stars on high are faded now and darkness reigns over all now is the dreadful hour now will our torches glare with more livid horror now our shrieks and clanking arms will more appall the foe but heed ye bards that for the sign of onset ye sound the antientest of all your rhymes whose birth tradition notes not nor who framed its lofty strains the force of that high air did julius feel when fired by it our fathers first drove him recreant to his ships and ill had fared his second landing but that fate silenced the master bard who led the song now forth brave pair go with our blessing go mute be the march as ye ascend the hill then when ye hear the sound of our shrill trumpet fall on the foe  caractacus now glory be thy guide pride of my soul go forth and conquer  evelina brother yet one embrace o thou much honored stranger i charge thee fight by my dear brothers side and shield him from the foe for he is brave and will with bold and welldirected arm return thy succor exeunt arviragus and elidurus chorus now ye priests strew on the altars height your sacred leaves and light the morning flame but why is this why does our brother mador snatch his harp from yonder bough why this way bend his step  caractacus he is entranced the fillet bursts that bound his liberal locks his snowy vestments fall in ampler folds and all his floating form does seem to glisten with divinity yet is he speechless say thou chief of bards what is there in this airy vacancy that thou with fiery and irregular glance should scan thus wildly wherefore heaves thy breast why starts   ode     hark heard ye not yon footstep dread that shook the earth with thundering tread twas death  in haste the warrior past high towerd his helmed head i marked his mail i marked his shield i spid the sparkling of his spear i saw his giantarm the falchion wield wide waved the bickring blade and fired the angry air     on me he cried my britons wait to lead you to the field of fate i come yon car that cleaves the air descends to throne my state i mount your champion and your god my proud steeds neigh beneath the thong hark to my wheels of brass that rattle loud hark to my here one of the druids blows the sacred trumpet clarion shrill that brays the woods among     fear not now the fevers fire fear not now the deathbed groan pangs that torture pains that tire bedridden age with feeble moan these domestic terrors wait hourly at my palace gate and when over slothful realms my rod i wave these on the tyrant king and coward slave rush with vindictive rage and drag them to their grave     but you my sons at this high hour shall share the fullness of my power from all your bows in levelled rows my own dread shafts shall shower go then to conquest gladly go deal forth my dole of destiny with all my fury dash the trembling foe down to those darksome dens where romes pale specter lie     where creeps the ninefold stream profound her black inexorable round and on the bank to willows dank the shivering ghosts are bound twelve thousand crescents all shall swell to fullorbd pride and all decline ere they again in lifes gay mansions dwell not such the meed that crowns the sons of freedoms line     no my britons battleslain rapture gilds your parting hour i that all despotic reign claim but there a moments power swiftly the soul of british flame animates some kindred frame swiftly to life and light triumphant flies exults again in martial ecstacies again for freedom fights again for freedom dies  caractacus it does it does unconquered undismaid the british soul revives  champion lead on i follow  give me way some blessed shaft will rid me of this clog of cumbrous age and i again shall in some happier mould rise to redeem my country  chorus stay thee prince and mark what clear and amberskirted clouds rise from the altars verge and cleave the skies o it is a prosperous omen soon expect to hear glad tidings  caractacus i will send them to thee  chorus but see a bard approaches and he bears them else is his eye no herald to his heart  bard chorus caractacus caractacus speedily tell thy tale  bard a tale like mine i trust your ears will willingly pursue through each glad circumstance first monarch learn the roman troop is fled  chorus great gods we thank ye  caractacus fought they not ere they fled o tell me all  bard silent as night that wrapped us in her veil we paced up yonder hill whose woody ridge oerhung the ambushd foe no sound was heard step felt or sight descried for safely hid beneath the purple pall of sacrifice did sleep our holy fire nor saw the air till to that pass we came where whilom brute planted his five hoar altars to our rites then swift we hasted and in one short moment each rocky pile was clothed with livid flame near each a whiterobd druid whose stern voice thundered deep execrations on the foe now waked our horrid symphony now all our harps terrific rang meanwhile the grove trembled the altars shook and through our ranks our sacred sisters rushed in sable robes with hair disheveled and funereal brands hurled round with menacing fury on they rushed in fierce and frantic mood as is their wont amid the magic rites they do to night in our deep dens below motions like these were never dared before in open air  chorus did i not say we had a power within us that might appall even romans  bard and it did they stood aghast and to our vollied darts that thick as hail fell on their helms and corslets scarce raised a warding shield the sacred trumpet then rent the air and instant at the signal rushed down arviragus with all our vassals a hot but shortlived conflict then ensued for soon they fled i saw the romans fly before i left the field  caractacus my son pursued  bard the prince and elidurus like twin lions did side by side engage death seemed to guide their swords no stroke fell fruitless every wound gave him a victim  caractacus thus my friend ebrancus illfated prince did thou and i in youth unite our valors in his prime he fell on conways banks i saw him fall and slew his murderer  but how far did they pursue  bard even to the ships for i descried the rout far as the twilight gleam would aid my sight  caractacus now thanks to the bright star that ruled his birth yes he will soon return to claim my blessing and he shall have it poured in tears of joy on his bold breast methought i heard a step is it not his  bard it is some of our own train and

quotations from ancient authors are here thrown together in order to support and explain some passages in the drama that respect the manners of the druids and which the general account of their customs to be found in our histories of britain does not include  page      on the left beside the sages skilled in natures lore  ie the euvates one of the three classes of the druids according to am

universe is shown to be on pythagorean principles whenever the priests are mentioned in the subsequent parts of the drama this order of men is intended to be meant as distinguished from the druids and bards  page     thou shall live yet shall thou live an interdicted wretch all rights of nature cancelled alluding to the druidical power of excommunication mentioned by caesar si quis aut privatus aut

retain variety of charms and have still toward the landsend the amulet of maen magal and glain neidr which latter they call a milpreu or melpreu and have a charm for the snake to make it when they have found one asleep and struck a hazel wand in the center of her spires  page      have the milk white steeds unreind and neighing prancd with favoring steps the few and imperfect accounts antiquity gives us of ceremonies etc which are unquestionably druidical makes it necessary in this and in other places of the drama to have recourse to tacituss account of the germans amongst whom if there were really no established druids there was certainly a great correspondency in religious opinions with the gauls and britons the passage here alluded to is taken from his  0th chapter proprium gentis
