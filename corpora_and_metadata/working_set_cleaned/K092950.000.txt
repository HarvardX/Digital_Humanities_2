price two shillings  the following little pieces fruits of some leisure hours are exposed with the same indifference they were conceived if they prove useful the end is gained if not there is no great harm done no man will grudge the author the satisfaction of a laudable attempt he shall grudge no man the privilege of reading or neglecting of approving or condemning  jus tertii when a man pleads any point in which he has no legal interest i e from the gaining of which he can propose to himself no just or reasonable advantage he is removed personali objectione from pleading such point for the law encourages no man to stand in the way of his neighbor unless his own interest be at stake  this personal objection is expressed commonly by the name of justertii and the position runs thus that it is jus tertii to found upon any alledgance which does not terminate in the legal interest of the proponer but of a third party which comes in plain english to this sir you are not pleading for your self but for another and this is the true touchstone to discover when the jus tertii is well or ill founded if the proponer can show he has any legal interest any just benefit or advantage in making the alledgance this personal objection of jus tertii can never lie against him  in the application of this doctrine the greatest difficulty is in judging what is a legal interest that every accidental or occasional benefit does not come up to a legal interest is plain as to this matter all arguments drawn from possible contingencies are cut off a legal interest must be something fixed somewhat the proponer is founded in law to plead upon and to be cut out of which he can subsume upon as an act of injustice this falls to be estimated and judged of by the situation the proponer is in from the nature of his claim and relation to his party  for example a nullity of the execution of a warning against a tenant to remove being objected against an adjudger whose adjudication was expired by another who was not within the year of him but both were infeft the lords found the nullity not competent for that second adjudger to object unless he were either preferable or to come in pari passu and therefore repelled it as jus tertii to him fountainhal forbes  0th june   0  rule contra purdie so far the matter is clear  in a removing against a tenant the defender was not allowed to plead upon the right of a third party as preferable to the pursuer unless he would subsume upon some right made to him by the third party erskine col stuart contra lord of grange for here the tenant could not figure the smallest advantage in pleading upon the right of the third party unless it were   mo a possibility that the third party would not turn him out   do that for one year at least he could not not having given any warning to the tenant both which being accidental and contingent the law respects not as not coming up to a legal interest or such a reasonable benefit which being cut out off he can subsume that he has met with material injustice which a tenant can never say who is removed upon a legal warning by any person having a colorable title to the lands all his legal interest is to pay his rent securely it belongs not at all to him to object against the pursuers title providing ex facie it appear to be good or to dip into the question whether some third party may not have a better title  the like is observed by colvil december      countess of errol contra tenants where a liferent being competent to a lady by her husband who was only liferenter himself in an action of removing against tenants at her instance after her husbands decease this exception that her liferent was extinct by her husbands decease was repelled as being jus tertii to the tenants  another example is mentioned by spotiswood voce escheat and liferent   d march    0 murray contra commissary of dunkeld in a special declarator of the commissary of dunkelds escheat pursued by mr patrick murray the defender propond an alledgance upon the ordinary backbond given to the treasurer by the donatar which bore that he should not use the gift to the prejudice of the rebels creditors this the rebel alleged might be propond in his own name as well as the creditors seeing he was interested to see his creditors rather paid by his own escheatable goods than that the donatar should meddle therewith and the creditors be obliged to have recourse to his lands or his person the lords repelled this as not competent to be proponed in the rebels own name here the rebel had a plain and fixed interest but still he was denied the benefit of the alledgance because it was not a legal interest sciz such an interest or benefit he was entitled to by law because a backbond of the nature mentioned in the decision can have no respect to the advantage of the rebel whose escheat falls in modum poenae but respects solely the creditors and therefore the creditors may plead upon it the rebel never can  in a declarator of property the defender pretending no right in his own person was not suffered to make any objection against the pursuers title stair    july      lord fraser contra lord of philorth here the defender by making the alledgance and removing the pursuer could have no other view but to retain possession for some time longer which is so far from a legal interest that it is plainly injustifiable in respect it is more reasonable to give him the possession who has some colorable title than to allow it to remain with the person who has no pretense at all  and in a declarator of the property of teinds though the title of the process was a progress exceedingly ill connected and laboring under many infirmities yet the lords sustained the title in the same way as if the action had been a reduction and improbation of landrights and found it to be sufficient against naked heritors pretending no right to the teinds of their lands and that it was jus tertii for them to object against it the defenders yielded that any presumptive title might do in a question of lands because no man can pretend the smallest interest in or to lands but in consequence of some conveyance some written document which if he has not it is indeed jus tertii to object against any presumptive title in the person of another but that could never happen in a question of teinds because an heritors right to the lands suppose he has none to the teinds gives him a sufficient title and plain interest to object against any mans being declared titular of his teinds which was enforced from these considerations   mo that every heritor has a right to have his teinds declared free rather than the property of any man and that because several legal interests arise to him thereby   do every heritor has an interest that his teinds should belong to the crown rather than to a subject the exchequer being in use to grant tacks to heritors of their teinds at a very easy rate and rather to belong to the patron from whom they can acquire at six years purchase than to any other titular who can demand nine  the question comes precisely here whether the alledgance made for the defenders amounted to a legal interest such a benefit as it was unjust to deprive them of that it is a legal interest the court was of opinion   th november    0 mitchel contra baillie and shearer observed by forbes where a charter of adjudication of the teinds of certain lands with infeftment thereon was not found a sufficient title to oblige the heritor of the lands to make payment of the teinds without producing the adjudication itself and instructing a right to them in the person of him they were adjudged from albeit no other right appeared to compete  a vassal being pursued by a purchaser of the superiority made this defense that the sellers relict was infeft as conjunct fiar and that he the defender was bound to acknowledge none other for his superior during her lifetime which was sustained colvil  may      lord of capringtoun contra lord of caldwells this alledgance was not jus tertii because vassals have a legal interest to keep their charterchests shut against every one but their proper superior  having thus given a general idea of my subject the application thereof will best be seen by induction of particular cases which for clearness sake i shall range under different heads  position i a debtor pursued by an assigney is founded in an interest to allege that it appears ex facie scripturae or is otherwise necessarily consistent with his knowledge that there is no right in the assigneys person because in this case he cannot pay safely but if ex facie scripturae by the production it appear that the assigneys right is founded the debtor cannot be allowed to plead upon any exception to take away the assigneys right unless it be so notorious as necessarily to superinduce a mala fides such an exception is jus tertii as to him he has no interest in it all his concern is to pay safely and he pays safely when he pays to the man who has the face of a title especially interposita authoritate praetoris  as to the first branch of the position see durie march        ramsay contra mackieson here a debtor being pursued by his creditor upon a bond it was found competent for him to propone this alledgance that the pursuers escheat was gifted and the special declarator intimated to him the debtor which declarator though afterward passed from as to him by the donatar was equivalent as if the pursuer had been denuded by an assignation intimate and therefore he could not pay bona fide  as to the second branch see durie    december      hamilton contra durham in which this exception proponed by a party in whose hands arrestment was laid was repelled as being jus tertii sciz that the arrester could not demand the sum to be made furthcoming in regard he had recovered payment from the common debtor  james ballantine took a bond payable to himself and after his decease to  ballantine his son john ballantines name was afterward filled up in this bond though he was born after the date thereof and he was found to have good action as a substitute against the debtor who had no interest to debate how johns name came into the bond that being jus tertii seeing there was no other heir or child pretending right stair dirleton   january      ballantine contra edgar  a debtor objecting against the donatary of his creditors forfeiture that the creditor himself was only an executor which being an office could not be assigned far less could be carried away by the forfeiture except as to the executors own share the lords found this alledgance jus tertii to the debtor and therefore repelled it fountainhall   th november      graham contra lin there may be some doubt as to this decision the pursuer here had not even a colorable title the defect appeared ex facie scripturae it seems incumbent upon a defender to take notice of such a defect and upon the judge to sustain it for the benefit of those who shall really be found to have the jus exigendi  position ii it is not jus tertii in a defender to found upon the right of a third party when the intent is only to make out that he himself is not liable  in a pursuit for liquidating the avail of a marriage it being alleged by the donatary that it was jus tertii for the apparent heir to say that his father died not in the fie as being denuded by an adjudger who was publicly infeft unless that adjudger would appear and defend the lords found that it was not jus tertii but competent to the apparent heir to found upon it fountainhall    february   0  lord rae contra innes  position iii when payment is offered to a creditor it is jus tertii for him to object that the person is not entitled to make the offer because a creditor is bound to accept of payment from whatever hand  a party served and retoured heir to a defunct offering to redeem an adjudger who alleged that the party to whom the heir was retoured was presumed alive his death not being instructed the lords found that the alledgance was jus tertii to the adjudger and sustained process at the heirs instance upon the retour produced in regard there was no nearer heir quarrelling the same    july      hay contra dobbie the matter comes here an adjudication within the legal which was the case here being only a security for debt may be extinguished by whoever offers payment after expiration of the legal when it becomes a right of property the adjudger is not bound to debate the relevancy of objections tending to annul his right or open the legal unless with a person connecting a good title to the lands  in the redemption of a wadset by an appriser of the reversion it was found jus tertii for the wadsetter to allege the apprising was fallen by prescription fountainhall   november   0  nicol contra park here the prescription might have been interrupted and it was not reasonable to oblige the appriser to enter into this dispute with a person who had no other interest but to get payment but this matter is not without some seeming difficulty for if a wadset be considered only as a bare security for money there does not a reason occur why it should not be extinguishable by any person whatever offering payment if it be considered as a right of property in lands redeemable only by the reverser himself and those deriving right from him by effectual conveyances upon that supposition the wadsetter ought to be allowed to make every objection against the title of the redeemer and in my opinion would be well founded in the objection of prescription mentioned in the case  position iv it is not jus tertii in an apparent heir to allege that the pursuer has no jus agendi though the apparent heir refuses to acknowledge the passive titles  the reason is that regularly before the defender is obliged to recur to any defenses the pursuer must show that he is founded in his action and unless he make out this point the defender is not obliged to say whether he represents or not being founded in a legal interest to keep this matter private from every one save the defuncts just creditors thus then an apparent heir without involving himself in the passive titles may propone every objection against the pursuers claim that arises ex facie scripturae or that he can otherwise instantly verify objections indeed that require a proof stand upon another footing not that it is jus tertii in the defender to propone them the reason why the apparent heir after proponing such objections is not suffered to deny the passive titles is allenarly the hardship upon the creditor in obliging him to sustain a long proof which cannot possibly be of any benefit to him so long as the defender has in it his power to deny the passive titles  position v in a competition betwixt two rights to the same subject whereof the one under which my competitor claims is in it self preferable it is jus tertii for me to object that his progress is not well connected which is only competent to one having a more complete progress to the same right or interest  for example a has an absolute good progress to the infeftment x b has but a lame progress to the infeftment y yet b is preferred y being supposed the preferable infeftment and the reason is it is just to give b who has at least a doubious title a preference to a who can have no pretense as long as the infeftment y is in the field the respective interests produced are ranked according to their legal preference and the persons claiming upon these interests if they have any appearance of a connected title take their places accordingly this being premised it is obvious that a can have no legal interest to impugn bs progress for though it should be found that c has right to the infeftment y and not b that does not benefit a he can propose to himself no advantage by gaining the point because in that case the judge would prefer c and not a  the right of a feu vassal being apprised from him and the apprising again dispond to another the superiors heir raised reduction and improbation against the disponee and obtained certification against the principal sasine on the original charter and against the grounds and warrants of the apprising notwithstanding of which it was found jus tertii in the pursuer to quarrel the want of these writs in respect that as heir to the ganter of the original feu charter he was liable to warrant it fountainhall   february      earl of forfar contra gilhaigie observed also by mr forbes as of    january      for the original feu charter which was produced being plainly preferable to the pursuers claim of property since he was debarred thereby it was the same thing to him who was vassal in that question he could have no legal interest  in two mutual declarators touching the right of a salmond fishing the one produced a charter from his majesty with a well connected progress down to the time of the competition the other produced a right from a subject of a much older date but not well connected for many of the interveening years in so much that his progress so much of it as was well connected did not go so far back as his competitors yet it was found that the person deriving right from his majesty had no interest to object the want of midcouples to the other and that it was jus tertii and incompetent for him to object and obtrude that defect unless he derived right from the same author or any succeeding in his right fountainhall   december   0  forbes of watertoun contra udney  in a competition anent the property of lands betwixt a less preferable interest and an adjudication of the preferable interest it was found jus tertii in the party compeating upon the less preferable interest to allege that the adjudication was satisfied and paid by intromissions within the legal forbes    june      murray contra mlellan  position vi in a competition i am not allowed to found upon the interest of a third party as preferable to that of my antagonist  the proof of the immediately foregoing position is equally applicable to this  john murray served himself heir in general to alexander maxwel his grandfather and upon that title did compeat with neilson of chaple who had adjudications in his person led originally against the said alexander maxwel conveyed by the creditor to elisabeth maxwel and from her to the said neilson of chaple it was contended for john murray that elisabeth maxwel the intermediate author had disponed these apprisings to her husband gilbert mcartney and that therefore neilsons right was null as granted a non habente potestatem the lords found it jus tertii for john murray to found upon the right of gilbert mcartney unless he derived right from him this was found anno      in the competition neilson of chaple and lanerick of ladylands with john murray here the objection against neilson viz that his author was denuded and consequently that he could have no right was in it self good but then his competitor was not allowed to found upon it because he could show no legal interest therein for what if neilsons right should be found null that would signify to mcartney indeed if he pleased to appear but nothing to murray who was at any rate excluded by the adjudications whoever had right to them  position vii but as law allows me to use every argument tending to annull or cut down the title upon which my competitor founds when the consequence is to prefer my own title it is not jus tertii to found upon the interest of a third party when it tends to prove not that the third party is preferable which would be jus tertii but that i my self am preferable by the nullity of my competitors right  x is infeft in lands he gives a disposition containing procuratory to a who assigns first to b and then to c but c is first infeft betwixt the dates of these two infeftments x grants a second disposition to d who obtains himself infeft prior to b but posterior to c upon the supposition that a personal conveyance denudes of a personal right quaeritur how is this matter to be extricated b is preferred to c upon the footing of this brocard a being supposed entirely denuded by his first assignation in favors of b c is preferred to d as first infeft and d to b for the same reason and thus the matter becomes plainly inextricable unless d be allowed to plead that cs infeftment is null as flowing a non habente potestatem his author a being ab ante denuded in favors of b the difficulty in this cass is that it is jus tertii for d to plead upon bs assignation the answer is that this very example must show it not to be jus tertii since the consequence would plainly be to make the affair inextricable which is a downright absurdity to take a general view of the matter it appears without controversy that d is the man who is first legally infeft and who has first denuded the common author x now if this be the plain matter of fact i can see no good reason why d should not be allowed to found upon it it is a rule in our law that alii per alium acquiritur obligatio the principle upon which this is founded will equally support another rule that alii per alium acquiritur exceptio and when we consider the nature of this objection of jus tertii the difficulty will evanish according to the definition it arises from pleading a point wherein the party has no interest and the gaining of which cannot profit him the direct contrary is the case here for if cs infeftment be found null d comes in of course  to explain this matter further let us take a view of a decision observed by forbes   th dec   0  colonel erskine contra sir george hamilton in which a person having a real right in lands was allowed to object against a competing adjudication that it was null as being led upon a bond paid by the debtor albeit he who quarrelled the adjudication derived no right from the person against whom it was led  this decision is obviously well founded and yet therein we see a party allowed to found upon the deed of a third person with whom he does not connect viz the payment made to his competitor by the common debtor and he is allowed to do so for this precise reason that thereby he comes to establish a preference to himself now i can see no difference betwixt this decision and the case in hand in both a party is allowed to found upon the deed of a third person with whom he has no connection and in both he has equally a legal benefit in so doing in a word there is nothing more common in law than to see people founding upon the deeds of third parties such alledgances cast up in a thousand shapes every day if they can show no legal interest in so doing it is jus tertii they are debarred personali objectione if they can show a legal interest they ought to be heard this is also fortified by the doctrine contained in position ii for if a defender can found upon the right of a third party in order to obtain absolvitor for the fame reason may a competitor found upon the right of a third party to obtain preference  another case is related by lord stair   d july      johnston contra arnold to this purpose in a competition betwixt two apprisings whereupon infeftment had followed both led before the act bringing in apprisers pari passu the first appriser was also first infeft but it was objected against the infeftment by the second appriser that it was null being in name of an assigney to the apprising who did not appear to have any right no assignation being produced this the lords fustained and did not find it jus tertii to object the want of the said assignation  nb the competition run betwixt the second appriser and the heir of the first appriser who had also in his person a conveyance from the assigney in whose name infeftment was taken  position viii where an alledgance tends not to make my partys title absolute ly null but only reduceable or annullable at the instance of a third party it is jus tertii for me to found upon it  for example a donatar of ward and nonentry pursuing the vassal for the nonentry duties fallen due several years after elapsing of the ward this gift of nonentry continues but three terms after the ward in competition with the king or another donatar but is still good against the vassal and therefore it is reckoned jus tertii for him to found upon it haddington  th july      dickson contra lord dawick a spuilie was sustained although at committing the same the party injured was at the horn it being found jus tertii to the defender to allege that the action in that case was competent only to the king and his donatat maitland   th june      lord kinfauns contra lord craigie the reason is that denunciation does not ipso facto divest the rebel of his movables he remains still proprietor until the king pleases to take the benefit of his rebellion and therefore the decision would probably have gone otherwise if the defender could have subsumed upon a general or special declarator at the donatars instance in a process at a ministers instance for his stipend it was objected by the heritors that he was not duly admitted by a presentation conform to the statute  0 annae rerestoring patronages this was found jus tertii to the heritors being competent only to the patron himself forbes   th june      mbain contra lord of scatwell in a reduction of a subtack upon this ground that by a clause therein if the subtacksman failed in paying of his tackduty at certain terms the tack should be null this nullity was only found competent to the tacksman himself setter of the subtack not to the master in respect it was not an absolute nullity but in favors of the tacksman if he pleased to lay hold upon it durie   th dec      earl of galloway contra m culloch  it may be worth notice that this position does not so directly come under the doctrine of jus tertii in the decisions just now mentioned the alledgeances were repelled not so much upon the footing of a jus tertii that the proponer had no interest to make them but truly because they were by no means conclusive did not infer what they were brought to prove which above all is plain from the last mentioned decision in which there was not wanting a legal interest to found the proponer in his alledgance of nullity he failed only in this that it was not found to be a nullity there is a wide difference betwixt a null right and a right annullable a nullity in a right may be pled upon by every one who can show an interest in the question the power of annulling by no mortal but who is vested with the power  beneficium cedendarum actionum when a creditor has different persons or subjects bound to him for security and payment of his debt it naturally arises to be a question how far he has it in his power to exerce his right arbitrarily by loading one and freeing another and when he does so if there is any relief competent to the person or subject overburdened questions of this nature may be easily solvable in the simple cases but the connections betwixt persons and subjects creditors and debitors preferable and secondary securities cast up so various and intricate and run out so great a length that one is apt to lose himself if he does not begin at principles and go on step by step from the more easy to the more intricate cases  it appears in the first place agreeable to principles of justice and humanity that creditors having bound to them different persons or their effects should not be allowed arbitrarily to load one and exempt others there are two good reasons for this one a priori the other a posteriori the one a priori is drawn from this law of nature that every man is confined in the way of using his property so as to be least hurtful to others he is allowed to prefer himself but his own interest being out of the question he has no longer liberty to go on to take any step in aemulationem vicini either by directly doing damage or by using the pretext of his property arbitrarily to prejudge one for the benefit of another to take this in somewhat a different light property was introduced not that men should be indulged to use it wantonly but only in so far as beneficial to themselves therefore every man may use his property while his private interest goes along there his power is at an end after that the law takes it out of his hands and directs it so as in the whole to do most good to others and when the matter is brought there it is plain that the law which is no respecter of persons never acts arbitrarily but deals to every one with an equal hand the consideration a posteriori is drawn from the numberless inconveniences that might ensue if creditors were indulged in this arbitrary proceeding it would naturally introduce underhand fraudulent pactions betwixt the creditor who holds the balance and some one or other of the debitors in order to throw the burden upon others every one would endeavor to bribe highest to get himself relieved and thus bribery and corruption would go on to the destruction of debitors whereby their creditors would have an opportunity of making unjust gains by extortion which no civilized country will indulge  the roman law and ours go thus far hand in hand that a debtor paying is entitled to demand assignation from the creditor against his fellow debtor l    l    fidejuss here the roman law stops at least that of the pandects and gives no action for relief to one codebitor against another where the action is not ceded l    fidejuss this is better ordered in our law with us the debtor who pays has directly an action for a proportionable relief against his codebitor without necessity of assignation this is not understood to proceed from any paction expressed or implied betwixt the correi debendi it flows directly from the above principle sciz that a creditor is confined from exercing his right arbitrarily he ought to draw a proportional part from every one of his debitors or if for his own ease he chooses to draw the whole from one it is incumbent upon him to assign his debt and diligence that the person making payment may have a proportional relief off others and because it is a rule that what ought always to be done is ever held as done the law to abridge the unnecessary circuit of an assignation gives directly an action of relief to the debtor making payment against his fellow debitors whether he has an assignation or not this seems to have been the law of the codex l   c de duob reis and this is our common practice at this day  thus the matter is fixed upon the most solid and equitable footing so far as relates to personal relief amongst fellowdebitors it must be acknowledged that our practice is but in its infancy as to real relief that ought to be competent to the proprietor or secondary creditor out of whose fund payment is drawn against the other funds upon which the preferable debt is equally secured to give the plainest example two persons conjunctly and severally oblige themselves to pay a sum and grant each of them an heritable bond out of their respective lands upon which infeftment follows so far the matter is clear by our practice that the debtor out of whose estate the whole sum is made effectual by virtue of the infeftment of annualrent has personal relief off his fellowdebitor but why not also real relief that is why should he not be entitled to take up the creditors infeftment upon the other debitors lands in order to be ranked for that part of the sum which he has paid over and above his proportion it appears without controversy that there is the same foundation for both it may possibly be objected that after the debt is paid out of one debitors effects the bond falls extinguished with all its consequences but in answer to this it is urged   mo that it is jus tertii for the debtor himself or his real creditors to plead upon this since in all events no more is intended to be drawn from him than his proportion of the debt   do and principaliter at any rate this might have been done by the circuit of an assignation now as is above laid down the law supplies this and grants an implied assignation for truly the action for relief betwixt codebitors whether personal or real is no other than an action upon an implied legal assignation the matter then comes out thus from each of the debitors the creditor has strictly right to demand payment of the one half if he choose to poind the ground of one of the debitors for the whole which he may do for his own convenience the law supposes that he takes the one half in payment of that debitors proportion of the debt but as for the other half that is not supposed taken in payment of a debt which the other debtor is ultimately liable in but as the price of the legal assignation see l    fidejus and therefore the creditors infeftment remains still good upon the other debitors lands as to that half which may accordingly be taken up in virtue of the legal assignation by the debtor who has paid the whole the benefit of this legal assignation would be of considerable effect in practice amongst others it would remove the pretext that debitors have to suspend real diligence in order to obtain an actual assignation  it is true no traces appear in the roman law of this real relief otherwise than by the circuit of an assignation with respect to which there is a remarkable text l   pr de cens but neither were they acquainted with the personal relief at least by the ancient law however as the foundation of real relief is plainly laid down in the said l   de cens it would be no great stretch to establish it even in the roman law by an argument drawn from the said l   c de duob reis  the principle being thus fixed it will be easy to draw out a rule for adjusting all the kinds of real and personal relief amongst codebitors and secondary creditors a creditor who has several persons bound to him in a debt is supposed to take payment equally and proportionally from every one of them if he chooses to draw more from any one than his proportion this is not understood as taken in payment but as the price of an assignation actual or legal this intitles the payer to come in place of the creditor as to that superplus which accordingly he may draw from the other debitors after the very same manner when a catholic creditor whose infeftment reaches over two tenements draws the whole out of one the person overburdened whether proprietor or only a secondary creditor ought to be entitled to act in the creditors name to be refunded of the superplus over and above his proportion out of the other tenement whereby equality is preserved amongst all concerned and no person or subject bears a greater or less burden than his situation obliges him to and thus the rule comes out that real or personal relief goes no further than to be refunded of what the subject or person has been burdened with over and above his proportion  we must now come to particulars and for methods sake it may be proper   mo to handle such cases as fall directly under the rule   do these cases which by reason of special circumstances may be ranked under the head of exceptions  proposition i supposing a preferable infeftment upon the tenements a and b both pertaining to the common debtor and a secondary infeftment upon a only the secondary creditor infeft in the tenement a out of which tenement the catholic creditor chooses to draw his whole debt is entitled only to a proportional relief out of the tenement b though there be no other infeftment upon it save that belonging to the catholic creditor  this is a direct inference from the rule above laid down the catholic creditor is supposed fictione juris to draw proportionally out of the two tenements and if in fact he does otherwise the creditor overburdened has relief indeed but only so far as he is overburdened as to a total assignation against the tenement b it appears obvious that the secondary creditor upon a is no better entitled to it than any of the personal creditors of the common debtor if the fact be that he has lent more money upon the tenement a than that portion of it will satisfy which remains after a proportional allocation of the catholic right he has himself to blame upon that supposition nothing remains to him but in common with the personal creditors to attack that portion of the tenement b which remains after the said proportional allocation  to take this matter a little more at large let us examine what must be the consequences of a scheme where it is held that the secondary creditor upon a is entitled to demand a total assignation for his relief against the tenement b in case there is no other burden upon it beside the catholic infeftment upon this scheme it is not seen that any creditor can well excuse himself for lending upon the tenement b when there is a secondary creditor upon a and a catholic creditor over both for this would be truly defrauding the secondary creditor of his security if it be alleged   mo that the secondary creditor upon a when he lent his money took his hazard of this it is answered this is no excuse to any party who officiously cuts him out of his hazard by turning it into a certainty against him if it be said   do that the creditor contracting upon b was not bound to know of the creditor upon a the answer is that at any rate no creditor is safe to lend upon b without knowing whether there is a secondary creditor upon a because in proportion to the extent of the other debt his claim upon b falls to be more or less restricted besides it is enough to qualify mala fides that a man chooses to do what he sees may very possibly produce mischief to others though the mischief be not absolutely certain if it be said   tio that the creditor upon b does no more than any creditor does who lends upon heritable security knowing his debtor to have personal creditors the difference is that the tenement b upon the present supposition is understood to be a security to the creditor upon a by his right to demand assignation preferable to all other creditors which security the creditor upon b in part cuts him out of now personal creditors have no security upon their debitors lands they may effect it by diligence but so may they the money come in its place from all which it appears that if it be a lawful commerce for a creditor to lend upon b while there is another secondary creditor upon a and a catholic creditor over both which cannot be disputed it must follow that the creditor upon a has but a proportional relief off the tenement b even when there is no burden upon b save that of the catholic creditors  what is said here with respect to a creditor lending upon b may be applied with equal force to a purchaser of the subject  corrollary hence in the proportional relief betwixt the secondary creditors the creditor upon b though posterior is in no worse situation than the creditor upon a though prior  scholium it is laid down in the proposition that the secondary creditor upon a is entitled only to a proportional relief out of the tenement b now this he can demand of right and can by no alteration of circumstances be cut out off but at the same time there is nothing to bar the catholic creditor from assigning in totum if he pleases so long as no secondary creditor appears upon the tenement b the granting of an assignation in such circumstances not being a matter of justice or equity in which one is tied down but of pure favor the very conception of which supposes the action to be voluntary or arbitrary  it is very true that in this situation the catholic preferable creditor has it in his power to favor either the secondary creditor upon a or the personal creditors who have not attached either of the subjects if he deny an assignation all that remains for the secondary creditor upon a after adjusting the proportional relief is to adjudge the tenement b pari passu with the personal creditors which will entitle him to a share of what remains of the tenement b unexhausted after the proportional relief if on the other hand the catholic creditor vouchafe to grant assignation the personal creditors have no access unless the two tenements do more than satisfy both the real debts this indeed is an arbitrary proceeding but at the same time not such as the law has any caveat against because as above laid down in matters of favor every one must act arbitrarily the personal creditors having no nexus upon the tenement b having not so much as the pretense of lending their money upon the faith of it are founded in no title to oppose a total assignation the catholic creditor is not so much as bound to know that there are any personal creditors and has no counection or concern with them when therefore in these circumstances the catholic creditor chooses to favor the secondary creditor upon a by granting him a total assignation this is not cutting down or hurting one creditor in favors of another since the personal creditors have no nexus upon the tenement b it is at most but disappointing them of a hope which may be lucrum cessans but is by no means damnum datum it is another case if the personal creditors have by diligence attached the tenement b it is thought that even a bare citation in an adjudication is a sufficient nexus upon the tenement b to enforce a proportional relief betwixt them and the secondary real creditor upon a for after citation it is no longer a matter of favor but of justice and equity  yet after all if there is any appearance that a total assignation is the result of a contrivance betwixt the two real creditors to disappoint the personal creditors it is left to be considered if upon that supposition the assignation might not be cut down upon the head of collusion and there would be the more ground for this if such assignation were granted after nottour bankruptcy which indeed would be very suspicious  proposition ii supposing still a catholic creditor over the tenements a and b the same proportional real relief will he competent betwixt the secondary creditor upon a and a purchaser of the tenement b and e contra  for there being no greater connection betwixt the catholic and secondary creditor than betwixt the catholic creditor and the purchaser there appears nothing in the variation of circumstances to disturb the proportional allocation of the catholic debt which brings it to the common case if it be objected that the purchaser upon the obligation of remuneration is entitled to a total assignation since the catholic debt is drawn out of his funds whereas when it is taken out of the tenement a it is drawn out of funds that belong to the common debtor which does not entitle the secondary creditor to remuneration the answer is that neither is the purchaser here entitled to remuneration the catholic creditor is not bound in any sense to acknowledge the purchaser when he draws his payment out of the tenement b though now no longer in his debitors person he is doing no more but explicating his own right and therefore there is no connection no negotium gestum inter eos to infer any such remuneration if it be urged   do that the purchaser in this case being entitled to relief off the common debtor upon his warrandice it is answered that the secondary creditor upon a when he is cut out by the catholic creditor has as well founded a title for relief  corrollary if the purchaser of the tenement b retain sufficient in his hand to satisfy the catholic debt in that case if the catholic creditor draws payment out of a the secondary creditor upon that subject is founded in an action against the purchaser for a proportional relief and what is over and above in the purchasers hands remains to be affected by the diligence of all the creditors personal and real if he choose to draw his payment from the purchaser the personal creditors are not entitled to a relief out of the tenement a see what is laid down in schol prop i  scholium   from the whole taken together it appears to be the same whether the subjects belong to the same or different proprietors and whether the persons claiming relief be secondary creditors or purchasers  scholium   the above doctrine will hold equally in all sorts of diligence infeftments of annualrent adjudications inhibitions or arrestments  proposition iii if the catholic creditor lend a second sum to the common debtor upon the subject a before the existence of any debt upon b in this case the proportional allocation will not obtain he is at liberty to draw his preferable sum out of the tenement b in order to make his second debt effectual upon the tenement a  this follows from the first principle for the proportional allocation obtains only when his own interest is out of the question and it cannot be said that he acts arbitrarily in drawing his preferable debt out of b when he has the reasonable view of saving his other debt upon a nor is any one prejudged thereby since it is easy to know from the records what debts are upon the tenement a before a creditor is in safety to lend upon b it is requisite at any rate to know what burdens are upon a preferable to the catholic infeftment and it is not a great additional trouble to search forward to the present time add to this as a matter without dispute that the catholic creditor rebus integris may renounce either of his securities to the debtor and by the same reason therefore may he lend  scholium the same will obtatin where the catholic creditor purchases in the secondary creditors debt upon a or conveys his own debt to the secondary creditor it is true the personal creditors may here come to be disappointed but this is not inconsistent see schol prop i  proposition iv but where there is already a secondary creditor upon the tenement a if the catholic creditor choose to lend a second sum upon b in this case the proportional relief will obtain though directed against himself  because otherwise he would be in mala fide to lend to the common debtor since it tends to cut out the creditor upon a who had reason to trust to a proportional relief and were this otherwise no creditor who sees a catholic infeftment over two tenements would be in safety to lend his money upon either  proposition v supposing a catholic infeftment upon two tenements and a secondary upon each if the catholic creditor purchase in either of the secondary infeftments he is liable to the proportional relief the same will obtain if either of the secondary creditors purchase in the catholic infeftment  this is a consequence of prop iv  proposition vi the catholic creditor while there is no other encumbrance upon the two tenements may renounce his right upon either of them to the debtor himself or in favors of another creditor lending his money but after the existence of the secondary debt upon a he cannot renounce his right upon the tenement b if he does it can only be in so far as relates to himself  this is plain from prop  th and  th it will be proper here to obviate a scruple that arises with respect to this proposition let us put the argument in the mouth of a personal creditor who may urge it as a hard case the tenement b lying open for him to adjudge whereby he would have the benefit of a proportional allocation if the law should cut him out by suffering the catholic creditor to renounce in favors of the secondary creditor upon a the same says he indeed happens if the catholic creditor purchases in the secondary debt upon a or assigns his right to that secondary creditor but this must be allowed for the sake of commerce that creditors be not debarred from taking money for their claims in answer to this it is allowed that if the renunciation can be proven the result of a contrivance to disappoint the personal creditors i know not if this might not be understood as collusive and which must always be understood if the renunciation be after notour bankruptcy but otherwise renunciation may be as necessary for commerce as either of the other two cases for put the case the secondary creditor upon a refuses to trust his money any longer in the common debitors hands unless he get an additional security upon b or a renunciation from the catholic creditor if the last be chosen as more easily expedited it is obvious the personal creditors have nothing to complain of see what is further said schol prop   st  these four last propositions are plainly in principles but there may be some dispute in the execution for they suppose that before the catholic creditor can renounce the tenement a or lend upon it or purchase in a debt already contracted he must search the registers least there be a debt already contracted upon b if he lends or purchases in no question it is cum priculo as for renouncing he may do it safely but the creditor in whose favors the renunciation is made is by no means in safety to rely upon it without knowing what burdens are upon the other tenements subjected to the catholic infeftment another inconvenience is that there is no absolute certainty of coming to the knowledge what renunciations have been granted for if even the declaration of the catholic creditor should be thought a sufficient security though that is not always easy to be obtained yet frequently the debt stands in the person of a singular or universal successor to remedy these inconveniences it might be proper by an act of sederunt to appoint   mo secondary creditors when they contract to intimate their rights to the catholic creditor under this certification that otherwise the catholic creditor shall be at liberty to contract acquire or renounce as if such secondary debt were not existing   do to appoint renunciations to be registered which will give absolute security to contract upon tenements whereupon there is already a preferable catholic infeftment we will see from decisions to be mentioned hereafter how far this is understood to be necessary and how far already fixed  to conclude this head it often happens to be doubtful after what manner this proportional allocation of the preferable creditors right is to be extricated by reason of the peculiar nature thereof or of the rights of the secondary creditors to give an instance  let us suppose three adjudgers sciz a catholic adjudger of both tenements   do an adjudger coming in pari passu upon the tenement a   tio an adjudger without year and day upon the tenement b the difficulty in this case is that the catholic adjudger is not simply preferable to the other two adjudgers as in the ordinary cases but it may be reduced to the simplest case thus let the tenement a be supposed divided betwixt the two adjudgers in proportion to their respective debts this because they come in pari passu lay aside altogether that proportion of the tenement a which befalls the creditor who comes in pari passu with the catholic adjudger upon that tenement this pays his debt pro tanto and as for the remainder it comes in as a secondary debt upon that proportion of the tenement a which falls to the share of the catholic creditor the case then reduced to its simplest terms stands thus a catholic right over a certain proportion of the tenement a which we shall call d and also over the whole tenement b a secondary right over b sciz the adjudication without year and day a secondary right over d sciz the remainder of the other adjudgers claim over and above what his share of the tenement a comes to and when the question is reduced to these terms the rules for the proportional allocation are easily applicable  let each of the debts be   and each of the tenements worth   in the first place lay aside   as a praecipuum to the second adjudger upon a this being done we have a catholic creditor over the tenement d    and of the tenement b    out of these two tenements he ought to draw his sum proportionally that is   out of d and   out of b   being to   as   to   after which there remains   to the creditor upon b   to the creditor upon a so upon the whole the catholic adjudger draws his   the adjudger coming in pari passu with him upon the tenement a draws   and the other adjudger upon b only    let us vary this case a little and suppose all the three adjudges within year and day and let the numbers be the same save only that the adjudger upon b is only   here striking out the second and third adjudgers claims so far as they come in pari passu with the catholic adjudger there will remain two subjects   which remains of a   which remains of b over which the catholic adjudger is preferable and out which he is to draw his debt   proportionally which is      out of   and      out of   so that the catholic adjudger draws his whole   the adjudger upon a draws     the adjudger upon b       let us now suppose the legals to be expired and see what alteration that makes here the adjudications that before were rights in security limited to the payment of the debt secured become now rights of property thus then in the first of the two cases the catholic adjudger now no longer restricted to his claim of   in the division of the property with the other adjudgers claims the half of the tenement a and the whole tenement b and in the other case he draws the half of the tenement a and    of the tenement b  to give another instance where the application of this rule may seem to be attended with some difficulty the case is after an inhibition the debtor grants a personal bond to one and alienates a parcel of land to another the inhibiter attacks the purchaser is he bound to assign in totum the difficulty is that here there appears no place for a proportional allocation there not being two funds out of which the debt secured by inhibition may be drawn the answer is that the personal bond granted after inhibition must be considered as one fund at least so much of it as comes to be made effectual against the bankrupt estate by adjudication and the lands disponed as another and therefore that though the inhibiter may assign in totum yet the assigny cannot use it but proportionally against the personal creditor adjudging but if the assignation to the purchaser is supposed prior in date to the adjudication upon the personal bond there the assignation may be used in totum per corrol prop iv simular to this is diligence by horning against a bankrupt which is made use of to found a reduction upon the act      in this case the creditor reducing is bound to assign his debt and diligence but then the assigny cannot extend it against other alienations made prior to the assignation otherwise than proportionally but as to alienations made after he may extend it in totum  let us now touch some of the exceptions where this proportional relief is denied upon special circumstances  it will be remembered as laid down in the beginning of this essay that the proportional allocation and relief obtains when several persons or several subjects are bound equally to the same creditor the inequality of the obligation will in all cases disturb this rule as for example where one person or thing is bound principally an other only in subsidium  as to cases of this kind take the following rule  proposition vii when two persons or subjects are bound unequally the one principally the other in subsidium the proportional allocation cannot obtain but the subsidiary obligant is entitled to a total assignation against the principal and has a total relief  this naturally follows from the doctrine above laid down for if an equality of obligation infer a proportional assignation or relief an inequality of obligation must infer a disproportional assignation or relief and thus it is founded in the general principle that cautioners who have renounced the benefit of discussion have yet the benefit cedendarum actionum  and first of the strict cautionry obligement the intendment of which is that the cautioner shall pay if the principal be insolvent and which therefore infers the benefit of discussion here it is obvious that there is no proportional reliet betwixt the principal and cautioner after the principal debtor is discussed the creditor attacking the cautioner is bound to assign his debt and diligence that the cautioner may make the best of them abstracting from the principles above laid down this is otherwise plain from the following consideration that as the principal debtor is liable ultimately for the debt the diligence ought to be kept up in order to attack any future funds accruing to him and since the creditor is out of the question by the cautioners making payment the diligence ought to stand in the cautioners person the obligation to assign being thus founded in the nature of the cautionry contract it follows that the creditor may not withold it upon a pretext as if no man were bound to assign against himself for it is obvious the principal debtor is not sufficiently discust so long as the creditor retains to himself securities for his separate debt upon subjects belonging to the principal debtor it makes no objection what was found l   c fidejuss because at the time of this law fidejussores had not the beneficium ordinis aut discussionis being introduced afterward by justinian see nov   c    in this matter a question may arise relating indeed principally to the nature of an inhibition let us suppose a man lends money upon a personal bond and inhibits the debtor thereafter he lends another sum to him secured by infeftment last of all the debtor grants a bond of corroboration of the personal debt with a cautioner when the cautioner pays without controversy he has a right to the inhibition upon this the question arises whether the inhibition assigned to the cautioner does strike against the creditors heritable bond which resolves into a dispute anent the nature of an inhibition whether it be real that is directed to the debt and intended to guard it or only personal directed to the creditor that is in other words whether inhibition be a prohibition to the debtor to alienate in prejudice of the debt or in prejudice of the creditor i incline to the last upon which supposition the inhibition when assigned will not be available to the cautioner since it does not strike against alienations made to the creditor himself it is a different case if the cautionry obligement was prior to the contracting of the heritable debt of which hereafter  let us in the next place suppose a cautioner who has renounced the benefit of discussion by binding himself conjunctly and severally with the principal and here though the cautioner is directly yet not equally bound with the principal therefore by prop vii as he has a total relief he ought to have a total assignation but if once we establish the obligation upon the creditor to assign it will follow by prop v that he cannot thereafter contract with the principal debtor directly or indirectly to disappoint the cautioners relief but there appears nothing to oblige the creditor to assign against himself to defeat any right of his own that was prior to the accession of the cautioner for since in this case the cautioner has not the benefit of discussion he has nothing to found his claim of assignation upon but the general laws above laid down and therefore this case falls to be regulated by prop iv  possibly it may not be thought an useless piece of curiosity to see this made out from other principles in all cases it carries strong conviction when it is found that different principles coincide in the same conclusions the principle of law that leads me to this point is as follows that when different persons are bound to one another in mutual and reciprocal obligements to a certain end in every thing they do with relation to the contract they are bound to have in view the support and accomplishment thereof in other words the law considers persons so bound together as in a society with relation to their common affair and it is a rule in society that every member ought to act for the common behoof thus a purchaser of land buying in a collateral right cannot pursue a warrandice against the seller upon the footing of eviction but must restrict his claim to the money he paid for the collateral right which is supposing it to have been bought in with a view to the common interest thus a wadsetter buying in a preferable title to the estate is understood to do it for the joint behoof of himself and reverser and therefore cannot plead upon it against redemption of the lands the same will be found to obtain betwixt a creditor and a cautioner who has renounced the benefit of discussion for as to the proper cautioner his benefit of discussion as above set forth affords him more ample security than he has by this principle to come to particulars if the creditor adjudge inhibit or take any other additional security he is understood as carrying on a commune negotium for the behoof of himself and cautioners which infers that he ought to communicate such additional security to the cautioner performing his part by paying the debt in which view it must be considered when any additional security is granted to a creditor as it is a security for the debt itself of consequence it must be a common security to all who are concerned as cautioners to see the debt paid all this proceeds from what is commonly called the bona fides contractus and thus it is made out from the nature of the contract itself that the creditor is bound to assign his debt and diligence to the cautioner upon payment it is a natural consequence from this that if the creditor discharge any additional security it operates relief pro tanto to the cautioner which being fixed law with us is a confirmation of this doctrine for it obviously supposes that the cautioner has an antecedent right to demand assignation without which it would be nothing to the cautioner whether the creditor discharge the additional security or not from the same principle it follows that a creditor in a personal bond with cautioners using inhibition against the debtor and thereafter lending money to the debtor upon heritable security is bound notwithstanding to assign his inhibition to the cautioner upon payment though against himself because the inhibition is a common security for the debt both to principal and cautioner which security the cautioner cannot be defrauded of by any afterdeed of the creditors and if a creditor cannot discharge any additional security directly neither will he be allowed to do it indirectly by the circuit of lending money to the debtor it follows   do that if the creditor cannot safely lend to the debtor after the date of the additional security as little can he purchase in  but now let us suppose the heritable bond prior to the accession of the cautioner and let us also suppose it law that inhibition does strike against posterior alienations to the inhibiter himself in this case there is nothing in this principle at least why the creditor should be obliged to assign at all far less to assign against himself for though upon this principle the creditor is bound to assign to the cautioner who has renounced the benefit of discussion whatever additional securities were obtained after the date of the cautionry engagement the same will not hold with respect to anterior securities because these cannot be regulated by the laws of society being before the society existed  another exception we shall give is of three different sort of creditors upon the same subject   mo an annualrenter or annuitant   do a liferent infeftment of locality   tio an adjudger one would readily think of reducing this to the common case by considering the liferent infeftment as one subject the adjudication of the property as another and the annualrenter or annuitant as a preferable infeftment over both but when the nature of an annualrent or annuity is considered this will be found a wrong conception of the matter an annualrenter or annuitant ought first to draw his payment out of the fruits and it is but by a subsidiary right that he is entitled to claim the property itself this is obvious from the action of poinding the ground the style of which carries the poinder only to affect the property failing movables upon the ground in this view the rents stand as principal debtor the ground only as cautioner from this consideration the liferent infeftment by locality ought to be entirely burdened with the annuity or annualrent there is no place therefore for a proportional allocation and consequently no foundation for relief  but what if the annualrenter or annuitant suffer the localist to uplift the whole rents trusting to his subsidiary action against the property this plainly would be acting arbitrarily by giving a partial preference to the localist and therefore the adjudger in this case would be entitled not only to a proportional but to a total relief against the localist and further if these preferable creditors ly out and refuse to intromet i see no reason why the adjudger may not be entitled to uplift the rents in their name  nb here it is taken for granted that as a localist is a liferent proprietor she can have on poinding of the ground for any inlacks of the rents more than an absolute proprietor can and so these inlacks are not a real burden upon the ground as the inlacks of an aunuity are all the remedy she has is to adjudge the fie upon her warrandice which will bring her in pari passu with other adjudgers upon personal rights let us now suppose that she has adjudged upon her warrandice but this will make no difference it will not bring on a proportional allocation the annuity or annualrent continues still a burden upon the locality and all the alteration is that the localist upon her warrandice comes in among the other adjudgers    do what if the annuitant or annualrenter actually assign to the localist if this was done subsequent to the date of the adjudication it will avail nothing see proposition v unless perhaps it be allowed the force of an adjudication to bring in the localist pari passu as if she had adjudged upon her warrandice there is even a scruple if this assignation should be sustained though of a date prior to the adjudication because it tends to cut out the personal creditors who rest secure to adjudge quandocunque as long as no other adjudication stands in their way but this scruple is already obviated schol   prop i    tio if the annuity and locality be vested in the same person before the existence of any other right upon the estate the possession my be attributed to either to save both this is clear from prop iv and though the matter should be reckoned doubtful as to a renunciation which can never be a necessary deed when granted to a localist who has not power like a creditor to uplift there can be no dubiety when the localist purchases the annuity and e contra because there is no reason such commerce should be discountenanced  this is all to be understood of an annuity and locality concurring for the same years but if there be prior annuities due before the commencement of the liferent right these cannot be said to be a natural burden upon every years fruits falling due to the liferenter as the yearly annuities are and therefore the creditors cannot force the annuitant to draw them out of the rents as little can they be reckoned a proper burden upon the fie considered exclusive of the liferent but they ought rather to be considered as a catholic burden and the liferent and fie as two separate estates subject to them and therefore to be drawn proportionally out of each i e upon a sale they are to be paid out of the first end of the price the remainder thereof to go to the localist in liferent and the adjudgers in fie  another exception is as follows let us suppose the locality the preferable right   do the infeftment of annualrent or annuity   tio the adjudger at the same time let us suppose that the liferenter consents to the posterior annualrentright by virtue of this consent the annualrenter will be preferable has the localist in this case a total or only a proportional relief against the adjudger the answer is she has a total relief because the consent here is private betwixt the annualrenter and localist and can operate nothing in favors of the adjudger besides there is implied in the consent an obligation upon the annualrenter to keep the localist indemnis so far as consistent with his own interest therefore what the annualrenter uplifts in this case is understood as in name of the localist and he takes the rent not as in payment of his own claim but as money received from the localist for the purchase of his right which therefore he is obliged to assign so far as he receives thus the paction is not extended to be a direct preference to the annualrenter but interpreted to be only an obligation upon the localist to communicate her rents to him or which is the same to allow him to uplift in her name and so it was found home    february      competition lady ludquhairn with her husbands creditors but what if such consent were absolutely conceived would not this bring it to the former case as if the annualrenter were simply preferable  to complete this essay it will be proper to look into the decisions of our court of session and to examine how far they have followed or varied from the principles here laid down they are as follow  an annualrent being payable out of two tenements which came afterward into the hands of different singular successors it was found that the annualrenter might uplift the whole out of any one of the tenements assigning against the other for relief stair   th june      adamson contra lord balmerino this is an example of the first proposition  a cautioner upon payment craving assignation against his cocautioner the lords found the creditor not obliged to assign the cautioner being sufficiently secured in law by his action for relief newbyth stair  0th july      home contra crawfurd in this case though hard to deny assignation yet the dispute perhaps was of little importance since the relief that was competent might be as effectual  in a competition an adjudger subjected to an inhibition offering to purge by payment of the debt the creditor was found obliged to assign his inhibition but not in so far as it might be prejudicial to other debts in his person stair   th july      chiesly contra hay the like stair   th february      bruce contra mitchel these decisions are defective in so far as they do not mention whether the inhibiters secondary debt was of a date prior or posterior to the adjudication if prior the decisions are founded in prop iii if posterior the relief ought to be proportional per prop iv  a creditor being preferable over two tenements and a secondary creditor having a right only over one of them in that situation the preferable creditor for a separate debt adjudgd both tenements it was found that the catholic creditor was not obliged to dispone to the secondary creditor in prejudice of his adjudication existing before the date of the process stair  th nov      miln contra hay by this decision and some others to be mentioned hereafter it seems to be established that the catholic creditor is in safety to lend upon the tenement b before he be interpelled by process at the instance of the secondary creditor upon a it will undoubtedly be allowed that if he is interpelled by intimation as is above proposed the effect would be the same by these decisions then we may reckon it as established that intimation is necessary to interpel the catholic creditor without which he may safely lend upon the tenement b though in prejudice of the secondary creditor upon a and this in some measure supersedes the necessity of making an act of sederunt to that effect  it may further be remarked upon this decision that if the bond upon which adjudication past was prior in date to the notification of the secondary creditors infeftment upon that supposition the catholic creditor was not at all bound to assign argum prop iii because though he might be in mala fide to lend upon b after he knew of another debt upon a yet not to adjudge upon a prior debt that being necessitatis not voluntatis  similar is the case observed by fountainhall   d january      scotland contra bairdner where in a competition betwixt a liferentrix who only had her liferent upliftable out of the half of the subject and a creditor whose infeftment affected the whole and was prior to that of the liferentrix and who had also an adjudication but posterior to the liferent right she craving that he might be decerned to assign her as to one half in regard the other was sufficient to pay him his annualrent the lords thought that if he acquired any such adjudication less preferable post litem motam he might be reputed in mala fide to make use of such right to impede his assigning to the liferentrix but if he had got it before then there was no law hindering him to do the same and to cover it by his better right and so the lords refused to decern him to assign the liferentrix against the other half in prejudice of his adjudication here again the necessity of intimation is enforced  an assignation to some goods by a bankrupt to his creditor in security and payment being reduced upon the act      by another creditor and the reducer at the same time arresting in the assigneys hands and pursuing a forthcoming the assigney was contented to make the goods forthcoming but craved assignation from the pursuer to his cumulative security by adjudication in so far as he should pay that so he might operate his relief out of the common debitors effects pro tanto the lords found this relevant and ordained the pursuer to assign but with this express quality that the pursuer should be preferred quoad his debt and the assigney should not compete with him for the same fountainhall forbes    december   0  reid contra man this decision is certainly well founded there can be no pretense for obliging a catholic creditor who gets payment only of a part of his catholic debt to assign in proportion to that payment which may tend in some measure to restrict his claim for the remainder it is fair in such a case if he assign at any rate  a creditor by bond wherein three persons were bound as coprincipals being the first arrester of a subject belonging to one of his debitors was not found obliged to assign his bond to the other arresters for recovering of the other two coprincipals the superplus paid to him out of the common debitors effects more than his third share although relief of two thirds was competent to the common debtor himself against these coprincipals for this reason that the creditors postponed might affect the said relief by diligences forbes    february   0  kennedy contra vans and crawford this decision is one of very few that are not easy to be adjusted to principles running contrary to the primary law of a proportional allocation it appears obvious that the ratio decidendi which may possibly be the observers is by no means conclusive for if assignation is never to be granted where the creditor craving assignation has otherwise action competent against the person or subject it will follow that assignations should never be granted in any case at that rate in the known case of a catholic right over two tenements belonging to the same common debtor and a secondary right over one of them the secondary creditor could not seek assignation against the other tenement because he might affect it by diligence and it is remarkable that the decisions as handed down to us run so cross to one another that sometimes it has been sustained as a good reason for denying assignation that the subject designed to be affected in virtue of the assignation did not belong to the common debtor and consequently was not otherwise to be come at but through aid of the assignation see below forbes    june      ker contra creditors of harden but now what if another creditor of the common debitors has ab ante affected this relief the answer is that it will signify nothing for let us make a supposition which is exceeding rational that the catholic creditor had drawn his payment equally from the three coobligants upon that supposition as there would be no foundation for relief the creditor who had affected it could draw nothing it can make no difference that the catholic creditor chooses to draw his whole from one the very design of an assignation is to remedy this inequality and to put all things upon the same footing as if he had drawn equally and proportionally which every catholic creditor is supposed to do when the question is anent relief competent to secondary creditors among themselves  a party having two infeftments of annualrent one prior and another posterior to the infeftment of another creditor whose infeftment was only of a part of the lands he who had the first and third being infeft in the whole and taking up his annualrent out of that part only wherein the other stood infeft whereby that other was disappointed and therefore craved in a process to be assigned to a proportion etc the lords found that where a posterior creditor pays a prior out of his own money he has a title to demand assignation but if he leaves him to get his payment out of the debitors means the catholic creditor is not obliged to assign but with a quality and reservation that it shall not prejudice his other debts and rights though posterior to the partys right who craves the assignation fountainhall forbes    december    0 pitcairn contra halliday this is directly opposite to proposition iv unless it be said that there is here no appearance that the catholic creditor was acquainted with the interjected creditors debt if this be understood as the ratio decidendi it tends to fortify the doctrine above laid down anent the the necessity of intimation  brigadier preston purchaser of the estate of valleyfield at a public roup offered to the lords a scheme for drawing the price wherein it appeared that he had right to some debts preferable over the whole estate and to others preferable over particular parcels and pretending to exhaust the remanent price of the separate parcels affected by his catholic debts in order to bring in the other debts purchased in by him preferable as said is upon particular parcels this was opposed by colonel erskine who alleged that the catholic debts preferable upon the whole estate ought to be taken out of the whole head of the price whereby the price of every particular parcel of the estate would be diminished proportionally and he the colonel of consequence would draw some share of the remanent price whereas by the brigadiers scheme he was entirely excluded the lords found the brigadier might exhaust the price of any part of the estate by his sovereign rights affecting the whole and that he might make the best use he could of his rights providing the same were not acquired or made use of in emulationem of the colonel bruce    february      brigadier preston contra colonel erskine here the fact is not distinctly laid down whether the purchases made by the brigadier of his secondary rights were prior or posterior to the existence of those belonging to the colonel if prior the decision is agreeable to the corrollary of prop iii otherwise if posterior unless it be put upon the footing that colonel erskine gave no intimation to the brigadier of the existence of his rights and the provision at the close of the interlocutor shows plain enough the opinion of the court as to this matter for after such intimation any secondary rights purchased in by the brigadier who was catholic creditor must undoubtedly be deemed to be acquired and made use of in emulationem of the colonel  a creditor ranked in the second place did after the ranking purchase in the preferable debt and having these two rights in his person he became purchaser of the estate at a public sale and gave bond for the price payable to his creditors as they were ranked the preferable debt purchased in by him as said is did not only reach over the lands purchased by him at the public roup but also over a separate subject belonging to another the fact was that the price of the lands sold publicly was but sufficient to answer the preferable right and therefore the purchaser willing to bring his secondary claim within the price craved payment of his preferable right entirely out of the separate subject which the lords refused and found that the said debt being in the person of the purchaser of the lands upon which it was ranked primo loco which purchaser granted bond for payment of the price to the creditors as ranked the said debt became eo ipso extinguished confusione and could not revive to be a charge upon the separate subject   th june      competition betwixt mr henry ramsay and the bank of scotland in this case it is clearly laid down that after intimation by process of a secondary right the proportional relief will obtain though the preferable and any other secondary right should come into the same person when the matter is brought here it will follow that any legal intimation is sufficient for it would be ridiculous to impose the necessity of raising a process when there is nothing else in view but to intimate a fact to the defender thus then we may hold it as an established point in our practice that the catholickcreditor may renounce his right upon the tenement a lend a second debt upon that tenement or purchase in a debt upon it at any time without being obliged to search the registers until actual intimation be made to him of a secondary right upon the tenement b  robert scot served heir in general and confirmed executor qua nearest of kin to sir william scot of harden conveyed all subjects heritable and moveable that he had right to by these titles to ker of chatto some of sir williams real creditors infeft in his land estate having also affected by diligence their debitors other effects conveyed as said is to ker of chatto were in a competition preferred to the disponee ker thus excluded by the preferable creditors demanded assignation to their debts and diligence in order to affect the real estate it was answered for the creditors that no person is entitled to demand assignation unless against his own debitors effects the lords found that in so far as sir william scots creditors are either paid out of his estate or out of his other effects they are not bound to assign their debts and diligences in favors of chatto forbes    june      scot contra ker that this decision is reconcilable with the principles above laid down i see not unless we take a separate circumstance into consideration though not at all laid hold upon by the collector sir william scot had tailied his land estate with strict prohibitory and irritant clauses now though this could not save the estate from his own debts yet it may infer a very natural presumption that sir william intended his separate funds should go in the first place for payment of his debts if this be well founded the decision is extremely justifiable for the separate funds to which robert scot succeeded upon his confirmation and general service have been considered as the principal debtor and the tailied estate as cautioner only and therefore in this view it had been wrong done by the creditors to assign against the tailied estate had they been ever so willing  in the year      mguffoc of rusco heritor of the lands of borgue granted an heritable bond for the sum of  000 lib out of the said lands in favors of irving of logan whereupon the creditor was infeft the same year thereafter the said rusco granted a disposition of the lands of borgue in favors of his second son david blair reserving a faculty to alter but which faculty he afterward renounced in his sons contract of marriage mguffoc of rusco being overcharged with debt in the      his estate was brought to a sale and the said irving of logan who had adjudged all his debitors lands for the above mentioned debt of  000 lib was ranked as a preferable creditor and upon his drawing payment it was demanded by the other creditors that he should assign them to his infeftment upon the lands of borgue according to the general rule in these cases that who has a preferable infeftment in two different subjects for the same debt if he choose to draw his whole claim out of one is obliged to assign to the creditors postponed to afford them a proportional relief out of the other subject this was opposed by the relict and children of borgue upon this medium that by ruscos disposition to his second son and afterconsent in that sons contract of marriage he became bound to warrant the said lands the consequence whereof is that had irving of logan drawn his whole sum out of their lands they must have been entitled to demand assignation against rusco bound to them in warrandice just as much as a creditor who takes payment from a cautioner is obliged to assign him against the principal debtor answered rusco was never bound to warrant his son david and his heirs against logans debt the disposition was under a reserved faculty to contract debt alter and dispose of the estate etc and consequently the debt already contracted could be no contravention of the warrandice and supposing the son had paid the debt he could never have distressed his father for the same and consequently an assignation would have been fruitless and ineffectual nor does the fathers afterconsent in his sons contract of marriage which implied a renunciation of his faculty any way alter the case for by no interpretation can this be drawn to import an obligation upon the father to warrant or relieve his son of the foresaid debt the lords refused the assignation january      competition betwixt the creditors of rusco and the relict and children of blair of borgue this decision runs directly counter to the principle of a proportional allocation there may occur some difficulty in adjusting the real relief in this case which will be solved by comparing this case with that abovementioned of a catholic adjudger of two tenements another adjudger within year and day upon the tenement a a third without year and day upon the tenement b here the lands of borgue stand for the tenement b and david blair proprietor thereof for the adjudger without year and day  mrs dalgleish creditor to earl of roseberry arrested the rents of his estate in the tenants hands as also a personal bond of his in the hands of mr john alves the debtor thereafter the same rents were arrested by blair another creditor who by decree of furthcoming was preferred secundo loco on that subject last of all the common debtor granted assignation of mr john alvess bond for onerous causes to archibald robertson merchant in edinburgh this assignation obliged the debtor in the bond to raise a multiplypoinding wherein the arrester was preferred to the assigney this gave occasion to robertson the assigney whose subject was thus carried away by the arrester to demand an assignation to the arresters debt and diligence in order to operate his relief out of the other subject affected thereby sciz the rents of the estate in the tenants hands against that demand blair the second arrester of that subject appeared for his interest it was pled for him that the common debtor could not put the arrester in a worse situation by granting assignation to robertson and therefore that he is entitled to a total assignation as if the assignation had not been granted it was answered that the common debtor remained fiar of the bond just as much after blairs arrestment as before the arrestment not affecting the bond and therefore his assignation to robertson was valid and effectual in law and did infer an obligation upon the catholickcreditor choosing to draw his payment out of a fund that now no longer belonged to his debtor to assign for a total relief which obligation was inferred from the principles of remuneration to this it was replied by the second arrester that the bond being affected by the preferable arrestment was made litigious and therefore was still to be considered as remaining in the person of the common debtor the lords found that mistress dalgleish was not obliged to assign to the assigney robertson in prejudice of blairs arrestment   th june    0 competition betwixt robertson and blair this is directly opposite to prop ii but it is to be observed that here robertson was insisting for a total assignation possibly had he restricted his claim to a proportional assignation he would have had a more favorable hearing  george gordon lent  000 merks upon bond conjunctly and severally to kincaid and suttie kincaid got the money and gave suttie a bond of relief upon this bond after the term of payment diligence was done by horning and inhibition thereafter kincaid suttie and johnston conjunctly and severally granted bond of corroboration containing a clause obliging the other two to relieve johnston as their cautioner johnston after this and after existence of the inhibition lent kincaid the common debtor  00 lib sterling by an heritable bond last of all the said johnston paid the debt wherein he was cautioner and took from george gordon the creditor assignation to the debt and diligence and insisted against suttie for relief in this process the question occurred whether johnston was bound to assign the inhibition to suttie upon payment johnston pled that the inhibition strikeing against his heritable bond the law did not oblige him to assign against himself suttie contended that this rule holds not betwixt cautioners who seeking relief off one another are bound in strict law from the nature of the contract to assign the lords found no necessity upon johnston to assign the inhibition   th november    0 johnston contra suttie to examine this case by the laws above laid down we shall in the first place take up the question as if george gordon the creditor in the bond with inhibition had also been the lender of the posterior heritable bond and as johnston were not in the field in this case according to the plainest principles suttie paying the debt would be entitled to demand assignation to the inhibition though exclusive of the heritable bond see page  0 it is another question how far the inhibition would in this case be serviceable when assigned but this comes not in in a case like the present where the heritable bond was granted to another than the inhibiter continuing still the supposition that gordon was creditor in both bonds let us draw a little nearer to the present case by taking in the consideration of the bond of corroboration wherein johnston acceded as cautioner here johnston paying the debt would have right to demand assignation to the inhibition and when he is seeking relief off suttie it is as evident he must transfer the debt and diligence to him in order to operate his relief against the principal debtor for if he acts as creditor the thing is apparent if as cautioner upon the clause in the bond of corroboration it will come to the same for if a creditor be bound to assign upon payment multo magis a cocautioner who has a bond of relief to come close to the case in hand if gordon was bound to assign to suttie even against himself though he had been lender of the heritable bond he cannot put him in a worse situation by choosing to take his debt from johnston and johnston who comes in gordons place by the assignation cannot be in a better situation than gordon himself would be had he been the lender of the heritable bond to take this matter in the nearest view gordons inhibition became an additional security for the debt for the benefit of himself and all the cautioners therefore whichever cautioner was burdened with the debt had a right to the inhibition in order to operate his relief against the principal debtor and thereupon was entitled to reduce every deed posterior to the inhibition in whoseever favors granted  vinco vincentem in the essay upon the beneficium cedendendarum actionum we have endeavored to lay down after what manner creditors catholic and secondary are to draw their payment from the several persons and out of the several subjects burdened with their debts the design of this essay is to lay down some rules for extricating the preferences of creditors and disponees competing upon the same subject in the first essay the question is having given the order of preference to determine the method of drawing payment out of the different funds and from the different persons liable in the debts in this the question is having given the fund to determine the absolute and partial preferences and what each competitor shall draw  for methods sake we shall first take under consideration the competition of creditors among themselves these stand limited and restricted according to the extent of their claims after discussing which the competition among disponees etc fall in whose claims upon the subject contraverted are from their nature unlimited and totally exclusive of others  in the preferences that arise simply from priority of time there can arise no dubiety among competing creditors potior tempore potior jure is a rule upon which preferences may be as easily determined as it is to determine that this year this hour this day is posterior to the last the difficulties that arise proceed from partial grounds of preference that one creditor obtains against another whereby it happens that he who is posterior in time shall sometimes exclude and be preferred to one or another that is prior to give an example suppose three annualrenters a b c all in order of time suppose at the same time a consenting to cs preference in this case a is preferable to b b to c and c again to a a to b and b to c by priority of time and c to a by the consent in cases of this nature if the debts exceed the fund it will be found no easy matter to adjust what every creditor should draw  before we come to the point it will be necessary to consider the force and effect of the consent that the last creditor has obtained from the first this consent must be considered in one of two views   mo as giving the right consented to all the benefit of the consenters diligence that is interpreting the consent as a virtual assignation or   do as giving it only a preference so as to entitle the creditor consented to to draw as if the consenter were not in the field this last is the true meaning of the consent and all the force that the law allows it and which indeed is the only view in which the matter can be attended with any difficulty for if the consent be understood as a virtual assignation there can be no collision betwixt the first and last creditor the rule prior tempore potior jure will be sufficient to extricate the whole  taking then the consent as a preference not a virtual assignation the method that naturally casts up to adjust these preferences appears to be this let the creditors be ranked upon the subject according to their real preferences a in the first place b in the second c in the last these are the places that naturally belong to them in virtue of their diligences this step being taken it falls next to be considered what partial grounds of preference any creditor has against another in this case the only partial ground is the consent whereby c is entitled to draw as if a were not in the field to adjust this preference let us suppose the fund   and each of the debts   in adjusting the real ranking a draws   b   c nothing b keeps his   this he is entitled to by the real ranking not being concerned with the partial preference that occurs only when the question is betwixt the other two creditors let us next consider the effect of this partial preference which intitles c to draw as if a were not in the field when this calculation is made c will be found entitled to draw only   so that upon the whole b draws   c   and a    this appears to be the natural method for adjusting preferences among creditors who have personal challenges or partial grounds of preference against one another to clear the matter still further it will be proper to obviate what objections may arise according to this method it is obvious that a the consenter is in a better situation than if b were not in the field this may appear strange it may be thought when c is claiming the benefit of as consent that he ought to draw the whole   seeing it is jus tertii for a to plead upon the right of b which he does when c is restricted to draw only   as this indeed seems to have the air of an objection a solid answer may tend strongly to enforce this scheme to obtain perfect satisfaction we need but look into the circumstances of the parties and nature of the transaction c about to lend his money sees two real creditors upon the subject he is unwilling to lend upon that security unless he obtain as consent to his preference he sees at the same time b preferable but that he takes his hazard of he is willing to lend under that disadvantage all therefore he can pretend to draw even after as consent is what remains of the fund unpreoccupied by b this is all the real security he has to depend upon and all he ought to draw in the division of the fund or price thereof when therefore in the question betwixt c and a upon the consent bs right is brought under consideration it must not be taken in this light as if a were founding any preference upon it it is pled upon only to determine how far the consent should operate the law says that such a consent is not a virtual assignation it means no more but to allow the creditor consented to to draw as if the consenter were not in the field to make this calculation it is plain that bs interest must be taken into consideration and therefore according to the example above laid down when c draws   all the fund that remains unpreoccupied by b he draws the whole that was intended him by the consent this argument is drawn from the meaning of the consent and it is solid however it will be necessary to give another answer sufficient to reach all the cases of partial preferences as well as that by consent and this will arise from considering the nature of the objection jus tertii in the essay upon that subject it is laid down position vi that one is ever allowed to found upon the right of a third party when the conclusion tends to restrict or annul the right of his antagonist thus substituting an inhibition in place of the consent when the third creditor inhibiter comes to claim his preference he draws just   as the right consented to did because all that the inhibition or consent can operate is to strike out a and when that is done all that remains to them unpreoccupied by b is   and though b himself draws but   in competition with a yet a can found upon bs right to restrict c to   since it is not claiming a preference upon bs right but using it as an argument to restrict cs right and truly the argument is conclusive were c allowed to cut out a of his whole claim without suffering any restriction upon account of bs claim it would follow that an inhibition which is only understood a ground of preference must really and substantially be a virtual assignation so as to put the inhibiter in the inhibited persons place and to entitle him to draw not only in his own right but in right of the person inhibited which is directly contrary to the nature of an inhibition  it may possibly be urged further upon this point why should it not be reckoned jus tertii for a to found upon bs right in order to restrict c as well as it is for c to found upon as right in order to restrict b now it c could found upon as right in order to restrict b the scheme would come out thus by means of the restriction b drawing but two there would remain four unpreoccupied to be drawn by c in answer to this let it be considered that the jus tertii cannot lie both ways if it be jus tertii for c to build upon as right in order to restrict b it cannot be jus tertii for a to found upon bs right in order to restrict c these being directly contradictory positions the one terminating in a virtual conveyance the other only in a preference which is the true conception of the matter but more directly the difference comes precisely here a as above laid down may found upon bs interest to cut down c why because the necessary consequence is to prefer himself or which is the same to relieve himself of a burden but to what purpose is it that c would found upon as interest it is true a is preferable to b but no conclusion can be drawn from that to cs advantage it neither tends to profit c or to relieve him of any burden thus in competition with a b can only draw two but it will not follow that four remains for c because is perfectly consistent that b draw four in competition with c though he draw only two in competition with a  i have chosen the partial preference that arises from consent as the plainest and simplest case to illustrate and clear this subject but what is laid down here will apply to all the other grounds of partial preference inhibitions pari passu adjudications etc all of which operate a preference not a virtual assignation  the rule then comes out thus first to rank all the creditors according to the priority of their diligences without respecting the partial grounds of preference any one may have against another by this first operation will be ascertained the claims of these creditors who stand free of challenge in the next place to adjust what will fall to any creditor in virtue of partial grounds of preference the operation must go thus strike out the creditor against whom the partial ground of preference is directed what remains of the fund unpreoccupied by the other creditors not struck at belongs to the creditor obtainer of the partial preference  it need hardly be qualified here that for what is drawn from the first creditor a by virtue of the consent or inhibition he cannot recur against b that would carry this absurdity to make the inhibition or consent virtually operate against b though intended only against a bs annualrent second in the order of time entitles him to take up the second place this is his situation let a and c adjust their preferences in the best shape they can if c thurst out a that entitles not a to thurst out b he must be satisfied to take up cs place but it is proper to be observed that it will make no difference as to this scheme whether the partial ground of challenge be considered as operating a direct preference or only a personal claim or ground of reduction for taking the matter in either shape the creditor who has the ground of challenge must still be entitled to draw as if the debt against which the challenge lies were not in the field this observation supersedes entirely the necessity as to this point of disputing whether an inhibition give a direct preference or be only a ground of reduction which possibly may be a question not easily determined from the nature of that diligence  let us illustrate this doctrine by another example the first we shall give is out of the roman law the species facti is this a person borrows money and for security gives a hypotheck which the creditor neglects to registrate thereafter the debtor becomes a tutor whereby by the roman law his whole goods become hypothecated to the pupil last of all he borrows another sum and gives another conventional hypotheck which the creditor registrates what gives occasion to the difficulty here is a constitution whereby conventional hypothecks registered are preferred to these not registered whence the unregistred hypotheck is preferred to the legal and the legal to the registered by priorty of time for a legal hypotheck need not be registered the registered hypotheck again is preferred to the unregistred let us as before suppose each of the debts    the fund    to extricate this let us first adjust the real ranking by this ranking the legal hypotheck draws   not being concerned with the ground of challenge that the one conventional hypotheck has against the other all that the registered hypotheck can draw supposing the unregistred out of the field is barely   the other remaining   is left to the unregistred hypotheck this scheme of ranking falls in precisely with the one abovementioned and so it ought because the registring of cs hypotheck has the same effect with his inhibition against a or as consent to his preference  thus the matter comes out where the partial grounds of challenge operate a total preference the cases fall next to be considered where these partial grounds operate only a pari passu preference or such like which is the case of adjudications within year and day as for example we shall suppose a to be an adjudger infeft b an annualrenter c a second adjudger pari passu with the first in this case it is plain all the second adjudger has to depend upon is what remains of the fund after satisfying the annualrenter and that remainder too he must lay his account to share with all prior adjudgers and posterior within year and day he can be in no better situation than if a the first adjudger were posterior to the annualrenter or even were the last adjudger but within year and day whence it follows that c the second adjudger in this case can draw but half of the free fund that remains unpreoccupied by b the annualrenter this case is also reducible to the former by taking it in this light a the first adjudger is preferable to b the annualrenter and b the annualrenter to c the second adjudger by priority of diligence c the second adjudger is preferable to a the first adjudger by the act      not totally indeed but for the one half and accordingly he draws that half as if a the first ajudger were not in the field to illustrate this by an example let us as formerly suppose the fund    each of the debts    then a draws   in competition with b to b there remains   which he retains in all events to c again there remains but   unprooccupied by b which at the same time he must communicate with a upon account of the pari passu preference so upon the whole a draws   b   c    in this view of the matter it is taken for granted that the act of parliament bringing in ajudgers pari passu does not give the second adjudger all advantages as if his diligence were truly of the same date with the first adjudgers such favor was surely not designed all intended by the act to cut off that preference which first adjudgers naturally have by priority of diligence so that it levels the first adjudgers preference in competition with a second but gives no privilege to a second adjudger in competition with third parties  having laid down the rule and method for determining the preferences among compeating creditors it will be proper in the next place to add some other examples to these above set forth  a an annualrenter consenting to cs preference b an adjudger inhibiting before the contraction of cs debt c an adjudger pari passu subject to bs inhibition and preferable to a by the consent let us continue to suppose the fund    each of the debts     in adjusting the real preferences which fall first under consideration a draws   and the two adjudgers pari passu each of them draws   next as to the partial grounds of preference b the adjudger inhibiter cutting out c by virtue of his inhibition must draw as he were not in the field and so takes   which is his ultimate draught c again must draw as a were not in the field which entitles him to no more but   being cut out of the other   by the inhibiting adjudger these   c draws from a and consequently upon the ultimate division a draws   b   and c    let us again suppose each of the debts    the fund continuing    in this case a will draw   b   and c    let now each of the debts be    the fund continuing    in this case a will draw the whole  another example may be drawn from l    qui potior in pign a debtor hypothecates his fund first to a next to b in the last place to c in a competition betwixt a and c c is unjustly preferred but against this unjust sentence there is no appeal entered c is also preferred to b but upon an appeal b obtains redress in this case it is demanded how the preferences are to be adjusted a is preferable to b and b to c by priority of time c again to a by the sentence not appealed against this case comes to be the same with that of three annualrenters abovementioned whereof the last has an inhibition against the first  another example may be given which deserves well to be considered   mo an assignation intimate   do an arrestment interveening betwixt the assignation and intimation   tio an adjudication whereof the citation was prior to the arrestment but posterior to the date of the assignation the subject is the rent of lands and the parties all called together in a multiplepoinding here the arrestment is preferable to the assignation stair t assignation    the assignation is preferable to the adjudication by priority of diligence durie   d march      smith contra hepburn and the adjudication again to the arrestment upon the same account forbes    june   0  steuart contra steuart how is this matter to be extricated here is a plain direct circle of absolute real preferences founded all upon the same medium which appears to be a plain direct inconsistence for it comes to the same as if a should be made preferable to b upon any one medium and b again preferable to a upon the same medium in all the circles that have hitherto cast up different media of preference are brought in to make the circle thus it may readily be that a is preferable to b b to c upon one medium and c again to a upon another medium or more shortly that a is preferable to b upon one medium and b to a upon another as for example in two infeftments of annualrent whereof the last has an inhibition that strikes against the first a is preferable to b by priority of time and b again to a by his inhibition but it is inconsistent that two diligences can be mutually preferable upon the same medium which would iner this absurdity that from the same medium two opposite or inconsistent conclusions might be drawn in this case the same medium of preference regulates the whole competition sciz the priority of attachment or nexus realis upon the subject were this medium carried steadily through in comparing these diligences with one another it is impossible there could be any difficulty the matter becomes inextricable by this alone that in the competition betwixt the assigney and arrester the arrestment is supposed to make a nexus realis upon the subject whereas in competition with the adjudger the arrestment is supposed only to be a personal prohibition to the debtor and consequently no nexus realis no wonder then that two inconsistent suppositions in the same competition should bring on an inextricable circle to evade this if it be alleged that an arrestment is preferable interveening betwixt the assignation and intimation upon a presumption of collusion betwixt the debtor and assigney antedating the assignation in order to disappoint the arrester the answer is ready   mo there is no ground in law to infer such a collusion with respect to a formal right solemnly executed before witnesses granted for an onerous cause   do any such presumption of collusion must necessarily operate in favors of the adjudger as well as of the arrester which yet was never pretended the matter therefore must necessarily come out in this shape either that arrestment makes a nexus realis upon which supposition it must be preferable in the present case both to assigney and adjudger or that it makes only a personal prohibition upon which supposition both assigney and adjudger must be preferable to it that the last supposition is the truth of the matter will appear   mo from the nature and style of the diligence   do from this indisputable position that arrestment stops not a posterior poinding   tio from what is above laid down that a posterior adjudication is preferable to an arrestment  sect ii of the competition among disponees etc the rules above laid down will apply equally to the case of disponees as to that of creditors there is no other variety in the cases but that of limited and unlimited and even creditors come frequently to have unlimited claims which happen so often as the debt is equal to or exceeds the value of the subject in which circumstances they come to be precisely upon the same footing with disponees in competition among disponees etc real preferences and personal grounds of challenge cast up the same way as among creditors and the rule must equally obtain in both that the personal ground of challenge is frequently cut down for want of an interest to plead it so that jus tertii does equally regulate both cases  to show this connection by an example let us suppose three annualrenters of which the last has an inhibition against the first let the fund be    and each of debts    upon this supposition the creditors will draw   a piece but again let each of the debts be    and upon this supposition the first annualrenter will draw the whole notwithstanding that the last annualrenter is preferable to him by virtue of his inhibition which in this case it is jus tertii for the last annualrenter to insist upon the fund as to him being entirely preocupied by the second annualrenter so that though the third annualrenter should prevail in his personal challenge against the first it would avail him nothing  instead of annualrenters let us now substitute disponees and it is obvious the resolution must be the same the last disposition though supported by an inhibition that strikes against the first cannot prevail the jus tertii lies against him in respect he can have no benefit by the challenge the fund being already preoccupied by the second disposition  it is then the jus tertii that equally regulates both cases which allows the personal challenge to go no further than the challenger can show a benefit thereby it will readily occur that among disponees this bar of jus tertii generally excludes the personal challenge totally the fund being supposed already preoccupied by some third right against which the challenge lies not among creditors it is generally otherwise for the third right against which the challenge lies not being limited and for the most part not absorbing the whole fund this of consequence allows the personal challenge a partial effect as may be seen in all the examples above given among creditors unless where the debt of the interjected creditor has been equal to the value of the fund and this is the only variety that does occur in application of the above rules to the case of compeating disponees  let us now proceed to give other examples upon this head  example i let us suppose   mo a deathbed deed completed but reducible by the heir   do a second deathbed deed of the same subject consented to by the heir  the first deed cuts out the second the second cuts out the heir and the heir again cuts out the first  to clear this case it must be premised as a thing taken for granted that the heirs consent here operates not a conveyance of his privilege but barely a renunciation thereof with respect to the right consented to if it did operate a conveyance there could be no difficulty in the question because upon that supposition the reduction would be competent to the second disponee as well as to the heir himself taking the consent then as operating only a renunciation the decision must come out in favors of the first disponee he stands first in the order of time and as for the personal challenge competent to the heir against him the challenge is barred by the jus tertii the interveening disposition consented to rendering it fruitless to the heir to insist upon his privilege and thus it happens that a consent or other deed designed in favors of one may yet accrue solely to the benefit of another  example ii   mo a base infeftment of ward lands   do a public infeftment of the same confirmed by the superior which excludes recognition   tio the superior upon his privilege of recognition  this case is plainly of the same nature with the former it is jus tertii for the superior to plead upon his recognition because he can have no benefit thereby unless this consideration be brought in to difference the cases drawn from the nature of holdings viz that a superior has an interest to choose his own vassal which may be alleged as sufficient to found him in his challenge against the base infeftment although he have no further inrerest in the question but that he be vassal whom he has chosen and whose right he has consented to this dispute i shall leave in medio as a little foreign to the subject in hand  it must here be taken along that recognition is understood only as a personal privilege competent to the superior were it in ipso jure nullity the decision at any rate would go otherwise upon that supposition the second disponee publicly infeft might found upon it per pos vi jus tertii  example iii   mo a base infeftment   do a public infeftment   tio the superior in right of ward  in this case the public infeftment is good against the ward as holding of the superior himself and therefore it is plainly jus tertii for the superior to insist against the base infeftment in so far as he is excluded from the benefit of the ward by the public infeftment and therefore the base infeftment will come out preferable  example iv   mo a base infeftment   do terce or courtesy   tio the superior by ward or recognition  in this case also it is plain that in so far as the superior is excluded by the terce or courtesy in so far will the base infeftment have the benefit thereof  example v   mo an adjudication with a charge against the superior   do voluntary disposition with infeftment reducible as being granted in cursu diligentiae of the first adjudger   tio adjudger within year and day of the first  in this case the disposition excludes the second adjudication and is excluded by the first in so far as the first would draw were the disposition not in the field and so it will come out that the first adjudger will have the half of the fund providing his debt amount so high and the disponee will enjoy the remainder  example vi   mo a charge of horning   do an assignation of a bond to a creditor reducible by the charger on the act        tio arrestment thereafter laid on by a third creditor in hands of the debtor in the bond  here the assignation will stand good against reduction in respect that it is jus tertii for the charger to found upon it being at any rate excluded by the arrestment  example vii   mo an adjudger with a charge against the superior   do an adjudger infeft without year and day   tio an infeftment upon a voluntary disposition which disposition is of a date prior to the citation in the adjudications  in this case the adjudger infeft is preferable  example viii   mo a personal onerous bond   do an infeftment upon a posterior gratuitous disposition granted in the circumstances of bankruptcy   tio an infeftment upon an adjudication for an onerous debt contracted after the gratuitous disposition with which adjudication the first onerous creditor adjudging does not come in pari passu  here the gratuitous disposition comes out preferable  we shall conclude with some decisions that have past upon this subject  an infeftment of annualrent being after the first apprising and before the second all three were brought in pari passu being within year and day the statute being new and dubious stair   february      brown contra nichols this case is handled above  the next decision i shall mention is the competition amongst the creditors of langtoun  0 january   0  this being a curious case and pretty stiffly debated i shall give it at full length as observed by a very eminent hand  langtouns affairs having gone into disorder in the beginning of the year    0 about the time of his retiring he grants many heritable bonds of corroboration whereupon infeftments followed before any adjudications could be expede and there were also many inhibitions some older some later before the granting of several of these bonds of corroboration and the creditors did all generally adjudge within year and day the debts and diligences did far exceed the debitors estate whereupon a competition of creditors arising several questions did occur which had never formerly been determined especially in the ranking of simple and inhibiting adjudgers and annualrenters which questions were pled and determined without names of parties but upon the nature of their several rights and diligences  for the annualrenters it was alleged that their infeftments of annualrent being prior to all the adjudgers they were preferable and their annualrents payable in the first place before an adjudger could draw any share of the rents  and for the inhibiters that the sums in their inhibitions must be fully satisfied before the posterior annualrenters could draw any share  and for the simple adjudgers on debts anterior to the inhibitions that the said inhibitions could not be any ways prejudicial to their debts but that they as coadjudgers with the inhibiters ought to draw the same share as if no inhibition had been used  these several propositions were all severally founded upon known principles of law in case of competition betwixt any two of the three contending parties but not reconcilable to one another in the competition of simple and adjudging inhibiters and annualrenters which was the case that lay before the lords to be decided  the lords after many hearings in presentia and very mature deliberation and reasoning amongst themselves did at last come to establish certain rules for determining the present question and the like that might occur in other processes of ranking which of late had fallen to be more frequent and the decisions more accurate in regard of the late acts of parliament anent the sale of bankrupts estates  the rules established by the lords were these first that an inhibiteradjudger did not simply reduce posterior annualrenters but only in as far as these annualrenters were prejudicial to the inhibiter and found that inhibiters would draw such a share of the rents or in case of sale of the property of the estate as would have belonged to them if no posterior voluntary rights had been granted and found that anterior creditors adjudging within year and day of the inhibiter could not be prejudged by the inhibition but that anterior creditors adjudging would draw the same share of the common debitors estate as if there had been no inhibition used  by this decision the inhibiter did not obtain full payment of the sums in the inhibition before the annualrenter could draw any share nor did the annualrenter lose all but a part only nor was the annualrenter allowed to recur upon adjudgers for anterior debts for making up that share which the inhibiter reduced and cut off as for example suppose the case that the subject affected is worth   000 merks and that there are three adjudgers pari passu for  000 merks each and one annualrenter effeiring to  000 merks and that one of the adjudgers is also an inhibiter before contracting the annualrenters debt the division falls thus the three adjudgers for equal sums do first divide the   000 merks in equal parts whereof each draws  000 merks and thereby lose each  000 merks the annualrenter being a common burden on the subject affected and preferable to all the adjudications claims  000 merks from each of the three adjudgers as a stock effeiring to his annualrent but the inhibiting adjudger strikes off his claim by virtue of his diligence of inhibition but the posterior adjudgers having no defense the annualrenter draws  000 merks from each of them whereby the inhibiting adjudger gets his full third share with the coadjudgers but loses  000 merks of his whole sum and the annualrenter loses  000 merks and gets  000 merks and the coadjudgers get each  000 merks of the remaining  000 merks  according to this rule the lords did uniformly determine in all subsequent rankings and sales for several years and the rules are found practicable in all the variety of cases that did occur in the several processes of sale which have been very frequent since that time but thereafter in the case of arridden there happened a special circumstance which had not been pled when the rule was established and some alteration had also happened on the bench since that decision whereupon the whole foundation of that rule and decision was called in question and often debated in presentia and several bills and after a review and full consideration of the case the lords did proceed upon the same foundation and strengthened the former rule  carriddens case occurred in the competition of the creditors of cockburnspath a part of nicolsons estate and he being an inhibiter and also an adjudger within year and day the lords found his adjudication null but he insisted as inhibiter for reducing the right of several debts after his inhibition whereon adjudication had been led within year and day of other adjudgers on debts anterior alleging that he could not be wholly excluded while these adjudgers on posterior debts were admitted to a share of the price for he could still adjudge whereby his adjudication would be drawn back to his inhibition and always be preferable to such adjudgers whose debts were posterior to his diligence  to which it was answered that his adjudication could afford him no share because setting aside all the posterior creditors the diligences on anterior debts were far beyond the value of the subject of the competition and seeing his inhibition could not prejudge these anterior debts nor diligences it afforded no prejudice to him that posterior creditors by their diligence came in pari passu to get a share with anterior creditors because though these posterior debts had never been contracted carridden was utterly excluded and his inhibition was only a prohibitory diligence whereupon he could not reduce posterior debts simply but in so far as they were prejudicial to his debt and his afteradjudication could not state him in the case of these posterior annualrenters so as to make the benefit of their annualrents accresce to him  upon the several debates in that case the lords at last by their interlocutor   th february school found that an inhibiter cannot be prejudged by posterior debts nor anterior creditors prejudged by an inhibiter and found that the contracting of debts after an inhibition could not be profitable to an inhibiter nor does their diligence accresce to him and that therefore carriden could draw no share of the price of cockburnspath  according to these rules all the rankings have ever proceeded uniformly without any contradiction but of late in the competition of the creditors of langtoun that rule was again called in question and upon a petition several times moved by the inhibiters a hearing allowed in presentia in which it was alleged that the rule above set down could not consist with the true effect of an inhibition which was not only a prohibitory but a preparatory diligence and that an adjudication coming after whether within year and day of other adjudgers or not was always to be drawn back to the date of the inhibition so as to remove all posterior annualrents or other diligences on posteriordebts and these being removed the inhibiter fell to come in to get the full payment of the debts in his inhibition at least to the extent of the voluntary rights and then the annualrenter being preferable by the nature of his right and security came in the next place to get the full payment preferable to posterior coadjudgers as for example in the case formerly stated of a subject to the value of   000 merks and three adjudgers for  000 merks each and an annualrenter effeiring to  000 merks the annualrenter as preferable draws first his share sciz  000 merks which is set aside so the remaining  000 merks being divided in three each adjudger gets  000 merks but the inhibiting adjudger recurs upon the annualrenter by virtue of his diligence from whom he draws  000 merks more to make up his  000 merks then the annualrenter by the nature of his right being preferable to the coadjudgers recurs on them from whom he draws the said  000 merks so remains only to the coadjudgers  000 merks  for enforcing this the inhibiter insisted upon the nature of the diligence alleging that the adjudgers diligence reached nothing but the reversion over and above the annualrent which was preferable upon every part of the subject adjudged and therefore the inhibiter getting his full share by virtue of his adjudication and inhibition the annualrent lay upon the shares of the coadjudgers and it often happens that an inhibiter gets a better share by reason of posterior voluntary rights than he would have had without them as for example suppose that in place of a right of annualrent a posterior creditor had obtained either a proper wadset or a redeemable right of a part of the debitors estate and being thereupon infeft was preferable to the posterior adjudgers in that case the inhibiter would have an equal share with the coadjudgers if within year and day and what were wanting would be made up to him by affecting the wadset or right of property made after his inhibition wherein the coadjudgers would have no share nor interest and by that means the full sum in the inhibition would be made up and he in a much better condition than he would have been if no posterior right had been granted and suppose again that this inhibiter had not adjudged within year and day he would indeed have had no share in the reversion or superplus with prior adjudgers but his diligence would have been drawn back to procure to him full payment of the sums in his inhibition at least so far as the value of the posterior voluntary right did extend to and there is no reason that the case of an inhibiter should be worse where there is a posterior annualrent than it would be if no proper wadset or partial right had been granted  to all which it was answered that the rules above laid down are most just and equitable and nothing material objected  the fundamental rules are   mo that an inhibiter cannot be prejudged by posterior debts   do that an anterior creditor can no ways be prejudged by an inhibition whereas by what is now pled an inhibition would strike more effectually against the prior creditor than the posterior annualrenter for though the inhibiter recurs upon the annualenter as posterior the annualrenter recurrs again upon the adjudgers whose debts were contracted prior to the inhibition by which means the annualrenter loses nothing though the inhibition ought only to strike against posterior voluntary deeds and the adjudger on prior debts is at the whole loss albeit it be a most certain principle that an inhibition has no imaginable effect against anterior debts and diligences following thereupon so that there must certainly be a fallacy in that reasoning and there is no manner of mystery or the least difficulty in finding where the fallacy lies viz an inhibition is no ground reduction of posterior debts simply to anull them but only in so far as they are prejudicial to the debt in the inhibition that is to say in so far as the inhibiter falls to draw a less share of the estate or rents thereof than he would have obtained if no posterior voluntary deed had been done and an inhibition is merely a prohibitory diligence for removing the prejudice of posterior deeds but does not give any positive right nor state the inhibiter adjudger in place of the annualrenter so as to draw a share by virtue of the right of annualrent as the inhibiter must acknowledge by his own argument for if the inhibiter came in place of the annualrenter that is to say if the right of annualrent did accresce to the inhibiter then the inhibiter getting payment in the right of the annualrent would extinguish the annualrent and consequently the annualrenter could never recur upon the coadjudgers so that the scheme offered by the inhibiters is inconsistent with law and reason in every circumstance for the inhibiter can never have what was competent to the annualrenter but by coming in his place and causing the annualrent to accresce which were a notion absurd and inconsistent and what is urged that an inhibition is not only a prohibitory but a preparatory diligence is a new invented notion never heard of in any former case and without any foundation in law  and whereas it is alleged that in the case of a proper wadset or a partial right of property after inhibition and before the adjudications the inhibiter strikes out the posterior wadsetter or purchaser and comes in his place from which it is inferred   mo that an inhibiter may have advantage by posterior voluntary deeds   do what must be acknowledged to be in the case of a proper wadset or an irredeemable right of property ought also to hold in the case betwixt the competing annualrenter and inhibiter  it is answered that in the case proposed an inhibiter may have an accidental advantage in the competition with other creditors by posterior voluntary deeds for the inhibiter would not only have a share with the coadjudgers in the reversion of the debitors other estate but further would affect the lands irredeemably disponed or wadset after his inhibition but cannot have the like benefit in the case of an annualrenter and it often happens that by a competition a greater benefit arises to some creditors than would do if some of the parties competing were out of the field because in a competition of many creditors there must be general rules and foundations in law with regard to the rights and interests of the several creditors competing which alter if the rights of some of these creditors be drawn out of the field as for example in the competition betwixt an inhibition and a posterior voluntary right without the concourse of other creditors the inhibition is alalways preferable but in the competition of many other creditors the inhibition may happen to be totally excluded and posterior rights get a share  to apply this to the case proposed a proper wadsetter or a right of property of a part of the debitors estate does wholly separate and set apart the wadset right or the property from the debitors estate in competition with posterior adjudgers whereby they are entirely excluded from that wadset or right of property but quoad the inhibiter the wadset or right of property is null and therefore the inhibiting adjudger removing the voluntary right by his inhibition comes to receive the benefit of the voluntary right so far as is wanting to him by his diligence in competition with coadjudgers or other creditors whereof the reason is plain because such voluntary rights do in the first place wholly exclude adjudgers not inhibiters and then the competition falls singly betwixt inhibiters and posterior purchasers and in the competition of these two the inhibiter is ever preferred but that makes nothing to the advantage of what is now urged to be a rule in the competition of simple and inhibiting adjudgers and annualrenters for    mo the posterior wadsetter or purchaser so excluded does not recur upon the posterior adjudgers but only suffers the loss as having rested upon voluntary rights without diligence and so the rule above set down that prior creditors are not prejudged by the inhibition stands still good whereas in the present debate it is alleged that as the inhibiter recurrs upon the annualrenter so the annualrenter also recurrs upon adjudgers and anterior debts    do there is a manifest disparity betwixt the case of an annualrenter and a proper wadsetter or purchaser of a part of the debitors estate by an irredeemable right for the last two do entirely divide and separate the wadset or irredeemable right from the remainder of the debitors estate and thereby does wholly withdraw his purchase from the posterior adjudgers whereas an annualrent right resembles a servitude and is a burden consisting with the property and affecting every part thereof and therefore the posterior adjudgers carry the property so affected and when these adjudgers divide the property or the rents the annualrent which lies as a burden is equally proportioned amongst the adjudgers according to their dividend but that proportion of the annualrent which falls upon the share of the inhibiting adjudger is struck off whereby he gets the same share that would have fallen to him if there had been no annualrent and because the said share of the annualrent is cut off by the diligence of an inhibition the annualrenter is at a loss and cannot recur upon the adjudgers who did not inhibit because the inhibition can no more prejudge anterior creditors than posterior deeds can prejudge the inhibiter as for example in the case above stated of a competition for a stock of   000 merks the three adjudgers pari passu for  000 merks each get only  000 merks and the annualrenter effeiring to  000 merks gets  000 merks from each of the two adjudgers who did not inhibit but draws nothing from the inhibiter as being after his diligence and suppose again that the inhibiter were not pari passu with the other two adjudgers but year and day after them these two adjudgers would first draw their full  0000 merks out of the common stock whereby there would remain  000 merks to the annualrenter and then the annualrenter would draw his other  000 merks from the two first adjudgers which would make up his whole annualrent but the inhibiter who was not within year and day would reduce the annualrent in so far as extended to the  000 merks more than fell to the first two adjudgers because though the first two adjudgers were preferable as to their  0000 merks and in so far as the annualrenter draw from them the inhibiter was not prejudged yet as to the superplus of  000 merks the competition falling betwixt the inhibiter and a posterior annualrenter the inhibiter is entirely preferred but suppose again that there were three adjudgers pari passu still for  000 merks and an inhibiter adjudger year and day after for the like sum and an annualrenter as formerly in that case the three adjudgers on anterior debts would each draw  000 merks and the annualrenter would draw  000 merks from each of them and so obtain full payment and the inhibiter adjudger not within year and day would get nothing albeit the posterior annualrenter gets all as was found in the forecited case of carridden because the inhibiter is not prejudged by the annualrenter who can never compete if the question were betwixt them two but the whole stock being affected and exhausted by preferable adjudications for anterior debts the inhibiter is thereby effectually excluded by his own negligence and the diligence of the other creditors and is noways prejudged by the annualrenter who by his preference to the coadjudgers gets his full annualrent which the inhibiter ought not to envy and can not quarrel the annualrenters advantage not being in defraud and prejudice of him and thus it happens that in the competition of many creditors the division being made according to foundations and principles of law a voluntary right obtains preference and payment when an anterior inhibiter is wholly excluded not by the annualenter but by other competing creditors and it is a mistaken notion of the import of an inhibition to imagine that an inhibition gives any positive right or that the inhibiter is prejudged as long as he gets not his full payment preferrable to posterior annualrents for the effect of his diligence is only that he do not get less than if these annualrents had not been granted or that in competition with voluntary rights alone and without the intervention of other competing creditors the inhibiter is always preferred to the voluntary right but where other creditors come in pari passu or are preferable to the inhibiter and postponed to the annualrenter every creditor draws his share according to the nature of his right and diligence  the lords found that in the competition of simple and inhibiting adjudgers and annualrenters the inhibiting adjudger could only reduce the posterior annualrent in so far as he was thereby prejudged and that he could not claim full payment of the sums in his inhibition before the annualrenter could draw any share in the said competition but could only draw such a share of the annualrents or price as he would have drawn if there had been no posterior annualrent or voluntary right  the estate of tofts being sold at a public roup and the decree of ranking remitted to an accomptant to draw out a scheme of the division of the price amongst the creditors an objection was started against the scheme to understand which the following fact is necessary to be known   mo susanna belshes had an inhibition in the      and adjudication upon the same ground of debt in        do kippenross had an inhibition in the      with an heritable bond of corroboration and infeftment in the      which infeftment was struck at by susanna belshes her inhibition   tio a set of annualrenters some prior some posterior to kippenross but all of them struck at by his inhibition   to a set of adjudgers in the      coming in pari passu with susanna belshes her adjudication struck at by neither of the inhibitions to reduce this case to its simplest terms and to throw off extraneous circumstances kippenrosss inhibition and the effect thereof was first considered which striking only against the posterior annualrenters the case was taken up as if these annualrenters were not in the field and at the same time the inhibition itself was laid aside it having thus got its full effect by throwing out of the field every right it struck against this being premised the case reduced to its simplest terms came out thus   mo an infeftment of annualrent soiz kippenrosss   do posterior adjudgers coming in pari passu of which adjudgers one soiz susanna belshes has an inhibition that strikes against the infeftment of annualrent  the question is how are these creditors to draw their proportions the annualrenter is ranked primo loco and the inhibiter without doubt draws from him whatever she could draw were he not in the field so far the matter is clear but now the dispute comes can the annualrenter recur against the other adjudgers against whom the inhibition strikes not for any share of what was drawn from him by the inhibition the scheme says no the objector says yes  to go to the foundation of this matter it must be carefully attended to that an inhibition is in itself no real right gives no preference in the subject not being directed against the land but against the competing creditors such of them as it strikes against in a word being but a personal prohibition directed against creditors it affords only a personal challenge which does not alter or disturb the real preferences  for example if there be three annualrenters a b c following one another in the order of time and ranked accordingly let us suppose that c the last annualrenter has an inhibition striking against a the first annualrenter let the estate be  00 and the value of each of the annualrent rights  00 in this case the method of drawing can be no other but this a the first annualrenter is preferred primo loco and draws his whole sum viz  00 by which his annualrentright falls to be extinguished by payment b the second annualrenter draws all that remains being other  00 and thus so far as concerns the real and direct preferences c the last annalrenter is cut off and draws nothing but then when we go to consider the pretenses that one right or diligence may have against another which my lord stair terms page     the partial reasons of reduction we find that c has an inhibition against a and therefore must draw from him whatever he would have drawn by virtue of his annualrentright had a never existed which is no less than his  00 and thus the ultimate division comes out b gets  00 c gets  00 and a gets nothing now in this case the objector must say that a recurs against b for what was drawn from him by the inhibiter which lands in giving c  00 a  00 and b nothing and he comes at this conclusion by conceiving c by virtue of his inhibition preferable in the first place a in the second place and b in the last place which is plainly fallacious   mo because an inhibition as said is gives no real preference   do because it is evident let a and c adjust their preferences as they best can that b the second annualrenter against whom the inhibition strikes not must possess the second place so that if we shall allow c by virtue of his inhibition to take up the first place naturally due to a that cannot harm b a being thus beat out of his place cannot dispossess b but must upon that supposition fall back to the last place and were this otherwise great absurdities would follow according to the objectors scheme as was just now demonstrated the estate being  00 and each of the annualrents  00 c the inhibiter draws his whole claim a his whole claim and b gets nothing at all what is this but to say that the inhibition excludes b though it has no cause of reduction against it and preserves a though it is against a only that it strikes  there is another case which tends much to illustrate this doctrine let us suppose a liferentrix who having the preferable right upon the estate consents to the preference of another creditor which wives are frequently led to do let us suppose at the same time a third creditor who has an infeftment of annualrent interjected betwixt the liferentright and the right consented to it is plain that the consent here alters nothing of the real preferences the liferentrix falls to be ranked primo loco the other creditor secundo loco and the right consented to ultimo loco and in that order they must draw their respective proportions and the estate of consequence be disburdened the right indeed ranked in the last place by virtue of the consent must draw from the liferentrix whatever it would have drawn had the liferentrix not been in the field but sure this could never entitle the liferentrix to recur against the annualrent ranked in the second place whose right the consent harms not as to him the consent is res inter alios which can neither hurt him or do him service the foundation of law is precisely the same in the case of inhibition the effect of which is restricted against the creditors which it strikes at and in no case can either harm or benefit others  all this is to clear the method of making out schemes in rankings which has been continually practiced and followed ever since the viscount of stairs time who was the first that fixed this rule viz that the real rights must first be ranked according to their preference and having drawn their sums accordingly the estate falls to be disburdened of them and they extinguished by payment in the next place must be considered the partial pretensions or reasons of reduction that any of the creditors may have against others as to such the rule is  that whatever is drawn from a preferable creditor upon any personal consideration intitles him not to recur against any other preferable creditor posterior to him against whom the personal consideration militates not see stair page     at the foot  to apply all to the case in dispute which is that of an annualrenter and two posterior adjudgers one of which has an inhibition striking against the annualrenter my lord stair in the above cited place has well fixed that the annualrentright must be ranked first and the adjudications in the second place pari passu then he considers the effect of the inhibiters personal claim against the annualrenter but allows not the annualrenter at all to recur against the other adjudger for what was drawn from him by the inhibition which were landing in the above absurdity no less than allowing the annualrenter when he is beat out of his own place to take up the second place and dispossess thereby the adjudger whose place by right it is whereby the inhibition would come to strike against the adjudger and not against the annualrenter in express contradiction to the intendment of the diligence which the law says in this case strikes only against the annualrenter and not against the adjudger now here the objector would have the inhibiting adjudger to be ranked in the first place and thereby to take up the place of the annualrenter because the inhibition strikes against him he would have the annualrenter struck out of his own place to take up the second place possessed by the adjudger and he would send the second adjudger thus unjustly dispossessed to seek his redress off the first adjudger in the best manner he can which is evidently contrary to the nature of the thing and the conception of these diligences  to sum up all when kippenross pleads upon his inhibition no doubt it must have its effect and thereby must be struck out all the posterior infeftments of annualrent in the next place when he pleads upon his infeftment he has a title to be ranked for his whole sum he is accordingly ranked and draws his whole sum and thus his infeftment has also its full effect there is indeed a personal claim upon him by virtue of an inhibition which takes from him some share of his draught but this personal claim the other real creditors have no concern with as to them it is plainly res inter alios they cannot be lesed thereby the inhibition militates against kippenrosss annualrent not against the posterior adjudgers they cannot be in a better or worse situation than if that inhibition were not in the field and therefore whatever susanna belshes her inhibition draws from kippenross this cannot burden the adjudgers or put them in any situation by which they shall draw one farthing less than if the inhibition never had existed  the lords found that kippenrosss infeftment being once ranked so as to draw his share in competition with the other real creditors that he could not recur against the posterior real creditors for any part of what was drawn from him by susanna belshes her inhibition  feb    0 campbell contra drummond  in a reclaiming petition the objector against the scheme endeavored to turn his argument into another shape he pled according to the rule laid down by lord stair page        that the adjudgers are to be accounted as joint proprietars and the infeftments of annualrenters as servitudes on the property whence he drew this consequence that as it is the property of an annualrentright to affect every part of the ground in solidum in which unaquaequa gleba servit therefore it was in kippenrosss power to draw his whole sum out of the simple adjudgers part and he behoved so to do because he was barred by the inhibition from any demand upon the inhibiting adjudger but the answer was obvious to the lords   mo that this argument went upon a fallacy supposing each adjudger to be possessed of a different tenement without any connection or relation to one another and the annualrent a burden upon both whereas the subject was but one and the adjudgers had each of them a right over the whole pro indiviso attending to this the objectors argument falls to the ground because before there could be any access to make a partition of the land itself or the price coming in its place betwixt the two adjudgers all the burdens upon the joint property must have been considered and paid off so as to leave the remainder clear to be divided equally betwixt the adjudgers   do esto the scheme should be framed in this way which the objectors seems to point at sciz first to divide the common subject betwixt the two adjudgers joint proprietars to be sure the next thing to be done was to divide the common burdens also by which means no more but the one half of the annualrent would fall to be a burden upon the simple adjudger it is true this could not limit the annualrenters right who might notwithstanding draw his whole sum from the simple adjudger but then the simple adjudger who had not only paid his own share of the annualrentright but also that share which by the division was laid upon his coadjudger would without controversy be entitled to recourse against the coadjudger as having paid a debt which he the coadjudger was ultimately liable in and this brings it back precisely where it was before by the other method of calculation and indeed it would be absurd that two schemes both right occasioned only by taking up the matter in different lights should terminate in different conclusions upon which considerations the lords refused the bill without answers  observations upon prescription as man is not formed complete in himself but an indigent being standing in need of daily supplies from without the deity has bestowed the earth upon man and men upon one another toward this end he has wisely implanted in our natures the remarkable affections to property and society in this equally provident as in his other dispensations to mankind not only to furnish us sufficient means but which is admirable to compel us in the most agreeable manner to make choice of and embrace these means possibly at first when the world was thinly peopled and great plenty of common necessaries of life the affection for property was small and the natural notions of appropriation little cultivated but as mankind grew numerous and the necessaries of life not so easily come at labor and industry became of value and property to be considered for without property labor and industry was in vain the foundation of property a posteriori is apparent that it is also founded a priori in the nature of man and consequently in the original laws is also certain evident from this that nature which makes nothing in vain has provided every person with an affection to property wherein is founded that connection betwixt men and things which we call commonly by the name of property and whereby nature prompts a man to be differently affected to one thing from another and which affection leads us to bestow care in preserving labor and industry in improving what we thus consider as our own and frequently enhances the value of it in our imagination above reality and above the value we attribute to any other thing that does not stand with us in that relation this affection is as much founded in nature as that we bear to our children or any affection whatever and the design is admirable for it is this affection that is the primum mobile of all that industry and diligence men bestow upon their affairs providence foresaw appropriation necessary and it fitted us with affections and faculties leading to that end and thus property is founded a priori in the nature of man or which is the same in the abstract laws of nature the abstract laws relating to whatever species of beings being nothing else but the regulations their natures and constitution prompt and direct them to govern themselves by  property being thus founded in the law of nature there are means of acquiring and losing it founded also in the same law occupation is the primary mean of acquiring property and derelition of losing it when we relinquish our property by any express positive act of the will no body questions the effect but it has not been so clearly understood that the same effect may be wrought negatively by neglect desertion or disuse most writers agree that prescription is a creature only of positive statute not at all founded in the law of nature thus grotius jur bell l   c   thus puffendorf l   c    but let us examine humane nature let us see what it says as to this dispute for to it must ly the ultimate appeal let us suppose that by some accident one loses a jewel he is concerned and contrives all means for recovery the affection of property exerts itself and during that time the thing is as much his as ever his attempts prove unsuccessful hope loses ground he despairs by degrees his loss wears out of his mind his affection cools and at last evanishes he loses entirely the consciousness of property thus the matter lies over for many years my position is that the connection betwixt the man and his jewel is by those means as thoroughly dissolved as if he had derelinquished it by the most positive act or as if it had never been his the affection and consciousness ceases upon which his property is founded and property ceases of consquence it is upon this foundation that things lost by shipwreck after such long time as the proprietor has given over all hope of recovery go to the first finder l    ad r d it is upon the same that a hunter so soon as he gives over hope of his quarry loses that title of prevention which he had by the pursuit after which the law gives access to the next finder if this hold with respect to the person himself who once had the affection of property much more with respect to his heirs who never were in possession and possibly in time may have entirely lost the knowledge of their predecessors right thus then dereliction may be distinguished into two kinds positive or active and negative or passive the positive act is properly abdication and hereafter when we intend to express the negative we shall indifferently use the terms of dereliction or desertion  let us now put the case that the jewel is found by a person who after using all the proper means of discovering an owner takes it up upon the footing of dereliction to make the case stronger instead of a jewel let us suppose a piece of ground or something else that the finder may possibly imagine never had been appropriated he continues to possess as proprietor he lays out money builds a house and makes great embellishments the estate descends from father to son the natural affection increases by time to this paternal inheritance which has been now in the same family if you will for several centuries at last the former proprietor comes and claims the ground he shows after what manner his predecessors were led to forsake their country and possessions during all that interval they had been abroad in another land where they fixed their heart and residence without the least view or prospect of ever revisiting their native soil till by some accident like the former fortune led them back to the country from whence they originally sprung let any man consider seriously this case and consult his own heart about it he will find this claim to be against nature and reason the demand has no other foundation but a quondam property long ago deserted and given over for lost it is directed against a person whose predecessors have been bona fide in possession time out of mind and justly esteemed themselves truly proprietors a demand of this kind is obviously against nature the first proprietor deserted his possession lost his affection to it whereby as to all real effects the case comes to be the same as it had never been his another person is suffered peaceably and honestly to take up the deserted possession he has no reason to be suspicious of this more than of any other vacant spot of ground his affection grows to the subject as his own property it becomes as strong as he had bought it nay we may suppose he actually bought it or obtained it by some other the most indisputed title if the law thereafter take it from him it takes it from a man who cannot help thinking it unjustly tore from him and who is thereby made a real sufferer to be given to another whose pretensions are quite wore out by course of time and who is thus made locupletior aliena jactura it can never be in the law of nature to indulge such hardships it will be granted to be perfectly agreeable to humane nature that a man indulge his affection in such acquisition at first indeed it is reasonable to have some doubts these must wear off necessarily by the course of time till at the long run the possessor acquires the most solid affection to and security in the thing as his own after so good a foundation built in humane nature it never can be agreeable to the laws of that nature to overturn such a foundation by wresting the property from him which were in other words to say that nature dictates to be secure and insecure at the same time  the matter comes here in one word the longer a man possesses bona fide the greater is his security in the thing and affection to it till at length both become extreme the laws of nature ought to protect every possessor in reasonable security and affection which are of natures growth and not prefer him who has neither security nor affection and thus by the law of nature a long continued bona fide possession is a good title for acquiring property  it will conduce to the better illustrating of this doctrine if we take a view of the effects of bona fide possession in its full extent the bona fide possessor from the very beginning is allowed to consume the fruits the true proprietor let him put in his claim when he will has no demand upon that score the reason is that as property is introduced for the convenience and support of mankind it is better any man consume the fruits than that they be lost to every body and therefore are given to the possessor who has a title such as to convince the judges that he was in bona fide to consider himself as proprietor and as from the nature of the thing titles to property are extremely uncertain it is the interest of mankind that they be kept secure against afterreckonings of this nature it is but enlarging this thought to give security to the possessor after great length of time in the thing itself when the former possessor has lost his affection and all thought of recovery for is not all this answering the true design of property by making it subservient to the uses and necessities of mankind are not these very laws anent property sciz that it cannot be taken away without consent of the owner and such like introduced for the same i nd those very laws that seen most opposite to this doctrine but what is the result of all none other but this that the end is the true touchstone to judge of the preference of the means thus in common cases the rule ought to be sacred that no mans property be tore from him without his consent because otherwise the great end proposed by appropriation could not be brought about but then if in any circumstance the rigid observance of this rule shall be so far from conducing to the end proposed that it will be flying directly in the face of it in that circumstance it must yield to some other rule more adapted to bring about that end and he who in that circumstance does notwithstanding adhere to the rule is guilty of the plain absurdity of preferring the mean to the end  prescription necessarily presupposes two persons one who loses and another who gains thereby this is evident for all the ways known in law to deprive a man of any of his rights and privileges are in favors of and with a view to the interest of others prescription is of two kinds the positive whereby is gained a power over the property or person of another the negative whereby one loses his own rights or privileges to determine what rights fall under the negative prescription by the law of nature it is obvious in the first place that it is a legal extinction of rights of property which go thereafter to the first occupier   do all burdens upon the person or effects of another fall under it which operating an extinction only not a transference stand in need of no positive act of the acquirer of his liberty to produce the full effect because if the creditors right fall the debtor cannot remain bound but as to all acts of native liberty personal privileges and such like which in benefiting ourselves interfeir not with others and make no restraint upon them such cannot be lost by disuse because they involve but the idea of one person and concern not others whereby supposing them capable to be cut off by prescription still it would come to nothing because no mortal could be founded in an interest to allege upon it the personal objection of jus tertii would ever lie against him thus if a person shall keep silence a hundred year confine himself to a place or to a certain method of action there is nothing in nature to oblige him to continue a moment in the same longer than he wills unless another by use consent or otherwise has acquired a power over him to restrain his native liberty it is for the same reason that a man cannot tie himself down even by the most express consent unless declared in favors of some third party thus then rights prescribe only negatively which involve the consideration of two persons but there is here a remarkable limitation which makes a considerable further restriction upon rights prescribable which is that personal powers or faculties such as faculties to burden to alter or innovate to revoke etc though inferring a burden upon others are not lost non utendo the true and adequate reason whereof is this that it being involved in the very idea of a faculty to be exerced quandocunque at the arbitrary pleasure of the possessor as well now as afterward as well afterward as now neglect or desertion the causes operative of prescription can never be inferred simply from forbearance in rights the very design of which is to be made effectual quam primum such as obligations for money or other prestation forbearance to act upon these implies neglect and dereliction but where it is the very intention of the thing that the matter should lie over where it is entirely arbitrary whether the power be exerced this day or hereafter the forbearing to act at present cannot infer in the nature of things neglect or dereliction these limitations upon the negative prescription sciz acts of personal liberty that imply but one person and faculties of the nature to be exerced quandocunque are both of them generally comprehended under the expression of res merae facultatis though very different in their natures and carefully to be distinguished as for the positive prescription all rights may be acquired thereby that are capable of possession  it is obvious that positive prescription can in no case exist without the negative for it is through neglect and dereliction that the positive prescription gives any man power over the effects or person of another but the negative prescription may well subsist alone and work its whole effect without intervention of the positive prescription thus property is lost negatively non utendo and if the possessor has the positive prescription it is a strong confirmation of his title but not absolutely necessary the proper subjects therefore of the positive prescription are servitudes personal or real whereby restraint is imposed upon persons or their effects which can by no means be done by the negative prescription alone  it was necessary to lay down the principles of the law of nature relating to this matter which will serve to guide us in the ambiguities of our own law as well as where it is totally deficient  having explained the doctrine of prescription as founded in the law of nature before we come closs to our own practice it may be proper to premise that besides the above considerations there are many others sufficient to have influenced our lawgivers to introduce a statute of this nature nothing more conduces to the wellbeing of a society than that private property be fixed and ascertained it tends to quiet the minds of possessors and encourages industry which of all things ought to be most cherished besides it cuts off in a great measure a sort of pleas pernicious above every thing to society sciz such as are the result of forgery fraud and underhand dealing such claims being generally laid over upon the prospect that by length of time the proper means of discovery shall be evanishd or the real exceptions competent against them be forgot taking then prescription in all these different views it is so far from being odious that perhaps there never was a constitution better founded whether it be considered in the view of equity or expediency the expediency is apparent the equity is clearly shown above since the indulging of old forgotten claims comes truly to this making the claimant locupletior aliena jactura and it is extremely curious to observe in this case as well as in many others how common sense and the dictates of nature get insensibly the better of false principles imbibed by reading or education in all our authors it is held and allowed that prescription is odious yet our court of session has been in the constant use of extending rather than limiting the statutes thereanent and at this day as we shall see afterward it is established in practice that many things fall under prescription which have no sort of warrant from the acts of parliament  though prescription be founded in the law of nature it must be observed that no precise time is fixed to it by that law this is in some measure arbitrary left to the regulation of every different society for it self our law with great judgment has fixed upon forty years a shorter time might possibly have been reckoned too great a limitation upon proprietors a longer time was unnecessary for exceeding the ordinary memory of man in that respect it is equivalent to the longest duration and the man who during such an extent of time neglects or overlooks his affairs would probably reap little benefit from a longer indulgence  it does not appear that our statutes or practicks have much receded from the law of nature except in one particular prescription of rights of property by the law of nature the negative prescription is as effectual to cut a proprietor out of his right as a creditor yet without a positive prescription since the effect would be to make the subject caduciary to go to the fisk or first occupier our law favoring the quondam proprietor allows him to take it up quandocunque as long as not appropriated by the positive prescription and thus with us there is no such thing as a negative prescription of rights of property abstracted from the positive prescription  it is commonly held that in our law bona fides is not a requisite of the positive prescription the lord stair says that in act      there is no provision concerning the manner of the entry whether it be bona fide peaceable or lawful    h t if this be absolutely fixed in our practice there is an end of the question if not the following considerations may not be quite impertinent   mo if bona fides is essential to the nature of prescription as has been fully laid down above it must ever be understood included unless where expressly excluded   do in this very act it is virtually if not expressly included for to what other end is a title by charter and sasine made essential if not to establish a bona fides let a man examine seriously all the reasons for prescription political and legal and he shall not be able to point out any other view the legislator could have in making a title necessary to prescription this will be more plain when we take a view of the roman law there a justus titulus abstracting from bona fides was reckoned a requisite of the positive prescription as much as it is with us yet when we come to examine that matter to the bottom it will appear that justus titulus was truly no distinct requisite of prescription that it was only so far considered as to make evidence of a bona fides and that where there was otherwise presumption or evidence of bona fides prescription was sustained without any title at all all this is clear from the authority of africanus one of the best roman writers l    pro emptore his words are quod vulgo traditum est eum qui existimat se quid emisse nec emerit non posse pro emptore usucapere hactenus verum esse ait si nullam justam causam ejus erroris emptor habeat nam si forte servus vel procurator cui emendam rem mandasset persuaserit ei se emisse atque ita tradiderit magis esse ut usucapio sequatur to the same purpose are l    pro empt l ult   pro suo and upon the same footing it is that one erroneously conceiving himself heir prescribes a right to the heritage by addition in this case usucapio proceeds upon bona fides without any color of a title see voet t pro heredere   if then it come out that in the roman law the justus titulus is truly no distinct requisite of prescription more than it is in the law of nature why should we go about to establish it as the only principle when our law says no such thing to degrade the bona fides in subserviency to which the justus titulus ought alone to be considered   tio the cases just now mentioned from the roman law without controversy would equally obtain in our practice the usucapio pro herede particularly is established by express statute p      c    and the prescription limited to  0 years here then by authority of parliament we have the bona fides made the foundation of prescription without the least pretense of a title what can be answered to these examples by those who hold that a title is necessary and not bona fides   to bona fides is absolutely necessary ad lucrandos fructus perceptos ex re aliena would it not be absurd to adjudge the property to a mala fide possessor who at the same time is in so unfavourable a situation in the eye of law as even to be made accountable for the fruits long ago consumed it is a common case to indemnify a possessor as to the rents who at the same time is made to restore the property so much less favorable is the one claim than the other but it would be strange indeed to sustain a title as sufficient to retain the property which is not even sufficient to retain the fruits already consumed this last argument i acknowledge appears to me in a very strong light however if it appear not so to others i shall be the less surprised in that they have a support from the roman law see l      a r d this text and others to the same purpose would stagger me extremely were it not in my opinion an argument of as great weakness on the one hand to give implicit faith to any human authority as on the other wantonly to neglect or contemn all human authority sure i am the cool and diligent enquirer who in search after truth uses his own reason and the lights that nature has afforded him is more to be commended and offers a more agreeable incense to the memory of the great men who write upon the roman law though in his judgment he may sometimes argue them of little slips and errors than the abject mind does which blindly follows wherever they choose to lead so much was necessary by way of apology for venturing to set up private judgment against public and indeed generally speaking so well founded authority but to return to my subject  here we have a notable difference in our law betwixt the negative and positive prescription bona fides is necessary in the one not at all in the other obligations are lost merely by disuse and dereliction without necessity of alleging a bona fides in the debtor or any thing similar to a positive prescription of liberty for though the former proprietor is restored against the fisk the creditor is not restored against his debtor because liberation is as much more favorable than obligation as private property is more favorable than confiscation this explains the decision fountainhall  th december   0  napier contra campbell where it was found that after the  0 years prescription the defender was not obliged to give his oath whether the debt was yet resting owing and though he should confess it that he was not in foro humano liable possibly it were to be wished we had deviated from the law of nature in the negative prescription of obligations as far as we have done in the negative prescription of property bona fides is absolutely requisite in the acquisition of property by prescription without which the former proprietor is not cut out by whatever disuse might it not be thought as reasonable that the debtor should not be restored to his liberty unless by a quasi possession of exemption upon a bona fide colorable title and were this made the rule the negative prescription would be as strongly founded in equity as it is in strict law it is a great hardship to oblige a man to pay a debt he never was conscious of having absolute affection and security upon the side of freedom it is no hardship to refuse action to a creditor who had perhaps never considered himself as such and never built hope in the claim and thus the rule of equity might apply here as well as in the positive prescription sciz quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura hitherto i say we have thought proper to adhere strictly to the law of nature the alteration here offered may possibly obtain footing in our practice  the positive prescription may be defined a legal acquisition of property or servitude by means of a forty years bona fide possession qua proprietor or qua having a right to the servitude joined with a total disuse or neglect of the righteous owner during that time the negative prescription is a legal extinction of the creditors interest by means of a total disuse or dereliction for forty years  every temporary extinction of a right is not prescription that is only understood to be prescription which extinguishes rights designed by the law or consent to endure a longer time thus the annus deliberandi the three years preference given the creditors of the defunct the legal of adjudications and such like fall not within the compass of this essay  the negative prescription is not a real extinction like payment but only a personal exclusion of the pursuer being an extrinsick not intrinsic exception this is plain from its nature being directed against the pursuers negligence and therefore can only amount to a personal exception against him thus in an adjudication or other right disponed to two different persons one after another the negative prescription may run against one of them though the adjudication it self be saved from prescription by the other disponee    november      fraser contra mackenzie  upon this principle depends the resolution of the following questions an unintimate assignation lies over  0 years prescription has run against the cedent but interrupted quoad the assigny by minority has the assigny thereafter intimating a good title r d the debt was funditus extinguished in the person of the cedent ans prescription is only an extrinsick exception denying action to the cedent but leaving the debt entire to be made effectual by the assigny  the like as to a disposition upon deathbed of an heritable debt which is lost as to the disponee by the lapse of  0 years the heir with respect to whom the prescription was interrupted by minority or otherwise has a good action against the debtor notwithstanding the debt is prescribed quoad the disponee  the same principle determines the question as to the prescription of accessory or cautionary obligements here we must distinguish betwixt an additional security strictly accessory or subsidiary and an expromissory security i e the acceding of a new principal obligant in the first case because such strictly accessory obligements can have no selfsubsistence by whatever means the principal obligation is cut off its shadow the accessory falls of course but when several coobligants bind at different times for the same debt every several coobligant will be free by a several course of prescription for prescription is not like payment an extinction of the debt it self operating only an extrinsick exception personal against the pursuer  from this principle it also follows that prescription is not of the nature of a presumption inferring that the debt is extinguished by payment or otherwise which some hold for in the above example fraser contra mackenzie if the adjudication were presumed extinguished by payment or intromission in the first disponers person this would necessarily affect the second disponee because an adjudication extinguished by payment in one assignys person cannot subsist in the person of any other there is a second argument to evince this prescription has such an effect against the pursuers claim that it cannot thereafter be reared up by the debitors oath of knowledge that it is still resting owing does not this evince that prescription is not a presumption at all whether juris and de jure or juris only for it is obvious that every legal presumption however strong must yield to a demonstrative proof by the debitors oath there is some better color for putting the positive prescription upon the footing of a presumption the narrative of the act seems to favor this but as prescription is supported by the law of nature it has a more solid fundation than a presumption a creature of the law in this case no better than a fiction  it goes next in order to consider what things fall under the negative prescription   mo it is plain from the two statutes p      c    and      c    joined with the nature of prescription above laid down that all burdens established against persons or things prescribe non utendo such as obligations mutual contracts infeftments of annualrents wadsets servitudes dispositions adjudications etc all of which include the idea of two persons one who loses his right and another who is thereby freed from a claim or burden in a question upon this head it was found sufficient to exempt the defenders lands from the jurisdiction of a regality that he had been free for the space of  0 years never being enrolled or cited by the bailie but still by the sheriff stair    november      rolland contra lord of craigievar it was also found that the power of repledging from one court to another was lost non utendo by the negative prescription fountainhall    january      justices of the peace of the shire of air contra town of irvine   do rights of property suffer not the negative prescription    december      presbytery of perth contra the magistrates of perth   tio acts and exertions of native liberty which make no burden or restraint upon others including only one person who has the power but none other against whom it is directed none of these suffer the negative prescription and if they did it would be jus tertii to found upon it thus the right of blood never prescribes it is true that if another than the righteous heir serve the law makes his retour irreducible after  0 years but abstracting from the positive prescription the righteous heir may serve quandocunque no mortal can be founded in an interest to make opposition   to powers and faculties of the nature to be exerced quandocunque such as faculties to dispone burden alter revoke etc thus reversions suffer not the negative prescription it is involved in the very nature of such to ly over the man cannot be accused of negligence who wadset his lands yesterday for not redeeming them to day or to morrow to oblige him to redeem them presently under the hazard of prescription would be going directly contrary to the nature and design of the contract yet this seems to be laid down parliament      cap    unless it be referred to the positive prescription which interpretation is founded both in the nature of the thing and in the act it self for if reversions be registered or incorporated within the body of the infeftment the act in this case says they never can prescribe now it appears obvious that this does only relate to the positive prescription there is good reason that reversions incorporated or registered should be good against the positive prescription and the same reason will infer that latent reversions ought not but no good reason can be given if latent reversions prescribe negatively why they should not also though made ever so public neglect and dereliction are the foundations of the negative prescription and they must hold equally in both cases to infer the negative preicription or they must hold in neither which is the more rational scheme  for the same reason a donation betwixt man and wife may be revoked at any time and the power of revocation suffers not the negative prescription fountainhall    january      turnbul contra husband upon the same footing it is that the power to take infeftment upon a precept is not lost by delay which while the party is in possession of the lands or superiority thereof may ad libitum be done quandocunque   july      johnston of corhead contra johnston of newtoun  in mutual contracts prescription can have no such effect as to liberate the one party while the other remains bound if the one demand performance he must fulfill also his part because prescription does not change the nature of contracts by transforming them into other species it cuts them off simply or allows them to stand simply now as the nature of a mutual contract is one and indivisible to oblige the one party to perform while the other is free would be entirely to change its nature by transforming it into a simple obligation which prescription cannot do being made to destroy not to establish obligations thus in a contract of sale for example which has lien over  0 years without implement but kept alive by the one party through minority or interruption if the party against whom prescription has not run insist for implement he must at the same time perform the mutual cause because if he pursue upon the contract he must take it as it stands but then the prescription has this effect that the other party cannot pursue upon it because as to him it is lost non utendo and thus prescription may run against one party in a mutual contract and not against the other but never so as to divide the prestations the contract must be fulfilled in totum or not at all  it is commonly held that a right of peerage does not suffer the negative prescription but of this there may be a doubt it cannot be put upon the footing of a personal quality such a one as no person has an interest to object prescription against because the first peer being removed the second in order attains the first place it is true peerage is not a burden upon any person or thing but neither is property and yet by the law of nature it suffers the negative prescription our law indeed in favorem restores the former proprietor to his right but that favor cannot be pled in this case more than in that of a creditor there is no reason for restoring one peer against another more than for restoring a creditor against his debtor it cannot be put upon the footing of a faculty to be exerced quandocunque a right of peerage is of the nature to be capable of neglect and dereliction as well as a right of property or of credit lastly though jus sanguinis prescribes not which might be reckoned of the same nature with this in question that holds only where it is jus tertii for any mortal to make the objection no person having an interest to hinder an heir to represent whomever of his prdecessors if the right taken up by the heir be of the nature of an obligation the quondam debtor suffers nothing because he is already free by the negative prescription if a right of property the present possessor is safe by the positive prescription and if that be not run the heir has access upon a separate medium to wit that property prescribes not negatively if it be a personal faculty that interfeirs not with others or if it be of that nature to be exerced quandocunque there is nothing to hinder the heir to take it up now this applies not to a right of peerage the prescription of which third parties have interest in equally as where the prescription is of obligations  reduction upon the head of deathbed was found to suffer the negative prescription forbes    march   0  murray contra irving but in that decision mention is not made of what nature was the subject disponed upon death bed if it was an heritable bond there can be no question about the decision for this reason that the heir could have no interest to pursue such a reduction against the disponee whose right against the debtor himself was cut off non utendo and if the disponee took a document upon the right and saved it from prescription that cannot benefit the heir but if the heir himself used interruption there is a difficulty which resolves into this whether a deathbed deed be ipso jure null or good until it be challenged by reduction if the last the reduction prescribes non utendo if the other the subject remained in haereditate jacente and there could be no necessity of a reduction if now the disposition upon deathbed was of lands the same distinction must be taken along for upon supposition the deathbed deed was good until reduction it follows that the reduction is cut off by the negative prescription if null as a right of property prescribes not non utendo the heir may take it up when he will  the negative prescription of annual prestations is a subject abstruse in itself and not at all cleared by writers or decisions to avoid the labyrinth these naturally lead us into it will be the best way to abstract from them for the present and endeavor to draw our conclusions from well founded principles to begin we ought nicely to distinguish amongst four things   mo the contract or other legal deed which is the cause and whereby the right is established   do the writing which is the evidence   tio the right it self established   to the consequences of the right for example in a loan of money the fact of delivery of the sum lent to the debtor with his consent to repay is the cause the bond is the evidence there is a right of credit established the consequences are   mo a power to oblige the debtor to repay the sum quandocunque   do a power to oblige him to pay annualrent in the mean time of these four it is the right itself that is the proper subject of prescription it is obvious that consent or evidence are not capable of prescription and as for the consequences of the right if the right itself remain firm and unshaken its consequences are a shadow that must ever attend the substance if the right itself fall it is bootless to talk whether the consequences be prescribed since a shadow cannot exist without the substance having gained this point that the right itself is the proper subject of prescription let us now put the case of a sum of money lent repayable at two different terms the creditor insts for payment forty years after the first terms payment fell due but within forty years of the second term quaeritur whether the remaining half that fell due the second term can yet be exacted the answer is that it cannot because the right itself the jus crediti is cut off by prescription after which there can be no pursuit upon the bond the creditor has been negligent for the space of forty years since the time that action was first competent thereupon the law from this infers that he has derelinquished his right which brings him to the same situation as it never had been granted the right itself falls with all its consequences upon the same medium it is that a bond bearing annualrent having lien over forty years not only the principal sum but all the intermediate annualrents fall to the ground though none of them have been due forty years and possibly some of them not a single month thus the matter was determined in the roman law and upon the same principles see l    c de usur the words are eos qui principali action per exceptionem triginta vel quadraginta annorum sive personali sive hypothecaria ceciderunt jubemus non posse super usuris vel fructibus praeteriti temporis aliquam movere quaestionem dicendo ex iisdem temporibus eas velle sibi persolvi quae non ad triginta vel quadraginta praeteritos annos referuntur asserendo singulis annis earum actiones nasci principali enim action non subsistente satis supervacuum est super usuris vel fructibus adbuc judicem cognoscere from the same principle it flows that if a creditor take document upon his right the right itself is safe from prescription with all its consequences which is insinuated in the first act anent prescription and cleared by practice thus negative prescription is saved as to the whole the creditor doing diligence against any one of the principals or cautioners stair dirleton    th december      nicolson contra lord of philorth forbes    d february      earl of marchmount contra home thus in an infeftment of annualrent reaching two tenements diligence done against the one or payment made by the debtor saves prescription as to both which was found though the annualrent was constitute upon the two tenements by two different sasines stair gosford    d june      lord balmerino contra hamilton the like in a thirlage of omnia grana crescentia established by writ where it was found that the defender having grinded a part of his corns at the mill to which he was thied this was sufficient to support the astriction for the whole though there was a desuetude as to some particulars comprehended in the writ above the space of forty years durie    june      lord of waughton contra home all which tend to show that there is no such thing as a distinct prescription of the consequences different from that of the right itself all tends to this point the right itself falling it falls with all its consequences the right itself being supported it is supported with all its consequences it follows also as a plain consequence of the same principle that if a creditor take document upon his bond by receiving payment of any years annualrent or any part of the principal sum this must be a good interruption not only as to the principal sum itself but as to all preceding annualrents because the right is thereby supported which supports all its consequences and so it was determined stair    july      blair contra blair this decision indeed was thereafter altered   th february      inter eosdem and the quite contrary found upon this reasoning that though payment either of the principal or annualrent does interrupt prescription of a bond as to the principal sum yet the annualrent being annua praestatio every year does infer a distinct obligation and every distinct years annualrent does prescribe by forty years silence so that the payment of the subsequent annualrent or a part of the principal does not interrupt the prescription of any single bygone years annualrent if there was no pursuit upon that years annualrent during the course of prescription i cannot persuade myself that this is just reasoning the error seems to lie here that every years annualrent is considered as a distinct principal obligation not depending upon or consequential to the right whereby the principal sum is established whereas it is as direct a consequence of the right of credit as the penalty is or any other accessory stipulation to try this reasoning let us examine where it will carry us the obligation for annualrent is a distinct principal obligation therefore it is not interrupted by document taken upon the right for the principal sum therefore   do of necessary consequence it prescribes not with the principal sum but has its own separate prescription and so though a bond be cut off by a forty years negligence all the annualrents within the forty years may yet be demanded expressly contrary to the above text of the civil law founded in the most solid principles to sum up this dispute the whole comes here if annualrent be a distinct principal independent obligation it must have a separate prescription from that of the principal sum whereby the principal sum may be prescribed while the bygone annualrents remain due and prescription of the principal sum may be interrupted without interrupting the other if annualrent be an accessory a consequence depending upon and flowing from the jus crediti established by the bond and contract in the pursuers person which it unquestionably is both the above positions must be wrong prescription of the one must cut off the other and interruption of the one support the other equally as in the case of infeftment of annualrent established over two tenements or against two debitors and yet payment by one debtor or out of one tenement is just as distinct a prestation from the payment made by the other debtor or out of the other tenement as the prestation of annualrent is distinct from that of the principal sum or penalty  having premised these principles it is time now to take a view of the decisions relative to this point and   mo a liferentrix having lived many years after her husbands decease without demanding her annuity in an action at her representatives instance for the annuities falling due within the years of prescription the lords found that there being no action intented for payment of the liferent for forty years after the husbands decease the right of liferent and the pursuers claim thereupon was prescribed forbes   th july      steuart contra the children of cuming of pitoullie but in a simular case of a bond of pension granted to an advocate the bond had lien over forty years without any thing done upon it yet the bygone pensions falling due within the years of prescription were decerned to be paid to the creditors representative upon this footing that every years pension was a separate obligation and run a different course of prescription  july    0 lockhart contra duke of gordon these two decisions hang not well together the first seems to be well founded there is also a text in the roman law which runs counter to our doctrine it is l     c de praescript  0 vel  0 ann in his etiam promissionibus vel legatis vel aliis obligationibus quae dationem per singulos annos vel menses aut aliquod singular tempus continent tempora memoratorum praescriptionum non ab exordio talis obligationis sed ab initio cujusque anni vel mensis vel alterius singularis temporis computari manifestum est the mistake with submission seems still to lie here that every terms prestation is considered as a distinct principal independent right equally as if granted by different persons at different times in different deeds which is plainly a wrong conception of the matter all these different prestations are the effects of one cause sciz the right established in the creditors person by the legacy promise or other legal deed the right here is as much unicum and individuum as any that contains but one single prestation the unity of the right depends upon the unity of the contract where the deed is one which it always must be when done unico contextu by a single act of the binding faculty the right established thereby must be simple and one though complex in its performance for example an obligation to pay ten pound is one simple obligation though it may be implemented by distinct performances of partial payments it is the same though the performance be stipulated originally to be at different times such as a stipulation for annualrent or other annual prestation which difference of time in the performance does no more infer different or distinct obligations than the obligation to build a house which must necessarily take up time in the performance or any right of servitude such as common pasturage all of which are performed successively in time and yet are funditus cut off by the disuse of bare forty years let us further illustrate this matter by the consideration of a tack which though containing mutual and different prestations both as to kind and time is yet one contract one right in the contracters the matter then comes here if the right itself be cut off by prescription sciz the legacy or contract the annual prestations flowing therefrom and depending upon it must cease of consequence  to sift this matter to the bottom being of importance let us examine what further may be said in favors of this distinction betwixt the prescription of annualrents and other yearly prestations inferred from comparing these two laws of the codex together if it be contended to ly here that the principal sum falling the accessory annualrent cannot stand whereas in other annual prestations there is no principal obligation to which they may be referred as accessories but each prestation is a separate principal the answer is it is true that after the principal sum is extinguished no annualrents can begin to exist but as to the annualrents due before the prescription run out there is no such connection as to infer that they must fall because the principal falls the solid reason is that there is a right in the creditor antecedent in the order of our ideas to the respective claims of both principal and annualrent from which right these claims flow are consequences of and depend upon to claim is to act and all legal action presupposes a right in the actor which makes it legal it is this right which suffers the negative prescription and it being done away there is nothing left to support a claim either for principal or annualrent the very same way in other annual prestations a bond of pension for example there is an antecedent right that supports every respective years claim which being extinguished these claims must all fall at once if it be alleged that every years claim arises from a separate independent right which arises annually let it be considered that time alone cannot make a right to exist if it did not exist before it cannot begin now by the force of time alone the pension is one arising from one consent one act of the binding faculty even as much as a right to a sum bearing annualrent is one or a right of pasturage or to oblige a person ad factum prestandum which requires a course of time to performance or even as a right of property which involves many powers and prestations differing in kind as well as time to show that a bond of pension is one right though containing the performance of many years let us consider the difference betwixt that case and a different bond for every years pension renewed annually in the last case a right arises and falls every year and all the different bonds are quite independent and unconnected whereas in the other case a right arose upon subscription of the bond which subsisted equally and uniformly through all the years it was designed to last and fell not until running out of the last year   do if such a pension be not allowed to be one right it will be difficult to show that one years pension is one right which is equally divisible as  00 years are into months and days and so on to infinitum  to fortify this let us apply to the natural notions of mankind whether they are not apt to consider a right obtained by one consent in one deed as one whether of judging of ones own neglect he does not take it from forbearing to pursue upon the deed the contract without dreaming to distinguish the particular prestations therein  thus as to the negative prescription of annual prestations these two conclusions appear to be well founded   mo that the right itself falling by prescription it must fall with all its accessories and consequences   do that any document taken upon the right according to act      c    as it does preserve the right itself so of necessity it must preserve all the accessories and consequences  hitherto of annual prestations where the right itself is prescribable there remains still behind another branch to be discussed sciz where the right itself is not prescribable which is the noted case of teind feuduty etc in this case though the right itself fall not by disuse or dereliction yet it is our constant practice to cut down the bygones preceding  0 years thus i say stands our law but if one shall go accurately to inquire into the reason it will not be found so obvious the footing i apprehend it is generally taken upon is that every years prestation is a different right which of consequence must have a different course of prescription but this i acknowledge i never could conceive and that it is a wrong conception of the matter is pretty fully explained above it is obvious in all such cases though the prestations arise annually yet there must be a right antecedent in the order of our ideas which supports each of these prestations and upon which each years claim is founded which right is as much unicum and individuum as any right can be that supports but one single performance to take a closer view of this in the matter of teinds in which indeed every years prestation bids as fair for being a distinct right as any one that can be exemplified it is obvious in the first place that vicarageteind has never been taken upon that footing otherwise it could never suffer a total negative prescription which it unquestionably does and it is plain that parsonageteind is as much jus unicum and individuum as vicarage   do parsonageteind is apparently considered as jus unicum and individuum without which it could never be carried by the positive prescription were it otherwise possession of parsonageteinds for  0 years might well exclude a demand for bygones upon the footing that the fructus are bona fide percepti and consumpti but could give no right for time to come because no right can be carried by prescription but that individually upon which the possession was founded the conclusion of all is that if a right to parsonageteinds be a jus unicum and individuum prescription must run against it totally or not at all if the right fall it must fall with its consequences if it stand it must stand with its consequences  after the same manner the right to feuduties is jus unicum and individuum the right itself can never prescribe being inherent in the superiority which again being a right to lands can never suffer the negative prescription the like of tackduties which are constituted in one contract established by one consent one bargain  it is extremly true that in these examples there has been neglect disuse and dereliction all that is necessary in the common cases to found the negative prescription but quid inde to say that the negative prescription in any particular case runs not is in other words to say that the law restores him against his neglect disuse and dereliction therefore the personal objection of prescription lies not against him therefore he can insist upon his right quandocunque and if he can insist upon his right he can insist upon it as it stands and as it stood from the beginning for prescription alters not the nature of rights transforms them not into other shapes it cuts them down simply or allows them to stand simply thus in the case of feuduty since the right of superiority prescribes not neither can the claim for the feuduties whether against the vassal or against the ground which claim is inherent in the superiority essential to it and therefore not to be divided from it  if now the matter be put upon this footing that by the law of nature all sorts of rights fall by the negative prescription and among the rest right to lands and teinds and that our law when it restores proprietors against this prescription does it not totally but only as to bygones within  0 years and in time to come the difficulty is   mo that this is but an arbitrary scheme for taking the thing in this view it appears more reasonable that the prescription should be allowed to run with respect to the whole bygones from the present time for truly the neglect and dereliction would infer so much equally as in the case of a bond bearing annualrent in which the annualrents within  0 years fall by prescription as well as the bond itself and when we take a view of the reason why right to lands falls not by prescription the objection will appear in a stronger light a man by our law is restored to his property where it is not acquired to another by positive prescription because the former proprietor is in a more favorable case than the fisk or first occupier but there is no reason he should be restored to bygones seeing liberation is more favorable than obligation especially taking along that neglect on the one side without bona fides on the other is sufficient in the negative prescription if then this scheme come out to any thing it must come out thus that property in lands is lost by the negative prescription as well as other rights whereby all its consequences and accessories fall of course but that our law ob favorem gives back the property as by a new right unless it has been acquired to another by prescription   do there is another strong objection against the scheme which cuts off the bygones only preceding  0 years which is that as the law is supposed to restore the proprietor to the bygones within  0 years because of his neglect with respect to these of an older date it must follow that if he has purged his neglect by uplifting any years duty within the  0 years such a document taken upon his right must be an interruption even as to bygones for  0 years preceding the date thereof now this will scarce be allowed the contrary is the received scheme sciz that every years prestation runs a distinct course of prescription and therefore that the uplifting of one years duty will not save another  considering this matter in all its different lights the most rational footing it can be put upon seems to be that the refusing action upon annual prestations preceding  0 years does not at all arise from prescription but from a quite different foundation the law introduces a presumption that every man will demand what is due to him at least within  0 years and that if he delays longer it is because payment has already been made i am the more satisfied with this from what i see in durie   th december      lord of gairntully contra commissary of st andrews where a feuduty being demanded after  0 years it was found that this being a debt owing by the defenders own chaer he could not propone prescription against the ame but the lords thought it expedient that the pursuer should restrict his libel to the feuduties arising within the last  0 years if this scheme hold it will follow that the pursuer has access in this case to refer to the defenders oath that the duties even preceding the  0 years are still resting owing which as above set forth he has no access to do in the proper prescription and thus prescription in cases of this kind is precisely of the same nature with the quinquennial prescription of tackduties etc and triennial prescription of merchant accounts etc none of which truly are of the nature of the proper prescription they found not a personal objection against the pursuer upon the medium of neglect or dereliction they are nothing else but a presumption introduced by law that the debt is satisfied which has this effect to throw the onus probandi upon the pursuer that the debt is still resting owing  thus far upon the question with relation to rights that fall not by prescription whether at least they should not fall as to bygones preceding forty years we proceed now to another question with relation to teinds in particular why they should not fall totally by the negative prescription it is laid down by lord stair in his institutions    hujus tituli that a right to teinds may be prescribed as well as other rights by forty years possession but that a right to bygone teinds being founded in public law prescribes not except as to bygones before forty years thus in our law teinds are subject to the positive but not negative prescription yet it must be acknowledged that the reason given here for the difference is not quite satis ying all rights are founded in public law as well as teinds besides that public law has no more relation to the negative than positive prescription to take this matter from the beginning it is obvious that before the reformation while teinds were the patrimony of the church and not alienable they were in no view prescriptable as being extra commercium just as much as the res sacrae sanctae and religiosae among the romans but the case differed after the abolition of popery teinds continuing no longer the patrimony of the church they were erected into temporal lordships gifted away to particular persons and now plainly in commercio it is true they continue still burdened with a competent provision to ministers so far as that burden goes they are still extra commercium and consequently not prescriptable but as for the interest the laity have in teinds it is perhaps not easy to account why that interest should not suffer the negative as well as positive prescription let us suppose the case that a person who is titular of his own teinds disposes upon the same by way of sale the purchaser forbears during forty years to insist upon his contract it does not appear why the contract should not fall by prescription and of consequence the right to the teindduties nor is it any way repugnant that the same teinds should yet continue to be a subsisting subject liable to the burden of the ministers stipend because as above laid down prescription gives only an exstrinsick exception against the pursuer claiming but operates not an extinction of the right claimed i have formerly thought that teind is a landright and therefore suffers not the negative prescription but this is not just teinds are a burden upon land just as an infeftment of annualrent is and if the negative prescription should take place the consequence would be a liberation only not a transference of property were a right to teinds to be considered not as a jus unicum and individuum but a separate principal independent right as to every distinct years teindduty the matter would be expedite but this is not so as is endeavored to be made out above and truly after all since a right to teinds is acquirable by prescription which supposes it a jus unicum and individuum it appears a fair consequence that it should be lost the same way  as to the negative prescription of viccarageteinds there is a remarkable decision observed by fountainhall    july      lord of grant contra mintosh where it is held that viccarage of lint hemp milk etc does totally prescribe non utendo for forty years which holds true in general with respect to all species except calves lambs and wool and the reason given for the exception is because these commonly pay viccarage in all places and therefore as to these cessation of payment liberates only from all years above forty the author adds that the same had been found before earl of panmuir and the heritors of inverness as also the parson of prestonhaugh and his parishioners and as to roots it was then lately decided between gib in suttiesmyre in aberdeen and burnet where roots and herbs were found not liable in viccarage unless they had been in use of paying the teind within these forty years and on the  0 june      minister of elgin contra his parishioners the lords found that yards in elgin belonging to the canons of old should not pay viccarige because free forty years back and past all memory unless he would prove payment either out of their or any other the canons portions within that time to the church this decision seems to introduce a distinction amongst the different species that pay viccarage teind sciz ordinary such as calves lambs and wool which prescribe not extraordinary containing all the other species which do prescribe if this hold it must be taken in a limited sense what is laid down by lord stair tit teinds   sciz that viccarageteinds are local according to the custom of the benefice or parish and thus subjects that ordinarily pay viccarage are upon the same footing with parsonageteinds neither of them subject to the negative prescription  discharges and liberations are not capable of the negative prescription they relate not to the constitution of a right but to the ultimate conclusion and performance thereof they cannot therefore be lost non utendo because not designed to have any further operation thus decreets of valuation and sale of teinds prescribe not fountainhall forbes  th june    0 lady cardross contra graham because such decreets are not an establishment of a right of teinds but a liberation therefrom and in mutual declarators of thirlage and immunity the one founding on an old charter the other on a posterior contract giving power to the party whose lands had been thirled by the charter to build a mill on his own ground it was found that though he had not built any for upwards of a  00 years yet this liberty was not lost by prescription fountainhall forbes   th march   0  lord newmains contra lord of bimerside  as to exceptions which are reckoned perpetual according to the brocard temporaneae ad agendum sunt perpetua ad excipiendum the following distinction will clear the matter if the exception be founded upon some right in the defenders person it can last no longer than the right subsists but if founded upon discharges liberations or such like it must be perpetual thus the exception of payment can never prescribe because it is a liberation but compensation does prescribe with the defenders claim upon which it is founded for there can be no compensation after the debt is extinguished by payment or prescription in this view i cannot tell if the decision forbes   th june      sinclair contra murray be well founded the case was in an action of count and reckoning the defender proponed compensation upon two receipts in which the pursuer acknowledged the receipt of money from the defender and obliged himself to allow the same at counting replied for the pursuer the receipts are prescribed it was answered that discharges or receipts affording ground of defense only and which the receiver cannot found upon till he be pursued are perpetua ad excipiendum and cannot prescribe which was found relevant  prescription though not an intrinsic or real exception is of that sort of personal exceptions which are drawn from the circumstances of the pursuer denying him the jus agendi for this reason it may not only be pled upon by the debtor himself who is liberate thereby but by all others having interest in the question and thus in a competition betwixt two assignies to an adjudication the second assigny was allowed to propone prescription against the first assigny whereby his came to be the preferable right    november      mr alexander fraser contra hector mackenzie  of the positive prescription a habile title ever presumes bona fides without examining into the right of the disponer providing only there be any room for the supposition that the subject possibly might have been his thus forty years possession with a title from a subject was found sufficient to establish a fair though the king alone can constitute fairs it being a possible supposition that the right was originally derived from the king to the disponer stair  d december      farquharson contra earl of aboyn and a bishops charter disposing of a salmonfishing with forty years possession was sustained as a good right notwithstanding that salmonfishing is inter regalia because the bishop might have got a grant from the king stair    th january    0 brown contra town of kirkcudbright  by the roman law the authors possession acceded to that of the singular successor to complete usucapion providing the author was in bona fide see voet h t    but in my opinion though to the positive prescription a continued bona fides is necessary yet there ought to be an exception in the case of a bona fide purchaser who should be allowed to reckon upon his authors possession though it be found afterward that he has been in mala fide and could not acquire to himself by prescription the reason is that dereliction is sufficient to cut off the former proprietor and the present possessor who has bought bona fide is in as favorable situation as if his author had been also a bona fide possessor and consequently ought reasonably to be preferred to the former proprietor and much more to the king or first occupier  as to the title necessary in the positive prescription found that sasines upon hasp and staple having no other warrant but the clerk of the burgh his assertion are not a sufficient title for prescription as not contained in the act of parliament      which mentions sasines upon retours charters and precepts of clareconstat but no word of hasp and staple so that acts of parliament being strictissimi juris are not to be extended and these being omitted it must be presumed to be casus de industria omissus and not per incuriam fountainhall  0th june      administrators of heriots hospital contra hepburn were this law there could be no such thing as prescription in burgage holdings to be sure this could never be the intention of the act it is true correctory laws are strictissimi juris and not to be extended but the subject of this act is of another nature it has its foundation in the original laws as well as in the laws of other countries and therefore reasonably may be extended to all similar cases upon which considerations the contrary was found forbes    th november and    th december   0  ker contra abernethy in other cases a sasine without a warrant not bearing to proceed upon a retour or precept of clare constat is no title of prescription stair   st january      fraser contra hog but a procuratory of resignation with a sasine relative thereto was found a sufficient title for prescription though the precept was wanting fountainhall  0 th june      administrators of heriots hospital contra hepburn in the positive prescription founded upon the possession of heirs it is sufficient to produce the naked sasine without either the precepts of clareconstat or retours upon which they are founded stair gosford    th february      earl of argyle contra lord mnaughton but at the same time it was found that the sasine of an heir who did not himself possess the whole space of forty years never being renewed in his successors who all of them continued to possess as apparent heirs was no sufficient title for prescription stair ibid fountainhall    th june    0 earl of queensberry contra earl of anandale but it appears to be without controversy where the original right itself is produced that the bare possession of the heir without sasine is sufficient because here the right has been possessed upon  0 years which is sufficient for prescription  whether usucapion can proceed upon the title pro haerede is a celebrated question in the roman law which the roman lawiers themselves seem to have differed about and is not at all cleared up by their commentators this question because of its very great import in our practice must be considered at large to begin pomponius l   pro haerede seems to lay down in general that usucapion in this case may proceed his words are plerique putaverunt si haeres sim and putem rem aliquam ex haereditate esse quae non sit posse me usucapere upon his side are ranged l   eod and julian l      de usurp and usucap  on the other hand the famous papinian

excludit veluti cum sciens alienum illum illo vel precario possedit quamvis enim precarium haeredem ignorantem non teneat nec interdicto recte conveniatur tamen usucapere non poterit quod defunctus non potuit idem juris est cum de longa possessione quaeritur neque enim recte defendetur cum exordium ei bonae fidei ratio non tueatur and there are who follow him the emperor antoninus l   c usucap

justum non habuit haeredi bonorum possessori licet ignoranti possessio non prodest quod nostra constitutio similiter and in usucapionibus observari constituit ut tempora continuentur  the commentators to reconcile these texts in appearance so opposite take a method but too frequent amongst them they recur to distinctions and if they can be so happy to make these distinctions square with the words of the text they are very little solicitous about the spirit and meaning and thus they cut the gordian knot instead of loosing it they rarely proceed to the examination whether their distinctions are founded in principles or in reason and yet this is the only point worthy the canvassing i am for from saying this is always the case it must be acknowledged we owe a great deal to the commentators for the lights they have afforded in clearing up the roman law yet it cannot have escaped any intelligent reader that this observation does not altogether want a foundation and the example to be here given is a notable instance of it  to reconcile these texts the doctors make this distinction sciz whether the defuncts possession was vicious or bona fide by any lawful title such as commodatum depositum precario or such like they hold that if the defuncts possession was vicious there can be no usucapio pro haerede but if bona fide that is if the defunct possessed as colonus commodotarius etc the subject so possessed by the defunct may be acquired absolutely by the heir upon this title usucapio pro haerede see vinnius ad dict    institut de usucap voet ad pandect t pro haered   that this distinction does by no means agree with the spirit and meaning of the above cited texts will appear almost upon the first reflection and that it is not founded in principles we shall endeavor to show hereafter besides the misfortune is in this case that it does not even agree with the words papinian says expressly in dict l    tamen usucapere non poterit quod defunctus non potuit compare also dict l ult c usucap pro haerede  in the midst of so much obscurity what light shall we find among all the authorities abovecited papinian is the single writer who gives a reason for his opinion says he there can be no usucapio pro haerede quia haeres in jus omne defuncti succedit and ignoratione sua defuncti vitia non excludit which is in other words that the heir is the same person with the defunct and therefore cannot be in a better situation than him this i confess i could never thoroughly comprehend an heir indeed is thus far the same person with the defunct that he is liable for all his debts and succeeds in all his rights but it was never imagined that an heir is the same person with the defunct with respect to any purely personal quality or property good or bad if the defunct has committed a crime the heir is not the same person in any sense to be liable as the criminal if the defunct was a tutor the heir represents him qua debtor not qua tutor the same way if the defunct was in mala fide that is a personal property wherein the heir represents him not the heir may well be supposed in bona fide though the mala fides of his predecessor be ever so certain and this papinian himself does allow in the text giving an instance of it in the case of precarium  let us examine what light we can have from principles it must be obvious from the nature of prescription that the title real or putative to which the possessor ascribes his possession must be in its nature absolute and exclusive thus the title pro emptore is an absolute exclusive title for this good reason that the same subject cannot totally belong to two at once there cannot be prescription against a right which is compatible and consistent with the right upon which the prescriber founds therefore a right of a wadset or of a feu acquired by prescription does no more exclude the reverser or superior than the purchase of them does from the true proprietor to apply this let us consider if at all or in what cases the title pro haerede is an absolute exclusive title at first view it is plainly an absolute and exclusive title as to all competing heirs if one person be sole heir to the defunct which is always implied in a service where but one is mentioned no other person can be heir thus far then there may be an usucapio pro herede his bona fides with the putative title of being sole heir will support him in the right after having possessed during that course of time the law requires let us next consider how this title stands with respect to the debts and deeds of the defunct as to these it must be allowed that it is far from being an absolute exclusive title an heir qua such is liable to and burdened with all the debts and deeds of the person whom he represents and therefore the title pro herede is so far from being exclusive in this case that in reality it implies this burden just as much as a wadset implies a reversion or a feu the right of superiority this brings it to the same as if the debts and deeds of the predecessor were every one of them specified in the heirs right in this case therefore the heir can have no bona fides no security the debts and deeds of his predecessor he must ever lay his account to answer  if this hold and upon a review i cannot find but it is solid the distinction above laid down by the commentators must fall to the ground as without any foundation if the defuncts possession was as colonus or commoditarius the action locati conducti or commodati competent against him must be good against his heir for ever until they fall by the negative prescription it is true the heir may believe that the subject belonged to the defunct in property but then it is not every vague opinion any how taken up that will found the bona fides necessary for prescription it must be a solid belief founded upon good reason an heir can never have a solid bona fides as to any subject descending to him from the defunct for ought he knows it may belong to another no body has told him otherwise it may be given or promised away it may be burdened with debt the very title of heir obliges him to submit to all these chances which as above laid down effectually excludes that security that bona fides which is absolutely necessary in every acquisition by prescription it must be obvious then that this distinction betwixt a bona fide and vicious possession can signify nothing at all as to the question in hand  it being thus laid down that usucapio pro haerede is well founded where the competition is among heirs but that it cannot obtain against the debts and deeds of the predecessor let us in the next place examine what the texts above cited say as to this distinction the l    diverse and temporal prescript l   and ult c usucap pro haered and    institut usucap relate all of them solely to the second branch of the distinction and the authors have nothing in view but the debts and deeds of the predecessor in these texts where they declare against the usucapio pro haerede the l      cited upon the other side of the question plainly relates to the first branch of the distinction the words are hoc amplius si justam causam habuerit existimandi se haeredem vel bonorum possessorem domino extitisse fundum pro haerede possidebit the l ult pro haered may well be understood of the same case so there remains none that requires an answer save l   pro haered plerique putaverunt si haeres sim and putem rem aliquam ex haereditate esse quae non sit posse me usucapere this text it is obvious can have little weight either way it carries little more than an insinuation that the lawiers differed upon this head but if it be matter of conscience with any one to have implicit faith in every one of the roman lawiers for a further answer let him consult heineccius ad pandectas t pro haered who understands this text of cases like the following where for example a foreign sheep has fallen in with a flock that is in hereditate jacente which therefore may be acquired by the heir possessing pro haerede bona fide however though it should be allowed that in this case usucapio proceeds the explanation does not much satisry me pomponius is there speaking in general and it is hard therefore to suppose that he meant only of a particular case  according to the doctrine here laid down there must be a great difference with respect to the two sorts of positive prescription established in our law sciz that of heirs and that of original purchasers the last gives security against all mortals the other gives no security against the debts and deeds of the predecessor  it remains only to be mentioned that the usucapio pro haerede so far as it relates to the competition among heirs is established in our law by act      cap    and a time fixed much shorter than the ordinary course of prescription for it statutes that no retour shall be reduceable after twenty years sir george mackenzie in his observations upon this act gives his opinion that this prescription of twenty years militates only in cases of competition betwixt the several kinds of heirs among themselves as whether the heir of line should be preferred to the heir of taillie but it does not exclude the clear interest of blood for jura sanguinis nullo jure civili dirimi possunt l   de reg jur and therefore an elder brothor was found to have good interest to reduce a second brothers retour    th january      lamb contra anderson this observation does not appear to have any foundation in the act which talks in general of the righteous heir and nearest of kin and thus it was found   th july   0  lady edinglassie contra lord of powrie observed by fountainhall that this act does relate mainly to erroneous services where a remoter heir is retoured in prejudice of a nearer but that it does not found heirs served to quarrel their own retours upon minority and lesion or such like seeing minority and lesion was a ground of reduction before that act and needed no new law as for the decision lamb contra anderson when it is looked into it holds forth no such distinction the case there was that a younger brother had served heir while the elder was out of the country and the dispute turned solely upon this the elder brother having returned with in the twenty years and dying soon after the lapse thereof without intenting an actual reduction of his brothers retour whether the eldest brothers creditor who had charged him to enter heir within the twenty years and adjudged could have access to the lands here it was not called into controversy but that if the heir had died abroad without making any motion against his brothers retour the retour would have stood good it was only contended that the heirs return with the charge against him to enter was equivalent to a reduction of the brothers retour which the lords found sir george has a second observation upon this act his words are by this act though such retours may be reduced in prejudice of persons so served yet if the persons so served have disponed their right to singular successors having bona fide acquired rights as said is they cannot be prejudged and in our law this is still introduced for the good of commerce in favors of singular successors for how should they know that the retour was reducible were this observation founded in the act it would give a security to purchasers and in my opinion a reasonable one that our law as yet is not acquainted with it is no where held forth in general that onerous purchasers are safe against all latent claims all of these they stand exposed to that from their nature are good against singular successors and this among others our legislature has indeed rectified this in some measure by several salutary laws among these the act of prescription makes the greatest figure it has further introduced registers and appointed several kinds of rights to be registered under this certification that otherwise they shall not be good against singular successors but there are many rights still behind not appointed to be registered and many more that from their nature cannot admit of it of which this in hand is an example all of these are good against purchasers let us examine what the act says as to this the words are it is always declared that these presents shall nowise be prejudicial to whatsoever persons who have acquired rights of lands and heritages before the date hereof bona fide from persons already retoured thereto in any time bygone but the said persons who have bona fide acquired shall bruik their rights according to the law then standing the meaning of this is extremely obvious the law referred to is parl      c    by which it was introduced that retours should be unquarrellable after three years both with respect to the inquest and the person served this was altered by the present act so far as relates to the person served who must now run a course of twenty years prescription this alteration being made it remained to be considered what should become of those who had purchased bona fide after three years from persons standing infeft upon retours enjoying the privileges of the former law the resolution upon this was obvious that they must be secure seeing the persons from whom they purchased were secure by the said triennial prescription sir george in the above citation understands this clause as a privilege introduced in general in favors of singular successors both who had acquired and who should acquire thereafter there needs little other argument against this but the clause itself upon which he founds his observation which in express terms restricts this declaration to singular successors who had purchased before the date of this present act that purchasers from the nature of the thing are not secure against this reduction will be clear   mo because this reduction is not personal against the defender but real in the subject the righteous heir coming up claims the subject as his own and the person retoured cannot stand in his way having no right established in the subject till after the course of the twenty years prescription in short it is not properly a right reducible but null till it be established by prescription which is the common nature of rights to which the positive prescription is necessary and therefore a purchaser from a person erroneously retoured can be no more safe within the years of prescription than any one who purchases a non domino   do this is plainly the opinion of the legislature in the above cited clause protecting the purchasers only from those whose retours become irreduceable by prescription   tio were purchasers from heirs absolutely secure a principio against this reduction no good reason could be given why this reduction should be limited to twenty years rather than the common period of forty whereas upon the supposition that purchasers are not secure till after the lapse of twenty years there is an exceeding good reason for it one buys from an heir seeing a sufficient good progress for forty or fifty years bygone this gives him tolerable good security unless with respect to this reduction at the instance of a nearer heir it would be hard in this case to leave him open and insecure for the course of a second forty years in a word a shorter prescription than twenty years would be hard upon the righteous heir a longer would be hard upon purchasers  whether the kings annexed property be extra commercium so as not to be carried by prescription is a dispute our lawiers seem not perfectly agreed in sir james steuart in answer to dirletons doubts voce prescription thinks it cannot sir george mackenzie in his institutions is of the same mind yet this author in his observations upon the act anent prescription observation   seems to be of a different opinion as also dirleton voce prescription against the king who gives this remarkable reason for it that the positive prescription is introduced not so much odio and negligentia non petentis as favore possidentis which says he is the same with relation to the king as to another lord stair seems also to favor this side of the question holding that this act runs against the king as well as the subject without making any distinction    hujus tituli when we consider the act itself there seems to be little room for doubting that the kings annexed property may be carried by the positive prescription statuting that whosoever shall possess upon heritable titles peaceably during the space of forty years shall not be troubled pursued or inquieted by his majesty or others upon any ground reason or argument competent of law excepting falsehood and as a strong fortification of this it must be noticed that in act    parl      the prescriptability of annexed property is directly taken for granted yet after all there is a decision observed by fountainhall    february      kings advocate contra lord of livingstoun that looks as if our lords were of opinion that the annexed property is not prescribable it is to this purpose that a right of servitude even upon the kings property may be acquired by prescription it not being annexed property there is another decision observed by lord stair that looks the same way   february      fergusson contra parishioners of kingarth  in our practice the positive prescription is extended to other rights besides lands which have charter and sasine for their title and so a tack null as being set without consent of the patron was found validated and unquarrellable by forty years possession stair gosford   july      parson of prestounhaugh contra his parishoners the like stair   february      robertson contra arbuthnot stair   july      college of aberdeen contra earl of northesk fountainhal    june      earl leven contra parishoners of kennoway and markinsh but as to this matter there is no small difficulty every man is presumed to know the law and therefore to know that a tack of teinds set without consent of the patron is not good so that here there can be no title no bona fides for prescription but possibly these decisions may be defended upon the footing of the negative prescription the action of reduction of the tack being lost non utendo if it be not said that the tacks were simply null and needed no reduction  a possessor cannot prescribe contrary to the terms of his own right for this would not only be a prescription without a title or bona fides but even directly contrary to both thus nothing can be acquired by prescription without the limits of a bounding charter hence the decision must be wrong recorded by hope tit fishing    december      forbes contra lady monimusk where a forty years possession of salmond fishing upon both sides of the water was sustained though the possessor was only infeft in a salmond fishing upon one side of the water  where the title is general whereby it is dubious whether the subject be disponed or not the forty years possession has two effects   mo it ascertains the dubious clause and infers the presumption that the subject in question was intended to be disponed and to be comprehended under the general clause   do it bestows the property in consequence of that title where the subject flowed a non domino thus a charter with a general clause cum piscationibus with forty years possession was sustained as to a salmond fishing stair    january      heritors of don contra town of aberdeen stair   december      brown contra town of kirkcudbright here a general clause cum piscationibus is not commonly understood to carry salmond fishing as being inter regalia and therefore unless the posssssion had explained the clause so as to comprehend salmond fishing there could have been no title for prescription but a charter of a barony cum piscationibus needs no possession to explain the clause because a charter of a barony is interpreted in the most extensive sense and therefore carries salmond fishing so that if the disponer be dominus the disponees right is good a principio and in such a case prescription can only be necessary where the right flowed a non habente see stair gosford   february      fullarton contra earl of eglingtoun compared with stair    january    0 brown contra town of kirkcudbright upon the same footing it was that in a reduction at the kings instance against the heritors adjacent to a muir of his majestys patrimony the lords found that not only the heritors whose charters bore the said muir expressly but also even those who only carried the common clause cum communi pastura had a right of servitude on it if they could prove prescription by forty years possession fountainhall    february      kings advocate contra heritors about drumshorling muir  it is upon this same footing that a forty years possession upon the dubious title of part and pertinent infers prescription thus a parcel of ground was found to be acquired by prescription in the person of a singular successor who had no other title thereto save that of part and pertinent and that though the subject had formerly been a separate tenement stair    november      young contra carmichael  0 february      countess of murray contra weems and this was even found in competition with one specially infeft in the subject forbes    february      earl of leven contra finlay and forty years possession of a pasturage upon the title of part and pertinent was found sufficient though a prior tack of the pasturage was produced set by the pursuers predecessors to the defenders predecessors in virtue of which it was alleged the possession of the pasturage began which was not found sufficient to take off the positive prescription stair    november      grant contra grant this decision gives rise to the following considerations if the possession be of a servitude or such as can come under the clause of part and pertinent the presumption is that the possession has followed in virtue of that title but it must be noticed that it goes no further than a presumption there being no proof that the servitude possessed is truly part and pertinent of the lands if there were the defense of prescription would not be necessary to overturn such a presumption then the pursuer must have access to prove that the servitude was not possessed as part and pertinent but by right derived from him a tack for example of this there can be no doubt if the tack was set within the forty years but now let us suppose that the tack was set and run out before the beginning of the prescription will not the presumption lie that the tacksman continued to possess per tacitam relocationem certainly since he began to possess the servitude as a distinct subject and not as part and pertinent it is impossible thereafter that by a bare act of his mind he can forbear to possess as tacksman and resolve for the future to possess upon the footing of part and pertinent nothing less would be necessary than a new grant from some third party besides it was never heard that a resolution did ever found a right in order to prescription before he began to possess the servitude as part and pertinent it is obvious he could not have the least shadow of a title to found him in a prescription and of consequence that private act of the mind could not give him one it is a different case where the tacksman sells his property lands and also the subject set to him in tack as part and pertinent of the lands for in that case the purchaser has a good title to found him in a prescription stair  0 february      countess of murray contra weems  a person grants a wadset who has no title himself the wadsetter possesses forty years the wadsetters right is secure by prescription is the reversers right also secure i answer no because though the wadsetters possession be the reversers possession yet the reverser has no bona fides no titulus praescribendi a habile title may be founded on by the receiver in order to prescription never by the granter otherwise setting a tack qua proprietor might be founded upon by the setter as titulus praescribendi yet in this case prescription was found to run in favors of the reverser as well as wadsetter forbes    june      murray contra maclellan  servitudes are acquired by prescription without any express title in writing some of them by presuming from long possession an antecedent title which not being necessary to be in writing at least in any formal way the writ if any has been may be readily supposed to have fallen by in that time and if there has been only verbal consent it is plain that after the distance of forty years the possession must be the only evidence thereof other servitudes such as paying dry multures are upon a different footing there every act of exercise of the servitude infers a present consent if there has not been one antecedent for it is rational enough to suppose that a man will pay dry multures in subserviency to another mans right already constituted or in order to give a new right but the supposition is quite absurd that a man looking to his own interest and having no other view but to act in his right of liberty would go about to pay dry multure  to complete prescription it is sufficient that the party possess naturally himself or civilly by those deriving right from him thus the liferenters possession was found to be the fiars possession newbyth    november      thomson contra young and porteous for the liferenters possession was her defunct husbands possession from whom it was derived and the defuncts possession was the heirs possession the same will obtain where a right is disponed to one in liferent and another in fie which is plain from this consideration that the possession of the author and singular successor are conjoined to make up prescription when both possess upon the same right  movables differ from lands in the positive prescription in this that forty years possession presumes a title but still it must be competent to the former proprietor to prove there was no title which he does when he proves that the defender or his predecessors stole the thing or that it was lent to them in which view the decision   december      minister and session of aberscherder contra parishoners of gemrie observed by durie is not easy to be accounted for where in a pursuit for a church bell lent by one parish to another the defense upon the positive prescription was sustained by forty years possession without allowing the pursuer to prove the loan  the several cases of non valens agere prescription as has been laid down being the result of neglect and desertion it operates not where the party can assign any just cause of forbearance and therefore    mo prescription runs only from the term of payment not from the date of the bond and therefore a bond being payable to a husband and wife and longest liver etc prescription was not found to run against the wifes liferentright of this sum till after her husbands death because before that time she had no action nor interest stair dirleton gosford    june      gaw contra earl of weems the like with respect to a bond payable after the granters decease stair    june      bruce contra bruce and in general prescription runs against no right till action be once competent upon it because from that period only can neglect or dereliction be dated and yet by an express clause in the act anent the septennial prescription of cautionry obligements prescription runs from the date not from the term of payment maxim invita jurisprudentia fountainhall   december   0  gordon contra cuming    do the most proper case of non valens agere is where the person is barred by an injust forfeiture from following out his right for there can be no neglect where there is no liberty stair    january      duke of lauderdale contra earl of tweedale this was sustained to a party who was abroad in his majestys service during the usurpation and durst not appear under hazard of his life though it was pled that in this case there being no forfeiture the party might have appeared by a procurator sir patrick home january      whiteford contra earl of kilmarnock    tio in some cases it is laudable to forbear action as for example where a woman in decency forbears to pursue her husband and therefore during the time she is clad with a husband prescription runs not against her forbearing to pursue for implement of her contract of marriage stair gilmour   th july      macky contra stuart    to where the circumstances are such that he can have no benefit by acting as for example where a man having in his person two adjudications upon an estate continues to possess upon one of them for upwards of  0 years which is afterward found redeemable the other adjudication in the mean time will not suffer the negative prescription because he was not negligent in not persuing upon it having possessed the whole estate by virtue of the other adjudication and thus a man is never put under a necessity to act when he can have no other view but to stop prescription for prescription being a consequence of neglect if he was not negligent which he is not when he could have no benefit by acting the prescription cannot run it was objected against a defender pleading upon the positive prescription that for some time during the forty years there was a liferent of the subject in question in the person of one of the defenders authors to which liferent the pursuer was consenter and therefore during that time he was non valens agere in respect by no action could he obtain possession and the lords never put parties to the necessity of intenting processes where they can serve to no purpose but to stop prescription

february    0 brown contra hepburn an apparent heir in possession of an estate by singular titles having thereafter purchased in an apprising it was found that the apparent heirs possession did preserve the said apprising from the negative prescription it being pled in the general that where a possessor has many rights in his person all distinct titles of possession prescription cannot run against one of them so long as he keeps possession for what can he demand upon any of these titles but to have the possession which if he already has there can be no occasion for an action but afterward upon a reclaiming bill the lords found no necessity of determining this point having taken it up upon a separate footing    th november      mr alexander frazer contra hector m kenzie the septennial prescription being alleged against a cautionry obligement the charger answered that for a part of the time he had a ground of compensation and so was non valens agere though that ground was never propounded and now was removed this answer was repelled fountainhall forbes    th february      bourbon contra montgomery    to no man can prescrive against himself of this take the following example the estate of paisley etc stood vested in the person of lord cochran tailied to himself and heirs male after his decease his grandfather the earl of dundonald who had no right in his own person granted a difposition of the same estate to the lord cochrans son and his heirs male one of whom above  0 years thereafter altered the destination and conveyed the subject to his daughter the disposition granted by the earl of dundonald being null as a non habente potestatem the estate in consequence was found to be all the while in hereditate jacente of the lord cochran upon which the heir male who had access to make up his titles to the lord cochran after the decease of him who conveyed the subject as said is to his daughter quarrelled the conveyance as being a gratuitous deed by an apparent heir and the forty years positive prescription in consequence of the earl of dundonalds disposition being pled in support thereof the prescription was not found to run in respect that no man can prescrive against himself home    th january      marquis of clydsdale contra earl of dundonald in this case there were no termini habiles for prescription prescription necessarily implies two persons two opposite interests the one in a course of acquiring either property or liberation the other in a course of neglect forbearing to follow out his interest here there was but one person sciz the heir male and no man can be accused of negligence for not following out an action against himself besides no ground of action arose until the disposition was granted to the daughter and the destination to heirs male thereby broke in upon we have then three foundations each of which separately is sufficient to support this decision   mo a man cannot prescribe against himself   do no benefit in pursuing   tio no action until the time the disposition was granted to the daughter  as to interruption of prescription no document taken upon the debt will be sufficient to interrupt the negative prescription unless it be such as is sufficient to interpel the debtor thus registration of a bond is no sufficient interruption but when this is examined it will not be found to square exactly with the principles laid down anent the negative prescription it is obvious that registration alone is sufficient to purge the creditors neglect and when further interpellation of the debtor is found necessary it can be with no other view than to put an end to the bona fide possession of his liberty now this indeed is reasonable as was hinted above but as our practice requires no bona fides in a debtor this interpellation in order to an interruption of the negative prescription seems not to be well founded in principles possibly it may be held that the registration of a bond without going on to interpel the debtor for the space of forty years infers a presumption of some original vitiosity in the bond which barred the creditor from bringing it sooner to light and it may be said that interpellation of the debtor within the forty years is a necessary step to take off this presumption whatever be in this it is plain it cannot be universal for to put the case where the debtor acknowledges upon oath that the debt is just there simple registration ought to be deemed sufficient to interrupt the negative prescription  finis
