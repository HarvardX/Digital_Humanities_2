a short treatise of the virtues of dr batemans pectoral drops the nature of the distempers they cure and the manner of their operation  published by the kings letters patents under the great seal of great britain  the seal of each bottle   any shopkeeper etc may be furnished with these drops with good allowance to sell again directing a letter or sending the carrier to j cluer in bow churchyard who is the only person that sells the same wholesale in london they are also sold wholesale by w dicey in northampton and r raikes in gloucester  the introduction as the universal good of mankind is or at least ought to be as well the particular end of every private member of that large community as the more general aim and ambition of all public societies it consequently follows that all actions designs and inventions tending mediately or immediately to the promoting that great and glorious design must in themselves be essentially good and therefore praiseworthy and to be encouraged and supported by all those who partaking of that nature are in a capacity to receive the benefit and advantage of uch undertakings and if so as there is no blessing in the treasure of providence of so true and inestimable a value as health which as a good ground in a consort of music modulates and forms the variety of sounds into a most agreeable and delightful harmony is the very basis and foundation of all other subordinate pleasures delights and satisfactions so on course the promoting preserving or if lost restoring so precious a jewel must necessarily be one of the principal and most acceptable designs in the latitude of humane application and as such worthy the encouragement and approbation of every one who is desirous of advancing the good of his country without this consideration which nevertheless may be an accidental additional motive that himself may at one time or other probably stand in need of so great and useful a benefit  now of all the numerous train of diseases of all the vast variety of distempers which at any time affect the human system there are none more to be dreaded none hardr to be by art removed and what is worst of all none more epidemical than the gout the rheumatism the stone the jaundice and asthmas not to mention the more accidental though frequently fatal attacts which colds surfeits agues fevers colics pleurisies melancholy rickets and a thousand other distempers arising from crudities flatuities and a thousand other different causes make upon our constitutions each of which if not timely and strongly repelled is sufficient to subvert and at length wholly destroy the order and method of the animal economy and thereby procure our certain hasty and probably unprovided dissolution from the life which it is our great and main care and study to preserve and prolong which repulse can no how better nor more effectually be made than by the speedy application of such remedies as are best calculated to resist break absorb and expel the noxious particles of the morbific matter whose mixture with the particles of the blood and violent attraction of one another causing irregular circulation unequal and languid motion viscid grumes unnatural rarefactions rapid collisions or violent impetus therein or other how altering the quality disturbing the free circulation or disordering the natural texture and moment of that fluid necessary for the support and preservation of health and life do by the means give birth to the most fatal and acute distempers and dispersing themselves and their dire effects through all the vessels and channels of the body do in time if not speedily and vigorously repelled impair corrupt and destroy the solids also and lay the foundation of all those grievous and almost incurable cronic diseases whereof some wretched part or other of mankind is daily and hourly complaining among whom not a few prolong their misery or hasten their end by a tedious unprofitable course of methodical experiments whereby they rather pall and weaken nature than relieve and restore her being resolved as i have often heard them express themselves to dye by the hands of the learned while others out of a contrary prejudice to all means in general perish for want of a timely application of such remedies as the piety learning and industry of some private person inspired with the love of his country and good of mankind has with great pains and labor found out and produced to the world as a more near immediate and effectual preserver and restorer of that health they seem so desirous to obtain yet are so backward and unwilling to procure though by that means attainable with very little trouble and less charge  among which productions for the good of man kind and cheap and easy attaining restoring and preserving of health there never yet has been any thing made known to the world of that prodigious and almost incredible virtue and efficacy as dr batemans pectoral drops which are justly to be preferred to and distinguished from all others for their wonderful and almost infallable effects not only in colds agues fevers colics melancholy and rickets but also in curing those great and implacable enemies of our health and ease the gout rheumatism jaundice stone gravel and astmas but before i can enter upon an explanation of their use and manner of operating in all these several cases i will previous thereto lay before you in short the nature case rise and progress of those distempers whereby you shall yourselves be able to judge of the efficacy of these drops in relieving them in doing whereof i shall not abuse your patience as is too commonly done with improbable conjectures incoherent notions unnatural opinions and fantastical inventions of the ignorant and unlearned pretenders to physic but i shall deliver you the stanch and undoubted judgments decisions and opinions of the best and most approved physicians and philosophers both ancient and modern such as hippocrates serapion averrois galen sydenham radcliffe keil quincey and others of indisputed authority and reputation in the arcana of nature and first of the gout  chap i of the gout this is a distemper of that inveterate and malignant nature as to be a continual foil and reproach to the best physicians of all ages no method of physic diet or habit however regular reasonable and orderly no prescriptions though bearing the specious and plausible sanction of academic graduate and collegate learning being able to give a turn to this distemper or reach its secret recesses for retiring into the extremities of the fine capillary vessels where by reason of the unequal celerity and languid motion of the blood in those parts its venomous particles are suffered to attract one another with great violence it bids defiance to all their art and will oftener yield to one lucky nostrum than all the repeated assaults of what they call regular practice which is never more ineffectual and at a loss than in this case and more especially if that nostrum be prepared as these drops are for such a species of simples as are capable of being rendered by such preparation fit to pierce the very inmost nervous colls increase the impetus of the vital and animal fluids and follow the particles of the morbific matter through all the fine meanders of the blood till having disturbed their attraction and broke them by repeated collisions one against another into the minutest parts it forces most of them through the pores of the body by perspiration obtunding absorbing and carrying the rest away with it in its course till arriving at the kidneys they are secreted there from the blood and pass away by urine all which operations these drops to a miracle perform by virtue of their diaphoretic absorbent and detergent qualities opening at once all the emunctories of the body and forcing off through them the very root and basis of the distemper they are to cure and that this is the only effectual rational method of treating this obstinate distemper the gout i appeal to that great searcher of nature dr sydenham who says whatsoever is assistant in discharging the foul vicious humors out of the body can never fail of answering the intention of cure for which it is designed whether in the gout rheumatism or any other cronic distemper and his authority i should think ought not reasonably to be disputed in the cure of this distemper whom not only a vast stock of acquired learning together with a prodigious natural capacity improved by long and great practice and experience upon others but also a continued and unconquerable gouty habit in his own body confirmed in this opinion that there was no other method of treating this terrible distemper which is also confirmed by what those two admiral physicians dr keile and dr quincey have told us concerning the cause of it which say they is created by the mucilaginous glands in the joints becoming gritty and stiff by means of a sharp acid humor flowing thereon which coagulating the oily liquor secreted by them for lubricating the ends of the bones at their several articulations to render them apt and ready for motion makes it instead of promoting and assisting that motion impeed and prevent it by clogging the interstices so that they cannot move at all at least not without very great pain hardning by degrees into white chalky gritty stones which are forced to be cut or otherwise taken out by art from the joints of the hands and feet of the miserable patient as daily experience manifests  now you are to observe that the particles which compose this sharp acid humor are surrounded with little pointed needles which wound and irritate the vessels through which they move and the very globules of the blood itself beating and coagulating thereby any fluid with which they mix but these being either obtunded and blunted and the points of them as it were sheathed and wrapped up in some of the particles of this medicine or else drove violently against one another with a force sufficiently to break off those little pointed spears and render them capable of flying off by perspiration by others or else so disturbed and separated by this new auxillary force that they cannot attract one another but un willingly disperse themselves in the blood and are many of them secretted and carried off by urine this i say must necessarily answer the intention of cure for by this means they are rendered incapable of irritating loading or coagulating any of the fluids and then on course the distemper before caused by them must by degrees abate and at length absolutely cease to which ends and purposes these drops are so excellently adapted and prepared and are in their nature so very absorbent detergent and diaphoretic that it is morally impossible they should fail of working a cure which can only be performed by the joint operation of those three qualities which are scarce to be met with in any considerable degree in any one medicine in the world but this alone  but perhaps some who understand no more of this distemper than the pain and torture it gives them will say that probably in the former stage of this distemper these drops may be effectual but say they mine is in my stomach bowels etc and they will not be able to reach it there but how weak and trivial an objection this is will appear from a reflection upon this phase of the gout which is only caused by a weakness and debility of nature through frequent debauches hard drinking long courses of useless physic etc whereby the impetus of the blood becomes so weak and languid and its motion so slow and irregular as to permit the morbific particles to attract one another in the blood vessels of those parts which can only be remedied by such things as warm and increase the bloods intestine motion so breaking and disturbing the attraction of the venomous particles and sending them back again to the extreme parts where they are to be treated as before for which purpose nothing in nature can be better fitted than these drops which have such a fine invigorating alexiterial property in them as to render them one of the best cardiacs in the whole materia medica  the dose in the former phase of the distemper is a large spoonful in any warm vehicle as mountain wine strong ale etc made as hot as you can drink it repeated three nights successively going to bed and by the blessing of god you need not fear ease  but in the latter phase where the morbific matter is not only to be repelled but the faint and languid state of nature enlivened and invigorated it is necessary that you increase your dose as the cause may require in any warm vehicle as before composing your self after it and encouraging the sweat by all proper methods  after this in order effectually to rout this most errible enemy it is necessary you continue to take a small dose of about  00 or   0 drops every three nights alternately taking three nights and missing three nights till such time as you find the strength of the distemper to abate which it will sensibly do in a small time and at length quite go off  instances of the cure of this distemper by these drops might be given in great numbers from persons of undoubted credit and reputation on enquiry would satisfy the curious of their wonderful effect in that intention but not being willing to tire the reader and these drops by their continual success so strongly recomending themselves i shall out of a very great multitude only trouble you with a few as you will find at the end of this treatise  chap ii of the rheumatism having in the foregoing chapter been so very particular in describing the origin nature rise progress and cure of the gout there will be the less need of enlarging in this upon a dissemper so near a kin to it as the rheumatism even so near as in many constitutions to be owing to the same cause with this only difference in the effect that as the former preys chiefly upon the joints and extreme parts of the body this for the most part affects the membrana communis musculorum or rather to speak more properly the membrana adeposa at least that part of it which lies between the muscles and the cutis and is the basis or the cellulae adeposae being full of small fine glands for the secretion of that oily sulphurous matter of which the adeps or fat is composed which sulphurous oil being coagulated by the same means says a learned author and from the same causes as the juices of the mucilaginous glands in the joints are in the gout that is to say from the attraction of sharp acid particles secreted from a viscous blood this membrane in which those glandulae adeposae are situated becomes suff harsh and rigid and unapt for motion the oil which those glands continually discharge for lubricating the muscles being all turned by coagulation into a fizey thick jelly so that every time the muscle or muscles round which that part of this membrane is wrapped contract in order to perform muscular motion they are instead of being assisted therein by that lubricating oil impeeded and confined by the stiffness of the coagulum and the rigidity and harshness of the surounding membrance till by force of the nervous fluid flowing into the fibers and extending them in the contraction they force it to give way which is not without great pain and consequent weakness and soreness of that part not to mention the pains caused by the unnatural distentions of the vessels from the quantity of viscid serum obstructing them and hindering the free circulation of the blood especially in the fine capillary channells without a considerable dilatation from whence not seldom proceed astmas pleurisyes peripneumonys inflammations fevers and death  this is only to be remedied by diluents and evacuating medicines as in the gout but not by any common evacuators many or most of which weaken nature too much in their operations and being used without proper diluents will evaprate all the real natural serum and leave nothing but a sort of serous jelly in the blood which thereupon will either immediately stagnate or effervesce in such a manner as to cause a violent putrid fever and without almost a miracle the certain death of the patient it is true they may ease the violent pains of this distemper but if at the same time they increase the inflammation and effervescence of the blood the fever proportionably increases and the poor deluded patient dies as too many do by common practice whereas these drops dilute and expel what is redundant whereby the blood is restored to its natural crasis it is due velocity and impetus recovered the pains cease the fever abates perfect health ensues besides which by their alexiterial cardiac qualities at the same time that they thus increase the impetus and moment of the fluids to the discharge of the morbific matter in prespiration they also warm and comfort the whole nervous sistem assist mightily in repairing the waste of the animal spirits occasioned thereby which is evident in what has been already said of them concerning the gout in the stomach and bowels proceeding from a real weakness and decay of nature  in short no preparation was ever yet found out so suitable to the very nature of this distemper as these drops which will plainly appear from the vast number of certificates of cures wrought by them every week out of which i have thought fit to trouble you with but a few  the dose and manner of ordering your self is the same as before directed in the gout to be varied according to the distempor and strength of the patients constitution from  0 to   0 or  00 drops in any convenient vehicle which need not be so strong and spiritous as in that distemper but must be drank as warm as possible going to bed and covering your self up warm as before  chap iii of the jaundice to give you an exact theory of this distemper would tak up more room than this short treatise will admit of i shall therefore as i have done by the other distempers in the foregoing chapters open it so far to you as to convince you tha these drops are the best specific if i may be indulged tha term in the whole materia medica to break through it is schirrous obstructions and finally eradicate it and all its dreadful symptoms ou of the humane body  this distemper arises from obstructions in the glands of the liver thereby preventing a due secretion of the gall from the blood by them in that viscus which bilious particles circulating therewith gives a yellow tiucture to the mucus or corpus reticulare spread under the cuticula which from thence appears of that color this is the first and common phase of this distemper but it will sometime and more especially in hard drinkers arrive to that height as to cause a frequent spitting and vomiting of blood which is generally reckoned a mortal symptom for it is caused by the obstructions it the hepatie glands becoming schirrous and so indurated as with great difficulty if at all to be opened again which straitens the motion of the blood through that viscus so much as to cause it to revulse with a great motion into the gastrick arteries which go of from the hepatic insomuch that breaking through them it drains into the stomach and by that means the course of that fluid is altered the secretion of the bile at an end and the whole system destroyed so that this latter stage of the distemper is seldom or never to be cured but may easily be prevented by taking the former phase in time powerfully deterging those tartarous obdurating particles ou of the blood which can only be by strong detergents and diaphoreticks which i have already proved to you these drops are and therefore cannot fail of curing if taken in time and followed up till by a continuation they become perfect alteratives and if any thing will cure the latter phase of this distemper these drop will having done wonders in it even when the patients have been given over by their physicians and the distemper baffled their utmos skill  the dose and manner of ordering your self with them is a before directed in the gout  chap iv of the stone and gravel these are one and the same distemper in two several degrees the stone being only concreted gravel and the gravel the matter whereof the stone is formed and in some wha is washed off it by powerful nepritics and lytholutics both of them being in their degree an aggregate of the tartarous particles of the urine pent up by the straitness of the urinary ducts which is only to be cured by dissolving the stone widening and deterging the passages and ridding the blood of those tartarous particles by diaphoretics before the secretion of urine is performed all which several operations these drops perform to a wonder and have by their detergent diuretic quality brought away from several persons stones of the size of a small nut kernel when every other remedy has failed to give them ease and by being continued afterward have cleansd the blood of its tartarous particles so as to prevent another fit for many years  the dose is as in the gout in a cup of white wind posset drink old hock green tea or any other potent diuretic made very warm and sweetened with an ounce of syrup of mashmallows going to bed immediately on taking them and they give ease instantly  chap v of asthmas the prodigious variety of causes from whence this distemper proceeds in different constitutions gives it so many various species and degrees as to render it one of the most difficult disorders to be skilfully managed of any affecting the human system but the chief sorts are the humid the dry and the nervous asthma of each of which i will separately give a few hints concerning their causes and systems and then proceeding to the description of the effects of these drops in all those intentions  but first it is necessary to premise what an asthma is in general that it is a frequent difficult and short respiration or breathing joined with a hissing sound and a cough especially in the night in cold weather and in a prone posture or lying down the former because the pressure of the atmosphere is greater in the night than in the day when the noxious vapors are exhaled and dispeld by the force of the sun beams in the night by reason of the pores of the body being contracted by the circumambient cold our transpiration is lessened and consequently a gravedo or weight of perspirable matter ensues which being flung upon the lungs clogs them and renders them less apt to perform their office and in the last case from the pressure which the contents of the abdomen when the body is in that posture make upon the diaphragm thereby lessening the capacity of the thorax or breast so that the lungs are too much confined and cannot dilate themselves sufficient to receive a due quantity of air  this being premised it will be easily understood how these several kinds of asthmas are produced the first or humid called also the pleuretic asthma arises from the redundance of rheumatic serum and viscous humors in the blood which being too thick to pass through the small fibers of the lungs stick close to the sides of those vessels and obstruct the blood in its circulation the parts swell and often ulcerate with great pain feverish habbits and difficulty of breathing or else the pituitous particles are spewed out into the bronchiae especially if not impregnated with a due proportion of salts causing a continual irritating cough in both which cases all inciding pectorals are good all diaphoretics and whatever attenuates and lessens the quantity of serum by that means depleting the extended vessels and working a revulsion of the stagnating humors which nothing can better effect than these drops which evacuate both by perspiration and urine and are certainly at the same time one of the very best cardiacs in the whole world  the next species of this distemper is the dry or plethoric asthma caused either by too great a repletion of a cachochy mious blood called a plethora or else by too great a rarefaction of that fluid in its vessels so that the fine canalls of the lungs are too far distended and consequently there is not room enough for the air to inflate the vessels which produces an inability of respiration for want of a due degree of expansion in that viscus such persons are generally crying out for air they always seem as if girted hard upon their chest and are almost become victims to a long scorbutic cachetic habit of which this is the last and oftentimes for want of proper remrdies applied in time fatal symptoms for in this case there is no time to use alteratives which work but slowly in the mass of blood whereas here we want an immediate assistance which can only be obtained by a conjunction of cardiacs and diapheretics both which qualities are eminently distinguishable in these drops which can therefore never fail the intention of cure in this distemper  the third and last sort of asthma i mentond was the nervous which is occasioned by a deficiency of the pectoral muscles for want of a sufficient quantity of spirits to nourish and contract them and is the dire effect of a nervous atrophy and to be remedied by high and vigorous cardiacs to rouse and invigorate decaying nature and as it were reenkindle the almost extinguished lamp of life which nothing can perform more effectually than these drops which have a prodigious influence in reviving the drooping spirits warming and comforting the nerves increasing the moment of the blood and doing every other office requisite to call back the almost fleeting life by their admirable cardiac quality insomuch that many have been restored to a miracle from even deaths door by them alone both in this and other cases  the dose in all these three cases is as before in the gout in any convenient vehicle but good mountain wine is best if it can be procured made very warm as before and taking care you do not get cold after it  chap vi of colds agues fevers etc i put these distempers all in one class because they have a mutual relation the one to the other as the cause has to the effect and econtia and as different effects produced from the same cause have to one another for it may generally be allowed that what we call colds are the basis or groundwork of most of those epedemic fevers which so commonly rage in this kingdom for perspiration being diminished through a contraction of the pores caused by the perception of external cold the perspirable matter flies off in a less quantity than when the pores are more relaxed and that part thereof which cannot get out returns back into the blood which it heats and irritates more or less according to the quantity of matter retained forcing it to distend it is vessels and producing thence frequently a solutio continui whence follows the idea of pain in that part with a gravedo or he winess of the whole frame but especially of the diseased part or else a coryza or defluxion of serous sharp humors from the glands of the head through the eyes nose mouth etc from whence if speedy care is not taken are engendered asthmas consumptions fevers etc and a whole train of evils which may be easily and certainly prevented by a timely use of some proper evacuator which shall by its diaphoretic quality discharge the blood of its load of foreign deleterious matter and force off the offending particles through the pores which we call sweating to which purpose there is no one thing in nature more effectual than these drops which are a most powerful diaphoretic and never fail of success in the most stubborn cold whatever it is an old and indeed most excellent maxim  venienti occurrite morbo prevent a threatening disease for as the english proverb has it a stitch in time saves nine and so it is here a single dose seldom or never fails curing a cold whereas if you let that cold grow into a fever it may be the work of several to complete the cure and glad you may be to come off so for nothing corrupts the blood more than a cold by irritating and inflaming it to the highest degree whence proceed putrefactions which if not evacuated by proper remedies increase the fervor and often generate acute putrid and malignant fevers whose dire effects daily examples sufficiently demonstrate to every ones experience these deleterious and malignant particles are therefore to be evacuated both by augmenting the before diminished perspiration and the ary secretion for by that means a great quantity of them pass off with the discharged sarum and on course leffen the fermentation in the blood but unless at the same time you use proper cardiacs to refresh nature she will sink under this vast burden for the hurry and heat the blood is in necessarily consumes a vast quantity of the animal spirits which decaying faster than nure can possibly return them she must certainly all beneath the prodigious wast unless relieved by some auxiliary force now as i have often mentioned before thse drops are both draphorene dere and caiac containing in themselves all those three gr qualities absolutely necessary in a complete februge and elves by the blessing of god effect a perfect cure without  drop of any other medicine  as for agues they are only the intermissions of fevers the cold fit being only an accidental and not an essential property thereunto so that as they are properly a species of a fever they are to be treated after the same manner and the method and intention of cure is the very same and if so then consequently the same remedy that prevails against one cannot fail in the other  and here i cannot omit mentioning one peculiar property in these drops sufficient of its self to recommend them effectually to all the reasonable part of mankind who are not wedded to methodical error and that is their most powerful energy in clearing the blood from the dregs of that fashionable but in many cases pernicious drug the bark of peru commonly called the jesuits bark this is the public asylum of mankind the panacea of the world the sovereign and universal orvietem against all the diseases of pandoras box and what not in the opinion of those valetudinarian wretches who dare not eat a meals meat open a chamber window or so much as go to stool without the leave of their physician whose constant prescription is still the bark in some form or other if madam has got a fit of the vapors the bark will cheer her spirits if she has taken too plentiful a dose of ratifea the bark will make her as sober as a nun if she is lovesick the bark is to moderate her desires and if she is in the raging fever of jealousy the bark is to make her believe that her husband is as constant as a turtle in short whenever the privycounceller of health is at a loss what to do for his guinea he persuades his patient she has an intermitting fever and bark is the word to save the expense of further thinking now by this you may judge whether this gigantic protean drug which is whimsically applied to so many chimaerical evils is of any valuable use any substantial benefit to mankind in real disorders and maladies arising from a vitiated state of the fluids we seldom play with serious matters nor make children rattles of diamonds one learned practitioner says the bark is a violent styptic and astringent another it is solutive and will of it is self without proper alteratives pass immediately downwards one says it consists of a fixed salt another of a volatile and a third that it is a composite of both one that it gives a spur to the intestine motion of the blood another that it locks up every thing in the blood some and those of note too assert that if given in large quantities it will by it is attenuating property create an anasarca or dropsy others that it is itself sufficient if taken in time to cure a dropsy one forbids the use of it in rheumatick fevers for fear it is attenuating virtue rarely the mass of blood and thereby enlarge the dimensions of it is vessels so far as to occasion an aneurisma or rupture or at least greatly increase the idea of pain of which opinion are no less men then the famous morton and sydenham whereas another later practitioner no ways inferior to either by all means indicates the bark in this case grounding his notion upon reason and to use his own words conteing and changing the common and trite but deceitful method of practice by observation  now if this be the case that these great and learned men cannot agree among themselves neither as to the nature nor effect of this magical drug is it not greatly to be feared and that with very good reason that if one is mistaken they may all of them be so the consequence whereof will be that this famous panacea like the jay in the fable stripped of all it is borrowed pomp will appear to be of no other use but to fill up the variety of natures works receiving a value only from opinion grounded on the weakness of one part of the world and the wileyness of the other  but if there be ana virtue in this drug the taste itself seems to point it out to be styptic and astringent which is also generally allowed by all who have any skill in it while for fashion sake they admit of other qualities as it were by prescriptive right and for interest invent new ones to authorize it is administration in some present necessity now if once it is allowed the bark is styptick and astringent it points out directly to the manner of it is operation and effect in seemingly giving a turn to some certain periodical exacerbations for which it is more generally adminisserd as intermitting fevers hemicraneas haemoptoes epilepsies and hysteries which says a great and learned author are to be relieved by the cortex only but what way is this relief to be had why says the same author the cortex locks up the febrile ferment in the blood and says he in another place if catharticks be given soon after it they make the type of the fever return in it is old shape for when the bark is carried off what locks up the distemper from whence i conclude that this mighty medicine like a cunning mountebank deludes us with plausible appearances and instead of really working a cure only postpones the exacerbation it may be for a week or a fortnight by locking the cause up in the veins which upon any accidental cold little irregularity or imprudent management breaks out again with double violence the consequence whereof is not seldom attended with the death of the patient as common experience daily confirms unless with morton you continue dosing your patient with it every ten days till the next syzygy or else with another great physician give him as much after the distemper is taken off as was sufficient to take it off in order to prevent a return supposing that  que facta liberant si ante fiant prohibent and pray what must the consequence of this be why the mass of blood is impregnated with so prodigious a quantity of styptic particles that the price you pay for your imaginary cure is a valetudinary state as long as you live becoming entailed upon your physician as much as his patrimony since few that have been weak enough to be persuaded into this habit have the resolution to get rid of the poison afterward unless by the same hand that gave it them whereas would they be wise at lest and get rid of their troublesome dangerous inmate as soon as they can by deteging and cleansing their blood they might in time by the blessing of providence restore that fluid to it is natural crasis and by deges overcome the malevolent effects of their fashionable physic for which purpose as well at the other intentions in this treatise these drops have been greatly commended by several who have happily experienced their effects and those among the learned world of both our universities and by them recommended in this very intention to the world for the general good of mankind  chap vii of the other virtues of these drops hitherto i have laid before you the particular effects of these drops in particular cases and that not by a dogmatical assertion of their virtues or any canting declaration of their specific influence and occult qualities terms only serving to cover ignorance and imposition but i have carried you through all the meanders of nature in her several turns and windings in her several various phases and symptomical appearances upon every case affecting the humane system which this noble and efficacious medicine is capable of searching and from thence drawn such easy and rational conclusions upon their operations as to make it visible to every capacity that has but the least notion of the connection between causes and their effects etc that they cannot fail in the several intentions wherein they are advised a task which not any selfinterest nor any sinister view of serving my own turn has in the least indud me to but purely the universal good of mankind and charity to my fellow creatures as is plainly evident from the established reputation these drops have already gained in the world the surprising cures they have wrought and the vast quantities of them sold throughout the whole kingdom so that there was no occasion upon any of these accounts to have been either at the trouble or charge of this treatise but purely to convince gnsayers of their admirable nature and efficacy in the intentions aforementioned to inform the ignorant of the nature of their several cases and where they may meet with a speedy certain and safe cure for their respective maladies and lastly to assure the whole world that these drops are no quack preparation o drugs injudiciously mixed and umbled together without either art or design but such as are grounded on both and carefully suited to answer the several intentions to which they are designed which any one capable of forming a right judgment of things may on the reading this short treatise be sufficiently convinced of wherefore i shall enlarge no further on this subject only to assure you that besides the several foregoing intentions these drops are also wonderful in their stopping diarrheas and luxes of all kinds vomitings hamoptoes and other dangerous unnatural discharges which weaken and destroy the entire humane system they give immediate ease in colics of what kind soever whether stne wind bus or hysterie raise the languishing frame of nature  consumptions and marasmi if taken before the lungs are entely corrupted raise and cheer the spirits in melancholy despondency hypocondriac and hysteric vapors give a new life in all paralytic evils restoring sense and motion to the almost perished limb they bring out the small pox measles and rashes to a wonder cure the rickets in children ease afterpains prevents miscarriages to a miracle and are in short the greatest restorer and strengthner of nature in the whole world  note no person ever yet afflictied with the most violent cough and cold took this medicine but what has been cured by taking one bottle only  a printed bill of directions is given with each bottle  here follows some few out of the many thousands of certificates of cures effected by these drops which certificates are not extorted by any sinister means but they are the true genuine and spontaneous declarations which the persons receiving benefit from these drops have voluntarily made to let the world know their great efficacy and virtue many of which persons who have been violently and grievously afflicted with intolerable pains etc have begged for gods sake that it might be published for the good of mankind that these drops alone restored them to their health and strength i gregory cripwell of bunny near nottingham was for a long time grievously troubled with the rheumatism and had not the least use of one limb or joint about me insomuch that i have often
