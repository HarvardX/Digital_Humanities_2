an introduction to the history of great britain and ireland  by james macpherson esquire  dublin printed for james williams at no   in skinnerrow mdcclxxi  preface inquiries into antiquity are so little the taste of the present age that a writer who employs his time in that way deceives himself if he expects to derive either much reputation or any advantage from his work prejudiced against the subject we add contempt to its natural sterility and seem to wish for no information from a province which we have been taught to assign to fiction and romance under these impressions the author of the introduction wrote without any of the ordinary incitements to literary labor he was induced to proceed by the sole motive of private amusement  notwithstanding the small hopes he entertains of reconciling the public judgment to the period which he has endeavored to illustrate he has taken some pains to present in its most agreeable form a subject not very capable of ornament he has studied to be clear in disquisition concise in observation just in inference an enemy to fiction himself he imposes none upon the world he advances nothing as fact without authorities and his conjectures arise not so much from his own ingenuity as from the proofs which the ancients have laid down before him  the darkness with which the prejudice and vanity of the scots and irish have covered their origin has forced the author to examine that point with a minuteness which a dispute so unimportant seems not to deserve but the disquisitions of many learned men had given a kind of consequence to the subject when they rendered it perplexed and obscure to extricate truth from the polemical rubbish of former antiquaries was a task of labor and the candid will forgive the length on account of the propriety of the disquisition especially in a work which professedly treats of the antiquities of the british nations  in that part of his work which relates to the disputes between the british and irish scots the author of the introduction derives much of his information from the manuscript notes of the late very ingenious dr macpherson whose dissertations on the antiquities of the northern britain are in the hands of the learned in the other provinces of his subject he has availed himself of the industry of some modern writers but he neither borrows their sentiments nor relies upon their judgment he looks upon antiquity through the medium of the ancients and thinks he sees it in its genuine state his work is formed on the general result of the information which the writers of greece and rome have transmitted from every quarter and if his system is not satisfactory it at least is new  contents state and revolutions of ancient europe preliminary reflections   the celtoe

revolutions of ancient europe preliminary reflections the northern nations averse to letters the northern nations whose character was in many respects singular were remarkable for their aversion to the study of letters fierce and untractable by nature and bred from their infancy to incursion and depredation they thought every pursuit not immediately subservient to the profession of arms mean and dishonorable they little considered that this prejudice was a fatal enemy to the fame which they sought after with so much eagerness in the field in vain were exploits worthy of memory performed when the only certain means of transmitting them to posterity were discouraged and despised  the middle ages in the cloud of ignorance which involved them at home they advanced into the provinces of western empire learning which had long languished among the romans expired with the power of that illustrious people and europe in a great measure returned to its original rudeness and barbarity when the detached tribes who had subverted the government of the romans formed themselves into regular communities some knowledge of letters began to revive but the christian clergy following the policy of their predecessors the druids confined that knowledge to themselves  unfavourable to history to record temporal events was not the first use made of letters by the religious of the middle ages miracles visions and the lives of saints were more important subjects than the transactions of states and kingdoms in the eyes of a race of men whose influence depended upon keeping mankind in the shades of ignorance and superstition we find accordingly that monks and hermits became illustrious in cells and in deserts whilst the monarchs of europe sat in obscurity upon their thrones  the feudal establishments introduce historical inquiry the north which upon the decline of the romans had filled the provinces of the western empire with its colonies sent abroad fresh armies of adventurers in the eighth and ninth ages these settling in some of the regions of the south gave a new turn to the genius of the european nations the feudal establishments introduced or at least revived and confirmed by them gave stability to government and were highly favorable to a spirit of national dignity and independence lands and honors becoming hereditary gave birth to a pride of family among the great barons and they endeavored to add luster to the distinctions which they had acquired by tracing their ancestors through the same path of eminence to a remote antiquity from individuals this genealogical enthusiasm spread to whole communities men possessed of the little literature of the times and a talent for fable either through ignorance or vanity indulged the romantic passions of an ignorant race of men by deducing the origin of their respective nations from very distant aeras the antiquities of every country in europe furnished an ample field of fiction and it was impossible to form tales too extravagant or improbable for the credulity of the age it is therefore no matter of wonder that we possess such a mass of legends for the ancient history of those nations who for many centuries have made a figure in europe  the history of ancient britain neglected the revival of critical learning has enabled foreigners to extricate in a great measure their antiquities from the fables of the middle ages in britain we content ourselves with looking back with contempt on the credulity of our ancestors from a pride incident to polished times we are apt to think and perhaps with some justice that the transactions of the infancy of society are as unworthy of remembrance as they are imperfectly known but this observation has been made not more to depreciate our ancestors than to cover a glaring defect in ourselves the british nations till of late years were much more remarkable for the performance of great actions in the field than for recording them with dignity and precision in the closet  design of the author men of abilities have removed this reproach from the nation the latter periods of our history are reduced into form and precision but the early part of our annals still remains in the possession of fiction and romance to dispel the shades which cover the antiquities of the british nations to investigate their origin to carry down some account of their character manners and government into the times of records and domestic writers is the design of this introduction the abilities of the author are perhaps inadequate to so arduous an undertaking but as he travels back into antiquity with some advantages which others have not possessed he flatters himself that he shall be able to throw a new if not a satisfactory light on a subject hitherto little understood though for want of sufficient guides he should sometimes lose his way in a region of clouds and darkness his hopes of the indulgence of the public are greater than his fears of their censure  the celtae two nations the celtae and sarmatae possessed ancient europe the greeks threw the first feeble light on the barbarians of the north and west they rose distinctly to view in the

of that appellation we must return into a period of remote antiquity the pelasgi of peloponnesus and the islands of the archipelago were the first of the european nomades who quitted the ambulatory

the north and the tide of migration which had for ages flowed from gaul returned upon itself with redoubled violence the german celtae celtae ive galli quos cimbros vocant appian in illyr   plutarch

however retained so many marks of their galic origin that some have thought that the name of germans proceeded from their similarity in every respect to the inhabitants of gaul forma et moribus et

deduce the origin of the british nations  the european sarmatae irruption of the european sarmatae the successive migrations of the barbarians of the north may be compared to the transient storms of a showery day the sun scarce returns after one cloud is past before another begins to gather in the same quarter of heaven the short space between is filled with that pleasing but melancholy serenity which attends joys whose period is approaching in view  the first irruption of the nations of the northern germany happened as we have already observed more than three centuries before the commencement of our present era about two ages after the celtae beyond the rhine threw another fleece of adventurers under the name of cimbri into the regions of the south sexcentesimum et

germans naturally distinguished the scandinavian sarmatae by a name expressive of the situation of their country  carried with them a proof of their sarmatic origin  their progress to the south when the celtae between the elb and the gulf of bothnia evacuated their territories and poured into the southern europe about fortyfive years after the death of alexander the sarmatae of scandinavia crossed the baltic and settled between the vistula and the drove under the general name of goths ex scanzia insula cum regi suo nomine berich gothi quondam memorantur egressi jornandes de rebus

shores of the ocean and in the peninsula of juteland gave the name of teutioni or northern men to the sarmatae who after having passed from scandinavia became their neighbors in germany instead of contending about the possession of the bleak shores of the baltic the cimbri and teutoni in close alliance with one another endeavored to procure for themselves better settlements in a more favorable climate and soil  the scandinavian sarmatae the teutoni were the first of the scandinavian sarmatae who invaded the south the calamities which overwhelmed those adventurers in their expedition discouraged their countrymen for more than two complete centuries from similar attempts in the reign of marcus aurelius forgetting the misfortunes of their fathers the sarmatic germans advanced into the regions of the south and east dio cass lib lxxi  a new bulwark against their invasion had started up in the power of the romans the military discipline of the legions stationed on the frontiers of pannonia frustrated all the efforts of the barbarians and obliged them to content themselves with the cold and sterile seats of their ancestors but though they were unsuccessful in many succeeding attempts they never lost sight of the object till the growing imbecility of the empire opened the south and west to their arms  the ancestors of the modern germans the celtae beyond the rhine were either dissipated in the dominions of rome before the fall of the empire or afterward lost in the inundations of the sarmatic scandinavians who passing over germany overwhelmed the regions of the south and west at the decline of the roman power the goths and vandals who extended their conquests to spain italy and africa were in some measure lost in the countries which they subdued the northern nations descended from the same stock who trod on their heels when they moved into the provinces of the roman empire are the ancestors of the present germans the franks having confined their migrating expeditions to gaul have still preserved their vandalic name in that country the saxons settled in britain are the most unmixed of the posterity of the sarmatae who first settled on the southern shore of the baltic  the slavi reflections when fate had decreed the fall of the romans she seemed to create barbarians for the single purpose of executing her favorite design nations appeared suddenly on the frontiers of the empire unheard of by others and even unknown to themselves the memory of their former transactions was lost in their own ignorance and the name of their original seats was as it were forgot in the length of their march they seemed to move forward under an impression of the inconveniences they had left at home more than from the hopes of success abroad having philosophy enough to prefer the uncertainty of future evils to present misery  origin and progress of the slavi the most obscure of those barbarians who contributed to the destruction of the western empire were the slavi whose posterity now possess all the regions between the euxine and the frozen ocean under the name of avari they advanced even as far as peloponnesus in the fifth century and under that of bulgarians they continued their irruptions into the south till the end of the eighth age pursuing and flying from one another in successive migrations they filled the western russia poland and the regions near the mouths of the danube with their colonies and having at last settled in fixed abodes started up into several powerful nations some of them extended themselves as far as dalmatia and illyricum and at this moment speak the language of their ancestors on the adriatic  a different people from the european sarmatae the slavi seem from their language as well as manners to derive their origin from the tartars of the northeast of asia they were a very different race of men from the scandinavian sarmatae the principals in the migrating expeditions which proved fatal to the roman power when the goths quitting their native seats to the east of the vistula had advanced into rhetia gaul and italy the slavi took possession of their habitations ubi ergo poloniam finem facit pervenitur ad slavorum amplissimam provinciam  growing numerous in russia and poland they extended themselves to the southwest and if we regard their numbers and extent of dominion they form at this day one third of the weight in the scale of europe  this short account of the origin of the slavi though foreign to our present subject comes in with some propriety in the revolutions which happened of old in the north  reflections on the origin of the european nations the celtae the sarmatae and slavi the succinct account given of the state of ancient europe lays open the secret springs from which its modern inhabitants derive their blood the polished nations who now excel antiquity itself in arts and vie with it in arms owe their origin to rude barbarians whose want of means of transmitting their history to posterity has perhaps contributed to their fame the celtae the sarmarae and slavi jumbled together by migration conquest and accidents of various kinds formed that great mass which has started up in the course of ages into those powerful and illustrious states which figure at this day in europe  the ancestors of the european nations though scarce any one people from the pillars of hercules to the tanais are free from a mixture of the three great original nations whom we have so often mentioned there are regions in that vast extent of country where the blood of each peculiarly prevails the celtae whom their connection with the romans had abandoned to conquest in gaul spain italy and its isles are the ancestors of the majority of the present inhabitants of those extensive countries the sarmatic vandals who under a great variety of national names succeeded the romans in the dominion of the south and west bore no proportion to the conquered they introduced among their new subjects their own form of government their own regulations the haughty ferocity of their character and manners that want of neatness sordes sarmatarum tacit germ xlvi which all the improvements of civilized times have not hitherto been able to remove but the language of the vassals a certain evidence of their superiority in point of numbers prevailed at last over that of their lords  proved from in germany from the source of the elb to the baltic from the vistula to the ocean in england in a great part of scotland the old scandinavians with little mixture prevail in the kingdoms of norway and sweden the blood of the ancient sarmatae is tinctured with that of the slavi who stepped into the vacant habitations of those tribes that successively for many ages discharged themselves into the regions of the south from both the shores of the baltic the dominions of the slavi we have already described  their language etc but to wander no further into dissertation language next to authentic records is the best evidence of the extract of a people the modern europeans deriving their blood from three very different nations still preserve among them the three original tongues of their ancestors these are the celtic the teutonic and sclavonic all radically different from one another wherever any of these three languages is spoken with most purity there the blood of the great nation from which it takes its name most prevails  an inquiry into the origin of the ancient british nations preliminary observations general should a traveller of ordinary curiosity land at the mouth of the nile he might perhaps content himself with viewing the fine effect which that noble river has on the appearance of the lower egypt one more inquisitive might choose to trace the stream to where it falls from the desert into the plains of thebes but he indeed must be uncommonly curious who would wander in search of its source to the mountains of the moon the source of the nile is said to lie in mountains of that name beyond the line  the novelty of the romantic scenes on the way might recompense him for the fatigue of his journey but mankind would scarce forget the folly of the undertaking in the pleasure of hearing the detail of his discoveries  observations a writer who penetrates into antiquity to investigate the springs from which a nation has issued may in like manner have his amusement for his labor partial to themselves the bulk of the people regard only those periods of their history which descend nearest to their own times satisfied with the renown of latter transactions they are as indifferent concerning their remote annals and origin as they who profit by the inundations of the nile are about the distant fountain from which it takes its rise the traveller to continue the comparison has in some respects the advantage of the writer for the sandy deserts of africa present not a more uncomfortable prospect to the eye than the sterile regions of national antiquities this consideration though it shall not prevent will contribute to shorten the present inquiry  britain little known before julius caesar britain before the arrival of caesar was rather heard of than known foreigners had visited its ports in pursuit of commerce but they took no pains to extend their inquiries to the internal state of the country the information of the romans accompanied the progress of their new communities rose gradually before them as they advanced into the heart of the island till the whole body of its inhabitants came forward distinctly to view when agricola carried the roman eagles to the mountains of caledonia but to investigate the origin of our ancestors with precision we must return to a period of more remote antiquity  affected by revolutions on the continent the british isles from their vicinity to the continent must in the nature of things have been affected by the revolutions which we have in the preceding sections briefly described the circles spreading from commotions in the center must have vibrated though perhaps faintly in the extremities of europe and the shock was certainly felt beyond the limits to which conquest and migration actually extended themselves we can accordingly trace in lively characters in britain the effect of every great movement made on the continent by the body of the celtae before the power of the romans confined them to fixed abodes  the gael a conjecture concerning the era whether britain was inhabited or rather perambulated by a race of barbarians before the gael of the continent extended their name with their arms into all the regions of europe ferox natio gallorum pervagata bello prope orbem terrarum livius lib xxxviii  is a circumstance which lies buried in impenetrable darkness the name of gael still retained by the posterity of the most ancient inhabitants of the british isles seems to look for its origin to the first great revolution of the celtae on the continent the wild tribes who originally possessed the vast regions bounded by the ocean the mediterranean the rhine the alps and the pyrenean mountains were as has been already observed the first of the european scythians if we except the pelasgi of greece who formed themselves into distinct communities arriving at some degree of civilization they became overstocked with numbers at home and they sent armies of emigrants in quest of foreign settlements gallia adeo frugum hominumque fertilis fuit ut abundans multitudo vix regi videretur posse ambigatus missurum se esse in quas dii

only room for conjecture we should in all probability look for it beyond the establishment of the phoceans in the district of massilia though it is affirmed both by livy and plutarch titus livius lib v  that the gauls for the first time entered italy in a hostile manner in the reign of the elder tarquin we have reason to believe that partial emigrations from that nation crossed the alps many ages

viii  umbri prima veterum gallorum proles august in sempron  umbros veterum gallorum propaginem esse marcus antonius reert servius in aeneid   mo  the epithet of veteres applied to the gauls is perhaps intended to distinguish the progenitors of the umbri the old gael from the cimbrogermanic gauls who in an after age pervaded all the regions of europe    we may naturally suppose that the gauls of belgium would have found less difficulty in crossing a very narrow channel into britain than their countrymen at the foot of the alps in clambering with their wives and children over the vast ridge of mountains which separated them from italy it may therefore be concluded that britain received very considerable colonies from the belgic division of gaul as early at least as the gael of the alpin regions seized upon italy under the name of umbri the umbri were the inhabitants of the upper italy and they seem to derive their name from the situation of their country oambruich literally signifies the declivity of a ridge of mountains  but though it is impossible to fix with precision on the era of the invasion of britain by the gael no doubt can remain concerning the existence of the fact itself the gael of britain and ireland retain a proof of their origin in their indigenous name the writers of antiquity confirm it from every quarter ferocitate excellent galli qui ad arctum

continent we ought to place it perhaps half a century prior to the arrival of caesar divitiacus king of the suessiones who flourished before that great commander may probably have transplanted from gaul those tribes in britain over whom he reigned  the belgae when they transmigrated into britain brought with them those arts of civil life which had made a considerable progress in gaul before they

banks of the severn were the most considerable tribe of the british cimbri they varied so much from the belgae that tacitus justly concluded that they were in some measure a different race of men to deduce them from spain was certainly an error it is not in any degree probable that in so early a period the spaniards who were never a seafaring people could transport themselves over an immense

the northern britain by the name of caledonians having passed from the continent before the arts of civil life had made any considerable progress among them retained the pure but unimproved language of their ancestors together with their rude simplicity of manners  though descended from the celtic stock the british cimbri derived their origin from the galic colonies who in remote antiquity had settled beyond the rhine these with a small mixture of the sarmatae returned in all their original barbarism into the regions of the south during their separation from their mother nation their language and manners must have suffered such a considerable change that it is extremely doubtful whether their dialect of the celtic and that of the old british gael were at the arrival of the former in this island reciprocally understood by both nations  the third colony differed in every thing from the gael and cimbri their manners were more humanized and their tongue though perhaps corrupted was more copious they had left the continent at a period of advanced civility their character changed with the progress of the arts of civil life and new inventions had introduced new words and new expressions into their language  spoke three different dialects but though the three nations who possessed the british isles at the arrival of the romans spoke three distinct dialects and differed materially from one another in the formation of their phrases and construction of their sentences the radical words used by all were certainly the same the names of places in the roman britain however

internal state of the gael of north britain and ireland is covered with that impenetrable cloud which invariably involves illiterate nations who lie beyond the information of foreign writers  ancient names of britain observations having briefly investigated the origin of the people it may not be improper to inquire into the name of the country etymology is a science frequently full of deception and always unentertaining and dry but as the author of the introduction returns back into antiquity with some advantages which men of greater abilities have not possessed he hopes to be in some measure satisfactory on this subject  the etymon of albion alba or albin the name of which the ancient scots in their native language have from all antiquity distinguished their own division of britain seems to be the fountain from which the greeks deduced their albion it was natural for the gael who transmigrated from the low plains of belgium to call the more elevated land of britain by a name expressive of the face of the countay alb or alp in the celtic signifies high and in invariably a country  the name of albion being imposed upon the island by the gael the first colony was known before the appellation which the romans latinized into britannia  and of the cimbri the second celtic colony who passed into britain arriving in belgium and descrying albion gave it a new name expressive of the same idea which first suggested the appellation of albion to the gael comparing the elevated coast of britain to the fenny plains of the lower germany they called it brait an a word compounded of brait high and an or in a country la bretagne peut aussi avoir tire son nom de sa grande etendue brayd ou brait signify vaste le plus grand an isle bretan la plus grande isle memoires

progress of time the scottish and irish gael have brought down the name of alba or albin to the present age the welsh use no appellation the era of its imposition ought to be fixed as far back as the arrival of the cimbri in the island the phoenicians of gades and the massilian phoceans who traded to the ports of britain learned the name of the natives and communicated it to the writers of greece and rome  ancient scots preliminary reflections origin of the caledonians uninvestigated in proportion as we travel northward in ancient britain the darkness which involves the antiquities of its inhabitants thickens before us the cimbri and belgae after they were comprehended within the pale of the roman dominions were seen distinctly but the more ancient inhabitants of the island the gael appeared only transiently when in an hostile manner they advanced to the frontiers of the province the arms of the empire penetrated at different periods into the heart of the country beyond the scottish friths but as these expeditions were not attended with absolute conquest and a consequent settlement of colonies the romans made little inquiry concerning the origin and history of the natives of the northern division of britain  by the romans julius agricola who for the first time displayed the roman eagles beyond the frith was not more successful in the field than he was happy in an historian to transmit his actions with luster to posterity but even the distinct and intelligent tacitus gives but a very imperfect idea of those enemies by the defeat of whom his fatherinlaw acquired so much reputation we learn from him indeed that the caledonians were the most ancient inhabitants of britain that they were brave and numerous that though overcome in the field by the discipline of the roman legions they were far from being reduced into any subjection which could deserve the name of conquest  their history after agricola was removed from the government of britain the writers of the empire for some years lost sight of the caledonians the incursions of those barbarians into the province forced both adrian murum per octoginta millia passuum primus duxit qui

prevent them from laying waste the northern division of the roman britain till severus about the beginning of the third century carried the war into their country with a numerous army this is the sum of what the romans have related concerning the caledonians for near two centuries after they were first mentioned to their origin and internal history the writers of rome were equally strangers  peculiarly obscure this defect in foreign writers with regard to the ancient inhabitants of north britain is not supplied by any authentic monuments of their own the caledonians were not more destitute of the means of preserving their history in the intermediate century between agricola and severus than their posterity were for a considerable time after the romans had relinquished the dominion of britain the climate and soil of caledonia were far from being favorable to internal civilization and a ferocity of manners arising from an uninterrupted series of hostilities effectually prevented the introduction of the arts of civil life from abroad  a reflection but when the scots look back with regret upon that want of letters which has involved in obscurity and fable the origin and history of their ancestors they ought to consider that it was perhaps from this circumstance arose that national independence which they transmitted to their posterity had the romans established themselves in caledonia we might indeed have known more of the ancient inhabitants of that country but it is much to be doubted whether the scots of this age would have been more concerned in their history than the english of middlesex and essex are in the transactions of the trinobantes who possessed those counties in the time of julius caesar the romans it is true introduced the arts of civil life into the countries which they subdued but with those arts came in slavery and a consequent imbecility of mind which in the end abandoned the vassals as well as their lords to conquest and even to extirpation  scots destitute of ancientdomestic writers the first domestic writers of the history of north britain were too ignorant as well as too modern to form any probable system concerning the origin of their nation destitute of records at home they found themselves obliged to fill up the void in their antiquities with tales which had been growing in ireland for some ages before in the hands of a succession of ignorant bards and fileas after the study of critical learning was prosecuted with success among other nations what part of it extended to scotland was only employed to remove some of the absurdities of the old fables and not levelled in a manly manner against the whole of that fabric of fiction which had so long dishonored the antiquities of that country  inaccuracy and indolence of their modern historians the ingenious father innes was the first of the scots who had the courage to attack the puerile system of their origin which his countrymen had for many ages adopted he wrested the scepter of scotland from the first fergus and thirtynine of the ideal successors of that pretended monarch and passing over into ireland discomfited that motley army of bards fileas and senachies which had been so long fortifying itself in rhimes traditions and fabulous records but innes was more successful in destroying the indigested accounts of others than in establishing a more rational system of his own setting out upon wrong principles and being an utter stranger to the galic language he fell into unavoidable mistakes and endeavored to obtrude upon the world opinions concerning the origin of the scots no less improbable than those tales which he had exploded with so much success though scotland has of late years produced men distinguished for their talent in historical disquisition none of them has thought proper to search for the genuine origin and history of his ancestors among those fables which obscure the antiquities of the nation possessed of parts perhaps too valuable to be employed in investigations of that kind they hastened to important periods of history where their abilities might with luster be displayed  a learned clergyman dr john macpherson minister of slate in the isle of sky  in one of the scottish isles reduced lately into form and precision the antiquities which innes had left in confusion and disorder had the ingenious writer extended his remarks as far as he might have been enabled to do by his erudition and great knowledge of all the branches of the celtic language there would perhaps be very little occasion for this essay his observations are so judicious and his arguments so conclusive on several points of this subject that to give him the merit of being the best antiquary that has treated of the origin of the scots is too small a tribute to his memory  origin of the scots general reflections on the origin of the scots it is unnecessary to controvert the opinion of cornelius tacitus concerning the origin of the ancient inhabitants of north britain rutilae caledoniam habitantium comae magni artus germanicam originem asseverant tacit vit agric cap xi  the name by which the celebrated writer himself distinguishes their country is sufficient to demonstrate that they came from a very different quarter of the continent than what he supposed when the arms of the empire under julius agricola laid open all the nations of britain to the enquiry of the romans it has been already observed that the whole island was possessed by three nations whom tacitus endeavors to deduce from communities on the continent very distant from one another the posterity of two of those nations preserve to this day in their names proofs that altogether subvert this opinion the silures or cumri of the south it has already appeared had a much better title to a germanic extraction than the gael of caledonia  a colony of gauls the gael or ancient gauls having transmigrated from the continent at a period when the arts of civil life had made but very little progress among them must have maintained themselves chiefly by hunting and we may suppose that in pursuit of their game they soon extended themselves to the northern extremity of the island a people whose subsistence arises chiefly from the chase are never numerous it is consequently natural to believe that the cimbri met with little opposition from the gael when the former passed from the continent and seized upon the southern division of britain  gradually advance into north britain and transmigrate into ireland in proportion as the cimbri advanced toward the north the gael being circumscribed within narrower limits were forced to transmigrate into the islands which crowd the northern and western coasts of scotland it is in this period perhaps we ought to place the first great migration of the british gael into ireland that kingdom being much nearer to the promontory of galloway and cantyre than many of the scottish isles are to the continent of north britain this vicinity of ireland had probably drawn partial emigrations from caledonia before the arrival of the cimbri in britain but when these interlopers pressed upon the gael from the south it is reasonable to conclude the numerous colonies passed over into an island so near and so much superior to their original country in climate and fertility  forced northward by the belgae the inhabitants of the maritime regions of gaul crossing in an after age the british channel maritima pars britanniae ab iis qui praedae ac belli inferendi

invasion of the southern britain that the gael of the northern division formed themselves into a regular community to repel the incroachment of the cimbri upon their territories to the country which they themselves possessed they gave the name of caeldoch which is the only appellation the scots who speak the galic language know for their own division of britain caeldoch is a compound made up of gael or cael the first colony of the ancient gauls who transmigrated into britain and doch a district or division of a country the romans by transposing the letter l in cael and by softening into a latin termination the ch of doch formed the wellknown name of caledonia obvious as this etymon of caledonia appears it was but very lately discovered this etymon first occurred to the author of this essay and he communicated it to dr macpherson who adopted it from a conviction of its justness  those who treated of the antiquities of north britain were utter strangers to that only name by which the scots distinguished the corner of britain which their ancestors possessed from the remotest antiquity from an ignorance so unpardonable in antiquaries proceeded that erroneous system of the origin of the scots which for many ages has been with so much confidence obtruded on the world  internal history unknown concerning the internal state of caledonia and the division of its inhabitants into various tribes in a very early period we can find nothing certain the account given by ptolemy of the epidii carini cantae logae and other nations is little to be regarded tacitus passed over those petty communities in silence and in the period between the expedition of julius agricola and the reign of marcus aurelius under whom the egyptian geographer flourished the romans had no opportunity of being acquainted with the domestic arrangements of the caledonions  their boundaries though the scottish friths are generally allowed to have been the boundaries of caledonia toward the south it is more than probable that those tribes who possessed the country between the walls were principally descended from the ancient gael the names of the selgovae and gadeni two petty communities on the northern banks of the solway and tweed seem to strengthen this supposition they carry in their signification a proof that the tribes who bore them were in a state of hostility with their neighbors the ottadini and brigantes which furnishes a presumption that they derived their origin from a different quarter selgovae is plainly selgovich latinized selgovich literally signifies bunters in a metaphorical sense plunderers a name by which their successors in the same country ought to have been distinguished till within little more than a century back gadeni is plainly from gadecbin robbers a name which arose from the same love of depredation with their friends and neighbors the selgovae   the maeatae but as that tract of country which is comprehended between the tweed and solway and the scottish friths was more exposed to invasion than caledonia we may conclude that the gael who possessed it were in some degree mixed with the cimbric ottadini and brigantes even before the invasions of the romans pressed those tribes toward the north it was from this unavoidable mixture that the selgovae gadeni damnii and novantes were in an after age distinguished by the name of maeatae which signifies a people descended from a double origin as well as the inhabitants of a controverted country moiatta or moiatich the inhabitants of the plains maeanatta the possessors of the middle country

illfated britons like many other interlopers from various parts of the world who succeeded them in ireland had the misfortune to fall under the displeasure of the senachies and were inhumanly

scythian nomades who prior to the migrations of the gauls wandered over the vast regions of europe found their way into ireland from the nearest promontories of britain the name of gael still retained

in hibernian antiquities never once asserted that the caledonians or their posterity the picts were of irish extract yet nothing is better ascertained than that the ancient britons of the south gave to the scots the picts and the irish the common name of gael mr o connor who lately gave to the public some wild incoherent tales concerning the ancient irish endeavors to obviate the strength of the

ancient gael of the continent  conjecture concerning the time of their transmigration the british gael in an early age extending themselves to the very extremities of the island descried ireland from the mulls of galloway and cantire and crossing the narrow channel which separates the two countries became the progenitors of the irish nation in proportion as fresh emigrants from the continent of europe forced the ancient gael toward the north of britain more colonies transmigrated into ireland from the promontories which we have so often mentioned it is probable that it was after the arrival of the cimbri in britain a number of the gael sufficient to deserve the name of a nation settled themselves in ireland but they became so numerous in that country before the arrival of the belgae in britain that the colonies which transmigrated from that nation into ireland were together with their language manners and customs lost in the gael so that in one sense the caledonians may be reckoned the sole progenitors of the old irish the firbolg so often mentioned in the traditions of the irish were belgic colonies who transmigrated from britain after the belgae had seized on the southern division of england they are mentioned very frequently under the name of siol na m bolga in the poems of offian   etymon of the name of erin when the gael arrived first in ireland they naturally gave it the name of iarin iarin or as the irish pronounce the word eirin is compounded of iar west and in island eirin is the name which the natives in all ages gave to ireland  or the western country in contradistinction to their original settlements in britain from iarin is not only to be deduced the eirin of the irish themselves but those various names by which the greeks and romans distinguished their island juverna ierna iris  hibernia  the appellation of iarin was not altogether confined to ireland by the gael of north britain they gave it also to those numerous islands which crowd the western coasts of caledonia but when by degrees they became acquainted with the vast extent of ireland when compared to the other scottish isles they called it by an emphasis hiarin or heirin the western country or island the proper and more ancient general appellation of the scottish isles is iarin and from that name as shall hereafter appear claudian derived his ierna after the conquest of the hebrides by harold harfager king of norway the whole string of islands which stretch along the western shores of north britain were called by the scots on the continent inchgaul or the islands of foreigners   and of hibernia hibernia the most common name by which the romans distinguished ireland may appear to some too remote in the pronunciation and orthography from iarin or heirin to be derived from either this difficulty is easily removed julius caesar mentions for the first time ireland under the name of hibernia one of two reasons induced the illustrious writer to use that appellation he either latinized the hyverdhon of the southern britains or what is more probable he annexed to ireland a name which suited his own ideas of its air and climate the romans long after the expedition of caesar entertained a very unfavourable opinion of the climate of ireland strabo thought that the severity of the weather rendered that island extremely uncomfortable strabo lib ii  and pomponius mela was told that corn never ripened there on account of the inclemency of the seasons supra britanniam juverna est coeli ad maturanda semina iniqui pomp mela lib iv  the attention of caesar was engaged by much more important objects than in informing himself minutely concerning the climate of a country to which he never intended to carry his arms if strabo and mela whose subject led to enquiries of that kind supposed that the air of ireland was extremely intemperate it is no wonder that caesar should have fallen into a similar mistake and we may from this circumstance conclude that he formed the name of hibernia from the adjective hibernus he thought that a perpetual winter reigned in ireland and he was informed that in the lesser islands in the neighborhood one

the irish diametrically opposite to that which we mean to establish the world are well acquainted with the pretensions which the irish have made for many ages to very high antiquities as well as to an original very different from the other inhabitants of the british isles instead of transmigrating from the nearest continent in the natural progress of migration it seems that the first colonies came to ireland across an immense ocean at a period when the rude navigation of the other nations of europe scarcely enabled them to waft themselves over rivers and narrow arms of the sea  pretensions of the old irish to letters to support this improbable tale another was formed no less incredible in itself than the fact it was meant to ascertain the fabricators of the irish antiquities found than an early knowledge of letters in their country was absolutely necessary to gain credit to the system which they so much wished to establish ireland therefore was made the seat of polite literature many ages before greece itself rose out of ignorance and barbarity to remove this support from the antiquities of the irish is to destroy at once that whole fabric of fiction which they possess for their ancient history  reflections the art of perpetuating ideas and of transmitting the wisdom of one age to another is the first means of civilizing mankind out of their natural ferocity and barbarity when some certain marks are found to send down the memory of inventions and transactions through a series of generations a nation becomes polished in proportion to the length of time it has been in possession of that art before the phoenicians taught the use of the alphabet to the ionians gentium consensus tacitus primus omnium conspiravit ut ionum literis uterentur plin lib vii  peloponnesus and the islands of greece were possessed by tribes as obscure and contemptible as those wild indians who wander through the forests of america the progress of the greeks toward the figure which they make in history accompanied the gradual cultivation of polite learning in their country and we find that from a possession of letters for a few centuries they arrived at such a pitch of civilization that it was not without reason they distinguished other nations by the name of barbarians  pretended civility of the old irish as the irish pretend to have been even before the greeks kennedys genealogy pref p     in point of time with regard to the reception of letters we ought naturally to expect that they became civilized in a very early period the annals of ireland are accordingly full of the progress of civility and the encouragement given to polite learning in that country many ages before any other nation in europe extricated itself from the shades of ignorance and barbarity but these annals deserve little credit on a matter of such high antiquity the psalter cashel the oldest record of the irish transactions was written in the latter end of the tenth age more than two thousand years after the pretended importation of letters into ireland  confuted from the testimony of the only credible accounts of the manners of the old irish as well as of the other barbarous nations of europe must be derived from the writers of rome and these do not go beyond the commencement of the christian era which is at least a thousand years posterior to the period assigned by the irish for the introduction of learning among their ancestors unfortunately for the hibernian system of antiquities by the testimony of foreign writers who extended their enquiries to ireland the

the britons but he even mentions several instances of their brutal ferocity of manners which decency obliges us to leave under the veil of a dead language  agrestissimi omnium britannorum sunt hiberni

civilized by a long possession of letters that they were thought to feed upon human bodies the authority of diodorus not only destroys the fiction of the early knowledge of letters in ireland but also ruins that system of antiquities to support which the fiction itself was first framed he shows that the irish so far from coming from a distant country were a branch of those gauls who had possessed

been in possession of letters for more than a thousand years being thus ascertained we find it absolutely inconsistent with learning and that civility which is the invariable companion of literature it was from this consideration that the most learned and unbiassed among the moderns rejected as mere fable and romance what is related concerning letters in ireland prior to the mission of patrick

ingenious father very shrewdly observes that the bare terms which the romans used in their letters arts and sciences sufficiently demonstrate without having recourse to history that they derived their polite learning from greece grammatica rhetorica logica philosophia cum multis aliis  in the same manner the proper terms by which the irish in their vulgar language express every thing concerning letters and science being latin words hibernized litera lietar liber leabar lego leagmi scribo scribmi penna penn etc etc it is an unaccountable oversight in oflaherty or in the senachies from whom he derived his information to give the name of taible filea to those wooden tables upon which it is pretended the pagan irish wrote taible if it is not derived from the english word table certainly owes its origin to the tabula of the romans had the credulous antiquary used the irish clar he might have avoided a circumstance which bears hard upon his own system  leave no room to doubt that they were taught first to read and write by persons who spoke the roman language but as the romans never entered ireland it is certain that the irish did not receive those terms immediately from that nation the first preachers of the gospel in ireland who had their education at rome were consequently those who introduced into that country the knowledge of letters and the roman terms by which their different uses were expressed  from their want of written monuments in vain continues innes has oflaherty ogygia xxx  and the ingenious father might have added many other irish writers affirmed that ireland is

these books are given to the public with literal translations and documents to prove their authority their age and where they have been preserved through so long a series of ages the learned ware

the psalter in another place ware de presulibus hiberniae  it must have been written after the commencement of the eleventh age  from the form of their alphabet the arbitrary order in which the irish of the middle ages placed their alphabet and the fanciful appellations they gave them prove only that the hibernian senachies formed a very early design to deceive the world on the article of their antiquities but arguments arising from those two circumstances can only deceive those who have not compared old irish manuscripts with the records of any other nation in europe prior to the invention of printing the perfect indentity observable in the forms of the letters in both sufficiently confutes this idle tale unless we are to suppose that the irish and not the romans humanized and taught letters to all the european nations  from the improbability of their assertions it is unnecessary with bolandus and innes to pursue the abettors of the pretended literature of ireland before the mission of st patrick through all the maze of a contest in which positive assertions on the side of the latter supply the place of argument to a brief detail of some other unanswerable objections advanced by the two learned writers we shall annex some additional observations to put an end for ever to the dispute keating oflaherty and toland upon the authority of the book of lecan a manuscript scarcely three hundred and fifty years old affirm that one phenius farsa invented the hebrew greek latin and irish alphabets together with the ogum of ireland little more than a century after the universal deluge a legend which says that the greek alphabet was invented many ages before cecrops and cadmus and the latin characters seventeen centuries before the romans were a people is too ridiculous to deserve any serious consideration but this idle story is not more pregnant with absurdity than the mention that is made of adam cain noah the deluge moses pharaoh and many other names and transactions in the old testament in annals said to have been written many ages before christianity introduced into europe any knowledge of the jewish history and antiquities  the ogum a species of stenography the irish being in some measure obliged to acknowledge that the bethluisnion notwithstanding the arbitrary transportation of the letters and the puerile fancy of imposing upon them the names of trees by the bards and senachies of the middle ages was borrowed from the latin still continue to insist that their ancestors in remote antiquity made use of characters distinguished by the name of ogum ogum is a word which has no affinity with any other in the irish language and seems therefore to have been a cantname imposed upon a species of stenography or cipher in which the old irish like many other nations wrote their secrets sir james ware whose authority is often cited to prove the existence of the ogum shows plainly that it was a kind of short hand varied according to the fancy of those that used it and consequently that it did not merit the title of an alphabet praeter caracteres vulgares utebantur veteres hiberni variis occultls scribendi formulis seu artificiis

or oflaherty durst in the seventeenth age give a complete turn to the irish antiquities but that no such system was formed is demonstrable from the silence concerning the times of heathenism in the most ancient annals of ireland of the existence of which we have any satisfactory proof these are the annals of ulster tigernach and innisfail all of which begin the history of ireland about the middle of the fifth age and end in the eleventh century vid waraeum de scriptoribus hiberniae passim   decisive proof against the pretended literature of the old irish to close with one decisive argument this controversy it is to be observed that the settlement of the milesians under the name of scots in ireland about a thousand years before the christian era is the capital point established by the pretended literature of the heathen irish should this early settlement be once ascertained it naturally ought to follow that the british scots derived their blood from those of ireland if they did they must have carried with them to caledonia that learning science and civility which had made so great a progress in their mother country before they transmigrated from it but nothing is more certain than that the british scots were an illiterate people and involved in barbarism even after st patricks mission to the scots of ireland the abettors of the irish antiquities are then reduced into this dilemma either the scots of north britain did not derive their origin from ireland or else the irish had not any knowledge of letters when the british scots transmigrated from their country if the first position is true the whole credit of the milesian story is at an end if the latter on the other hand is the fact no memory remains in ireland of transactions prior to the mission of st

who understood the ancient galic had not given room to suspect that they themselves were conscious of those impostures by their concealing from the public those monuments of their ancient history from which they pretend to derive their information but had they given them to the world it is highly probable that external argument would be very unnecessary to prove that the literature of ireland commenced with the mission of st patrick  irish writers reprehended it is a matter of some wonder that the irish remain so long wedded to a ridiculous system of antiquities which throws the reproach of credulity upon their nation every other polished people who in the times of ignorance had set up high schemes of antiquity have now extricated their history from the fables of their dark ages had there been a scarcity of men of abilities and learning in ireland some excuse might be framed for this blind attachment to the legends of the bards but as that country has produced very able men and qualified to form a solid foundation for a true history of their ancestors they deserve to be severely animadverted upon for not rescuing their antiquities from that obscurity and fiction in which they have been involved by some modern prejudiced and injudicious writers  antiquities of the british and irish scots preliminary observations general observation the dark regions of irish antiquity

a metaphor is haunted by goblins and strange forms which distract the attention and offend the eye to encounter the absurdities which the more ancient irish posses for the annals of their remote ages is not an arduous but a disagreeable and tedious task the field is ample but it produces no laurels the combat is not dangerous but the victory will be attended by no same but the professed design of this work gives propriety to a minute inquiry into the pretensions of ireland to high antiquities and the public it is hoped will forgive the prolixity of the disquisition on account of the necessity which has imposed so dry a subject upon the author  conclusions against the domestic accounts of the irish from the principles already established we may draw the following just conclusions that the history of the milesian colony which it is pretended transmigrated from spain into ireland under the conduct of heremon and heber is absolutely unworthy of any credit that the long list of kings who are said to have held the scepter of ireland for thirteen centuries before the christian era had their existence only in the distempered fancies of the bards of latter ages and in short that every thing related in their domestic annals concerning the irish prior to the mission of st patrick ought to be banished to the region of fiction and romance whatever dreamers in remote antiquities may be pleased to say it is an indisputable fact that the transactions of a nation illiterate in itself and too distant or obscure to be distinctly seen by foreign writers must for ever lie buried in oblivion the irish we have already seen were so far from having the advantage of the greeks and romans in an earlier knowledge of letters ken geneal pref p     that on the contrary they remained much longer in ignorance than the inhabitants of the regions of the west and north whom the latter of those illustrious nations subdued and humanized  history of ireland commences with st patrick the only means the old irish had to preserve the memory of their actions were the rhimes of the bards a race of men retained by the illiterate nations descended from the great celtic stock without insisting on the known uncertainty of history in rhyme we may affirm that a dull narrative of facts in verse could never take hold of the human mind in a degree sufficient to transmit a knowledge of events by oral tradition through any considerable length of time granting then every possible indulgence to the traditionary history of ireland we cannot admit that it extends much beyond the middle of the fifth age if even to record the rhimes of the heathen bards had been the first use made of the alphabet introduced by st patrick but as it is not in any degree probable that the first converts in ireland would employ their time in collecting and recording historical poems which were tinctured perhaps with the ancient superstition we may naturally place the commencement of the fabulous as well as of the true history of that island posterior to the introduction of christianity  spanish extraction of the irish examined and confuted spanish extraction of the irish before the christian era the irish annalists have for many ages adhered invariably to the pretended descent of their nation from the old spaniards the confidence with which they have always spoken on this subject induced some learned men who gave no credit to an early knowledge of letters in ireland to suppose that there was some foundation in fact for a story concerning which tradition had brought intimations from every quarter but to those who have well considered the state of ancient europe it will appear just as improbable that the spaniards could transport themselves into ireland before the christian era as it is impossible to believe that any memory of that event had it actually happened could have been preserved by tradition to the introduction of letters by st patrick  highly improbable it does not appear that much of the knowledge of the arts of civil life was extended to the inhabitants of the mountains of asturia and gallicia from the settlement established by the phoenicians in the island of gades so far were

english antiquaries the antiquaries of england either did not examine with attention the origin of the scots or averse to enter into a contest with the irish about a matter in which their own nation

after all the efforts of augustus in person or by his lieutenants antistius furnius carisius and agrippa the cantabri collected a body of men committed themselves to the ocean and seized upon ireland from a natural partiality for his countrymen he would have treated the irish with more decency and respect  tacitus cornelius tacitus wrote the life of agricola before the conclusion of the first age agricola had formed a plan to reduce ireland under the roman yoke the low idea that great commander entertained of the number and valor of the irish is an unanswerable proof that the cantabric descent of that nation is a mere fiction had any considerable body of those brave spaniards who fought against augustus and his lieutenants transmigrated into ireland agricola could not suppose that a single legion was sufficient to subjugate and maintain the conquest of that island it is idle in short to expect from tacitus any support to innes spanish system the celebrated writer from the best

the scots a valiant body of foreigners were settled among them before the time of that writer it is difficult to comprehend why a mixture of foreign blood should be necessary to make the irish a warlike people if the situation of their country secured them from invasion the civil dissentions arising from their being divided into a number of petty septs would have undoubtedly kindled and preserved a martial spirit among them but if a colony from abroad was requisite to entitle the inhabitants of ireland to the character of a brave race of men it is more natural to suppose that some of the britons of the south or of the caledonians of the north settled among them than emigrants from cantabria tacitus says and indeed it is common sense that many britons fled into ireland from the tyranny of the romans  ptolomy ptolemy who wrote under the antonines has not once mentioned the scots though he is very minute with regard to inferior tribes settled in ireland the geographer found in the lesser britain the brigantes vellabori cauci and menapii but the redoubtable scots of cantabria totally escaped his notice camden willing to humor the irish in their pretensions to a spanish extract has observed that the lucensii and concani were neighbors in spain as the luceni and gongani were in hibernia if this is an argument others of the same kind and of equal force may be produced to oppose it the cauci and menapii were neighbors in germany and so were tribes of the same name according to ptolemy in ireland shall we then bring some irish tribes from cantabria others from germany transport the brigantes from south britain and totally exclude all emigrants from caledonia which is within a few leagues of the irish shore camdens observation might have been extended further the iberians and albanians were contiguous to one another in asia the hibernians and albanians possessed the british isles divided from one another by a very narrow channel and ought we from that circumstance to infer that the caledonians and irish came from the shores of the caspian  orosius in the days of orosius the irish were distinguished by the name of scottish clans orosius does not say from whence these scottish tribes transmigrated into ireland though a spaniard himself he has not mentioned in treating of the cantabric war a circumstance that would have done honor to his country that a great body of the cantabri rather than submit to augustus or to skulk in mountains and deserts or throw in despair their lives away like many of their countrymen committed themselves to the ocean and acquired in ireland better settlements than those for which they contended with so much unavailing bravery against the romans  florus florus is another writer of spanish extraction he was evidently partial to the cantabri but he does not even furnish an obscure hint that either of the two warlike nations who were engaged in the last spanish war against the romans had after their unsuccessful efforts to defend their liberty found new settlements in the neighboring ocean the greatest part of the cantabri according to florus after being hard pressed both by sea and land driven out of their fastnesses hunted down like wild beasts and at last enclosed within lines of circumvallation rescued themselves from slavery by a voluntary death a series of similar misfortunes pursued the asturians after having enclosed themselves within walls they were taken by the armies of rome the whole nation were transplanted from their native mountains to the plain country and an end for ever put to spanish insurrections  the irish not a spanish colony proved from their language in the whole history of the cantabric war it is impossible to find a spanish nation hostile to the romans that were able to equip transports for a colony escape the vigilance of the roman navy and numerous enough to conquer or people ireland in vain has innes availed himself of a pretended analogy between the biscayan dialect and the language of ireland to support his scheme of the spanish extract of the scots that the most ancient inhabitants of galicia were mixed with celtes is a point sufficiently established by the authority of many of the ancients ephorus ingenti magnitudine facit celticam quod illi scilicet celtae pleraque ejus terrae quam nunc iberiam vocamus loca usque ad gades tenuerint

originally spoke in part the same language with the gael who first transmigrated into britain may from the circumstance of the descent common to both nations be inferred the sterility of the mountains of galicia would never invite new settlers whom the bravery of the old inhabitants could not repel they consequently remained an unmixed people and the simplicity of their manners preserved their language from corruption a similar situation had a similar effect on the scots of the british isles the north of scotland received no colonies in any period that can be assigned and the irish remained in a great measure unmixed until the english conquest of their country but notwithstanding circumstances common to the cantabri and the scots of both our isles the language of the latter has less affinity with the modern biscayan than the english tongue has with that of the moguls of the eastern tartary that the language of the mountaineers of galicia and that part of spain which stretches along the bay of biscay bears a near analogy to the language of the old irish has been an axiom universally admitted this has been the last resort the unanswerable argument to which all the irish antiquaries have referred the certainty of the spanish extraction of their nation unfortunately for the old hibernian system a dictionary of the biscayan language is at this moment in the possession of the author of the introduction and he publicly declares that there is less affinity between the biscayan and irish languages than between the latter and the tongue of the most distant nations in the eastern asia the curious may satisfy themselves upon this head by looking into diccionario trilingue del castellano bascuence y latin written by the padre manuel de larramendi and printed in      at st sebastians this discovery seems to confirm the opinion of varro who as he is cited by pliny insinuates that the iberians of spain were of african origin the language of the modern biscayans it is certain bears no affinity to the other european tongues which are radically descended from the ancient celtic the name of iberians given to them in contradistinction to the celtae is a proof of their being a different people lucan seems to insinuate this fact in a line already quoted gallorum celtae miscentes nomen iberis and the venere celtae sociati nomen iberis of silius italicus together with the express testimony of diodorus siculus and appian confirms the opinion   scandinavian extraction of the irish confuted pretended scandinavian descent of the irish confuted if innes had little reason to deduce the scots from spain he had still less to derive them from any of the nations of scandinavia neither he or stillingfleet were able with all their erudition to support a scandinavian migration into ireland in the first age by the authority of any cotemporary writer one argument will be perhaps sufficient to destroy the credit of this part of the ingenious fathers scheme the language of the scandinavians being a branch of the sarmatic is radically different from the hibernian and british galic it must be acknowledged that the ancients sometimes distinguished the germans as well as those nations who inhabited beyond the baltic by the name of scythians but it is extremely puerile to infer from the remote analogy between the name of scythians and scots that the latter nation derived their blood either from the germans or old scandinavians the danes for a similar reason might deduce themselves from the danai of greece and the caledonians of north britain trace themselves to those of the same name in aetolia  innes visioonary argument innes endeavors to support this branch of his system with other arguments the romans says the ingenious writer after the conquest of gaul found means to confine the germans within their own territories being overstocked with numbers at home they were obliged to put to sea and try their fortune beyond the pale of the empire the germans touching on the opposite shore of north britain were probably repulsed by the bravery of the caledonians upon which they steered their course to ireland and made a conquest of that country  from the population of germany the legions of rome it is certain frustrated for some time the attempts which the germans made to extend themselves toward the south in the reign of augustus they crossed the rhine without success and in that of vespasian they aided to no purpose the rebellion of claudius civilis when domitian held the reins of government at rome the germans attempted the conquest of gaul and they gave much trouble to many of his successors in the imperial dignity the romans says cornelius tacitus proximis temporibus triumphati magis quam victi tacit de mor germ cap     rather triumphed over than subdued the germans the victories which the imperial armies gained in their country being attended with more glory than any solid advantage to prevent the incursions of enemies so formidable the romans had recourse to political expedients to weaken their power at home both augustus and tiberius concluded treaties with the suevi and sicambri and transplanted them into the fertile provinces of gaul  confuted it does not appear that germany was overstocked with numbers after the roman legions had excluded their migrating armies from gaul in the attempts of the germans upon that country in the reign of augustus they lost a great number of their bravest soldiers and the expeditions of drusus depopulated whole districts of their country tiberius was not less successful in germany than his brother drusus nor his many victories less destructive to the inhabitants of that country velleius paterculus lib i  after his accession to the imperial dignity his nephew germanicus with eight legions supported by auxiliaries ravaged all that tract of country which lies between the rhine and the elbe and made a general massacre of the whole nation of the marsi germany during that fatal period was involved in civil wars the illtimed animosities between arminius and segestes the ravages of maroboduus and the invasion of the romans made it a scene of unparalleled miseries it is therefore certain that germany in the first century was more depopulated than it was in any former or after period if we except the time in which the franks allemans and lombards evacuated their territories to settle themselves in more fertile countries it must be confessed that several tribes in the northeast angle of scotland have preserved in their traditions and the genealogical histories of their families pretensions to a german origin the clancattin or the tribe of catti consisting of a great variety of branches the most numerous of which are the macphersans mackintoshes and sutherlands affirm with one consent that the famous catti of ancient germany were their ancestors though this opinion very probably took its rise from an identity of names it is far from being unlikely that some celtogermanic tribes transmigrated at different times into that part of britain which was not subject to the romans but it is morally impossible that a migration sufficient to people caledonia and ireland could have happened without falling within the knowledge of the writers of rome who certainly extended their enquiries to the transactions of the wild nations on the frontiers of the empire   the irish descended of the british gael it appears upon the whole that no colonies came to ireland either from spain or the north of europe between the commencement of the christian era and the close of the third century when the scots are mentioned by porphyrius for the first time that the scots came from either of those countries by a long voyage to ireland prior to the first century is sufficiently contradicted by the known barbarism of the old hibernians as well as of all other nations whom an intercourse with the romans had not humanized we must have recourse in the last resort to the caledonian britons for the genuine origin of the irish their name of gael their language the conformity of their manners and customs with those of the old britons all concur in proving beyond any possibility of reply that the irish are the posterity of the gauls or gael who after having traversed the island of great britain passed over in a very early period into ireland from the promontories of galloway and cantire  irish extraction of the scots examined general reflections general observation nations find it difficult to divest themselves of a

the glory of the roman name permit it that able commander says tacitus might find in those friths a proper boundary for his conquests in britain ac si virtus exercituum et romani nominis gloria pateretur inventus in ipsa britannia terminus tacit vit agric xxiii  agricola in the fifth year of his expeditions shipping his army in the clyde attacked nations till then unknown in that part of caledonia which lies over against ireland after several successful engagements he stationed some of his troops there to be in readiness for an irish expedition eamque partem britanniae quae hiberniam aspicit copiis intravit in spem magis quam ob formidinem tacit vit agric xxiv   first argument the counties of dumbarton and argyle were the theater of war in agricolas fifth campaign the inhabitants were so numerous that for a whole summer they gave ample employment to the roman army and that at a time when by the testimony of agricola himself saepe ex eo audivi legione una et modicis auxiliis debellari obtinerique hiberniam posse tacit vit agric xxiv  a single legion was sufficient not only to subdue but also to secure the conquest of ireland  second argument in vain will it be objected that the roman commander might have been mistaken in his calculation of the internal strength of ireland he had in his camp an irish prince who was no stranger to the state of his own country should it be supposed that this exile from a desire of inducing agricola to undertake an expedition which might reestablish himself in his dominions gave a false account of ireland the roman was too prudent to rely altogether on the intelligence of the hibernian fugitive the ports of ireland were in those times better known than those of britain and agricola must have consulted those who traded into that country concerning the force of an island which he intended to invade tacit vit agric xxiv   third argument we may therefore conclude that agricola formed upon good intelligence a just idea of the state of ireland and consequently that it was very thinly peopled or that the military character of its inhabitants on account of their extreme barbarism was very low in either of these situations it is not in any degree probable that the irish in the days of domitian would have made any attempts to settle in caledonia or that those whom one legion was sufficient to subdue at home could make conquests abroad among a people who employed the whole force of the roman army  fourth argument it is difficult to ascertain with exactness the number of the troops of agricola in his caledonian expedition josephus says that there were four legions stationed in britain in the days of domitian we learn from tacitus that agricola at one period of the caledonion war divided his army into three bodies the enemy attacked one of those divisions consisting of the ninth legion which according to the established maxim of the romans must have been supported by a proportionable number of auxiliaries upon the whole we may conclude that the two counties of argyle and dumbarton opposed for a campaign thrice the number of troops that according to agricolas opinion was sufficient to conquer the whole kingdom of ireland  fifth argument had there been in the time of agricola an hibernian colony settled in the western caledonia who had resolution and numbers sufficient to oppose that great man it is impossible that their mother country could have been represented by him in so despicable a light neither is it probable that tacitus in his short account of the irish nation where he observes that their genius and manners did not differ materially from the britons ingenia cultusque hominum haud multum a britannia differunt tacit vit agric xxiv  would have omitted to say that the western caledonians derived their blood from ireland had that actually been the case the celebrated writer on the contrary gave it as his opinion that the caledonians in the most extensive sense of that name and consequently the inhabitants of argyle and dumbarton were of german extract caledoniam habitantium rutilae comae magni artus germanicam originem asseverant tacit vit agric xi   irish fables on the subject the irish upon the authority of those annals whose credit has been already destroyed affirm that their ancestors in the days of agricola as well as in subsequent periods were the life and strength of the caledonian armies oflaherty in ogygia  it will perhaps be thought unnecessary to confute these unauthorized assertions after what has been already said concerning the faith due to irish history before the time of st patrick but to give every advantage to the zealous abetters of the old system we shall examine this tale without insisting on the impossibility that even tradition could extend to ireland in the first century  improbable crimothan the first it would appear held the reins of government in ireland when agricola carried the roman arms into caledonia this monarch transported an army into north britain aided the caledonians against the romans and after the departure of agricola returned to ireland laden with spoils and foreign trophies tacitus was extremely unjust to the happy valor of crimothan against the romans the illustrious crimothan the supreme king of ireland was it seems inferior in command in birth and valor to the chieftain who was at the head of the caledonian confederacy tacitus expressly affirms that galgacus was superior in those respects to all the leaders of that army which fought agricola near the grampian mountains inter plures duces genere et virtute praestans tacit vit agric xxix   impossible is it not somewhat strange that galgacus has totally neglected to mention his ally crimothan and his hibernian forces in that excellent speech with which he animated the caledonian army tacit vit agric xxx  and why did not tacitus place the provocation given by crimothan among those reasons which agricola assigned for his intended expedition into ireland the celebrated writer the truth is knew nothing of crimothan or his troops and therefore we may conclude that the redoubtable monarch if he ever existed never crossed the irish channel it is upon the whole demonstrable that no part of caledonia was possessed by an hibernian colony in the days of agricola and that the story of the pretended auxiliaries from ireland is absolute fiction  the caledonians suffered little from agricola the losses sustained by the caledonians during the expedition of agricola were perhaps much exaggerated by tacitus but had they suffered even more than the historian affirms they had time to recover their former strength during the long tranquillity which succeeded the departure of agricola and continued to the reign of hadrian the incursions of the caledonians rendered it necessary for that emperor to come in person into britain but that the barbarians suffered very little loss by his arms we may naturally infer from his relinquishing to them all that tract of country which extends from the tine and solway to the scottish friths murum per octingenta millia passuum primus duxit qui barbaros romanosque divideret spartian in hadriano xi   formidable in the reign of pius lollius urbicus in the reign of antoninus pius defeated the caledonians and driving them beyond the forth and clyde excluded them by an earthen wall from the roman britain britannos per lollium urbicum legatum vicit alio muro cespititio submotis barbaris ducto capitolin in antonin v  though repelled by urbicus and afterward by ulpius marcellus in the time of commodus they were far from being reduced so low as to yield a part of their territories to the romans much less to a band of hibernian adventurers before they were chastised by marcellus they had committed  dion cass lib lxxii dreadful devastations in the province and cut off a roman general with the greatest part of his army when severus assumed the purple they harassed the northern provincials with such cruelty and so little intermission that virus lupus was driven to the shameful necessity of purchasing a peace from them with money  dion cass lib lxxv   expedition of severus some years after this ignominious treaty was patched up the roman lieutenant in britain acquainted severus that the northern barbarians were every where in motion that they overran plundered and laid waste the province and that therefore a powerful reinforcement or the presence of the emperor himself was indispensibly necessary  herodian lib iii  severus desirous of adding to the laurels he had acquired in the east and north embraced with pleasure an opportunity so favorable to his ambition though oppressed with the gout and the weight of years he undertook immediately an expedition into britain and arriving with a great army made preparations for a vigorous and decisive campaign the barbarians were alarmed sent an embassy to excuse their conduct and to offer overtures of peace severus for some time amused the ambassadors and when every thing was prepared marched northward with a fixed resolution to exterminate the whole nation of the caledonians  attended with no success but the flattering hopes of severus vanished into air after the most vigorous exertions of courage conduct and force after sustaining incredible fatigues with amazing patience and the loss of fifty thousand men he was at last reduced to the old and inglorious expedient of building a wall to exclude from the province those barbarians whom he could neither extirpate or subdue  dion cass lib lxxvi  we may therefore infer from this circumstance that the caledonians after all the toil and military efforts of severus so far from being annihilated or even much weakened or humbled continued a very formidable enemy  milesian fictions some irish annalists affirm that the picts from the commencement of their history through a long series of ages were tributary to the milesian scots of ireland it is observable that the pretended records from which the incredible tale is extracted make no mention of the caledonian name which circumstance is very unfavourable to the credit of the annals of ireland the inhabitants of north britain ceased to be distinguished by the name of caledonians about the close of the fourth age so that the milesian system must have been fabricated in a period so modern as to place the fourth century beyond the reach of tradition but by whatever name the northern britons were distinguished it is reasonable to suppose that the monarch of ireland would have sent auxiliaries to his distressed vassals when severus threatened the whole nation with extirpation herodian and dion cassius then were very unjust to his hibernian majesty for neither he or his forces are once mentioned in the minute account given by those historians of the caledonian war the roman writers with one consent seem to have entered into a conspiracy against the military fame of the royal line of heremon in vain did crimothan discomfit legions in britain in vain did the redoubtable nial carry his victorious arms to the banks of the loire it was to no purpose that dathy dathy was an irish prince who according to the hibernian senachies peretrated with an army to the alps and was killed by a flash of lightning at the foot of thse mountains dathy though placed beyond christianity in ireland derives his name from david the son of jesse which of itself proves that the exploits of dathy were of the figmenta posteriorum seculorum of ware  whom heaven alone could subdue penetrated to the foot of the alps foreign writers with a scandalous partiality not only concealed the exploits but even the very names of those heroes  state of caledonia from severus to the appearance of the scots in the long period which intervened between the accession of the sons of severus to the imperial dignity and the middle of the fourth age the caledonians were not once attacked within their own territories by the roman armies the exploits of carausius are mere fiction and the feats of constantine and his father chlorus in caledonia existed only in the rants of ecclesiastical panegyrists the frequent contests for the purple between men sometimes called emperors and sometimes tyrants and usurpers in proportion as they were near or far distant from the capital the public distractions which arose naturally from these disputes the growing imbecility of the empire and the invasions of the barbarians of the northern europe diverted the attention of the romans from caledonia in a period so long and of such tranquillity the inhabitants of north britain instead of declining must have greatly multiplied their numbers in the tenth consulship of constantius the son of constantine we meet with the scots a formidable nation in britain ammianus marcellinus who found them first in the island does not furnish one obscure hint that they derived their blood from a foreign country the historian on the contrary gives to them and the picts the character of wild nations plainly in opposition to those britons whom the romans had subdued and humanized consulatu vero constantii decies terque juliani in britanniis cum scotorum pictorumque gentium ferarum excursus etc ammianus marcellinus lib xx   proved from various arguments first argument bid is the first writer who positively affirms that the scots of britain derived their origin from those of ireland whether they originally obtained from the picts the principality of iargael or argyle by force or treaty was a point which all his historical and traditional knowledge did not enable the venerable anglosaxon to determine the incapacity of bid who lived so near the pretended transmigration of the irish to solve this difficulty is a kind of demonstration that the whole story is a fiction imposed upon that credulous though pious writer  second argument if the picts were so seeble that a band of irish adventurers could tear from them one third of their dominions how came they so frequently to provoke the roman legions and harass the provincials from the time of chlorus to the total dereliction of britain by honorius to invade the territories of a warlike and disciplined people when they suffered a great part of their own to be wrested from them by a despicable enemy is a folly too absurd to gain any credit but perhaps the picts gave the district of argyle to their allies of ireland in consideration of services against the romans these services were extremely unnecessary for the romans till provoked by incursions were very inoffensive toward the barbarians beyond the walls nations in short have been known to receive foreigners into the bosom of their country to repel invasions but it is ridiculous to think that any people would have recourse to so dangerous an expedient for the pleasure of harrassing neighbors who did not in any degree offend them  third argument it is difficult for the unprejudiced part of mankind to believe that a colony sufficient to occupy the western highlands and isles could have wafted themselves their wives and children at once from ireland into the northern britain in curraghs or miserable skiffs whose hulls of wicker were wrapped up in a cows hide in these wretched vessels it is true an irregular communication was kept up between both the islands but the navigation was dangerous and performed only in the fairest days of summer mare quod britanniam et hiberniam interluit undosum et inquietum toto in anno non nisi aestivis pauculis diebus est navigabile navigant autem viminiis alveis quos circumdant ambitione tergorum bubulinorum solin xxxv  the fertility of the soil of iarghael could never be an inducement to an irish migration into that division of caledonia if poverty or their being overstocked with numbers compelled the inhabitants of the pretended dalrietta or the route in the county of antrim to go in quest of foreign settlements they ought in common prudence to have tried their fortune in the southern division of their own country and not in the sterile mountains of the western caledonia  fourth argument the irish must have been wonderfully improved in military knowledge from the days of agricola if it was more difficult in the fourth century to extort part of their dominions from them than from the caledonians who had better opportunies to be enured to arms turgesius and his norwegians did not find in an after age that the irish were so obstinately tenacious of their fertile lands as the posterity of the picts were of their own barren country when repeatedly attacked by all the efforts of scandinavia  fifth argument should it be supposed that a band of adventurers were expelled from ulster by the pressure of the southern irish it is difficult to account how the picts of britain should receive the fugitives either generosity or selfishness would have prompted them like the earl of pembroke to assist the exiles in recovering their territories and by that means to endeavor to conquer a part of a fine country for themselves but the picts were it seems strangers to the most common maxims of policy for according to the system under consideration they must have been of all nations the most tame prodigal and imprudent in short if the irish scots voluntarily abandoned one of the best districts of ireland to settle in one of the most sterile divisions of north britain they must have been more absurd than the hibernians of latter ages have been perhaps very unjustly represented if by violence they were driven from home the picts deserve the same character for permitting a band of vagabonds to seize upon one third of their dominions  sixth argument the saxon auxiliaries of vortigern were not so modest as the irish scots or else the picts were a people of much less spirit than the southern britons when the saxons raised their demands to an unreasonable height the britons disputed with them every inch of ground they were at last overpowered but it was after such an expense of time and blood that glory covered them in the midst of ruin had the hibernian mercenaries encroached upon the picts as the saxons did on the britons we might naturally suppose that the latter instead of carrying war and desolation into a foreign country in conjunction with the scots would have found employment for their arms at home the unanimity in expedition which subsisted for ages between the caledonian nations is proof sufficient that they derived their origin from one and the same source  the pretended testimony of foreign writers examined and confuted general reflections first appearance of the scots about the middle of the fourth age the unconquered barbarians of caledonia became known to the romans under the name of picts and scots marcellinus who is the first historian who met them in britain was an absolute stranger to their being a new people who then made their appearance in the island amm marcell lib xx the very learned and ingenious dr macpherson has in his critical dissertation on the british and irish scots proved against the bishop of st asaph that ammianus marcellinus does not furnish even an obscure hint that the scots were a new people in britain in the reign of constantius  in the period of time between the expedition of julius agricola and the reign of constantius we have already seen that the improbability of the transmigration of a foreign colony into north britain is so great that without positive evidence the story can never be believed the abettors of the hibernian antiquities finding that the credit of the domestic annals of ireland could never establish this fact had recourse to some passages of foreign writers which they wrested to their purpose  the impossibility of an irish migration into north britain between the reign of constantius and the dereliction of britain by honorius is supported by arguments equally strong with those we have produced for the period before the first of those emperors those who after constantius succeeded to the imperial purple till the days of valentinian were rather insulted than feared by the wild nations of caledonia the latter therefore were under no necessity to implore the assistance of foreign auxiliaries neither can we suppose that they would cede to a pitiful band of irish barbarians any part of those territories which they defended with so much spirit against the disciplined armies of the lords of the world  claudian claudians pretended authority the supporters of the hibernian extraction of the british scots pretend to have found in claudian a direct proof of their system that poet in his panegyric on theodosius has the following lines quid rigor aeternus coeli quid sidera prosunt ignotumque fretum maduerunt saxone fuso orcades incoluit pictorum sanguine thule scottorum cumulos flevit glacialis ierne claudian de quart consulat honorii  but we may venture to affirm that there is nothing in this passage conclusive in favor of the old milesian tale claudian indulged all the wantonness of a poetical fancy in this panegyric on theodosius it was the poets imagination only that warmed thule with pictish blood moistened the sands of orkney with saxon gore and thawed the frozen ierne into tears for the slaughter of the scots it is idle in short to search for fact in the hyperboles of poetry marcellinus though particularly fond of theodosius has not recorded these prodigies of valor even latinus pacatius though a panegyrist says no more than that the scot was driven back to his native fens redactum in paludes suas scottum latin pacat in panegyr theod  and the saxons destroyed in conflicts by sea  examined without insisting upon what shall hereafter appear at least probable that ireland is not meant by the ierne of claudian we may aver that there is nothing in these verses decisive concerning the origin of the scots if the hibernians were of caledonian extract if from the ancient ties of consanguinity a friendly intercourse was maintained between the irish and the inhabitants of albany a person of a less warm imagination than claudian might suppose that the former sincerely lamented the misfortunes of their mother nation should it be admitted that the scots of valentinians time were skilled in maritime affairs and had passed from ireland into north britain they ought after theodosius had chased them to their vessels to have directed their flight to their native island on the contrary claudians hero or rather claudian himself pursues them sword in hand into the hyperborean ocean scottumque vago mucrone secutus fregit hyperboreas remis audacibus undas    and confuted in claudians panegyric on stilicho there is a passage which has been often transcribed with triumph in opposition to the antiquity of the british scots me quoque vicinis pereuntem gentibus inquit munivit stilico totam cum scottus iernam movit et infesto spumavit remige tethys illius affectum curis ne bella timerem scottica nec pictum tremerem nec litore toto prospicerem dubiis venientem saxona ventis britain is here personified she makes her acknowledgments to stilicho for his services to her at a very perilous conjuncture she owed her safety to that able commander when the scot had put all ierna in motion when the ocean was agitated into a foam by hostile oars he delivered her from the terrors of a scottish war from pictish incursions and from beholding piratical squadrons of saxons coming to her coasts with the veering winds  it will be hereafter shown that the name of ierna may without any violence be applied to the western division of scotland including the isles but should the ierna of claudian be the same with ireland it would little avail the abettors of that system which we now oppose there is no necessity to believe that the poet adhered to historical fact virgil without any authority extended the victories of augustus to nations whom neither he nor his lieutenants ever looked in the face incedunt victae longo ordine gentes hic nomadum genus et discinctos mulciber asros hic lelegas carasque sagittiferosque gelonos finxerat euphrates ibat jam mollior undis indomitique dahae virg aeneid viii super garamantas et indos proferet imperium jacet extra sidera tellus extra anni solisque vias  hujus in adventum jam nunc et caspia regna responsis horrent divum et maeotia tellus virg aeneid vi  and why should not the same privilege of invention exaggeration and flattery be allowed to the laureat of honorius  a critical remark not to insist upon the improbability that the irish in that state of barbarism in which they were certainly involved toward the close of the fourth age could annually transport armies into britain we may safely affirm that the tethys of claudian was rather agitated into a foam by saxon than by hibernian oars the saxons in the days of honorius were in some measure a maritime people tethys signifies the ocean the sea between germany and england has some right to that title but the channel between ireland and caledonia was never dignified with so high a name this criticism is sufficient to destroy the whole force of the argument drawn from claudian it appears not from history that the scots ever infested the roman division of britain by sea constantine appointed an officer called comes littoris saxonici to take the charge of part of the coast of the province which was most exposed to the piratical depredations of the saxons but of a comes littoris scottici hibernici we have never heard  conclusive arguments if the province of valentia comprehended the country between the walls why did not the hibernian scots land every other season in galloway how came not the irish rovers to attempt a descent in either of the divisions of wales or in cumberland was not the coast of lancashire almost as near to the isle of man which according to orosius was possessed by scottish tribes as any part of the continent of caledonia was to ireland why in the name of wonder was a bulwark of turf or stone a better security against the irish scots than against the saxons of friezeland or holland as both were transmarine nations with respect to the province why did the irish with a peculiar absurdity land always on the wrong side of the roman walls which they must have scaled or destroyed before they could penetrate into the province it is impossible to believe that all their expeditions could have been so illconcerted and this consideration alone is sufficient to demonstrate that the scots whom the roman writers so often mention were inhabitants of caledonia walls were constructed and legions employed to defend the province from their incursions but fleets were never fitted out to intercept or destroy them at sea  orosius  isidorus the hibernian system being deprived of every support from claudian let us next examine some passages of other ancient authors whom our adversaries have raised to their aid orosius if orosius a spanish priest found the scots in ireland about the beginning of the fifth age marcellinus met with them in britain about the middle of the third ammian marcellin lib xx  isidorus isidore of seville who flourished in the seventh age says that in his time ireland was indiscriminately called scottia and hibernia and that the latter name proceeded from its lying over against iberia and the cantabric ocean scottia eadem et hibernia proxima britanniae insula sed situ foecundior haec ab africo in boream porrigitur cujus parts priores iberiam et cantabricum oceanum intendunt unde et ibernia dicta scottia autem quod ab scottorum gentibus colitur isidor orig lib xiv   examined on this etymon of hibernia great weight is laid by the abettors of the cantabric descent of the irish should the name of hibernia arise from the position of ireland with respect to iberia mauritania and a part of gaul ought to have obtained the same appellation from a similar situation with regard to spain ireland itself from a parity of reason ought to have a name resembling that of britain which lies so near it rather than from iberia divided from it by an immense ocean the bishop of seville the truth is knew very little about ireland or its inhabitants and his ridiculous derivation of the name of scots is a lasting monument of his talent in etymology scotti propria lingua nomen habent a picto corpore eo quod aculeis erreis cum atramento variarum figurarum stigmata annotentur isidor orig lib ix   and confuted isidore is not the first learned prelate who gave to ireland the name of scottia a bishop of canterbury about the year  0  bestowed upon that island the same appellation we shall not dispute with the irish that their country received the name of scottia some centuries before it was appropriated to caledonia but no argument can arise in favor of their superior antiquity from that priority a colony of the ancient grecians possessed themselves of a district of the lesser asia which afterward obtained the name of ionia that colony and their ancestors in greece for a series of ages were called ionians but their territories in europe never possessed the appellation of ionia and from that circumstance will any man conclude that the ionians of ephesus and miletus were more ancient than those of attica  gildas gildas examined the testimony of gildas seems at first sight more favorable to the hibernian system than that of isidore this writer with an irascible disposition soured by the misfortunes of the times was querulous wrathful scurrilous and at no less enmity with the whole world than with the enemies of his country the scots picts and saxons ex in britannia so gildas and bid in imitation of the romans called that part of the island which had been subject to the empire duabus gentibus transmarinis vehementer saevis scottorum a circo pictorum ab aquilone calcabilis multos stupet gemitque per annos  tum erumpens grexatulorum saxnes de cubili leaenae barbariae tribus etc then that kennel of whelps  the saxons issued out upon us from the den of the barbarous lioness and in another place this passionate writer says the fierce saxns of ever execrable memory detested by god and man were admitted into the island like so many wolves into the fold  it is almost needless to observe that gildas calls the scots and picts transmarine nations as bede has explained away that appellation in a manner that is not unfavourable to the system which we endeavor to establish transmarinas autem dicimus hs gentes non quod extra britaniam essent positae sed quia a part brittonum erant remotae duobus sinibus maris interjacentibus bid hist lib i c     the strength of the argument against us arises from the epithet of hibernian robbers with which the passionate gildas has dignified the ancestors of the scots revertuntur ergo impudentes grassatores hiberni domus post no multum temporis reversuri  not to insist upon the more proper reading of the passage as it is restored by dr gale vid gales edition of gildas instead of revertuntur hiberni domus the doctor reads more grammatically hibernas domus that is that the scots after committing their depredations returned home for the nter  which destroys at once the authority in favor of the hibernian descent of the scots we may upon another foundation fairly deny the consequences generally drawn from the vague expression of gildas propertius in one of his elegies gives the epithet of hiberni to the getes of thrace gildas was remarkably fond of expressing himself in the language of poetry his diction from so puerile an affectation partakes more of the turgid declamation of tragedy than of the precision and simplicity of a grave historian had he by way of sarcasm on the severity of the climate of caledonia bestowed the epithet of hiberni on its inhabitants he should not have written improperly unpoetically or unlike his own manner  and confuted the british and irish scots spoke the same language wore the same kind of dress and were distinguished by every characteristical mark necessary to make a foreigner believe that both nations were originally the same people whether the scots of hibernia or those of albania were the most ancient every one was at freedom to resolve in his own way had gildas positively decided in favor of the former his authority can go no further than his confessed knowledge in antiquities but it appears from other circumstances that the british writer was a very bad antiquary the scots according to him infested for the first time the roman province when maximus withdrew the legions from britain there is not perhaps any piece of ancient history better ascertained than that a tribe of the caledonians under the name of scots made incursions into the province near seventy years before the rebellion of maximus the account which gildas gives of the roman walls betrays his ignorance in the tradition as well as history of his own country and therefore it is difficult to say why the testimony of such a writer had it even been less equivocal should be thought decisive concerning the antiquities of a people to whose tradition and history he must in the nature of things have been an absolute stranger  bid bedes bid a saxon monk flourished in the monastery of girwy upon the tyne about the commencement of the seventh century and displayed uncommon talents and learning for the age in which he lived in his history of the saxon churches the venerable writer distinguishes with precision the british scots from those of ireland and positively affirms that the former derived their blood and origin from the latter bid did not confine his genealogical enquiries to the scots he endeavored to trace all the british nations to their respective origins  genealogical account of the british nations the britons properly so called says he were the first inhabitants of this island and they originally transmigrated from the armorican division of gaul the picts in an after age seized upon north britain for to the name of caledonia the anglosaxon was an absolute stranger after the britons and picts had possessed the island for some ages britain in its northern division received a third nation from ireland under the conduct of reuda whether the irish scots obtained settlements of the picts by force or favor was a point which bid could not determine he was however informed that they were called dalreudini from their illustrious leader reuda and from the galic word deal which according to the venerable writer signified a portion or division of a country duce reuda de hibernia egressi vel amicitia vel ferro sibimet inter eos pictos sede quas hactenus habent vindicarunt a quo duce hodie dalreudini vocantur  it is to be observed that deal does not signify portion or division   never implicitly adpted it is remarkable that not one english or scottish antiquary ever implicitly adopted every part of the anglosaxons system the picts and scots according to him as separate nations and from very different origins possessed north britain before the commencement of the christian era camden usher the two lloyds stillingfleet innes and many more rejected some one part or other and some the whole of bedes account of the southern britons but all these learned men received without examination his system of the hibernian extraction of the british scots  his mistakes where we have an opportunity to examine bedes account by the criterion of collateral history we find that he has committed a very essential mistake the southern britons were so far from deriving their blood from the inhabitants of armorica that on the contrary the armoricans had transmigrated from britain not many ages before bedes own time if bid therefore was in an error with respect to the origin of a people whose history on account of their connection with the romans was known it is much more probable that he knew nothing certain concerning the antiquities of a nation who had not among them the means of preserving with any certainty the memory of events  arise from various causes from the political and religious prejudices which prevailed in the days of bid between the british scots and the saxons we may conclude that the venerable writer had very little conversation with the antiquaries or senachies of the former nation had he even consulted them very little light could be derived from them in an age of ignorance credulity and barbarism bid on the other hand entertained a friendly partiality for the scots of ireland that people were in his time remarkable for monkish learning and ascetic austerities which together with their benevolence and hospitality to the saxon students who flocked into their country recommended them in a very high degree to the venerable anglosaxon bed hist lib iv c     the good man we may take it for granted embraced every opportunity of conversing with those hibernian missionaries and pilgrims who came over in swarms into britain in those days of conversion and religious pilgrimage from them he borrowed all that genealogical erudition which he displays in the beginning of his ecclesiastical history  he received his accounts of the scots from ireland the sudden transition which bid makes from the tale of reuda to a panegyric on ireland furnishes a strong presumption that he derived his information from that quarter having observed in the course of a very favorable description of ireland that no reptile is seen in that country that the air destroys serpents that the leaves of hibernian trees and the shavings of timber are efficacious antidotes against poison after having remarked that the happy island flowed with milk and honey and was not destitute of vines he concludes with a new declaration as if that doctrine had been strongly inculcated upon him by his irish friends that the british scots derived their origin from that fortunate country  confuted it is apparent from another circumstance that bid borrowed his account of the scots from the irish he calls the inhabitants of iargael by the name of dalreudini an appellation utterly unknown to the historians writers of chronicles bards and senachies of scotland though common in the annals of ireland bedes account of the picts being almost word for word what has been handed down in the historical rhimes of ireland keating p  0        furnishes a striking proof of the hibernian origin of the whole of the anglosaxons genealogical tale both the irish and he supposed that the picts were distinguished by that name which according to them is derived from a latin epithet near five complete centuries before the foundation of rome was laid by romulus the system of bid being thus traced to its source the tales of the irish bards and those tales having been already thrown into discredit we may infer that the venerable writers authority concludes nothing for the hibernian descent of the british scots  ushers arguments in support of bid to destroy from another principle the tale of bid and the story of reuda it may not be improper to observe that the learned usher found out that a district in the county of antrim which has for many ages been distinguished by the name of route is the dalriada of the old irish usser brit eccles antiq p   0  dalriada says the ingenious prelate derives its name from cairbreriada the son of conaire who held the scepter of ireland in the third century but we may venture to affirm that usher in this supposition was very much misled rute or reaidh in the old scotch language signifies a ram from the first of these synonimous words the territory in the county of antrim from which it is pretended that the british scots originally transmigrated received the appellation of the route and from the second is to be deduced the name of dalriada literally the valley of the ram  examined usher quotes a patent which is preserved in the tower of london wherein it appears that john king of england granted to allen lord of galloway the territory of dalreth and the island of rachrin which is situated over against that district usser ubi supra  from the syllabication of the two local names in the patent we may conclude that the etymon we have given of dalriada is perfectly just rachrin which may with great propriety be reckoned an appendage to the route signifies the rams promontory in the irish tongue and dalriada itself being expressly called the land of rams in the irish patent mentioned by the primate himself is a circumstance that is decisive in our favor  confuted dalreath or dalreadh which was afterward latinized into dalriada could not possibly according to the genius of the irish language be derived from cairbreriada were it even certain that such a monarch ever existed riada signifies a longhand an appellation joined to the name of cairbre on account of the singular length of his hands the route therefore in propriety of language ought to have been called dalcairbre if it must at any rate receive its name from that pretended monarch  authority of jocelyn and tigernach the primate with all his erudition could only produce the authority of jocelyn and tigernach tigernach carries down his annals to a d  0   in which he died jocelyn compiled a life of st patrick from all the utile tales and traditions he could collect and published it in the year      at the desire of thomas oconnor archbishop of armagh  writers of the eleventh and twelfth ages in support of the irish origin of the scots in britain had these writers even been less notoriously fabulous than they appear to be it is certain that they flourished in too modern a period to know any thing of the transactions of the irish in the dark ages prior to the introduction of christianity and letters by patrick the two writers it is true place the transmigration of the scots into britain on this side of that era but the testimony of the roman writers sufficiently destroys that absurd position ammian marcellin lib xx   exploded tigernach and jocelyn contradicted one another materially and bid who lived more than three centuries before the first of those writers differs toto coelo from both but had all the three concurred in transporting the scots into britain under the same leader and in the same year we might with reason presume that they were all mistaken usher has ascertained the bounds of dalriada or the route in antrim and found its whole extent about thirty miles usser ubi supra  were it even certain that dalriada produced more men th n any district of the same exent in ancient ireland still it is incredible that an army could be mustered there sufficient to subdue the principality of iarghael should the dominion of argyle only comprehend braidalbin cantyre knapdale and lorn the natives must have been an overmatch for the inhabitants of the small country pent up within the river boisy and glenfinneacht should it be admitted that the dalriadans were supported in their expedition into caledonia by some other irish tribes it is reasonable to suppose that the eastern picts would have aided their friends of the west at a time when they confessedly had nothing to fear from any other foreign enemy  nennius  general observations nennius the testimony of nennius deserves little attention he derived his intelligence concerning the origin of the scots from the hibernian senachies sic mihi peritissimi scottorum hibernorum nunaverunt nennius edit rog gale p  0   and their tales have been already examined and exploded the system of irish antiquity which nennius has preserved is in many instances diametrically opposite to those genealogical schemes which the modern writers of ireland have new modelled and adorned and hence an internal proof arises concerning the uncertainty of hibernian annals  conclusive arguments as a concluding argument against the hibernian extraction of the scots it may not be improper to observe that the caledonians might be called hibernians their country in general hibernia and the western division of it ierna or yverdon without deriving their blood from the irish the saxons of england it is well known had their norfolk and suffolk and the appellation of southerons and norlands are not hitherto totally extinguished among the scots the ancient picts in like manner were divided into two great tribes the vecturiones and deucaledones the inhabitants of the northern and southern divisions according to the testimony of marcellinus eo tempore picti in duas gentes divisi deucaledonas et vecturiones ammian marcellin lib xxvii camdenus vir in patria historia illustranda accuratissimus legendum putat deucaledonios velut sic nominatos ab occidua scotiae ora qua deucaledonius oceanus irrumpit   against the hibernian extraction after the caledonians upon the decline of the roman power in the southern britain began to infest the province in separate bodies the two principal tribes in those incursions were distinguished by the names of picts and scots by the historians of the empire if the picts spoke the gaelic or caledonian language they must certainly have called the territories of the scots iar eire erin or ardiar iar signifies the west eir is a corruption of iar erin is the same with the western country and ardiar is the galic name for the western quarter  words all of them expressive of the situation of the country of the scottish tribes in opposition to the pictish division of caledonia if they spoke the ancient british they would have distinguished the country of the scots by the name yverdhon or as it is pronounced yberon or yveron these names being communicated to the romans by the britons or by pictish prisoners it was natural for them to latinize them into ierna jouverna or hibernia in common conversation the western highlands are called by those who speak the galic language iar or the west and when the hebrides are comprehended in that division of scotland the galic appellation of iarin has been always given to the whole the district of atregathel or rather iarghael so often mentioned in the annals of ireland and scotland as the first possessions of the hibernian colonies in britain carries in its name a demonstration of this position as well as a decisive argument against the ancient system of the origin of the scots iarghael literally signifies the westernghael or the scots in opposition to the easternghael or the picts who possessed the shore of the german ocean  of the british scots in the neighborhood of drumalbin a ridge of hills which divided the scottish from the pictish dominions there is a lake which to this day is called erin the river erin or ern rises from that lake and gives its name to a very considerable division of the county of perth in this district there are to be seen several roman camps to this day the romans could not be strangers to the name of a country where their armies remained long enough to leave such lasting memorials of themselves behind juvenal from the soldiers of agricola might have heard of the district of erin which he softened into juverna and the troops of theodosius might have carried the same intelligence to claudian  arguments and proofs against the irish extract of the scots stillingfleet and usher examined stillingfleet confuted in vain has stillingfleet observed that there must have been a sea between britain and the ierna

insist upon that criticism if by ierna we are to understand iar the western division of caledonia from glotta to tarvisium the many extensive arms of the sea which indent that coast will at once remove the learned prelates objection should we suppose that iarin or the western islands of scotland were the ierna of claudian the objection will altogether vanish as many of those islands are at a much greater distance than ireland itself from the continent of caledonia stillingfleet remarks that if strathern in the county of perth should be admitted to be the ierna of claudian it would be ridiculous in the poet to say that the scots put in motion the whole of a small district of their county the bishop did not recollect that it was very common with the ancient poets to put a part of a country for the whole latium is often used for the roman empire mycaene for all the states of greece and thule by claudian himself for north britain quem littus adustae horrescit lybiae et ratibus impervia thule    the argument collected into one point to collect the whole argument on this head into one point of view the scots of britain lived in a cold climate their country was situated to the west of such of their neighbors as had an immediate communication with the romans the irish lay under the same disadvantage of unfriendly seasons and their island was simularly situated the historians and poets of the empire and the geographers of greece and rome exaggerated from ignorance or prejudice the severity of the climate under which both the scottish nations lived from an exact conformity of genius language manners dress situation and climate the scots of both the isles had a much better title to the common appellation of hiberni than italy spain and a considerable part of africa had to the name of hesperia but whether the hibernians of the british soil eumen panegyr  the hibernian robbers of a much later age gildas xv  and the scots vanquished by theodosius claudian de quart consulat honor  derived their origin from ireland or were of caledonian extraction is a point which eumenius claudian and gildas have left undetermined  usher examined it is observed by usher brit eccles antiq p      that albania was not distinguished by the name of scotia prior to the eleventh age the antiquaries of scotland have quoted several passages from bid to refute the observation of the learned prelate but had the remark been perfectly just it is by no means conclusive in favor of the superior antiquity of the hibernian scots were there no scots in ireland prior to the seventh century for then for the first time that country received the name of scotia from isidore and lawrence of canterbury we may turn the primates argument against his own system marcellinus found the scots in britain a whole century before orosius discovered them in ireland and from a parity of reason we might conclude that the british scots are more ancient than the irish friends of the ingenious prelate  and answered the learned usher is not more happy in the argument which he deduces from the appellation of scotia major given to ireland in opposition to the scotia minor of britain donald oneil in oneils letter to pope boniface  a petty king or chieftain of ulster in the fourteenth century and a charter granted by the emperor sigismund to a convent of scots and irish at ratisbon have made that distinction but to a conclusion drawn in favor of the old system from these circumstances it may from a parity of reason be opposed that the hibernians of the age of ptolemy were originally britons and not spaniards because that geographer gave the name of the lesser britain to ireland the inhabitants of hellas by a similar argument ought to have derived their origin from the italian magna grecia that is to speak the language of some of those who are most likely to oppose our system that the greeks who possessed themselves of a part of italy were older than their ancestors in greece  similarity of local names it may be here with great propriety observed that nothing is more deceitful in traducing nations to their origin than arguments deduced from a similarity of local names in different countries strabo thought it an extravagant fancy to derive the spaniards from the iberians of asia yet the asiatic iberia as well as spain had its iberus and arragon cellarius in iberia asiatica  but a conformity in a few particulars is not sufficient to persuade us that the neighbors of the caspian could in an early period transport themselves either by sea or land into the european iberia no more than the albanians of the same division of asia could send colonies to caledonia  furnishes no proof of a common origin italy macedonia asia near caucasus and north britain countries very distant from one another produced four nations promiscuously called albanians nothing can be inferred from this identity but that they all derived their names from the mountainous face of the regions which they respectively possessed dr macphersons dissertation x  in the same manner nothing can be concluded from the name of hiberni given by some writers indiscriminately to the western caledonians and the irish but that both nations lived under the same unfavourable climate and that both were peculiarly distinguished by the same characteristical qualities which naturally arose from their common origin  rise and progress of the fiction general observations in vain have the irish and the abettors of their high antiquities called in the aid of foreign writers to support the pretended hibernian origin of the british scots that part of their history like the exploded milesian tale must rest entirely on the credit of their own domestic annals but that no degree of faith ought to be given to those annals beyond the introduction of letters is a point which we have already very amply discussed the authority of history having failed it is natural to suppose that the adversaries of our system will have recourse to objections arising from reason to do all the justice in our power to the old and popular error concerning the origin of the scots we shall examine with attention those objections before we shall conclude for ever the controversy by arguments which though obvious are new and decisive  on the rise and progress could ancient tradition the belief of ages the positive assertions of english antiquaries and irish annalists and the universal acquiescence of the historians of the british scots be sufficient to establish the credit of the hibernian descent of that nation it must be confessed that it were idle to hope to reconcile the public judgment to a new system so diametrically opposite to the old but we have seen that tradition could not have extended to that period in which the transmigration of the scots is placed and therefore the belief of ages which was founded upon that pretended tradition was no more than a popular error this error rendered venerable by its antiquity misled to say no worse the writers of the annals of ireland and deceived the historians of north britain the antiquaries of england it must be confessed could not be influenced by the prejudices which led astray the writers of both the scottish nations but the former were under no temptation to contradict or expose a tradition which was not disagreeable to themselves though from a very different cause than that which rendered it so highly favored in scotland and ireland  of the hibernoscottish fictions it may not be improper in this place to inquire into the rise and progress of those traditionary fictions which have so much obscured the antiquities of the scots of both the isles when the first dawn of learning rose among those barbarous tribes who had subverted the empire of the romans some scholars more profound than the rest traced the antiquity of their respective nations to illustrious names recorded in ancient history the romans greeks spaniards and other nations who figured in old times were placed at the head of the pedigree of barbarians who but just emerging from illiterate obscurity had lost all memory of their own origin the impostures of the halflearned writers of the middle ages were received with avidity and great credulity by the english french spaniards germans danes and swedes a part of an infatuation so universal must have extended itself to the scots of ireland  cause of the obscurity which involves the ancient irish the letters which st patrick introduced into that island in the fifth age were not employed in recording historical transactions for some centuries posterior to that period the enthusiasm of the times turned all the little literature of the religious of ireland to holier purposes than to register temporal events which from the secluded situation of that country must have been very unimportant miracles visions and those sacred persons who distinguished themselves in the work of conversion employed the whole attention of the monks at a time that the royal line of heremon sat in the midst of obscurity and anarchy on the irish throne the antiquities of the nation being thus left in the hands of illiterate bards and senachies assumed so monstrous a form that the polishing they have received from succeeding writers has scarcely hitherto rendered them fit for the public eye  era of the spanish fiction the fable of the hibernian extraction of the british scots seems to have been fabricated in ireland long before the bards thought of bringing a colony from spain into that country bid in the seventh age had received intelligence of the first of those stories from the irish senachies but his placing it in a period beyond the reach of tradition has thrown absolute discredit upon the whole in the period between bid and nennius who for the first time mentioned the cantabric descent of the scots of ireland some learned bard or monk discovered that spain was called iberia and upon the similarity between that name and hibernia built the whole fabric of the milesian tale to obviate all skepticism concerning a story which wore the face of improbability it became necessary for succeeding writers to give assurances to the world that letters and polite arts were cultivated in ireland no less than seventeen hundred years before its conversion to the christian faith by st patrick  cause of the darkness which covers the british scots when monkish learning flourished in ireland the scots of britain by an uninterrupted series of hostilities with the britons picts and saxons were diverted from cultivating letters which alone could enable them to look back into their antiquities or to transmit any memory of their actions to posterity their exploits in the field died away for want of the means of perpetuating them in the closet the monks of ireland as it was manifest to the whole world that both the scottish nations were originally the same people made an easy acquisition of an illiterate though brave people and obtruded upon the world that system of the origin of the caledonian scots which has been for many ages almost universally received  negative arguments first argument had the more ancient genealogists of the little principality of argadia the principality of iarghael or argyle was called argadia by the monkish writers of the middle ages discovered that there was a considerable district in peloponnesus the name of which so nearly resembled the latinized appellation of their own country it is probable they would have traced their ancestors to an arcadian origin the arcadians were brave and a respectable people in greece  etc strabo l viii  and their being older than jupiter and the moon would have highly recommended them to the scottish senachies  second argument had the first fabricators of the fabulous history of scotland found out that there were albanians in the north of asia albanians in the army of alexander the great and alban senates and kings in italy it is at least doubtful whether they would have condescended to deduce their nation from ireland this conjecture is neither fanciful or extravagant the author of an old scottish chronicle preserved by innes gentes albo crine nascuntur ab assiduis nivibus et ipsius capilli color genti nomen dedit et inde vocantur albani de quibus originem duxerunt scotti et picti innes critical essay append no    having it seems read solinus solin polyhist xxv  derives the picts and scots from the albanian scythians but the monks of ireland found out iberia before the senachies of caledonia had the good fortune to meet either with the scythians or any albanian beyond the limits of their own country  objections answered the irish it may be objected were too obscure and inconsiderable a people in europe to tempt the scots to deduce their origin from them if the story had not actually any foundation in fact especially as their neighbors and enemies to the south traced themselves to an illustrious ancestry of romans and trojans the scots of albany entertained a very different idea of the irish nation hibernian missionaries had converted the greatest part of the scots from the errors of the pagan superstition columba was the great apostle of the picts and became afterward the tutelar saint of the united caledonian kingdoms legions of monks and saints swarmed from ireland into north britain in those days of conversion and religious peregrination it was natural for an illiterate people like the british scots to believe that a nation who produced these holy and very extraordinary men was one of the most illustrious in the world whether the zealous missionaries among other pious frauds endeavored to inculcate on their converts a belief of the stupendous antiquity of the irish nation and the hibernian extraction of the scots to promote the good cause of christianity by procuring to themselves a favorable reception in albany is very difficult to determine that those apostles served in the double capacity of bards and teachers of the faith is apparent from the appellation of chleri chleri from clericus  given in the old poems and traditions of the scots indiscriminately to the irish emigrants of both professions  the hibernian tales inculcated by irish missionaries and bards but be that as it will it is certain that swarms of irish bards accompanied into caledonia those hibernian missionaries who first converted the majority of the picts and scots to christianity it was convenient for the divine that the bard should propagate a belief of the connection between the scots of both the isles and the authority of the former could establish any doctrine in the minds of an ignorant credulous and superstitious people the senachies were impudent the bards formidable and both were eloquent if any skepticism remained against their welltold tales the missionaries destroyed it altogether by the weight of their sanctified character this system once established was propagated and became the traditional belief of after ages the little progress that learning made in scotland when its first histories were written could not enable the zealous abettors of its antiquities to overturn that system of the origin of the nation which had been so long obtruded upon the world and the scottish writers who in a much later period distinguished themselves in critical inquiries into the history of their ancestors were at more pains to adorn the fictions of their predecessors than to expose their absurdities  objections answered some learned men have drawn an argument against our system from the silence of the romans concerning the scots till after the commencement of the fourth age their not being mentioned before that century say they argues strongly that they must have been a new people in britain that this is an unjust conclusion will appear from collateral examples tacitus has not mentioned any national names in north britain but those of caledonii and horestii yet it is certain that the vecturiones and deucaledones of marcellinus the maeatae of dion cassius the gadeni cantae and epidii of ptolemy possessed that country ptolemy it must be confessed knew nothing of the inhabitants of the northern britain under the name of scots he was equally a stranger to the picts maeatae and attacotti but if he has neglected to mention the scots of britain he has been equally unjust to those of ireland a circumstance very strange if that country was as bede says overstocked with tribes of that name before caledonia received any colony from abroad  by collateral examples tacitus in his description of germany has omitted the saxons ptolemy soon after that celebrated historian found that warlike nation on the confines of the chersonesus cimbrica germany is for the first time mentioned by julius caesar and are we to suppose from that circumstance that the inhabitants of that extensive division of europe came in the days of the illustrious writer like a cloud of locusts from an unknown country the franks and allemans were not heard of before the third century yet those nations in whom the catti chauci cherusci agravarii the teutones and the cimbri in a confined sense were lost were never once thought to have been a new people who had enslaved destroyed or expelled the old inhabitants of those territories which they possessed in germany these collateral examples form a complete answer to the objection against our system which arises from the silence of the romans concerning the picts and scots till the beginning of the fourth age  positive proofs proofs of the caledonian extraction of the scots to dwell no longer on negative arguments against the hibernian system we shall proceed to positive proofs of the caledonian extraction of the british scots the very ingenious author of some dissertations lately published has discussed this subject with so much ability and exactness that little is left to be done but to collect into one point of view the most striking of his arguments to these arguments we shall annex some observations to quash for ever a system which had been so long imposed for truth upon the world  first proof alba or albin it has been already observed was the first name given to this island by the gael who transmigrated from belgium into the more elevated country of britain hence proceeded the albion of the greeks and the albium of the roman language the inhabitants of mountainous countries who from their situation have very little intercourse with other nations and who were never subject to a foreign yoke are remarkably tenacious of the local names and their aboriginal customs manners and language we accordingly find that the ancient scots in all the ages to which our information extends agreed in calling scotland alba or albania the highlanders and the inhabitants of the hebrides have to this day no other name but alba for scotland and they invariably call themselves albanich or genuine britons the uninterrupted use of this national appellation from the earliest account we have of their history furnishes a moral demonstration that they are the true descendants of the first inhabitants of britain had they been of irish extraction they and their ancestors would have undoubtedly assumed a name more suitable to their origin  second proof the belgic nations who transmigrated into south britain before the descent of julius caesar retained the name of those communities on the continent from which they respectively derived their blood caesar lib v  the auxiliaries of vortigern preserved long their original name of saxons and the scots who speak the galic language have no other name for england or its inhabitants than sasson and sassonich but if the ancient scots have preserved among them the true name of the english for so many ages after it has been disused by that nation itself it is much more likely that they must have retained their own indigenous name  third proof had the scots been originally irish erinich and not albanich would have been their proper name so far were they from adopting the name of their neighbors of hibernia that it is well known that both the old irish and the inhabitants of the north of scotland promiscuously call themselves gael or the posterity of the gauls who first transmigrated into britain from the continent the welsh in ancient times distinguished the scots of both the british isles by the appellation of gaidhel which as the dh are invariably quiescent in celtic words is much the same with gael in the pronunciation should then the scots be of irish extract it must naturally follow that the picts sprung from the same source a doctrine no less absurd than it is new  fourth proof from the name of the district of iarghael which it has been always said was the first territory possessed by the hibernoscottish colony there arises a very decisive argument in favor of our system iarghael is not the name of the country but of those who inhabited it from the earliest times it signifies the westerngael in opposition to the easterngael or the picts who possessed the shore of the german ocean but what is conclusive against the irish system is that caeldoch or the country of the gael which the romans softened into caledonia is the only name by which the highlanders distinguished that division of scotland which they themselves possess  the gael of the continent we shall now leave it to the candor of the unprejudiced and the con mon sense of mankind whether there does not upon the whole arise a demonstration that the first colony of gael or gauls who transmigated into britai from the continent and were afterward driven northward by the pressure of other interlopers are the progenitors of the scots of north britain and ireland the true cause why the name of scotti was not heard of till the days of marcellinus or rather of porphyrius is that it was a contumelious name dr macphersons dissertations  it was for the same reason that the genuine offspring of the old caledonians the highlanders have never adopted a name which carried reproach in its meaning  the immediate ancestors of the scots why the irish obtained in the days of orosius the name of scots when their transmigration from caledonia was so remote requires to be explained the name of scotti was communicated to the romans by the picts and britons the britons and romans discovering a perfect resemblance in the manners customs dress arms and language of the iarghael or western caledonians and the irish agreed to call both nations by one common name the irish being no strangers to the military reputation that their friends of caledonia had acquired against the romans and their provincials either adopted their name or acquiesced afterward in an appellation which some writers had imposed upon them the illiterate and consequently the bulk of the irish nation were never reconciled to this innovation they preserved the caledonian designation of gael or the name of erinich which they had assumed after their transmigration into ireland and the adventitious names of scotti and scottia fell at last into total desuetude  in the course of the preceding discussion the author of the introduction has laid no stress upon the testimony of the poems of ossian having rejected the hibernian bards there might be an appearance of partiality in drawing authorities from the ancient poet of caledonia in the present state of the argument there is no need of his assistance the fabric we have raised demands no collateral prop it even can bestow the aid it does not require the perfect agreement between ossian and the genealogical system we have established has placed his era beyond the commencement of the popular opinion of the hibernian descent of the scots which was old enough to be placed in a period of remote antiquity by bid who flourished in the beginning of the seventh age  religion of the ancient british nations preliminary reflections observations no weary traveller ever issued forth with more joy from a barren desert into the skirts of a pleasant and well cultivated country than the author of the introduction quits the sterile subject of scottish and irish antiquities but to decide finally a point so long agitated was a part of the province which he had chosen for himself the origin of nations like a river near its source presents nothing that is either beautiful or great it is only when history descends into the cultivated periods of a well formed community that it becomes an object of pleasure and the means of improvement we have still a long journey to make but the way is strewed with some flowers  modern historians blamed to an investigation of their origin it may be proper to add a brief inquiry into the religion of the ancient british nations this subject has not suffered less from the negligence than the former did from the vanity and prejudice of historians some complain that the ancients have not thrown any considerable light upon the northern nations others affirm that the opinions and actions of barbarians are unworthy of any memory the first observation is unjust the latter is the result of a pride incident to polished times  authors double source of information though few of the romans like the first caesar carried a talent for writing into the field the inquiries of their historians extended to the characteristical manners of the nations whom that illustrious people subdued we find accordingly that there are facts preserved sufficient to prove that the best qualities of the modern europeans are but the virtues of their ancestors separated from ferocity and barbarism nor is it from the ancients only we are to derive our information the opinions of our forefathers ought to be traced among those of their posterity whom their situation excluded from any considerable commerce with strangers such till of late years were the inhabitants of a part of wales and such still are some irish tribes and the natives of the mountains of scotland  enables him to advance something new possessed of this channel to a knowledge of the character of the ancient celtae we may perhaps be able to advance something new upon the subject and by applying the accounts of the ancients to the criterion of the living manners and indigenous opinions of an unmixed race of men rescue some facts from the shades of doubt and uncertainty the character of a people must be gathered from an inquiry into those prejudices and principles of the human mind which are the motives of their actions to take a cursory review of the religious opinions of our remote ancestors is the most direct path to a knowledge of those manners which so remarkably distinguished them from the polished nations of antiquity an ample field for disquisition presents itself but it is more the purpose of the author to give a clear and concise idea of the subject than to deviate into dissertations which without being satisfactory might assume an appearance of ingenuity and learning  their idea of the unity of god general remark on religion religion is one of those few things which seldom receive any improvement from time being an universal concern it naturally becomes a subject of general inquiry and every time it is turned in the mind it suffers additional corruption from those vain superstitions and fears which are inherent in human nature the original opinions of mankind concerning god were the most simple noble and just we find that an adequate n tion of the divinity was so far from growing with the progress of the art of thinking that the celt in the midst of his forest owned but one lord of the universe unum deum ulguris effectorum dominum hujus universi solum agnunt procop goth lib iii regnator omnium deus caetera subjecta atque parentia tacit de mr germ xxxix non diffitentur unum deum in coes helmold lib i celtae colunt quidem deum max tyr dissert xxxviii  when the academic on the banks of ilyssus animated into gods his own abstracted ideas  religion of the celtae the information of the ancients did not extend to the celtae when they continued in a state of nature and consequently we can form no judgment concerning their aboriginal ideas on the subject of religion when they became first known to the writers of greece and rome they were formed into communities subject to some kind of government and they had an order of men established among them who were not only the superintendants but perhaps the inventors of their religious ceremonies and opinions it is however probable that like other savage nations some tribes of american indians have an imperfect idea of god the choctaws in particular acknowledge that there is a nahulla chito or great spirit but as he never met either them or their fathers in the woods to assist them in the chase or taught them those arts which he communicated to the europeans they pay him no divine honors  they had some imperfect notion of a supreme being before the druids formed that philosophical system of religion which had such a wonderful effect on their national character and manners  characteristical n ame of god the name or rather title by which the divinity is distinguished in all the languages of the ancient as well as most of those of modern europe is sufficient to demonstrate that polytheism was not known to the old celtae the dis of the greeks their theos and the oblique cases of their eyes the dis ditis pater and deus of the romans are manifestly derived from de di ti or dia the only appellation by which god is known to those who speak the galic of britain and ireland e in the galic language signifies he which by prefixing the article d makes de or as it is pronounced di or dia literally the being or god emphatically  de di or dia literally signifies the person by way of eminence or rather the he if we can with any propriety use that expression  idea of his unity that the unity of the supreme being was one of the fundamental tenets of the religion inculcated by the druids aerem et aquam venerantur adorant autem tantummodo et deum nuncupant illum qui coelum et terram fecit on their followers we have reason to believe notwithstanding the positive assertions of many ancient writers to the contrary the old gauls were said to worship three divinities under the appellations of teutates hesus and taranis et quibus immitis placatur

the being and taranis is the epithet of thunderer given by all nations to the supreme divinity it has been the opinion of some learned men that teutates is a composition of di or deu god and tad or tat father but we may oppose to this etymon that tat for father is only used in a familiar sense by very young children when they address themselves to a parent for according to the genius of the galic language it can never be used by grown persons it is not therefore in any degree probable that a title in itself a diminutive was applied to that great spirit who pervaded the vast body of the universe were a stranger to hear some very good christians in the mountains of scotland addressing at this day their prayers to the supreme being he might suppose that the worship of teutates taranis

pretended polytheism religion subject to corruption the most rational systems of religion have been always found to deviate into absurdity and superstition among the ignorant multitude the human mind naturally timid is apt to clothe with terrors every thing which it does not sufficiently comprehend the bulk of the celtae therefore almost corrupted into polytheism the philosophical opinion of the druids concerning god  philosophical opinion of the druids on that subject the doctrine concerning the divinity which pythagoras and his disciples first broached in the south of europe was the same with that of the druids and perhaps borrowed by the philosopher pythagoras it is said traveled into thrace and borrowed many of his philosophical opinions from the thracians vid joseph cont app lib i he passed the later years of his life in magna graecia and consequently became acquainted with the theology of the samnites and other celtic nations who possessed the neighborhood of crotona he also

animus per universam rerum naturam commeans et intentus ex quo etiam animalium omnium vita capiatur min felix xix  from this system of the universality of god the celtic nations naturally deduced an idea that his presence was most conspicuous in those parts of the universe which were endued with most beauty and action the heavenly bodies on account of their splendour magnitude and motion the elements of fire air and water on account of their rapidity and invincible force were thought to possess an extraordinary proportion of that active spirit which prevaded the whole body of nature  reverence for great natural objects according to this system of theology it was natural for the celtae to direct their attention to those objects in which the active principle which diffused itself through the universe seemed most apparently to exert itself the heavenly bodies and what philosophers call the elements were proper emblems of a divinity whose chief properties were immensity activity and force it is likely therefore that the veneration which the celtae showed upon every occasion for the sun moon stars fire great collections of water and for forests and mountains proceeded originally from an opinion that these great objects were the best symbols of the supreme being eos scilicet barbaros dino in the celtic language tien or tin signifies fire ait nymphodorus sub dio

in a peculiar manner have been the result of that which the celtae professed god was not only the sole agent of the operations of nature but even the principal part of which nature itself consisted not so much the giver and preserver of life as he was that life itself which animated every living thing from this philosophical system opinions arose among the bulk of the celtae which almost deviated into polytheism as it was the business of god to do every thing so they thought that the chief wisdom of man should consist in penetrating into his designs and in endeavoring to avert such of his decisions as might be detrimental to themselves they for this purpose not only addressed their prayers and sacrifices to the divinity through those symbols we have already mentioned but also used divinations to discover his intentions and practiced charms to turn the natural course of events  their pretended worship of the heavenly bodies subaltern intelligences from their attention to the principal objects of nature there gradually arose a belief among the celtae that the heavenly bodies and elements instead of being symbols of the supreme divinity were the residences of subaltern intelligences thulitae complures genios colunt aereos terrestres marinos et alia minora daemonia quae in aquis sontium et fluminum versari dicuntur procop goth lib ii  these inferior spirits being immediately subordinate to god had access to know his intentions and it was in their power to forewarn mankind of them by certain signs and tokens but that divine honors were paid to those beings who resided in different natural objects was certainly the mistake of the writers of greece and rome to prove this seeming paradox we need only have recourse to the true celtic names of those heavenly bodies which are universally said to have been objects of the worship to the old northern nations  pretended worship of the sun examined crian or grian from which ought to be deduced the apollo grannius and grynaeus of the ancients is the appellative by which in all ages the celtae distinguished the sun we may venture to affirm that both virgil and his old commentator servius were mistaken in their etymon of grynaeus his tibi grynaei nemoris dicatur origo nequis sit lucus quo fe plus jacet apollo virg eclog vi a gryna maesiae civitate ubi est locus arboribus multis jucundus gramine floribusque variis omni tempore vestitus servius in vi eclog there was some years since a stone dug out of the ruins of the roman pretenture between the scottish firths inscribed to apollo grannius it was an established maxim of policy among the romans rather to adopt the gods of the nations whom they had subdued than to propagate their own religion among the conquered grynaeus and grannius are evidently derived from the celtic grian which is composed of cri trembling and tein fire in the oblique cases tein makes thein which is pronounced ein or an the consonants which begin the nominative of celtic words being invariably quuescent in the genitive so that criein or crian literally signifies the trembling fire in allusion to the suns appearance to the eye ossian countenances this etymon of crian in his address to that luminary stu cri aig dorsa nairdiar when thou tremblest at the gates of the west  the words are manifestly derived from criein signifying the trembling fire which in the galic language carries an idea too mean to be applied to a god re easga but most commonly gellach gellach is derived from geal fair or pale re signifies a smooth and easga a wan complexion reul a star seems to be derived from reeil as it were another noun and rinnac means literally a point or a spark of light the full moon is also called luan i e  which the luna of the romans vid sect on the celtic language  are the celtic names of the moon reul or rather rinnac signifies a star these appellations carry in their meaning a demonstration that the heavenly bodies were not worshipped by our ancestors gellach is literally a pale or wan complexion by an emphasis and rinnac a point of light titles utterly inconsistent with the supposed divinity of the objects which bore them  the heavenly bodies animated by inferior intelligences it is certain that the celtic nations thought that the heavenly bodies were the residences of intelligences subordinate to god these spirits were distinguished by the name of aise aise generally used in the galic language with the article d or to prefixed to it signifies a ghost or spirit aise is perhaps the original of the asae of the northern nations duodecim sunt asae divinis afficiendi honoribus odinus supremus et antiquissimus asarum edda island de almegteaas in the language of scandinavia signifies almighty god it is remarkable that the highlanders when they speak contemptuously of the person and parts of any man call him an daise or the ghost which is an argument that their ancestors did not worship the aise or the spirits which resided in the elements  a word expressive of their feebleness and imbecility in comparison of de the supreme divinity but we have reason to believe from the following circumstance that grianais or the spirit of the sun was anciently peculiarly honored in caledonia in the confines between badenoch and strathspey two districts of the county of inverness there is a very extensive heath which goes by the name of slia grianais or the plain of the spirit of the sun the river spey which is there deep and rapid borders this heath on the south and a chain of craggy mountains in the form of a half moon interspersed with precipices and a few naked trees confines it on the north it is entered toward the west by a narrow pass formed by the near approach of the spey and the mountains and deep woods anciently skirted it on the eastern side  a place of worship this sequestered heath swells toward the center into several eminences upon the most of which there are still to be seen several circles of stone resembling though in miniature the famous stone henge on the plain of salisbury these monuments of antiquity standing in a place altogether unfit for culture have received no injury but from time and are consequently more entire than any other of the same kind in the highlands and scottish isles the diameter of the area of the largest is not quite two hundred feet and in the center of each arises a conical pile of loose stones concerning the use to which these rude fabrics were anciently converted there remains not the vestige of a tradition in that country but the name which the place bears demonstrates that they were erected in honor of the sun  their superstitious ceremonies reverence for inferior intelligences among an unmixed race of men like the inhabitants of the mountains of scotland the superstitions and prejudices of their ancestors are handed down without much alteration through a long series of ages a stranger in hearing the ancient scots talking with great respect of the spirit of the sun the spirit of the mountain the spirit of the storm and the genius of the sea might be tempted to think that like what is reported of their celtic ancestors they still paid divine honors to the intelligences who were thought to reside in the elements if he saw them avoiding to bathe themselves in a spring and never mentioning the water of rivers without prefixing to it the epithet of excellent firuisc or genuine water in opposition to standing pools or small brooks which are simply called uisc  if above all they should be seen according to an annual custom not hitherto altogether disused kindling a fire on a rock on the first of may in honor of the sun and giving to that luminary the titles of day an lo the day by way of eminence  and the light of heaven solus neav the light of heaven the roman sol is perhaps derived from the celtic solus which signifies light  and avoiding to call him by his proper though derogatory name of grian any man might conclude that they still remained in the shades of heathenish ignorance and superstition  for natural objects but should the ancient scots themselves be asked why they show such a superstitious regard for natural objects they would reply that it is by no means proper to bathe themselves in a fountain lest the elegant minthais in tobair genius that resides in it should be offended and remove to another place and that the epithet of excellent ought in propriety to be prefixed to the water of rivers on account of its beauty activity and force we kindle say they the beltein beltein is a

of people for such only light up the beltein in our days are evident remains of the superstitions of the druidical system of religion it was a custom till of late years among the inhabitants of whole districts in the north of scotland to extinguish all their fires on the evening of the last day of april early on the first day of may some select persons met in a private place and by turning with great rapidity an augre in a dry piece of wood extracted what they called the forced or elementary fire teinegin or the forced fire the practice of extracting the teinegin is not yet altogether discontinued among the ignorant vulgar  some active young men one from each hamlet in the district attended at a distance and as soon as the forced fire was kindled carried part of it with great expedition and joy to their respective villages the people immediately assembled upon some rock or eminencee lighted the beltein and spent the day in mirth and festivity  the beltien the ceremonies used upon this occasion were founded upon opinions of which there is now no trace remaining in tradition it is in vain to inquire why those ignorant persons who are addicted to this superstition throw into the beltein a portion of those things upon which they regale themselves on the first of may neither is there any reason assigned by them for decking branches of mountainash clouaan beltein i e the split branch of the fire on the rock those who have ingrasted christianity on many of the superstitions of their remotest ancestors have now converted the clouan beltein into a cross with wreaths of flowers and heath which they carry with shouts and gestures of joy in procession three times round the fire these branches they afterward deposite above the doors of their respective dwellings where they remain till they give place to others in the succeeding year  these and many other extraordinary and superstitious ceremonies used upon this occasion have it is certain much of the appearance of religious worship paid by the ancient caledonians to the sun the rude monuments which as we have already observed bear still the name of grianais seem at first sight to put the certainty of the existence of polytheism among the celtae beyond any dispute but we may venture to affirm that neither of those circumstances furnishes a conclusive argument upon that head  their divinations divinations sacrifices and enchantments though it was a fundamental maxim in the opinions of the celtae concerning god that he was the sole agent in all operations of nature they were far from supposing that his decrees were predetermined and unalterable the first business therefore as has been already observed was to penetrate into his designs by means of divination and afterward to endeavor to avert from themselves such of those designs as might be detrimental by the assistance of sacrifice prayers and enchantment the element of fire and above all the sun which is the source of it were objects in which the soul of the world seemed most manifestly to exert itself and consequently they more than any other part of nature employed the attention of a superstitious people and this attention soon degenerated into those ridiculous ceremonies which we have just described as such circular piles of stones as we have already mentioned are only to be met with on plains we may conclude that they were only artificial eminences raised for the beltein in places where rocks from which it originally derived its name could not be found  reflections the sun not worshipped by our ancestors we have in our hands a positive proof that the sun was not an object of worship among the ancient caledonians a poem the composition of which is placed beyond the introduction of christianity into the north britain has preserved the real opinion of our ancestors concerning the spirit of the sun the subject of the piece is a war between two scandinavian chiefs in which one of them having the misfortune to fall into the hands of his enemy gives occasion to the following simile  seized amidst the shock of armies  clugar struggled in all his thongs and rolled in wrath his red eyes  thus

with so little respect the terrors which the poet has placed around him serve only to highten the ridicule of his distress the whole in short is absolutely inconsistent with that prescience and power which are attributes necessary to constitute a divinity but if the intelligence who resided in the sun and who was peculiarly honored by an unmixed branch of the celtae could not in their opinion extricate his wings from the effects of a frosty evening we may justly conclude that the spirits placed in less dignified objects of nature were actually what they were called aise or feeble shadows the celtic aise is the fountain from which we ought to derive the  dii and aesar of the ancient hetrurians as well as the anses or ases of the northern nations   dii apud tyrrhenos hesych quod aesar etrusca lingua deus vocatur sueton august cap     gothi proceres suos non puros homines sed semideos id est anses vocaverunt     general reflections to collect into one point of view the opinion of the celtic nations upon the subject of religion they originally believed that the supreme divinity de as the soul of the world pervaded the whole body of nature this philosophical idea degenerated among the bulk of the people into a supposition that some objects of nature instead of being animated by god himself became the residences of spirits who in subordination to him directed the operations of their respective portions of matter to these intelligences they gave the name of aise or shadowy ghosts expressive of the vast disproportion between them and that being who was the source from which these spirits themselves as well as every thing possessed of life and motion derived their existence it is upon the whole highly probable that the rites which some of the ancients took for sacrifices to subordinate divinities among the celtae were no other than ceremonies used by those barbarians for the purpose of their pretended divinations and enchantments  immortality of the soul general reflections the doctrine not coeval with man the doctrine of the immortality of the soul is not coeval with man whole nations have come down into the region of true history without having placed a tenet so essential to religion in their faith the infancy of society is not favorable to speculative inquiry mankind in their rudest state scarce ever extend their ideas beyond objects of sense they perceive when death suspends the functions of the body that the man ceases to act and to feel and the subsequent dissolution of his whole frame establishes the supposition that his being is at an end nature herself confirms the opinion from every quarter by symptoms of decay the oak that has fallen by accident or age resumes not its place on the mountain and the flower that withers in

doubtful whether the immortality of the soul is among the first truths which philosophers have rescued from ignorance and barbarity  era of its being first broached in greece the most polished nation of antiquity was late in its reception of the doctrine of the immortality of the soul the greeks till the days of thales thales primus dixit animas esse immortales chaerilus poeta  had formed no idea at all concerning a future state it is even likely that thales himself who was the first dignified with the title of wise primus nomine sapientis ornatus suidas  came too early into the world for the commencement of that opinion pherecydes of scyros pherecydes scyrus primus dixit animos hominum esse sempiternos cic tusc  according to the best authority first introduced the doctine about the

messeniac xxxii insinuates that even in the days of plato only some of the greeks believed that the soul of man was immortal  merely speculative the immortality of the soul was upon the whole a doctrine merely speculative among the ancient greeks their poets held it forth in their compositions their philosophers inculcated it upon their disciples it was a theme of disputation in the schools but the bulk of the people did not look upon it as a truth necessary to religion and it is even a matter of doubt whether those philosophers who affirm that virtue must be loved on its own account did not in that instance forget what they had advanced in other places concerning the rewards which await the good in another life  among the ancient greeks this skepticism of the greeks in so essential a point of religion may appear strange to men who have not examined into the origin of that illustrious nation the new people who chased the pelasgi see the state of ancient europe at the beginning of the introduction from peloponnesus and the islands of the archipelago came from the coast of phoenicia and the mouths of the nile they carried into greece the gods of syria and of egypt but they could not carry along with them a doctrine which was not received in those countries at the time of their migration it is a matter of great doubt with many whether the jews themselves admitted in an early period the immortality of the soul among the articles of their faith this much is certain that their lawgiver and prophets if they speak at all speak very obscurely as well as undecisively upon the subject bishop of gloucesters divine legation of moses   opinions of the celtae on that subject philosophy the greeks and romans affected to degrade with the name of barbarians all the nations beyond

scythian in the wild forests of the west we have however some reason to conclude that in an early era there was little foundation in fact for the distinction which greece and rome made between themselves and the rest of the world the superiority of the persians in the arts of civil life was manifest and acknowledged and philosophy itself took its rise among those whom the polished nations of antiquity distinguished by the name of barbarians philosophiam a barbaris initium sumsisse asserunt diog laert   rose first among the northern nations we discover by the first dawn of hisrory which

the opinion of the ancient brahmins who supposed that the soul of man was a portion of that irresistible principle which pervades and moves the immense body of the universe this was the opinion of the

wants which grow with the progress of society before property becomes the means of procuring sensual pleasure civil restraints are superfluous and morality itself an unnecessary study the contempt

pollutes the human mind in an advanced stage of civility we may here without impropriety observe that the vices of barbarians proceed from prejudice and their virtues from nature  morality taught by the druids the druids with their speculative opinions on religion inculcated upon their followers some general maxims of morality the result of their inquiries in other branches of philosophy their discoveries in the nature and properties of matter they confined to themselves to astonish into a veneration for their order a race of men whom they wished to govern through the channel of prejudice and ignorance darkness was favorable to the continuance of their power and they encouraged into a settled contempt that dislike to science and the arts of civil life which the northern nations derived from their natural aversion to mental as well as to bodily labor  and bards the moral character of our ancestors owed more to the compositions of the bard viguere studia laudabilium doctrinarum inchoata per bardos amm marcell lib xv than to the precepts of the druid that elevation of soul which the first inspired was more favorable to virtue than the cold dictates of the latter for the mind which entertains a conscious and dignified pride seldom harbors vice the influence which the bards derived from the instruction and amusement with which their poems furnished their countrymen raised them to equal honors with the druids themselves the respect for their order was so great and universal that armies engaged in action have been known to desist from battle when the bards threw

history of the celtic nations to commit those poems to memory to repeat them on solemn occasions was the great amusement and study of their vacant hours it is highly probable though the observation is not made by the writers of greece and rome that the order of the bards were divided into three different classes the british and irish scots had their ferlaoi or hymnists  strabo lib iv  who reduced

dullness a few of the compositions of the ferdan have triumphed over the ravages of time and prove that the bards inculcated the purest morals on their countrymen and comprehended in their songs all

be here observed that the inhabitants of london who use beer the most are of a smaller size than those who live less luxuriously in other parts of the kingdom to solve the difficulty we must have recourse to a remark already made that the sarmatae who upon the decline of the romans advanced into the regions of the west were a very different race of men from the celtae and that they sent down their low size with their blood to the present inhabitants of europe who are in a great measure their posterity the general use of spirits which has much prevailed of late in europe may have contributed to lessen the size of the present race distilled liquors certainly check the growth of the human body neither is wine itself favorable to it this much is certain that the inhabitants of

common and favorite beverage from all antiquity   effects of climate on the size of men the great stature of the ancient britons may in some degree be ascribed to the humidity of the climate under which they lived the same temperature of air which favors the extraordinary growth of vegetables may contribute to increase the size of the human body where it is not checked by that mode of life and hard labor which civil improvements have introduced into modern europe the inhabitants of cloudy regions and swampy countries even at this day exceed in stature those who live under a serene sky and

celtic women as it was common to all the nations of ancient europe descended from the same stock must like the stature of the men have proceeded from their being a different race from the sarmatae who carried their homely looks with their small size into the regions of the west  the uncorrupted chastity the absolute abstinence from early venery which a virtuous kind of prejudice established into an

british nations reflections on the origin of government rise and progress of society society is of greater antiquity than government civil regulations confess in their own origin the preexistence of public crimes mankind like other animals herded originally together through mere instinct and they deceive themselves who think that commuties were formed under a preconcerted system of policy man in his rudest state being destitute of property neither fears nor meets with injustice he possesses nothing which his own arm cannot defend before the love of the conveniences of life has overcome his neighbors natural propensity to justice in the progress of society individuals polish one another as it were by collision the fruit of the ingenuity of one is adopted and improved by another new inventions start up in every quarter and are lost in none luxury grows with the increase of the arts of civil life rapacity treads close on its heels and then for the first time the check of law and regulation becomes necessary to the welfare if not to the very being of the community  origin of monarchy the popular form of government is more ancient than monarchy the patriarchal authority from which some writers deduce the latter is too much circumscribed in degree and time to be the fountain from which monarchy flows the power which a parent has over his children cannot be transmitted to his son he derives it from nature and it dies with himself regal government is a civil institution which in various countries owes its commencement to various causes it generally takes its rise from a kind of usurpation and whatever theorists in politics may say there were originally no stipulations made between the tyrant and the people length of time establishes into a kind of right what at the beginning was an act of injustice and the acquiescence of the people constitutes into a moral duty that obedience which was at first the effect of fear  popular government older than monarchy the simplicity of monarchical government has established with many an opinion of its superior antiquity the infancy of society like that of man must be awed say they into good behavior by the fear of obvious punishment the slow movements of popular governments command no respect and impress no fears and therefore men naturally place the power of the state where it can be exerted with most expedition and precision they who argue in this manner are little acquainted with the character of barbarous times in the first stage of society there is no inequality between individuals a mans mind must be opened with civilization before he will acquiesce in an opinion of his own inferiority the barbarian knows no person better than himself and he submits to the dictates of none deriving in fact from the vigor and independence of his own mind that liberty which we owe to an accidental constitution of government  monarchy begins in force and is supported by influence though monarchy for the most part begins in the midst of tumult and war the very existence of regal power presupposes a considerable degree of civility in the community the authority which the leader of a nation may acquire from personal merit in battle will die away in peace unless the machine is kept in motion by the continued impulse of influence and this influence which is the foundation if not the origin of kingly government is only to be obtained by having something to bestow upon abettors and dependents a few being gained through the channel of interest the many are overawed into submission and that lenity and impartial justice which prudence dictates in the first periods of monarchy contributes to reconcile the minds of the people to the government of one  origin and nature of the popular form of government in the early infancy of a state the only laws that subsist in the community are the opinions and prejudices of the people before property is well established the catalogue of crimes is very succinct and the punishments annexed to each are neither severe nor inflicted with precision the people have not yet delegated their authority to a few and the power that remains in the hands of the many seldom exerts itself with vigor the society is kept together more by habit and the absence of vice than by any thing which deserves the name of government the people who have the whole power in their hands convene only when they are to carry war into an enemys country or to defend their own they consult together but on the external affairs of the community its internal concerns are left to the opinions of individuals this absence of all regulation may be called the most ancient form of government and it may be distinguished by the title of a popular government as the opinions of the people in general are the only checks upon the crimes and irregularities of individuals  form of the ancient british government the ancient british nations like the rest of the inhabitants of the north of europe were extremely fond and very tenacious of their political freedom though from a conviction that civil society cannot maintain itself without subordination they had their judges their

democratical meetings of the celtic nations the delegates being freed of the interruptions and confusions incident to the assemblies of the populace found leisure to determine upon domestic as well as foreign matters and this was the source of these civil regulations we distinguish by the name of laws  in the darkness which involves our remotest ancestors it is impossible to trace their government

their own language in the regions of the west and north which submitted to their arms is a position which the learned scarce ever doubted and which the rest of the world still implicitly believe the latin has been considered as the fountain from which the italian french and spanish derive their origin and it must be confessed that in a confined degree the opinion is extremely just it is however certain that this mark of their own greatness which the romans seem to have left in the conquered provinces proceeded more from the reputation of their literature than from the power of their arms the illustrious nation had too much sense to endeavor to impose their own language upon the conquered and had they even departed from their usual political prudence on that head it is scarcely credible that they could have succeeded in the attempt all other conquering nations to whom history extends its information failed in their endeavors of the same kind the victors have often adopted the tongue of the vanquished but the vassals have scarce ever been known to drop their own language for that of their lords  proved from collateral examples the arabs who conquered persia the persians who

court the attendants of the prince the posterity of the victors in general may retain the tongue of their original country but the bulk of the people will also retain that which descended to them from their fathers the romans themselves could never extend the latin to the provinces of the east on the contrary the language of their greek vassals prevailed at last over their own the obstinate despotism of william the conqueror and the perseverance of those norman and french princes who succeeded him in the throne of england could not force the language of france on the english nation and the lombards and franks lost their own sarmatic dialect in the tongues of italy and gaul the cause is as obvious as the fact is true the number of the conquerors bore no proportion to the vanquished and in the article of language the majority always prevails  cause of the connection of the french etc with the latin the connection between the latin and the languages of spain france and modern italy must be traced to another source than the government of rome the nations who inhabited those extensive regions originally and whose posterity still in a great degree possess them were in fact the same people with the romans those gael who in italy went under the name of umbri were partly the ancestors of the banditti who settled with romulus on the banks of the tiber the romans in their own aversion to commerce vindicate in part their celtic origin against their pretended descent from the greeks of magna graecia who were in some measure a commercial people some of their own writers join issue with us in this opinion their language though tinctured with hellenisms is radically different from the greek and we shall in a subsequent section have occasion to show that the primitives

almost to the baltic one language though in a great variety of dialects prevailed and from that circumstance should no other proof be produced we may conclude that all the nations who possessed that immense extent of country sprung originally from one and the same source  the latin descended from it in part it is more natural to suppose that the latin owes in part its origin to one of the dialects of the great and general tongue which pervaded ancient europe than that it was formed by a few vagabonds who assembled together for selfdefence on the shores of the tiber some visionary pedants have been known to attempt the creation of a new language illiterate men have always contented themselves with that which has been transmitted to them by their ancestors in the progress of society in the growth of inventions a language is polished in its phrases and enriched in the number of its words but its first rude elements remain in its primitives and serve to point out the fountain from which it originally flowed  the language of ancient britain general reflections time which effectuates a change in every thing has a peculiar influence on language in the less polished periods of society it grows gradually with advancing civilization and like those who speak it it becomes corrupted through improvement when literature and philosophy arrive at their height for even these like all human inventions have their bounds men of genius as it were arrest language in its progress and secure by their writings its permanency to future ages they put their seals upon it and send it down to posterity in a kind of independence on accident before the establishment of literature or where it is imperfectly known language having no standard by which it can be fixed fluctuates with the changing manners of the society and the longer it runs down through time it departs the further from its primitive simplicity  cause of diversity of dialects to this circumstance and not to a difference of origin we must ascribe that diversity of dialects which julius caesar found in gaul the aquitani  strabo lib iv were not understood by the belgae nor could the celt at the foot of the alps hold any conversation with the gaul at the mouths of the rhine yet no writer has ever affirmed that all gaul was not possessed by one and the same people though divided into separate states the truth is the identity of languages does not consist in their being mutually understood by the nations who speak them but in the similarity discernible between the names of things which are common to all countries and to every stage of society strabo says that the nations of gaul differed very little from one another in point of language  strabo lib iv  the doric of syracuse was not intelligible at miletus the dutch can hold no discourse with the silesians yet the sicilian and ionian were greeks and one and the same nation possess the upper and lower germany  three in britain at the arrival of the romans we have in a preceding section observed that gaul and the lower germany had sent colonies into britain at three different periods before the arival of the romans in the island the posterity of these must have differed considerably from one another in point of language the gael who still exist in northbritain and ireland passed from the continent before the arts of civil life had made any great progress in gaul and in some measure retain the unimproved language of their ancestors the second colony were the posterity of those gauls who being anciently settled beyond the rhine returned into the regions of the south under the name of cimbri the cumri of wales are their descendants and they preserve in their tongue a tincture of the sarmatic of the east and north the british belgae spoke that dialect of the language of gaul which still subsists among their posterity in lower britanny the three dialects which we have just mentioned have been thought by many learned writers to be the only genuine remains of the ancient celtic and others have added to these the language of the mountaineers of asturias and gallicia some have even gone so far as to affirm that these four languages are reciprocally understood by the scots irish and welsh the inhabitants of britany and the spaniards who border on the bay of biscay  observations on the biscayan armorican welsh etc the opinion is not just the biscayan has not even the most distant connection with the celtic the other languages derive it is certain their origin from one source they agree in many radical words but their idioms are different the welshman is as ignorant of the gaelic as the spaniard of arragon is of the dialect of dauphiny and the scot knows no more of the language of britany than the inhabitant of palermo does of the tongue of portugal  in vain have the learned had recourse to the rude dialects of the celtic which remain in britanny and wales to form upon them some idea of that language what they sought after with so much eagerness abroad was every day in their hands at home the language of the romans sprung originally in part from the celtic stock and the french italians and spaniards speak in some measure to this day the tongue of their celtic ancestors to render the first part of the position probable is to prove the latter beyond the power of reply  the latin and gaelic compared origin of the romans the gallic umbri bocchus absolvit gallorum veterum propaginem umbros esse solin viii umbros veterum gallorum propaginem esse marcus antonius refert servius in aeneid xii  and

italy before the foundation of rome was laid these were the same with the aborigines whose peculiar and rude manner of life bore testimony of their celtic origin when the greeks from their possession of the arts which they had received from phoenicia and egypt began to multiply their numbers in peloponnesus and the islands of the archipelago they sent abroad colonies who settled on the shore of the lower italy and carried on some commerce in its ports out of the vagabonds of these two very different sets of men romulus collected the founders of rome the mixed manners and the mixed language of the romans prove their double origin and furnish a kind of demonstration that the illustrious nation derived their blood from the celtae as well as from the greeks of magna graecia veresimile barbarici etiam generis reliquias nonnullas e vicinis et priscis incolis cum graecis se conjunxisse dionys halic lib ii be that as it will the sabins were received into the city of rome under titus tatius and the sabins were umbri and the umbri gael   they derived in part their language from the celtae the latin derives many of its roots and primitive words from the greek it also draws some from the ancient celtic the scots of caledonia were never subdued by the romans and they had little connection with that illustrious people the roman language cannot be supposed to have penetrated where neither the literature nor the arms of rome ever entered yet there is a wonderful similarity if not a perfect identity between many primitives in the gaelic and others that correspond with them exactly in the latin tongue this circustance seems to demonstrate that the gallic umbri of italy who were partly the ancestors of the romans and the gael of caledonia who were the sole ancestors of the ancient scots swarmed originally from the same hive  latin compared with the gaelic or caledonian tongue to prove the position by example a short catalogue of corresponding words is subjoined in

extended to a much greater length but nothing can be more tedious and unentertaining than a dry list of words to remove every ground of supposition that the scots of either of the british isles borrowed any part of their language from the latin it is necessary to observe that almost every one word in the gaelic column is either a compound or derivative from some well known primitive in that language the gaelic primitives are all monosyllables wherever a word of more syllables than one presents itself it is a compound and all the adjectives are formed by the addition of some termination or other to a substantive noun  reflections to draw in this place a parallel between the gaelic the welsh and the language of britanny would not even have novelty to recommend it the ingenious mr lhuds comparative vocabulary is already in the hands of the curious and to such as are not fond of philological disquisition it is sufficient to observe that the three languages though not reciprocally understood by the scots welsh and the inhabitants of britanny are evidently descended from that tongue which the nations of gaul carried in their migrations to every quarter of europe it is even demonstrable were not the subject foreign to this introduction that the italian spanish and especially the modern french owe their origin to speak in a confined sense more to the ancient celtic than to the latin which was itself in part a dialect of that language  an inquiry into the origin of the anglosaxons preliminary observations obscurity of the remote antiquities of the saxons the remote antiquities of the saxons lie buried in the darkness which involved in ancient times the inhabitants of the northern europe without the means of transmitting any account of themselves to posterity at a distance from those nations who possessed the use of letters their transactions were either lost in obscurity or disfigured with fable in their progress toward the south they gradually rose as it were from night the light of history broke in upon them and we see them for the first time in that rude form which a fierce combination of barbarians wear in migration and depredatory war after the soil and climate of britain had attached them to fixed abodes their natural ferocity was mellowed down by degrees the arts of civil life began to appear and they were among the first of the european nations who committed their history to writing and even whose transactions were worthy of being recorded  apology and design the character private life and government of the anglosaxons after their settlement in this island furnish an ample field for disquisition the monuments which remain of their history on the continent are few in number and the subject itself is in some measure barren from its high antiquity but as nothing that concerns a people who have made so great and splendid a figure can be uninteresting either to themselves or the world the author of the introduction hopes to screen his own want of abilities behind the importance of his subject he even presumes to think that he has thrown some additional light on those antiquities which he has endeavored to represent in their least forbidding form should his confining himself to the history and manners of the saxons in their rudest state be the chief objection to his work he may perhaps remove it by descending hereafter into a more fruitful period should the objection on the other hand arise from any defect in himself he will derive some happiness from the thoughts of having spent but little time in a province where he failed to please  of the author to investigate the origin of the anglosaxons to pursue their progress from scandinavia with precision it may not be improper to throw together some reflections on the fall of the romans the decline of whose power opened the regions of the west to the migrations of the barbarians of the northern europe  reflections on the fall of the romans cause of the stability of the roman empire the romans differed not more from other nations in the rise and progress than in the extent and permanence of their power the fall of the republic by melting down into one mass all distinctions of party gave stability and weight to the state when it destroyed the importance of the members of which it was composed feeble and corrupted in the center the empire threw all its vigor and strength into its frontier and became formidable abroad in the midst of domestic decay the disputes about the purple though frequent and bloody were but partial shocks they agitated and disturbed but did neither break nor ruin the great fabric of the state the storms were violent but they did not last long and things were soon restored to their original balance by the tranquillity of absolute government  in what different from other monarchies the despotic empires of asia raised by the abilities of one prince fall through the weakness of another the fate of the state is involved with the life of the monarch and when he dies in battle or by the hands of the assassin the great body of which he was the head submits to a foreign conqueror or separates into petty principalities under domestic tyrants the imperial authority at rome stood upon a more solid foundation when the julian family reduced the roman republic into an empire for themselves they did not change in appearance the ancient form of government though a new power started up in the state all the old offices remained despotism had the decency to cover oppression with a mask and to execute its most rigorous plans through channels neither unknown nor formidable in the days of freedom the power of the first caesars consisted in influence and an overawed and venal senate were the obvious instruments of their tyranny  why the permanency of the empire the interference of the imperial authority was confined to matters of state the detail of inferior government the course of justice between individuals remained in the possession of ancient forms the oppressions of the worst of the caesars scarce ever extended beyond the walls of rome and the provinces which had languished under the exactions of republican praefects flourished under the lieutenants of a caligula and a nero though vested with the sacredness of his triunitian authority no laws could bind the emperor the empire itself was governed in fact by a regular system of laws and therefore when the tyrant fell the state was not involved in his ruin  did not depend on the fate of the prince there was one other cause which prevented the permanence of the empire from depending on the fate of the prince the hereditary succession which the julian family endeavored to establish expired with nero and the suffrage of the army confirmed by the approbation of a timid and complying senate became the only necessary title to the throne men raised by accidental influence to the imperial dignity though they enforced obedience could command neither respect nor attachment from a people among whom they themselves had been so lately numbered as private persons the multitude who are in every age and nation the great supporters of hereditary monarchy found no resting place for their loyalty in the fluctuations of imperial succession and they acquiesced without reluctance in the government of any ambitious leader who had paved his way to the purple by private treachery or by open force  the extension of the freedom of the city the first cause of decline one of the best of those who held the reins of government at rome hastened the dissolution of the empire more than the very worst of his predecessors the first antonine by extending the freedom of the city to dion cassius says that this was the act of ant caracalla but other writers of credit affirm the contrary it was only perhaps the freedom of latium that was extended to the provinces by antoninus pius that of the city by caracalla all the provinces broke down the fence of distinction which even in the midst of degeneracy protected some small remains of the old roman spirit when the exclusive privilege of citizens was no longer confined to italy the awe which the conquered nations had for the original seat of greatness gradually decayed when to be born within the walls of rome no longer conferred any peculiar immunities that mysterious tie which bound the attachment of the citizen himself to the residence of his ancestors was broken and the veneration once annexed to the roman name became naturally feeble when the name itself was diffused over half the world  the absence of all spirit in the provinces but this cause of dissolution was neither obvious in its commencement nor rapid in its progress the total absence of all spirit in the provinces balanced for some time its decline in italy the debility which tyranny and luxury carried from rome through all its dominions even contributed though the opinion is singular to the permanency and stability of the empire the conquered nations by being deprived of their arms applied themselves to those enervating arts which by administering to luxury deprave when they polish the human mind timid and habituated to submission they fell in love with the tranquillity of despotism and in a kind of determination to continue slaves they became indifferent about the title and virtues of their tyrant the news of his accession was enough to establish the authority of any prince in the most distant regions of the empire and many provinces were so dispirited and passive that a military force was found altogether unnecessary to secure their obedience no attempt at independence could be made by such an inactive body men were either ignorant of the natural rights of their species or meanly resigned them for the abject security of servitude  the general debility spreading to the army the infectious debility which had seized the other subjects of rome did not for some centuries after the extinction of liberty overwhelm its armies born in the more distant parts of the empire and stationed on its frontier the soldier was a stranger to those enervating vices which extinguish the martial spirit when the legions followed an ambitious leader to rome a dismission from service was the common reward of their fidelity and if they were depraved by license they were soon dissipated and lost in the general imbecility of the body of the people they were succeeded in the presidial provinces by new levies of hardy and uncorrupted barbarians who preserved an appearance of vigor in the extremities of the empire after the center had exhibited every symptom of political decay  the removal of the seat of government the impolitic vanity of constantine in removing the seat of empire to a new capital gave a mortal blow to the roman state the senate whose consequence and authority had declined with their virtue were in some measure annihilated by being transplanted to another place the name even the very walls of rome contained something within them which commanded obedience from the provinces the opinion which supports all government was destroyed by turning the attention of the people to a quarter to which they were not accustomed to look they were habituated to obey implicitly the mandates of roman emperors and roman senates but to bizantine princes and assemblies they paid only that cold and unwilling obedience which force extorts from slaves to complete at once the ruin of that mighty fabric which the policy and virtue of ancient rome had raised constantine by creating new offices and by changing the names of many of the old altered the constitution of the roman government this prince in short who covered with splendid exploits in public life the meanness and even wickedness of his private character was more fatal to the permanancy of the roman power especially in the west than the most wretched and impolitic of his predecessors in the imperial dignity  gives a mortal blow to the empire julian though endued with all the spirit abilities and even virtues of the old romans came too late into the world to stop the rapid progress of the state to its decline his untimely death extinguished the last hopes of rome the vigor and prudence with which he conducted his measures in his early youth serve only to show what he might have been in his riper years had he lived there was a chance for the future permanency of the empire a certainty of its temporary greatness he fell and the whole fabric of roman power nodded to its fall when he died the circumscribed abilities of some of his successors supported for a few years a part of the venerable ruin but with every rude blast that rushed from the north and east some shattered fragment fell province was cut off after province till the mutilated body at last expired when rome itself was taken and sacked by the goths  general reflections on the sarmatae of the barbarians who were the secondary cause of the fall of rome the bad policy of constantine and the imbecility which gradually arose from advanced civility and slavery though they were the great were not the only cause of the ruin of rome the barbarians of the north and east who have even pervaded the regions of asia itself with their migrations gave the finishing blow to a state already tottering to its fall wandering like beasts of prey on the skirts of their own deserts they saw the luxuries which prevailed within the roman pale and they made many attempts to break into the fold whilst vigor and discipline remained among the legions on the frontiers they repelled with ease the irregular incursions of the naked tartars of the north and east but after the general effeminacy had extended itself to the army enemies who in the better days of rome were despised became formidable and victorious the fence being once broken down the deluge soon spread over the provinces of the west and that great fabric which was the work of many centuries fell in less than the space of one  the obscurity in which they were involved it were in vain to attempt to penetrate the darkness which involved at home the sarmatae who succeeded the romans in the regions of the west destitute of means of conveying their own annals to posterity the first feeble light of history was thrown upon them when they showed themselves in a hostile manner on the frontiers of the empire the writers who have sent down the earliest account of their invasions astonished at their appearance and alarmed at their cruelties seem to have been more anxious to describe what they then were than what they had formerly been they pushed not their inquiry into the origin of barbarians whose ravages conveyed the first news of their name and they were little solicitous about examining into the previous history of a rude race of men whose incursions into the roman territories were perhaps their first public transaction to supply in some measure this defect in the latter writers of rome we must return to antiquity and recapitulate some part of what has been already advanced concerning the state of ancient europe  europe possessed originally by the celtae and sarmatae when the greeks and romans had extended their inquiries beyond the danube and the alps they found in the vast track of country which they distinguished by the name of scythia two nations different from one another in manners customs and language to the inhabitants of the regions of the east and northeast of the danube they gave the name

legions stationed on the rhine and danube settled between the baltic the ocean and the two great rivers just mentioned and rose into various petty nations whose manners bore evident marks of their mixed origin the blood of the sarmatae seems however to have most prevailed for the language and character which the barbarians who overturned the empire carried with them into the south of europe

the saxons and their scandinavian ancestors having given human passions to odin accommodated him also with a wife paul diacon hist longob lib i  contrary to the practice of the celtae they admitted a female divinity into the catalogue of their gods which furnishes another argument of their sarmatic origin the angli in the days of tacitus worshipped the earth under the name of hertha and it was the same divinity who afterward obtained the title of frea the spouse of the great odin men who deduce every system of religion from rational principles may rest the origin of that of the saxons on philosophy odin was the irresistible principle which gives motion to every thing that breathes and hertha frea or the earth furnished that portion of matter which is animated into living creatures by the active and pervading spirit which is distinguished under the name of god  worship of frea under the name of hertha or the earth tacitus with his usual precision and elegance describes the veneration which the angli and their neighbors on the baltic paid to the spouse of odin her worship filled the minds of her devotees with sentiments very opposite to those which the bloody altars of odin inspired during the feast which was held in honor of hertha an universal joy spread over the country benevolence and hospitality prevailed in every quarter war and discord ceased and it was then only that peace and quiet were either known or loved the universal parent of mankind did not they thought delight in the destruction of her race and therefore every instrument of death was shut up

are circumstances which may lessen the horror which naturally arises in the mind against a practice so opposite to every idea of humanity an uninterrupted acquaintance with danger created among the northern nations a contempt for death which in the firm belief of an immediate entrance into a life of joy and festivity in odins hall they looked upon as a blessing rather than a misfortune a demise through violence in battle through suicide or by the hands of the priest procured an immediate admission into the northern paradise it was only the unfortunate persons who died of disease or age that

celtae the valhalla or hall of odin was placed on the top of the high mountains of sevo the celtic nations surrounded their fortunate island with tempest in the atlantic ocean among the sarmatae only those who fell by the sword were admitted to the table of odin such as died of disease or age went to the regions of hela under the earth men slain in battle were among the celtae entitled to a more elevated degree of happiness in their paradise but the peaceable and unwarlike had also a beautiful island of their own fighting drinking and the ministration of young virgins comprehended the joys of the valhalla the celtic heroes wandered after a variety of rural pleasures over the face of a beautiful and extensive country the heroes of the former were always in the presence of odin there is no mention made of the divinity in the celtic paradise the druids considering the divinity as the pervading spirit which gave life and motion to the whole body of nature formed no ideas of him as a personal existence  the sarmatae remained for ever in the valhalla the souls of the departed retaining among the celtae a warm affection for their country and living friends often returned to visit them the sarmatae admitted a good and a bad principle in their mythology they had their hell as well as their heaven the celtae placed nothing but endless felicity beyond the limits of the present life  their government general observations the want of information which induced the writers of rome to remove the northern limits of ancient germany to the pole was a source of error to the learned
