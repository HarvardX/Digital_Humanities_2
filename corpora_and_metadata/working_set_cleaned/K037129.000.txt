the fair american a comic opera in three acts as it is performed with universal applause at the theater royal drury lane  written by f pilon  dedicated to the right hon lord camden lord president of his majestys most honorable privy council  london printed by j almon no     fleet street  m dcc lxxxv  to the right hon lord camden lord president of his majestys most honorable privy council my lord when i consider the high rank you have long held as an enlightened statesman an accomplished orator and a wise legislator i fear i shall incur the censure of presumption for daring to trespass upon that attention so much more nobly employed in meditating your countrys good but great minds can descend with ease from the dignity of their spheres to the contemplation of the most minute objects and what would confuse or impede the operation of feebler faculties acts only as a relief to superior spirits lending them additional vigor in pursuits which call forth all their energies your lordships partiality to the dramatic muse is well known and the mecaenas of a garrick may naturally expect that writers for the stage will lay their offerings at the feet of a nobleman universally allowed the most exquisite judge in their own art  not content with the private satisfaction i enjoy from my veneration for splendid abilities and distinguished virtue i am ambitious the world should know i am capable of admiring them  there is a protecting influence in the name of camden that recommends to the wife and to the good it is auspicious to every muse and every honorable undertaking  and as such i have prefixed it to my work in imitation of the first caesar who concealed his baldness under a laurel  i have the honor to remain with the most profound respect my lord your most devoted and

in a garden charlotte and rachel discovered song charlotte when unrelenting fates ordain that lovers never shall meet again what object round can joy impart or wean from woe the bleeding heart in shades and silent scenes we find the only joy that soothes the mind there uncontrolled fond thoughts may rove and back recall the hours of love but ah when balmy hope is fled to pleasures voice the heart is dead then memory only wakes to show how deep the wretch is sunk in woe the sailor thus who far from shore hears all night long the tempest roar soon as the morning lights the skies beholds his vessel bulge and dies  rachel i dont know how other people may find themselves but the coming on of winter always makes a vast change in my spirits i have often wished that i had wings that i might fly round the world after the summer   charlotte i never heard you find fault with the season of the year in london rachel   rach lord maam one has so much pleasure in london it is impossible to know the difference betwixt summer and winter but how mortifying it is to live so trifling a distance from bath and to be so seldom indulged with the pleasures of it  i long to see my old master laid up with a fit of the gout as much as he does to get ease from it for then you know maam the family would remove to lodgings on the south parade with what pleasure i put on his flannels and see him pumped of a morning   charl but i thought your regard for me had reconciled you to your present situation   rach and so it has maam if my regard for you was not very great indeed do you think i would consent to be buried alive in this old crazy mansion house that looks as if it were left standing only for the rooks to build their nests in ah maam if i had your beauty and your fortune i would see the world and the world should see me too   charl but what could you do with a man of my fathers temper   rach more than he could do with a girl of my spirit  whenever our sex is used ill by a crossgrained old father or a surly husband especially maam when we are a little handsomish it is either because we dont know our own power or are afraid to use it  why there is mr summers now who has been so long courting you what is the reason mr bale will not consent to your marriage is not he a gentleman of as good family and as good fortune as any in the country  ods my life maam pluck up a spirit and since he is determined to shut us up like two starlings in a dark cage i think it is fit he should know we have learned to talk in our confinement   air rachel when cupid little fly rogue blooming fair and young first wounds the lovers heart how sweets a womans tongue we rob the bees of honey if we speak or sing but when the knot is tied each word has then a sting it is all clickclack whatever we say both jarring night and noon but ring the changes still each day and talk things into tune about his cage with joy the nimble squirrel climbs his prison quire forgot whilst tinkling go the chimes thus husbands managed well though fettered to the ground think when they shake their chains there is music in the sound it is all clickclack etc  charl it is turned of five oclock i expected my cousin angelica before this hour from london   rach ah the sweet good natured young lady  well if i was a man i should be in love with her up to inspiration i do believe i shall cry my eyes out whenever she returns to america   charl her father has a fine fortune in that country and is too fond of his amiable daughter to let her continue much longer in europe though she has been only six months in england two of which you know she passed with us her near relations my esteem and regard for her are as fixed as if we had been friends from our infancy   angelica without no no i will go into the garden to her   rach as i hope to be married madam here comes miss angelica herself   charl with all the eagerness of true friendship i fly to meet her   enter angelica in a black silk cloak charl my dear angelica how happy have you made me by this visit   ang and to enhance the value of it i am come down to you when every body else begins to think of quitting the country  in the month of september when the groves have ceased to be tuneful and old autumn is shaking hands with winter as if i came on the opening of the season to enjoy the pleasures of partridgeshooting   rach comes forward i hope your ladyship has been well since i had the pleasure of seeing you last but i need not ask that few ladies bring such complections from london   ang i am very well rachel thanks to a good constitution in spite of the gay scenes late hours and cloudy atmosphere of the capital   charl go rachel and prepare tea   rach do you choose it maam here in the garden   charl no in the front parlour and let me know when it is ready   exit rachel ang there is a cloud hangs upon your brow charlotte come open your heart and let friendship disperse it   charl you remember mr summers   ang yes and from the grave tone in which you pronounce his name i conclude you two have quarrelled  pho pho if that is all i will make up the breach when lovers fall out the high priest of cupid is piling up the blind gods altars with a little fresh fuel which of course gives a temporary damp to the blaze but a few sighs breathed from the bottom of two repenting hearts and their flames burn brighter than before   charl would i had nothing more serious to make me unhappy but every tender hope and fonder vision which rose in flattering prospect are no more  summerss visits have been long forbidden my inhuman father insists upon my banishing every thought of him as he had himself fixed upon another match for me i have never seen the husband of his choice nor did i know his name till this morning but i understand that he is next heir to a title and is expected here every hour to fulfill the ambitious views of my father and give my fate for life the seal of wretchedness   rondeau adieu ye fleeting hours of love that stole unmarked away and fondly promised once to prove as blessed each future day where yonder vilets scent the vale i met the faithful youth there first he breathed his tender tale and vowed eternal truth such joys are past no more we meet these wellknown haunts among when loves musician pipes so sweet her plaintive evening song adieu ye fleeting hours etc ang poor charlotte  fortune is determined to persecute us both for know my friend i am not what i seem  the gaiety of my words and looks are all a counterfeit my heart is like yours the martyr of a fatal passion  a passion so hopeless that every smile which peers upon my brow shows like a garland some poor victim wears that is doomed to bleed in sacrifice   charl can that be possible   ang you say that you are debarred all intercourse with the man of your heart he neither hears your sighs nor is witness to the tears you shed for him  my destiny is to the full as forlorn with this difference that i have not the faintest hope of my passion ever meeting a return and that i am divided from the object of it as far as seas and the western world can part us   charl is there a heart so insensible that loveliness like angelicas could make no impression on   ang you shall hear  as my father lived in the interior part of the province of south carolina he sent my brother attended by two servants to escort me in safety to charles town where i was to embark for england through the ignorance of guides we lost our way and fell in with a party of the french but were scarce made prisoners when an alarm was given of an enemy being in sight oh heavens how my heart beat  it was a detachment of horse from the kings troops motionless and dumb i heard the shout of war  saw both battles charge  when a trance relieved me from the agony of my fears the first object my eyes afterward encountered was an officer in the british uniform who looked tenderly in my face as if he had been anxiously waiting my recovery oh charlotte how shall i describe him to you  imagine a person the most captivating manners the most winningly polished and a countenance in which sweetness had so tempered the manly daring of the soldier that like mars when disarming by the graces he appeared resigning the laurel for the myrtle of love i hear the music of his voice this moment  madam said he taking me respectfully by the hand you are no longer a prisoner  it gives me inexpressible concern that the nature of my orders will not allow me to see you safe to the end of your journey but if we ever meet again  at these sad words the drums beat and the trumpet blew its silver summons  my brother in the same instant urged the dangers of delay and pressed me to renew our journey  with reluctance and regret i yielded to his remonstrances when turning round to take a parting look of my gallant soldier i found he was gone  the whole party had rode off at full speed in a few minutes i could see nothing but a cloud of dust and for ever lost sight of my deliverer   charl had you no means or opportunity of learning his name   ang yes i understood from one of the wounded left behind after the action that his name is mountford a colonel in the english army   charl mountford did you say colonel mountford   enter bale bale i am very proud charlotte to find the colonel employs so much of your thoughts  i have just received a packet from his father lord mountford acquainting me that his son arrived four days since from america and that i may expect him this afternoon at my house in order to fulfill the articles of the bargain concluded in his absence therefore prepare to receive the man who is to be your husband   ang good heavens  what do i hear   bale seeing angelica ah my blooming american rose  i am transported to see thee once more in the country  come throw your arms around your old uncles neck and let him welcome you   kisses her ang dear sir i am glad to see you   bale i vow to george this is very fortunate  to come down just in the nick of time to be present at your cousins wedding  i certainly should have sent for you if i thought i could depend upon your keeping a secret but it is the part of prudence to conceal all plans of consequence till they are too ripe to be frustrated by accident or stratagem this was my method forty years ago in matters of business a secret in my possession was treasure underground no funding it out in whispers and halfhints to set the bulls and the bears of curiosity at work i was as close as an iron chest and had a knack of holding my tongue without ever looking the wiser for it  but this was all method and whoever expects to thrive in the world must consider method as the foundationstone upon which trade builds the house of wealth and prosperity   charl then sir you are determined upon my undoing   bale zounds would you have me break my word with my lord mountford and forego the advantages of so noble an alliance  but say no more my plan is laid and if i had no regard to my promise or to my interest i hope i have some little regard to consistency and method in my proceedings   charl but when the whole happiness of my life is at stake    ang dear uncle will you suffer me to reason with you   bale i will not hear a syllable from either party  i am fixed in my resolution and my daughter knows it  do you think i have got a weathercock upon my shoulders i never retract my word nay so rigidly am i attached to regularity and system that i never change my habits of action in any one particular  in conformity to that rule look here at this coat shews his coat it was the fashion thirty years ago when some regard was paid to the button manufactory  look here too at the cock of this hat and the form of these buckles they were likewise all the mode in the duke of marlboroughs time and i wish for the sake of my country that some more of the good old customs of that time were still in fashion   song let young fops and old fools of all ranks combine to flock like trim jackdaws to fashions vain shrine in such if one moment they are worthy of note opinion is only the cut of a coat for my part i will steadily stick to one mode though my fashion is old it is english and good all cure sure our enemies think we are past or they never would smuggle their tailors so fast if things now go wrong that they will mend where is the chance when the nation is put in strait waistcoats by france for my part etc in the days of queen bess fine beaux were all seen with lace ruffs two yards round quilld under the chin then an englishman dressed in a style all his own and the sea was his empire  the globe was his throne since this is acknowledged i will stick to my mode though my fashion is old it is english and good ang though my father is your brother sir you differ very widely in temper from him   bale there is an instance in which nature herself did not observe method your father from his childhood had a leaning to extravagance and when the young spendthrift had squandered away all his pocket money at school i used to advance him a fresh supply at twopence in the halfcrown premium why to this moment i have a particular hour in the day for doing every thing and as the clock strikes my performance chimes echo to the sound of it but here is a curious calculation which i have made that tells me at a glance of the eye how every hour of my life is disposed of for twenty years to come pulls out a pocketbook now mark here is the third of august ten in the morning      reading the general evening post with my remarks upon the siege of gibraltar   ang a ccording to that calculation the siege must last for fifteen years   bale why troy held out a siege of ten years and i think we have abler engineers in our service than ever king priam had but pray take notice here i come to the year ninetynine february sixteenth eleven forenoon taking the air if the weather permit if not exercising at the dumb bell to open my chest and give me a freedom of breathing   ang why yes in the year ninetynine you may want something to give you a freedom of breathing   enter a servant serve

angelica pluck up your spirits my girl  if i could get you a husband and keep you on this side of the atlantic how it would astonish your father  let me see who have we got in the neighborhood ods so there is my old friend dreadnought that served last war under hawke ecod i believe he sailed round the world with anson too   char and if you had sailed round the world in search of a husband you could not have fixed upon such another  but sir though you may sport with my happiness and make it subservient to your caprice or your ambition you should consider that you have no such power over my cousin   bale i only mean to advise  but i think he is a very good looking man for his age  to be sure you may know by his walk that he has been more used to the quarter deck than the drawing room  then perhaps you will say he is tanned and has got a few scars in his countenance but these are valors credentials and the old admiral looks the nobler for them   ang you may spare yourself the trouble of providing me with a husband for my heart is unalterably engaged to another   the clock chimes quarter past five bale ods so i am engaged too there goes the quarter and i am so much beyond my hour of writing letters   exit ang nothing upon earth sure could have been more unfortunate   char my heart will not admit a thought of any man but summers   ang as we are acquainted with the state

young ladies is miss bale sir   bale that is she without a cloak  i must beg your pardon  dear me this is destructive of all method   exit bale in a passion manet carbine carb trumpets and kettledrums but she is a fine girl and when she shifts her ground her gait has the majesty of a charger what a park of artillery plays from her eyes what an ambush for love is that rogueish dimple in her left cheek  the bravest soldier that ever faced the thunders of battle need not be ashamed to tremble at approaching such a breastwork my master to be sure is very much averse to the match at present but i fancy he will alter his tone when he has seen his mistress her cousin has left her and she moves this way as my orders are to bring a particular account of her person i will take possession of this post for the advantage of reconnoitering i have not seen so much beauty in all my different quarters though i have been in the army since i was the height of a ramrod   angelica comes on ang this is

century   ang your ancestors friend    carb yes maam i am fourth in the line from the great oliver carbine who lost his head in holding lord mountfords stirrup at the battle of ramillies   ang a most respectable descent i must confess i make no doubt then you are a confidential servant   carb my master maam never undertakes any thing of consequence without consulting me  it is carbine what is your opinion or what do you think upon every expedition   ang then tell me i beseech you to be sincere but first as an earnest of my friendship take this gives him money dont think i mean to bribe you   carb i scorn a bribe maam as much as i value this mark of your ladyships generosity   puts up the money song you may take a piece of gold and your conscience never the worse when the chinkers are not

favors be inclined for this one i would take a score but a bribe etc ang how is the colonel disposed to his approaching marriage   carb madam he thinks time commands a halt every hour till he lays his heart and his laurels at the feet of his mistress aside there can be no harm in that volley of mere powder without ball for he must have no cyes if he does nt like her   ang then i am undone aside did you never hear him talk of another lady with any seeming partiality   carb no as i hope to be faved madam   ang what did he never speak of one he met by the most extraordinary accident in america   carb oh she was an american lady  now maam i understand you yes yes i know all about that affair there was an american lady he often talked of and talked to and there was a good deal of talk about their conversation but that is all over i give you my word madam   ang what do you mean sir   carb dear maam young fellows will be young fellows and youth is a soil that yields the better crop for having a little wild oatseed sown in it but the colonel maam is a man of the strictest honor he has resigned his former commission and now wishes to sight under the banners of an english commander   ang i find he has got a most strenuous advocate for his vices   car his vices lord maam how can you call a stray thought especially before marriage by so hard a name for my part i consider these little trips of the fancy in the light of deserters the partial defection of a few from an army is no reproach to the loyalty of the main body oh maam his heart lies in this house   ang every word he utters serves but to plunge me deeper in despair ah wretched wretched angelica all hope is now vanished and you may dedicate what remains to be endured of your joyless life to tears and solitude

great pleasure so i humbly take my leave madam his honor your father told me your wedding was fixed for thursday i shall wish you joy with all my heart but before i strike my tent give me leave to assure you maam that you and my master will be the happiest pair in england   exit carbine manet angelica he has taken me for my cousin all this time oh heavens what an emotion his parting words have given my heart his master and i  the happiest pair in england the treacherous illusion shoots with deceitful joy across my heart as some faint taper shows a caverns gloom or as the lightnings momentary ray reveals the frowning aspect of the night to warn the world of thunder   song how serenely the morning first opes its meek eye and looks like an angel with smiles from the sky yet ere noon some black tempest with terror shall sound and the springs tender blossom is blown to the ground thus it fares with our hopes when love fills the heart in sunshine they rise and in clouds still

instrument of her deliverance but as my orders were to proceed by the most rapid marches i was obliged to quit her nearly in the instant i had rescued her and what is worse before i had an opportunity of knowing who she was   sum did she refuse to tell you her name   mountf no but i feared to ask it for you must know there was a gentleman with her who from his attention i took to be her husband
