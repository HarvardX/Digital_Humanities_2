priestcraft distinguished from christianity  showing  i that wicked priests are the real antichrists mentioned in scripture ii that the corruptions of the laity in all christian states proceeds from the corruptions of the clergy iii that there was a more general virtue in the grossest times of paganism than there has been since our savior came into the world iv that there is a more general virtue in other parts of the globe than in the christian world v that there was a more general virtue in our own nation in the times of our ancestors than there is in our own times and that priestcraft and corruption of manners have increased together by their fruits ye shall know them london printed for j roberts near the oxfordarms in warwick lane       preface that the doctrines which the clergy preach to the people and the examples they give them have an extraordinary influence upon their thoughts and actions is evident from experience and from the very reason of the institution of the order that the examples which too many of the clergy have lately given them and the doctrines which they have preached to them have been neither christian nor moral is too evident from the dismal consequences of them from the divisions which they have caused in their hearers from their groundless fears and jealousies from their malice and their implacable fury from their hatred and their enmity not only to each other but to their native country to their very rights and liberties from the unfortunate event of the late war in spite of success and an unparalleled series of victories from a peace more calamitous than the most fatal war and more destructive of commerce from the dreadful and horrible dangers which we have so narrowly escaped by the immediate hand of god without any thanks to our own prudence and virtue and lastly from the dangers and the calamities which still threaten us and still hang over us and over all the rest of the christian world  to remove the causes of all these mischiefs that the effects may cease it is necessary to lay down a plain and certain rule by which the very meanest of the people may be able to distinguish a zealot from an incendiary a priest of god from a priest of baal and the precepts of the gospel from human traditions and the doctrines of devils  that i have discovered and reproved the vices of some of the clergy by the very same method by which they have caused our miseries that i have done this by a sermon by a chosen text and by severe but too just reproaches is i hope excusable in me or they are altogether inexcusable for whereas they have made use of calumny and defamation i have kept strictly within the bounds of a modest satyr which spares the persons and attacks the vices and never censures the deserving nor condemns the innocent and whereas they have had recourse to calumny and ungenerous slanders only in order to cause divisions and to inflame animosities i have endeavored by just reproaches to revive and restore charity  the author of the following discourse was born and bred in the communion of the church of england and nothing in the following sheets is in the least designed by him to reflect on that pious learned and numerous body who are truly christian priests of the church of england but then he declares that he cannot apprehend how any one can be a truly christian priest who makes it the entire business of his life to root charity out from the souls of men and by that means to drive from the face of the earth the very life and soul of christianity and as he cannot conceive that any thing can be a part or a member of a body which has not a communication with and a subordination to the head of that body as he cannot conceive that any one can be a priest of the church of rome who disowns the papal supremacy so he cannot believe that any one can be truly a priest of the church of england but he who being united to the faithful and obedient part of the clergy does with them acknowledge king george alone for his rightful head and his supreme ecclesiastical governor  the contents that antichrist according to the genuine meaning of the word signifies one who is thoroughly and entirely opposed to christ page   that one who is thoroughly and entirely opposed to christ is opposed to him as a king a priest and a prophet ibid that if christ is a good king antichrist must be

all this had upon the minds of men p    that the devil alarmed at this contrived by means of some christian priests to make christianity the occasion of introducing a more desperate division among men

our savior concerning the jewish temple ibid the prediction of antichrist concerning the christian church and the mischiefs that are like to befall it ibid how false and frivolous these predictions are p    all the marks of antichrist reduced to one grand characteristical mark which is the wresting the words of the gospel to mean something contrary to the great designs of christianity p    those designs are two viz   to restore the law of nature ibid   to promote and advance charity p     a discourse upon the first epistle general of st john chap   and part of the   th verse even now there are many antichrists there have been several wild and extravagant explications or rather applications of antichrist by those who have had a mind to fix it upon some particular person as upon the pope or mahomet or some other spiritual or secular tyrants according as they who applied it were corrupted or misguided by interest or malice or passion or fanatic enthusiasm but by antichrist in the genuine signification of the word may be meant every one who is thoroughly and entirely opposed to the lords anointed i e to christ but because there are no creatures so opposed and so contrary to him as the devil and his angels they are most properly the antichrists of whom the apostle speaks who appear in sundry shapes upon this earthly globe and make use of humane instruments and humane organs to accomplish their infernal designs and as we may find by the words of our text that many of them appeared in the world even in the most pure and primitive times who is so easy as to believe that they are not more numerous in our days in order then to the describing and distinguishing them so that they may be clearly known and discovered we intend in the ensuing discourse to handle these three points  first we shall give the general marks of this thorough and entire opposition of antichrist to christ secondly we shall consider the designs the doctrines the examples and the influences of one and the other according to those general marks of opposition thirdly we shall reduce all these marks to one grand characteristical mark and when we have done this it will be easy for you brethren to make the application your selves and to point out these to one another of whom it may be said in the words of the text viz even now there are many antichrists first then as our savior was a priest and the best and holiest of priests antichrist must be likewise a priest acting by the suggestion of the devil for no one can be thoroughly and entirely opposed to the best and the holiest but the most profligate and the vilest of priests  secondly as christ is a king who is perfectly good and gracious antichrist must be the worst and most insupportable of tyrants  thirdly as our savior was a prophet and an infallible prophet because he could not but foretell the events which he himself had decreed antichrist in opposition to him must be a prophet and for this reason a false and deluding prophet because he has neither himself any power over the future nor is influenced and enlightened by him who has but now we come  secondly to consider the designs the doctrines the examples and the influences of christ and antichrist in their priesthood their prophecies and their empire  first we shall begin with their empire because christ was a prophet and a priest only to advance his kingdom and antichrist too is a prophet and a priest only to promote his tyranny let us now see what sort of kingdom the one and what sort of tyranny the other came into the world to establish  since then the kingdom of christ or of the messiah is a spiritual kingdom or the kingdom of heaven the tyranny of antichrist must be a spiritual tyranny or the tyranny of the prince of darkness  let us now enquire what this kingdom of heaven is and in what it consists how it began and flourished how it came to be impaired and how far our savior came to restore it and we shall see by making this enquiry what sort of tyranny the tyranny of the devil is how it began how it increased how it came to be impaired and how far antichrist has a design to restore it  the kingdom of heaven then is a kingdom whose king proposes the happiness of his subjects as the ultimate end of his reigning over them for god is perfectly happy in himself and wants not our obedience nor our service a kingdom whose king proposes to make his subjects easy and happy here to prepare them for eternal happiness hereafter matt       come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest his empire then must be an empire of reason and law and by consequence an empire of liberty st james     but whosoever looks into the perfect law of liberty that man shall be blessed in his deed it is this law of liberty which establishes the rule of reason to restore the kingdom of god his empire over the soul and conscience and frees man from the slavery into which he was brought by his passions which is the empire and tyranny of the devil and of antichrist his son  for this tyranny of antichrist being in every thing opposite to the kingdom of christ must design both the temporal and eternal misery of his subjects must design to make them unhappy here in order to the making them eternally miserable hereafter and must not be a rule of reason and law but an empire of passion and will and must tend in every thing to subvert the empire which christ has established upon earth and to restore the tyranny of the devil whose kingdom as it began at first so it has ever since continued in opposition to the kingdom of heaven and as our savior teaches his disciples to renounce the world the flesh and the devil in order to advance his kingdom upon earth antichrist obliges his to make use of all three to promote his spiritual tyranny  the kingdom of heaven began with the creation of angels god reigned over those blessed spirits who are entirely happy in their obedience and their great and comprehensible law was love the love of god and their fellow creatures they loved god because they saw him as he is all beauty and all attraction and they loved their fellow creatures because they saw them the objects of their creators love gosp of st john chapter    ver    this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you   epist of st john chapter   ver    if god so loved us we ought also to love one another and this love was at once their duty and their happiness a love attended with perfect pleasure and with joy unspeakable  but when afterward the impious aspirer lucifer drew off his love from his creator and his fellow creatures and placed it upon himself that selflove was immediately attended with pride and rage and envy and hatred and malice passions till then unknown in heaven as being inconsistent with perfect happiness  thus fell lucifer but alone he fell not millions of immortal spirits he drew after him into perdition by his lies he seduced their souls defaced in their minds the love of their creator and of their fellow creatures for their creators sake and planted the love of themselves there with divine love away went all their happiness selflove was immediately followed in them as in their seducer before by pride and rage and envy and hatred and malice and they who while they were united to god by love were angels divided from him by pride and hate became immediately devils and from the most glorious most happy most beautiful part of the creation became all on a sudden the most execrable and the most horrible and as before they fell that divine love by which they were united to god was at one and the same time their sovereign law and their supreme felicity so when by pride and hatred and the rest of their diabolical passions they broke that divine union their pride their hatred and the rest of their tormenting passions became at once their transgression and their hell  twas after this that god created man to supply the room of the fallen angels and to plant the same kingdom upon earth which remained among the blessed spirits in heaven he created them little lower than the angels enlightened innocent happy immortal the empire of his maker was the same in him that it was in those blessed spirits an empire of reason and law and the same law was given to him which made the angels happy that great and comprehensive law was love the love of his maker and of his fellow creatures for his creators sake which as the apostle of the gentiles tells us is the fulfilling of all law and which our savior had told us before gosp of st john chap    ver    if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him and as long as this charming law remained in the heart of man inviolated it was always attended with peace and joy and inexpressible happiness  but satan who in every thing by divine permission opposes the designs of god attempted to destroy that kingdom upon earth which he had before impaired in heaven and what wonder if the seducer of angels succeeded in his attempts upon man if he extinguished divine love in his heart and inflamed it with selflove if he dissolved that union which man had with god and overturned his dependence on him destroyed the empire which heaven had set up in his soul which was an empire of reason and law and established his own tyranny there an empire of will and passion of pride and rage and hatred and malice and all those accursed and damnable passions by which the tormentor is himself tormented to which the tyrant is himself a slave  thus satan brought sin and misery and death upon mankind who was created innocent happy immortal and the kingdom which he established here upon earth in opposition to the kingdom of heaven increased so fast and extended so wide that charity which is the love of god and our neighbor was almost extinguished upon earth that men were miserably divided from god and from one another and that all mankind to the reserve of a small remnant were become abandoned slaves to the devil and to devilish passions when jesus christ came into the world to restore the kingdom of his father and to destroy the tyranny of the devil  for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil   epist of st john chap   ver    when the son of god came into the world to destroy the tyranny of the devil and to restore his own and his fathers kingdom that kingdom of love and peace and joy which was by the divine permission impaired upon earth by the devil at the fall of man and under which the blessed spirits are for ever happy in heaven in order to restore that kingdom he assumed the priesthood not only because there was a necessity for a priest who could make a propitiatory and satisfactory sacrifice for the sins of the world but because also there was a necessity for a doctrine which might incline and rectify the wills of men by enlightning and convincing their understandings that as man fell from perfection freely and of his own choice he might likewise be restored freely and of his own choice since if the change in him should be wrought wholly by grace his conversion would proceed from a force as it were upon his mind and would not be the action of a free agent  the kingdom then that our savior came to restore was the empire of charity the love of god and of our neighbor for the sake of god for wherever that divine love reigns there is the kingdom of heaven and wherever that love is wanting is hell and outer darkness beloved says st john let us love one another every one that loves is born of god and knows god he that loves not knows not god for god is love st johns first epist chap   ver     but here by the way we are to take notice that this love of our neighbor is to be extended to all mankind even to our most cruel enemies but it ought to be more intense or remiss according to the different relations in which men stand to each other we ought to love christians more than infidels our parents and kindred more than our acquaintance our acquaintance more than strangers and our country men more than foreigners  as the law of divine love in the observation of which lay the happiness of the first man and the perfection of his nature was subverted by selflove upon the suggestion of the devil our savior that he might reestablish that divine love endeavored to root out the love of ones self by a doctrine that was best adapted to the reasonable nature of corrupted man he attacked it therefore in all the several branches of it pride avarice and luxury or in the words of st john the last of the flesh the last of the eye and the pride of life to which he opposed a profound humility a rigid mortification and a sincere disinterestedness not that fantastic scorn of the world which proceeds from a stoical pride but that which is founded upon the most solid foundation the interest that one has in god for he to himself being selfsufficient he who has him has all things  but as pride is the most dangerous of the three forementioned sins for that is the continual fever of the mind whereas the other attack it but by irregular accesses pride insolently intruding at the very altar where the others never dare to approach there is no virtue that our savior recommends more throughout the whole gospel than humility nay almost every virtue which he recommends to his disciples appears to be founded on that as poorness of spirit meekness gentleness patience forbearance peacemaking longsuffering mercy forgiveness for nothing is more usual than for the proud to be swollen and drunk with vanity to be provoking disdainful insolent fiery impatient intractable cruel revengeful implacable that sorrow and remorse which is necessary to repentance implies a severe mortification upon a view of the turpitude of sin and the vileness of our own natures even the three cardinal virtues of the christian religion are founded upon humility not only charity to which the other two are subordinate for as pride is the effect of selflove selflove is augmented by pride but faith which is an assent to truths above our understanding because they are revealed by god to us is an owning of the weakness and blindness of our reason as the hope of salvation by the merits of christ is a manifest confession of the depravity and corruption and impotence of our wills  as true humility is the solid foundation of every christian virtue a foundation which extending as low as hell is the basis of a fabric which reaches to the very heaven of heavens our saviors doctrine attacked pride in all its numerous offsprings anger envy hatred malice and in all their unrighteous effects viz bitter and barbarous invectives presumptuous and damnable judgments debate contention strife revenge and murder and opposed to them the contrary virtues gentleness meekness patience forbearance peacemaking mercy longsuffering and forgiveness nay more real and unfeigned love to our most cruel enemies those who had the forementioned graces our savior pronounced blessed and left it to be demonstrated by experience how much accursed they were who were tormented by the passions and the sins  thus our savior taught the will of his father which descended from heaven to earth with him and being for ever an high priest after the order of melchizedec the prince of peace an order which is infinitely superior to the aaronical order infused into the hearts of his disciples not a windy contentious zeal for the observation of forms and ceremonies and the political government of an established church but virtues and graces which no philosophy and no religion had ever taught before to wit a profound humility and a love divine  but though this doctrine was never so conformable to the reasonable nature of corrupted man and though it was confirmed by signs and wonders that manifested a power which commanded nature and which made the very devils obey it would never have prevailed over the minds of men which are influenced so forcibly and constantly by their senses if it had not been enforced by the example of him who taught it his life and his doctrine were all of a piece and as the design of his coming down from heaven was by the means of humility to restore charity to reunite mankind to god and to one another his life and his death his incarnation his birth his baptism his choice of the most abject of men for his disciples and his submission to the death of the cross were each of them so many eternal lessons of humility are all of them so many amazing miracles of unparalleled condescension and of love divine  his very miracles were of a piece with the rest of his life and were so many examples to that doctrine of charity which they confirmed by their power as different in this from those which were wrought by moses as their designs were different for as the design of moses was to separate and distinguish one nation from another and to establish one by the extirpation of many the wonders which he wrought were answerable to that design attended by terror and followed by destruction wrought in favor of a few comparatively speaking to the plague and misery and destruction of many  but as the design of our saviors descending from heaven was to remove all separation and all distinction and to heal all divisions amongst men as his doctrine was adapted to all nations and to all men contrary in that to the rites and ceremonies of the judaick law as it was framed to comprehend all to unite all and to make all its followers easy here and eternally happy hereafter so likewise his miracles without partiality and without distinction brought help and comfort to all the roman and the samaritan as well as the jew had nothing of terror had nothing of destruction in them but were peaceful and gentle all of them as the dove that descended from heaven upon him who wrought them  if men were hungry in desert places he was at the expense of a new creation to feed them if they were languishing under diseases by a supernatural power he healed them he healed them by that gentle and peaceful power which calmed the winds and seas that were about to destroy them that power that controlled and rebuked the devils that were busied in tormenting them  as our saviors miracles were all of a piece with his doctrine his delivery of that doctrine was worthy of them both it was with power that penetrated to the inmost souls and astonished and confounded his most obdurate hearers st luke chap   ver    and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power and st matthew chap   ver    for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes his delivery of his divine doctrine was not like that of the cold unconcerned and phlegmatic teachers of the law no there was no less than god in his voice in his mien and in his every action  as religion so far resembles civil government that it must be carried on by the same methods by which it first began the apostles after our saviors ascension continued to preach the very same doctrine that he had taught before confirmed it by miracles of the same kind enforced it by an imitation of their masters life and by their own wonderful delivery of it when the apostle of the gentiles preached to the grecians his manner of speaking appeared as new to them as the doctrine he taught and as he spoke of things to them which neither eye had seen nor ear had heard nor had it entered into their hearts to conceive so he spoke to them in such a manner as never man had spoke to them and there was something in his delivery as far above the thunder of their pericles and their demosthenes as the things which he had said to them were of infinitely more importance and more concern to his hearers and he who when he spoke of the things of this world was so very cold and so unconcerned that his bodily presence was weak and his speech contemptible even this cold and unconcerned apostle when he discoursed of righteousness of temperance and of judgment to come was so strangely animated so wonderfully penetrated with the heavenly truths which he uttered that the very tyrant who came to judge him and to condemn him trembled at what his prisoner spoke acts        which naturally brings me to the effect and influence which so divine a doctrine thus enforced and thus delivered had upon the minds of its hearers which is as much greater than the impressions which the discourses of the grecian orators had upon their assemblies as heaven is greater and higher than earth and whereas those orators thought they effected a mighty matter if they changed the opinions of their assemblies in relation to their own their friends or their countries reputation and interests our savior and his apostles prevailed upon those who heard them to contemn all earthly reputation and interests to despise riches and power and glory and even life it self and the working this change in the heart of corrupted man was a greater miracle than the changing the elements the healing diseases or the driving out devils behold thousands of souls flaming with charity and loving their creator with all their might and their neighbors as themselves behold them parting with all they have and willing and contented to suffer want to relieve the necessities of others acts chap   ver    to the end behold thousands of souls gladly choosing and joyfully embracing poverty and infamy and sorrow and pain and death to render themselves acceptable to him whom they love so much was the kingdom of god restored and the tyranny of the devil impaired in the hearts of men  such were the effects of our saviors doctrine such was the influence which it had on the minds of men at which satan alarmed contrived by a masterpiece of infernal malice to make this very religion by which christ designed to unite men to god and to one another the occasion of introducing a more dangerous and desperate division between them than ever had appeared upon any worldly account of making selflove to take a deeper root and spread with more luxuriant branches of kindling in mens hearts a spiritual pride more fierce and more fiery than had ever appeared before a pride attended with a more implacable anger a more inveterate malice and a more irreconcilable hatred and in order to succeed in this devilish design he who knows by himself who ruins man by soothing and by pleasing him that there is no enemy like the traytorfriend and that so divine a doctrine could not be resisted effectually if it were opposed openly attempts to destroy it by a pretense to propagate it delegates his spiritual tyranny to some christian priests and prevails upon them in order to extend it and establish it to divide and weaken and ruin the church by a pretended impudent obstreperous zeal for its unity to teach his will for the will of the most high and by a height of wickedness which would be incredible if we had not so often seen it to prove the doctrine of the devil by the word of god miserably wrested to the perdition of the perfidious teachers and the credulous hearers   timothy     now the spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and to doctrines of devils  these are the antichrists mentioned in the text who to promote their own and the devils spiritual tyranny preach not the doctrine of jesus christ but the devils and their own it is not their business to preach up charity or to teach humility or any of the virtues that produce or maintain charity as gentleness meekness patience forbearance peace making mercy long suffering and forgiveness if at any time they take notice of the doctrine of christ in order to mingle it with their own and make the latter pass unsuspected they do it after such a manner as shows very plainly that it is not that they espouse as shall be further observed in its proper place their business is to preach division and dissension a spirit of party and of faction and to incite and inflame those passions that create or nourish division as anger envy hatred malice evil speaking evil surmizings impudent and opprobrious invectives presumptuous and damnable judgments pretended distrusts and ungrounded jealousies audacious and provoking threatenings debate contention strife revenge confusion riot murder it is their business to incense and exasperate their disciples against all who contradict their opinions not what they pretend to believe as to the credenda of christianity but the faith they profess as to their own traditions and the doctrines of devils and therefore it is their business to inflame their disciples not against infidels whether jews or turks or against pagans but against those of the christian faith nor against those who while they have only the name of christians are either deists or downright atheists by an open avowed profession or are thought to be such at least in their hearts by the horrible sins in which they live impenitent but against true and sincere believers against those who are under the fear of god and the sacred power of conscience these they account their mortal enemies against whom they exasperate and inflame their disciples exhorting them both by voice and example sometimes to laugh sometimes to rail with unmannerd frontless invectives at all the most venerable christian virtues which shine so bright in the others as humility meekness moderation union charity to hate them with an irreconcilable hatred to keep no faith with them to hold no trust inviolable to be bound by neither vows nor oaths but as often as they find opportunity to pursue them to the destruction of their reputation liberty goods and life it self and to break through all bonds both divine and humane to oppress them and destroy them  and as the power of this world is necessary for the supporting their spiritual tyranny they never fail to insinuate into their disciples that it is their duty to throw as much of into their hands as they are able to grasp to persuade them that they are bound to espouse the cause of those temporal tyrants with whom they their pastors have made an implicit contract for the mutual enslaving of mankind and the more these temporal tyrants are the devils vicegerents the more they trample upon law and reason and equity which are bonds of peace and union to mankind that it is still more their duty to extol them to obey them to serve them and to adore them and if these tyrants are the rulers of the native countries of these antichrists and their disciples these teachers industriously inform their hearers that they are absolutely and indispensably bound to obey them whatever exorbitant things they enjoin or to suffer whatever they are graciously pleased to inflict and this contrary to natures original law the first and strongest precept of which is selfpreservation and in order to it selfdefence that law which our savior came to restore and to fulfill and which none but the devil and his disciples can ever come to destroy and to induce them to this blind and impious obedience they endeavor to prove that these tyrants are their lords by virtue of fatherhood and their sovereign by right divine though as good as wise and as forcible arguments may be brought to prove that the devil is a lord by virtue of fatherhood and a monarch by right divine and consequently that he ought always to be obeyed and never to be resisted  and as these antichrists teach their disciples to hate and persecute those christians most who are under the fear of god and the power of conscience of all their country men and fellow subjects they instruct them to hate and malign them most who are the most zealous for the maintenance of their native rights and the validity and power of law  but if the forementioned secular tyrants are the rulers of foreign nations and are mortal enemies to the native countries of these antichristian teachers and of their disciples they are so far from being discouraged by this that they are animated and encouraged the more to prevail upon their hearers to espouse them and to assist them to rejoice at their successes and to mourn at their calamities and to declare themselves enemies to their native country and their native rights and traitors to their lawful prince and to their very god in spite of the most sacred and binding oaths which they have taken to the contrary nay they exhort and prevail upon those disciples to take the most solemn and binding oaths to be true to their prince their country their religion and their liberty only that they may oppress them with the greater security and betray them more effectually  nor is the doctrine of antichrist more removed from charity than his life which is the most contrary to it that possibly can be imagined he divides from his brethren of the priesthood as soon as he finds that they are obliged to profess peaceful and christian virtues and that he cannot with them compass his spiritual tyranny and st john in the words of the context makes this very division one distinguishing mark of antichrist   epist of st john chap   ver       little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby ye may know that it is the last time ver    they went out from us but hey were not of us for if they had been of us hey would no doubt have continued with us ut they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not at all of us he lives onverses with none preaches to none but such as profess divisions divides from all who are under the power of the gospel  the power of law is a foe not only to good subjects but to good princes and a friend to tyrants alone a traitor not only to his prince but to his country whose constitution he attacks by his enslaving doctrines and his more wretched abject politics of absolute nonresistance unconditional obedience the most insufferable kind of high treason for if he so justly suffers death who only attempts the executive power what may he not deserve who audaciously attacks not only all the legislative which includes the executive but the very law he not only hates both princes and subjects who govern by and declare for law but hates them with a more envenomed hatred a more felonious rancour than ever has been known upon a mere secular account reviles reproaches misrepresents calumniates them and as far as lies in his power oppresses ruins curses kills and damns them  instead of a profound and a christian humility he manifests a more than humane pride exalts himself above all that the world calls great with his independent power his uninterrupted succession his indelible character and his right divine and that pride is attended against all who oppose it with a rage an envy a hatred a malice inhuman and diabolical but above all a disdainful ridiculous fury and an unheard of cruelty a cruelty that spares no age no sex and no degree that has destroyed entire nations the people and their kings together  instead of the abject contemptible condition of our savior and his disciples behold his opposite with pompous titles and pompous equipages and an ambition still unsatiable instead of their poverty and their disinterestedness behold him loaded with benefices sinecures pluralities dignities flowing with wealth yet pining still with avarice instead of their rigid mortifications behold him indulging himself in fasts more luxurious than the feasts of others behold him meditating a lazy a refined and a temperate luxury that pampers and indulges nature instead of oppressing her that keeps all her appetites sharp and keen and raises all her lusts and passions high  as his doctrine is confirmed by his example it is extremely enforced by his manner of delivering it but because he is obliged to mix the doctrine of the gospel with his own in order to make the latter pass by virtue of the former let us distinguish what he preaches into first the doctrine of christ secondly humane traditions and humane inventions and thirdly the doctrines of devils  first then he is obliged to preach the doctrine of our savior in order to make his own pass and that doctrine comprehends first the duties and secondly the mysteries of christianity these duties likewise are either first purely moral or secondly christian for those that are purely moral he preaches them coldly enforces them feebly dehorts from the contrary vices faintly scarce ever mentions those which are most raging and most epidemical or if at any time he does mention them he has nothing in his air in his tone in his action that shows an ardent concern for the glory of god for the prosperity of the state that he lives in or for the salvation of the souls of men  for the christian virtues and especially those of charity and humility his hearers can never have any notion of em from him charity in his mouth dwindles to mere giving of alms which is but a poor and inconsiderable branch of that divine virtue he seems to be afraid to let his disciples so much as hear of the love of god and of all mankind for the sake of god or if he does at at any time mention it even that ardent virtue grows cold in his mouth and expires upon his antichristian tongue scarce ever reaching the ears of his hearers much less piercing their hearts his soul is an utter stranger to these heavenly emotions those divine raptures that inflame the hearts of the ravished hearers with seraphick love he never so much as preaches one sermon never so much as writes one treatise of that attractive virtue humility the soft and tender nurse of charity he either says nothing of patience submission forbearance longsuffering or he preaches them after such a manner that in his mouth they produce tumult fury faction riot and rebellion and all those diabolical passions and diabolical vices which are so destructive to the temporal and eternal happiness of men  and all these duties both moral and chrstian are but feebly and faintly enforced by the mysteries even those stupendous mysteries that are capable of supplying him with the most moving and sublimest eloquence with a more than humane force and fire and with a vehemence irresistible those mysteries so wonderfully important to himself and to his hearers which no man can believe and speak of as he ought to do but he must alarm and alter nature in the hearts of all who listen to him raise the most transporting joy on the one side or the most dreadful astonishment the most amazing horror on the other those very mysteries are spoke of by him after so cold and languishing a manner as causes unbelievers to turn scorners and believers to become apostates how does the deist smile and the atheist laugh to see this preacher discourse of death and judgment of heaven and hell calmly and without emotion who the moment afterward falls into a flame upon an empty dispute of turning to the east or bowing to an insensate altar  but he who is so unconcerned for the salvation of the souls of men for the honor of god and the interest of religion comes immediately to be warm and eager when his own reputation and his own interest are never so little concerned and he who daily with phlegm and temper hears the name of his maker profaned his mysteries reviled his threatenings defied his protection renounced nay and his very being denied contends warmly and eagerly for humane traditions and humane inventions for forms and rites and habits and ceremonies and whatever serves to nourish his spiritual pride and indulge his lust of power  but when in order to extinguish charity to divide mankind and to increase his own and his fathers spiritual tyranny he preaches the doctrine of devils preaches rage and hatred and envy and malice then is his delivery becoming of his doctrine then you may behold him burning with fury and distorted with convulsions and both body and soul entirely possessed with the same infernal passions which he would excite in his hearers  let us now consider the influence which such doctrines such examples and such a delivery has upon the minds of men we have already hinted that the design of the devil by antichrist is to take occasion from the christian religion by which our savior designed to unite mens affections to himself and to one another to introduce a more dangerous and desperate division among them than ever had been known before and now we shall show that he so far obtained his design that there was a more general virtue among men in the grossest times of paganism than there has been since our savior came into the world excepting the first and most primitive times of christianity that is those times when the supreme magistrate was not as yet christian and christian priests were yet undebauchd by worldly power and greatness and secondly that there is at this time a more general virtue in other places than there is in the christian world and thirdly that this deficiency and these corruptions among christians have proceeded and do proceed from the antichristian lives and doctrines of several among their clergy  first there was a more general virtue in the times of paganism than ever there has been since our savior came into the world in those times of idolatry there were more free nations in the world than ever there have been since the establishment of the christian religion and since there was more liberty then there was more union more justice more fortitude more public spirit for antichrist in order to extinguish charity and to raise divisions among men makes it his business with all his might every where to establish tyranny for as civil liberty is founded upon virtue and reason and law tyranny is established upon will and passion and vice and as mankind is united by reason and virtue and law they are divided by humor and passion and vice among those free states that flourished in the times of paganism there were two more illustrious than the rest who before corruption crept in amongst them had the moral virtues in so high a degree as no christian nation has ever been able to boast of there was a successive race of heroes among them who had not only a temperance and justice a valor but even a disinterestedness and magnanimity and an height of heroic fortitude which made them as much superior to other men as other men are to beasts nay without being taught charity by divine revelation or sustained in it by the greatness of the christian hope they practiced a very good degree of it either by the force of reason and nature or by some secret inspiration for they had a public virtue and public spirit which the christian world has thought more proper for its wonder than imitation they loved liberty and their country more than life hated slavery more than death looked upon all who favored tyrants as so many monsters and parricides and pursued tyranny with extreme vengeance even in their nearest friends and their dearest relations they laid down their lives with the greatest alacrity for their country and the public liberty and never used their valor against either they never had any faction or division upon a religious account had but few civil wars among them and not one religious except the egyptians who had degenerated into so bestial a fanaticism as made them contemptible to the rest of the world which easily understood by the force of reason that religion was designed to unite and compose and not to divide and embroil the world  if from ancient rome or athens we turn our eyes upon our own nation and upon our own times where shall we find the least footsteps of their general public or private virtue that we have not so much as the shadow of their general public virtues is plain even to sense for we see thousands among us disclaiming all pretense to it we see thousands that speak and act with impunity against their sovereign their country their liberty and their laws persons against whom those laws have made no provision because that our ancestors never believed that there could be such monsters and parricides in nature we see thousands openly threatening destruction to their country their friends their relations and to every thing that ought to be most dear to them and contriving success to the mortal enemy of all that ought to be valuable of all that ought to be sacred to to them since then we have not the general public virtue nor public spirit whieh rendered those ancient states so illustrious it follows that we have not their general private virtues for public spirit is founded upon private virtue and is the necessary result of that so that through whatever nation public spirit is spread through that nation private virtue must be generally diffused and therefore if we daily see so many attempting the ruin of their country it is because their pride their avarice their necessity and their luxury have made their present condition insupportable and any change desirable but if any one thinks those ancient states owed their general virtue to the forms of their government which were both republics to him we answer that no modern republic either has or has had the virtue which those ancient states had besides that rome was virtuous under its kings and so was sparta and macedon among the grecians as likewise persia in the times of its first monarchs  but secondly if we consider only our own times we shall find a more general virtue both public and private in any civilized nation upon the globe than in those of the christian world cast your eyes for example among the mahometans you shall find among them less ambition less avarice less luxury less fraud less injustice less perjury less perfidiousness than you shall meet with among christians you shall find that while every christian state is at present engaged against some other christian nation in a desperate bloody contention that these infidels at the same time have no wars with those of their own religion but that mahometans with mahometans the ottoman with the persian the persian with the mogul living in friendship and a profound peace listen with astonished ears to the numberless endless quarrels of the sons of charity what opinion must they conceive of our religion when they find that the only persons who profess the practice of charity are they who live in endless wars with those of their own faith that they are not only eternally engaged in civil wars which are so rare among themselves but even in wars unheard of among the infidels and which they cannot think of without horror i mean in wars of religion what opinion must they conceive of the christian religion and of the faith of those who pretend to teach others charity when they find that our very priests those dovelike messengers of the prince of peace have been the causes the abettors and the incendiaries of all those eoreign and domestic and religious wars among christians when they hear that it was a priest who first laid the plan of the french universal monarchy which has been the cause of shedding so much blood and of such horrible devastations in these western parts of europe that it was a priest who first began the design of the french succession to the spanish monarchy and that it was another priest who finished it which has let out another deluge of blood to overflow the christian world that it was a priest who put our first king charles upon those violent measures that occasioned the civil wars of england that it was a priest that involved poland in all that misery and devastation in which it now lies waste that they were priests who gave up the liberties of france and afterward that of denmark that they are priests who are at present doing their utmost endeavor to deliver up our own what must they think of the christian faith when the very vilest priests even of all the vile ones which we have mentioned above those priests who put a late unfortunate prince upon breaking through those bonds divine and human bonds which united him to his subjects those incendiaries of souls those persidious pests of societies and common disturbers of the christian world are called by the name of the blessed founder of our religion as the most profligate lay man that ever was upon the earth is entitled the most christian  but thirdly if we consider only our own nation and our own times compared with those of our ancestors we shall find that there was among them a more general public and private virtue than we our selves can boast of and that priestcraft and atheism ecclesiastical hypocrisy and laical deism right divine and socinianism nonresistance and public treason passive obedience and unnatural prodigious luxury have grown up and increased together  since then there neither is nor has been among christians the general public and private virtue that there was in the grossest times of paganism nor is there now in the christian world the same degree of virtue that is to be found in some other parts of the globe nor have we in our own nation as much general public and private virtue as our ancestors formerly had and we yet profess a religion more pure than our ancestors formerly knew a religion that teaches a more perfect and exalted virtue than the religion or the philosophy of the graecians and romans taught or than is taught by any religion that is at present established out of the christian world it follows that the want of general virtue among modern christians must proceed from the hearers or the teachers of christianity but from the hearers it cannot proceed for men are by nature the same that they were formerly have the same force of understanding the same passionate and ardent desire to be rightly instructed and to be truly happy and are the more adapted and prepared for instruction and for happiness by a greater light of knowledge and a greater experience of things  the fault being neither in the doctrine nor in the hearers it follows that the want of general virtue must proceed from some of the teachers who contaminate the doctrine of christ by their own inventions and the doctrines of devils but that the want of general virtue among us and our deplorable corruption of manners does principally proceed from the foresaid cause is evident from that which follows  a general virtue depends upon religion for all virtue proceeds from good sense or is the result of religion but not one man in fifty having good sense a general virtue must be the result of religion which is likewise proved by experience for all states through which a general virtue has been spread have been at the same time religious  but here we ought to observe that the religion upon which a general virtue depends must be a revealed religion for natural religion speaks to cultivate reason which is so rarely found among us but revelation speaks to sense which is common to all men  but of all revelations the christian religion is most proper even without the help of supernatural assistance to establish a general both public and private virtue the public because it is the only religion that teaches charity which divine virtue is the very height and perfection of public spirit the private because every virtue is comprehended in charity and because the christian religion has provided the most effectual remedies for the three chief causes of the corruption of manners which are in the words of the apostle the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life  now every religion like every government is humanly speaking maintained by the very same methods by which that particular religion was at first established as that of mahomet which began by the sword was maintained and carried on by the sword and the modern roman religion is maintained by the same force and the same fraud to which it owed its origin and every religion loses its force by the contrary methods to these which at first established it  as then the christian religion was at first established by the doctrine of charity and by the great examples of charity which our savior and his apostles gave through the whole course of their lives as it was maintained by the same methos so christian piety cannot only decay by the antichristian lives and antichristian doctrines of those who pretend to teach it  since then a general virtue in every nation depends upon the revelation established there whether true or pretended and the revelation established in every nation is maintained by the same methods to which it owed its origin and loses its force by the contrary methods as far as it can humanly lose it and since the christian revelation owes its establishment to the doctrine and examples of charity which shone in its first teachers it follows that the want of a general virtue and that deplorable corruption of manners that reigns among us are owing to the uncharitable doctrines and examples of some of the modern teachers of christianity  thus we have done our endeavor to show how antichrist stands opposed to christ in his priesthood and in his tyranny we shall only say one word of his opposition to him as a prophet and because we have reason to fear that we have been already tedious we shall pass by the other prophetical functions which are so nearly allied to those of the priesthood and only just say something of his predictions our savior foretold the destruction of jerusalem and of the second temple to confirm the faith of christians and to augment their charity by showing how little dependence is to be had upon the pomp and glories of this world and upon outward and appearing sanctity antichrist foretells the fall of the third temple which our savior has assured us shall never fall only that he may divide and embroil the world and extinguish charity for the danger of the church has now for some time been the general outcry but may we not have leave to ask those many antichrists when they say the church is in danger what they mean by the church and of whom it is composed what the danger is with which it is threatened or from whom or whence it must come may we not have leave to ask them one plain question are the souls of men to whom they preach in danger if they are not why do they preach to them but if they are is that the danger they speak of when they say the church is in danger or is it another danger if they say it is another danger can any thing be more ridiculous can any thing be more absurd when the grand concern nay the only concern the very all of those to whom they speak lies at stake to allarm them with trifles for what compared to that is not a trifle there is not one of them that preaches to a very numerous congregation but every sermon which he preaches is the last to some of them to one of them at least and who knows when they are assembled who that one may be who knows how near he himself is to death and final judgment how near to a danger horrible even to conceive and can this foolish this trifling this impudent preacher pretend to allarm them with another danger a peril of something more remote a peril perhaps in fancy or in fiction only a danger be it what it will that is not worth a moments thought compared to this stupendous danger is not this like putting a man in mind who is about to perish in a storm a thousand leagues off from shore just in the moment that the ocean opens her dreadful abyss to swallow him of putting him in mind of some trifling loss that he is like to sustain on shore would not this be a barbarous would not this be a monstrous mocking of him just in the terrible moment that he is about to perish would it not be by so much the more barbarous by so much the more monstrous in that it should come from one who must be about to perish with him  but if by this danger he means the danger of damnation which the souls are in to whom he preaches from what or whence is this danger feared is it from the actual and habitual sins of his hearers or have they so few of both that they are at leisure to apprehend damnation from something more foreign and more remote if it is from their actual and habitual sins and that extreme corruption which reigns in the congregation to which he preaches for in what congregations at present does not extreme corruption reign is not this a foolish is not this an impudent insulting of them have some certain preachers brought them into this danger and is it in their power to help them out of it and are they contented with barely threatening it has it not been made clear and most perspicuous that the extreme corruption of the laity proceeds from the antichristian doctrines proceeds from the antichristian practices of some certain preachers let but those preachers reform their doctrines and reform their practices and i will engage that the wretched laity shall reform immediately  but alas the danger that those preachers threaten is not from the sins of the people to whom they preach is not from the extreme corruption of manners that reigns in their congregations for when have these prophets ever inveighed against their most predominant vices by what sermons have they ever signalized themselves against their ambition against their avarice against their oppressions their public and private rapines against their new their unheard of their unnatural luxuries did they ever threaten them with danger from these are they really in no danger from these are they not in a thousand times more danger from these than they can be from any thing else in the world if they are why are they not told so if they are not from what wonderful what unconceivable thing is it from which they are more in danger  from what has been said it is plain that by the danger of the church these preachers mean not the danger of damnation which their hearers are in from their numerous and crying sins it follows then that they mean something that is of no concern to their hearers for if they would speak of things that are of any concern to them why not their main their whole their tremendous concern why do they omit that and threaten them with trifles why do they either not mention it or while they mention speak of it so very coldly they who while they speak of the danger of the church declaim so very warmly is it not shrewdly to be suspected that by the church they mean themselves mean their own interests and their own power o foolish and miserable laity to be so much alarmed and deluded and divided by these who are so cool so unconcerned for you so very warm and so very much concerned for themselves who not only neglect your real dangers but by falsely allarming you with imaginary ones bring you into the only real the only dreadful danger for let me ask you once more what is this pretended danger of the church is it the danger of the catholic church against the which our savior has told us that the gates of hell shall not prevail is not this assurance enough that it shall not fall or are some priests more dangerous than the devil or by the danger of the church do they mean the discipline and the government of some particular church as for example the discipline and the government of the national church of england are these in danger to be altered supposing they were these are things by the confession of all of no necessity to salvation and things by the confession of all but themselves at liberty to be altered in every nation at the will of their legislators and consequently if this danger were real it would be of no significancy to their hearers but this danger is not real and no shadow of proof has been brought to show that the discipline and government of the church are in any manner of perils nay unanswerable arguments have been brought to prove that they are not in danger o foolish and wretched people to be thus incensed and exasperated against each other by the vain fear of a fictitious danger which were in true would be ten thousand times less than the danger into which it brings you a danger which by the confession of all is the most real and most horrible of all dangers the danger of eternal damnation from your want of charity  the exactest discipline of the most perfect church is only in order to the saving of souls the design of our saviors coming into the world was to save souls and not to establish discipline for where is the discipline which our savior established can any thinking man believe that our savior jesus christ who came to pull down the partition wall that was between the jews and the gentiles by abolishing the ceremonial law and the ecclesiastic discipline of the jewish nation could ever design another certain discipline and other certain ceremonies which he could not but foresee would create a division among his future disciples but antichrist designs by destroying charity to damn souls that he may preserve discipline it is the danger that ecclesiastical discipline is in at which he is constantly alarmed o vain and impudent pretense for suppose the danger true as it is certainly most false how very foolish must that preacher be who pretends to be alarmed at any thing more than the danger of those souls which alone he preaches to save than the danger of those souls for which alone our savior died how many of those miserable souls have been for ever lost while they have been harkening to the danger of the church and dying impenitent in hatred and in devilish malice by the instigation of these their pastors against their innocent brethren have to their everlasting confusion found in hell that the church is not in danger  thirdly thus i have given you the marks by which antichrist stands opposed to jesus christ as a king a priest and a prophet i shall now sum up all those marks in one grand characteristical mark that as we have shown above that antichrist is a priest so it may be plain to the meanest capacity who these priests are of whom it may be said in the words of the text even now there are many antichrists  every priest then who when he preaches does apparently and maliciously wrest the gospel or the epistles which explain the gospel to say something that is quite contrary to the great design of our saviviour that priest is antichrist now the great design of our savior in preaching the gospel of his kingdom was to do principally two things first to restore the law of nature and secondly to revive and restore charity  first the great design of our saviors coming into the world was to restore and fulfill the law of nature matt   v    think not that i came to destroy the law and the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill and ver    for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled now what was the law that our savior came to fulfill not the ceremonial law for that he came to disannul epist to the hebrews chap   ver    for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof ver    for the law made nothing perfect and what law is it which our savior says must remain to the end of the world not the ceremonial law for that is already abolished heb  0 ver     above when he said sacrifice and offering and burntoffering thou would not neither had pleasure therein which are offered by the law then he said lo i come to do thy will o god he takes away the first that he may establish the second now what is this second law which our savior came to establish what but the law of nature or the moral law as appears by the forementioned chapter ver    this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days faith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them since then the great design of our saviors doctrine was to restore the law of nature every priest who wrests the gospel or the epistles which explain the gospel to say any thing which offends against the law of nature that priest is antichrist now the eldest of natures laws and that which man is the hardest brought to violate by the unanimous confession of all who have treated of it is selfpreservation but this is most evident that without selfdefence the law of selfpreservation cannot be kept inviolated and that without resistance there can be no selfdefence whatever priest then pretends to make the scripture say any thing against any manner of resistance of unjust violence that is necessary to selfpreservation the eldest law of nature this law which god has put in our hearts and has writ in our minds and which only the devil and his disciples can ever design to deface that priest is as much opposed to our savior as any thing possibly can be opposed and is therefore one of the many of whom we may say in the words of the text even now there are many antichrists  but secondly the other great design of our saviors doctrine was to restore charity gosp of st john chap    ver    this is my commandment that ye love one another and this great design comprehends the other viz the restoring of the law of nature gal   ver    for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self and romans    ver      0 owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loves another has fulfilled the law v   for this thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness thou shall not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self v  0 love works no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law thus charity includes the law of nature but it likewise includes a great deal more for by the law of nature as it stands now is meant only that which can be gathered by the light of reason but the law of charity includes more than what can be gathered from the light of corrupted reason and is the first law of nature which was given to adam in his state of perfection   epist of st john chap   verse    for this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning that we should love one another charity is the greatest of all the christian virtues by which alone our savior tells us matt    that men will be saved at the last day and for want of which alone he tells us they will be damned than which nothing can be more reasonable and more just for all other virtues are but in order to and as it were the scaffolding of that and are included in that when that is perfect the rest shall cease to be and all shall at last be swallowed up in charity which shall make the felicity of the blessed ten thousand ages after temperance prudence and fortitude nay after faith and hope themselves shall have been no more now charity being the only virtue that reigns in heaven he who has not been habituated to it on earth would go thither like a stranger to a remote country whose language and customs are both unknown to him and entirely different from his own and where by consequence he could neither keep any company nor find any pleasure the advancement of charity then was the great design of our saviors coming into the world for the advancement of charity is the salvation of souls and therefore that priest who wrests the scripture to say any thing destructive of that is emphatically antichrist  st paul by what he has said of charity in the   th chapter of the  st epistle to the corinthians has set before us several marks to know when the scripture is wrested to the destruction of that divine virtue  charity says he ver   suffers long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not it self is not puffed up v   does not behave it self unseemly seeks not her own is not easily provoked thinks no evil v   rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth v   bears all things believes all things hops all things endures all things from which it is plain that whatever priest makes use of the scripture to stir up division amongst men to nourish their malice their envy their pride to raise groundless fears and jealousies among them and to destroy the confidence which members of societies mutually have in each other and to compass all this by impudent ill mannerd invectives and a sort of ecclesiastical billingsgate that priest wrests the scripture to say something that is very destructive of charity and is emphatically antichrist  nothing can be more seasonable than here to consider what the apostle st james says of the tongues of such men and themselves jam   ver   the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among the members that it defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of hell v   for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and has been tamed of mankind v   but the tongue can no man tame it is abundantly evil full of deadly poison v   therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god v  0 out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be v    does a fountain send forth at the same time sweet water and bitter v    can the fig tree my brethren bear oliveberries either a vine figs so can no fountain yield both salt water and fresh and the apostle declares in the following verses that these churchincendiaries who make it their business to curse when it is their duty to bless who are agitated with rage and envy and malice have a spirit in them that is directly contrary to the spirit of the gospel ver    who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom v    but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth v    this wisdom descends not from above but is earthly sensual devilish v    for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work after that the apostle has in several of the foresaid verses shown you the spirit of antichrist in the following verses he describes the spirit of the gospel ver    but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and in the next verse he tells us the effects of it v    and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace but alas how little is there of this wisdom this spirit and this fruit among some modern preachers  thus st james declares railing to be contrary to the spirit of charity and consequently of christianity and this is the unanimous sense both of the apostles and of the evangelists and that it is never to be allowed of against any person or persons upon any pretense or occasion whatever let the crime be never so great or so horrible the greatest crime that ever was committed was the first the apostasy of lucifer from his creator the greatest of sins excepting the sin against the holy ghost and equal even to that like that so great that it was never to be attoned for by any repentance and never to be forgiven yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee the greatest crime next to these was the murdering of the lord of life and yet we find not in any of the apostles or in any one of the evangelists the least invective or the least bitterness against judas who betrayed him or the high priest who condemned him or pilate who deliver d him to the soldiers or the soldiers who mocked and scourged and crucified him and will our modern antichrists after this pretend to take occasion from the gospel of peace to rail will they yet further defend their railing by wresting the scriptures still more to their own destruction and the destruction of their credulous hearers shall the  th chapter of st pauls epistle to titus be brought to justify this spirit of antichrist i charge thee therefore before god says st paul to titus chap   ver   and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom ver   preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine to what is it that the apostle in this chapter exhorts titus why to preach the word in season and out of season that is to preach the son of god and the doctrine of charity and shall this be made use of to justify preaching up division dissension sedition and the doctrines of devils shall the apostles exhortation to reprove and to rebuke be made use of to vindicate want of manners and such rudeness as better becomes a drunken bully than a sober divine and a midnight tavern than a pulpit especially when st jude in the  th verse of his epistle mentioned above has as it were opposed rebuking to railing telling us that the archangel michael durst not bring a railing accusation against the devil but only said the lord rebuke thee and st paul tells titus in this very verse that his rebuking and reproving and exhorting must be with all longsuffering and with doctrine that is with charity the true christian is certainly the best wellmannerd man in the world if that be the truest good breeding which makes a man most easy both to himself and others and no man who calls himself a christian ever wanted manners but that man at the same time wanted both faith and charity but if no manner of railing in order to excite envy and hatred and rage and malice is allowed of by the christian religion then certainly the most criminal of all railings must be that which is pretended to be drawn from this very religion which by its principal commands a command comprehensive of all its commands obliges us to hare no man and to rail at no man but as the railing of our modern preachers can by no means be justified by st pauls exhorting rebuking and reproving can the grievous sufferings of that apostle for the sake of righteousness and the preaching of the gospel of christ be compared to a just and a moderate punishment inflicted by an offended legislature for the preaching division and sedition and the doctrine of devils especially when this very apostle has told us   cor    ver   though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profitteth me nothing from which we may conclude that many a martyr has gone to hell and passed from one flame to another is there no difference between a light suffering and a heavy one a nominal one and a real one a just one and an unjust one is there no difference between doing the work of christ and the work of the devil and his angels with whom i will not say according to their own charitable christian way of dealing that i will leave these wellnaturd preachers though it is with the company they have always kept as i believe has been made pretty plain but i humbly pray to almighty god to deliver them out of the hands of their old acquaintance who first seduced them and debauched them and whom as is manifest by their works they still frequent continually and of whose house and family they may most properly be said to be   john   ver  0 in this the children of god are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of god nor be who loves not his brother we pray to god to deliver them from these wicked spirits by a sincere repentance for all the mischief which they have done themselves and for all which they have been the occasion of in others for all the antichristian hatred that is for all the murder of which they have been guilty them and of which so many thousands have  guilty by the suggestion of them and the devil for st john tells us in the   th verse of the forementioned chapter whosoever hates his brother is a murderer the reason is plain because whoever hates another would kill him if he were not restrained by the fear of corporal punishment for this is evident that he is not restrained by the law of nature nor by the positive law of god not by the law of nature because that obliges him not to hate him by its great and comprehensive rule of doing as one would be done by for no man is willing to be hated by another nor is he restrained by the positive law of god because that obliges him not to hate him it follows then that he is only awed by the fear of corporal punishment and how often has this religious hatred this hatred excited by antichrist and the devil broke out in wars in murders in burnings and in massacres how near did it come to these confusions and these horrors lately how soon would it yet come to them if it were not restrained by the wisdom of our legislators we humbly beseech almighty god to cleanse the hearts of all these antichrists by a severe repentance for the numberless murders of which they have certainly contracted the malicious guilt and for perfidiously sapping at the same time the foundations of our constitution and the fundamentals of christianity we humbly beseech thee o god to pour into their hearts thy spirit of peace of meekness and of charity that they may be delivered from every evil work and preservd unto thine own kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen  the end
