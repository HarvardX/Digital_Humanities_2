a narrative of the method etc  a narrative of the method by which the private letters of mr pope have been procured and published by edmund curll bookseller nb the original papers in curls own hand may be seen at t coopers  london printed for t cooper in paternoster row mdccxxxv  a narrative of the method by which mr popes private letters were procured and published by edmund curl bookseller it has been judged that to clear an affair which seemed at first sight a little mysterious and which though it concerned only one gentleman is of such a consequence as justly to alarm every person in the nation would not only be acceptable as a curiosity but useful as a warning and perhaps flagrant enough as an example to induce the legislature to prevent for the future an enormity so prejudicial to every private subject and so destructive of society it self  this will be made so plain by the ensuing papers that twill scarce be needful to attend them with any reflections more than what every reader may make  in the year      edmund curl bookseller published a collection of several private letters of mr pope to henry cromwell esquire which he obtained in this manner  mr cromwell was acquainted with one mrs thomas to whom he had the indiscretion to lend these letters and who falling into misfortunes seven years after sold them to mr curll without the consent either of mr pope or mr cromwell as appears from the following letters  to henry cromwell esquire june         after so long a silence as the many and great oppressions i have sighed under has occasioned one is at a loss how to begin a letter to so kind a friend as your self but as it was always my resolution if i must sink to do it as decently that is as silently as i could so when i found my self plunged into unforeseen and unavoidable ruin i retreated from the world and in a manner buried my self in a dismal place where i knew none nor none knew me in this dull unthinking way i have protracted a lingering death for life it cannot be called ever since you saw me sequestered from company deprived of my books and nothing left to converse with but the letters of my dead or absent friends amongst which latter i always placed yours and mr popes in the first rank i lent some of them indeed to an ingenious person who was so delighted with the specimen that he importuned me for a sight of the rest which having obtained he conveyed them to the press i must not say altogether with my consent nor wholly without it i thought them too good to be lost in oblivion and no cause to apprehend the disobliging of any the public viz all persons of taste and judgment would be pleased with so agreeable an amusement mr cromwell could not be angry since it was but justice to his merit to publish the solemn and private professions of love gratitude and veneration made to him by so celebrated an author and surely mr pope ought not to resent the publication since the early pregnancy of his genius was no dishonor to his character and yet had either of you been asked common modesty would have obliged you to refuse what you would not have been displeased with if done without your knowledge and besides to end all dispute you had been pleased to make me a free gift of them to do what i pleased with them and every one knows that a person to whom a letter is addressed has the same right to dispose of it as he has of goods purchased with his money i doubt not but your generosity and honor will do me the right of owning by a line that i came honestly by them i flatter my self in a few months i shall again be visible to the world and whenever through good providence that turn shall happen i shall joyfully acquaint you with it there being none more truly your obliged servant than sir  your faithful and most humble seevant e thomas p s a letter sir directed to mrs thomas to be left at my house will be safely transmitted to her by e curl     to mr pope epsom july        when these letters were first printed i wondered how curl could come by them and could not but laugh at the pompous title since whatever you wrote to me was humor and familiar raillery as soon as i came from epsom i heard you had been to see me and i writ you a short letter from wills that i longed to see you mr d  s about that time charged me with giving them to a mistress which i positively denied not in the least at that time thinking of it but some time after finding in the newspapers letters from lady packington lady chudleigh and mr norris to the same sapho or e t i began to fear that i was guilty i have never seen these letters of curls nor would go to his shop about them i have not seen this sapho alias e t these seven years  her writing that i gave her them to do what she would with them was straining the point too far i thought not of it nor do i think she did then but severe necessity which catches hold of a twig has produced all this which has lain hid and forgot by me so many years curl sent me a letter last week desiring a positive answer about this matter but finding i would give him none he went to e t and writ a postscript in her long romantic letter to direct my answer to his house but they not expecting an answer sent a young man to me whose name it seems is pattisson i told him i should not write any thing but i believed it might be so as she writ in her letter i am extremely concerned that my former indiscretion in putting them into the hands of this pretiuse should have given you so much disturbance for the last thing i should do would be to disoblige you for whom i have ever preserved the greatest esteem and shall ever be sir  your faithful friend and most humble servant henry cromwell   to mr pope august        though i writ my long narrative from epsom till i was tired yet was i not satisfied left any doubt should rest upon your mind i could not make protestations of my innocence of a grievous crime but i was impatient till i came to town that i might send you those letters as a clear evidence that i was a perfect stranger to all their proceedings should i have protested against it after the printing it might have been taken for an attempt to decry his purchase and as the little exception you have taken has served him to play his game upon us for these two years a new incident from me might enable him to play it on for two more  the great value she expresses for all you write and her passion for having them i believe was what prevailed upon me to let her keep them by the interval of twelve years at least from her possession to the time of printing them it is manifest that i had not the least ground to apprehend such a design but as people in great straits bring forth their hoards of old gold and most valuable jewels so sapho had recourse to her hid treasure of letters and played off not only yours to me but all those to her self as the ladies last stake into the press  as for me i hope when you shall cooly consider the many thousand instances of our being deluded by females since that great original of adam by eve you will have a more favorable thought of the undesigning error of  your faithful friend and humble servant henry cromwell   this treatment being extremely disagreeable to mr pope he was advised to recall any letters which might happen to be preserved by any of his friends particularly those written to persons deceased which would be most subject to such an accident many of these were returned him  some of his friends advised him to print a collection himself to prevent a worse but this he would by no means agree to however as some of the letters served to revive several past scenes of friendship and others to clear the truth of facts in which he had been misrepresented by the common scribblers he was induced to preserve a few of his own letters as well as of his friends these as i have been told he inserted in two books some originals others copies with a few notes and extracts here and there added in the same books he caused to be copied some small pieces in verse and prose either of his own or his correspondents which though not finished enough for the public were such as the partiality of any friend would be sorry to be deprived of  to this purpose an amanuensis or two were employed by mr pope when the books were in the country and by the earl of oxford when they were in town  it happened soon after that the posthumous works of mr wycherly were published in such a manner as could no way increase the reputation of that gentleman who had been mr popes first correspondent and friend and several of these letters so fully showed the state of that case that it was thought but a justice to mr wycherlys memory to print a few to discredit that imposition these were accordingly transcribed for the press from the manuscript books abovementioned  they were no sooner printed but edmund curl looked on these too as his property for a copy is extant which he corrected in order to another impression interlind and added marginal notes to in his own hand  he then advertised anew the letters to mr cromwell with additions and promised encouragement to all persons who should send him more  this is a practice frequent with booksellers to swell an authors works in which they have some property with any trash that can be got from any hand or where they have no such works to procure some curl has in the same manner since advertised the letters of mr prior and mr addison a practice highly deserving some check from the legislature since every such advertisement is really a watchword to every scoundrel in the nation and to every domestic of a family to get a penny by producing any scrap of a mans writing of what nature soever or by picking his masters pocket of letters and papers  a most flagrant instance of this kind was the advertisement of an intended book called gulliveriana secunda where it was promised that any thing which any body should send as mr popes or dr swifts should be printed and inserted as theirs  by these honest means mr curl went on increasing his collection and finding as will be seen hereafter by no   a further prospect of doing so he retarded his edition of mr cromwells letters till the twentysecond of march       and then sent mr pope the following letter the first he ever received from him  no i sir to convince you of my readiness to oblige you the enclosed is a demonstration you have as he says disobliged a gentleman the initial letters of whose name are p t i have some other papers in the same hand relating to your family which i will show if you desire a sight of them your letters to mr cromwell are out of print and i intend to print them very beautifully in an octavo volume i have more to say than is proper to write and if you will give me a meeting i will wait on you with pleasure and close all differences betwixt you and yours  e curl rosestreet    march      p s i expect the civility of an answer or message     the enclosed were two scraps of paper supposed to be p ts a feigned hand the first containing this advertisement  no ii letters of alexander pope esquire and several eminent hands from the year   0  to      containing a critical philological and historical correspondence between him and henry cromwell esquire william wycherly esquire william walsh esquire william congreve esquire sir william trumbull sir richard steel e o  mr addison m craggs mr gay dean swift etc with several letters to ladies to the number of two hundred n b the originals will be shown at ed curls when the book is published  the other paper was a scrap of some letter in the same hand which expressed a dissatisfaction at curl for not having printed his advertisement  what more cannot be seen for the rest is cut off close to the writing  mr popes friends imagined that the whole design of e curl was to get him but to look on the edition of cromwells letters and so to print it as revised by mr pope in the same manner as he sent an obscene book to a reverend bishop and then advertised it as corrected and revised by him or if there was any such proposal from p t curl would not fail to embrace it perhaps pay for the copy with the very money he might draw from mr p  to suppress it and say p t had kept another copy he therefore answered the only way he thought it safe to correspond with him by a public advertisement in the daily postboy  no iii whereas a p has received a letter from e c bookseller pretending that a person the initials of whose name are p t has offered the said e c to print a large collection of mr ps letters to which e c requires an answer a p having never had nor intending to have any private correspondence with the said e c gives it him in this manner that he knows no such person as p t that he believes he has no such collection and that he thinks the whole a forgery and shall not trouble himself at all about it  ed curl returned an impertinent answer in the same paper the next day denying that he endeavored to correspond with mr p and affirming that he wrote by direction but declaring that he would instantly print the said collection in a few days more he published the advertisement of the book as above with this addition  e c as before in the like case will be faithful he now talked of it every where said that p t was a lord or a person of consequence who printed the book at a great expense and sought no profit but revenge on mr pope who had offended him particularly that some of the letters would be such as both church and state would take notice of but that p t would by no means be known in it that he never would once be seen by him but treated in a very secret manner he told some persons that sifted him in this affair that he had conversed only with his agent a clergyman of the name of smith who came as he said from southwark with this person it was that curl transacted the affair who before all the letters of the book were delivered to curl insisted on the letters of p t being returned him to secure him from all possibility of a discovery as appears from no    mr pope on hearing of this smith and finding when the book came out that several of the letters could only have come from the manuscriptbook beforementioned published this advertisement  whereas a person who signs himhimself p t and another who writes himself r smith and passes for a clergyman have transacted for some time past with edm curl and have in combination printed the private letters of mr pope and his correspondents some of which could only be procured from his own library or that of a noble lord and which have given a pretense to the publishing others as his which are not so as well as interpolating those which are this is to advertise that if either of the said persons will discover the whole of this affair he shall receive a reward of twenty guineas or if he can prove he has acted by for curl had said in his advertisement that he wrote to mr p by direction and another of his drawing up of mr popes life began thus by direction  direction of any other and of what person he shall receive double that sum  whether this advertisement or the future quarrel of curl and smith about profits produced what followed we cannot say but in a few days the ensuing papers being the whole correspondence of p t and edm cur were sent to the publisher t cooper which we shall here lay before the reader they begin as high as  no iv mr curl october the    th      understanding you propose to write the life of mr pope this is only to inform you i can send you diverse memoirs which may be serviceable if your design be really to do him neither injustice nor show him favor i was well acquainted with his father and with the first part of his own life though since he has treated me as a stranger it is certain some late pamphlets are not fair in respect to his father who was of the younger branch of a family in good repute in ireland and related to the lords down formerly of the same name he was as he has told me himself and he was very different from his son a modest and plain honest man a posthumous son and left little provided for his elder brother having what small estate there was who afterward studied and died at oxford he was put to a merchant in flanders and acquired a moderate fortune by merchandise which he quitted at the revolution in very good circumstances and retired to windsor forest where he purchased a small estate and took great delight in husbandry and gardens his mother was one of seventeen children of w turnor esquire formerly of burfit hall in the  riding of yorkshire two of her brothers were killed in the civil wars this is a true account of mr popes family and parentage of his manners i cannot give so good an one yet as i would not wrong any man both ought to be true and if such be your design i may serve you in it not entering into any thing in any wise libellous you may please to direct an answer in the daily advertiser this daysennight in these terms  e c has received a letter and will comply with p t  yours  on the backside of this letter is endorsd in curls hand  notice was accordingly given as desired in the daily advertiser upon which was sent the following letter   no v sir nov         i troubled you with a line some time since concerning your design of the life of mr pope to which i desired your answer in the daily advertiser of thursday the  0th instant october i do not intend my self any other profit in it than that of doing justice to and on that person upon whom sir you have conferred some care as well as pains in the course of your life and i intend him the like for his conduct toward me a propos to his life there have lately fallen into my hands a large collection of his letters from the former part of his days to the year      which being more considerable than any yet seen and opening very many scenes new to the world will alone make a perfect and the most authentic life and memoirs of him that could be to show you my sincerity and determinate resolution of assisting you herein i will give you an advertisement which you may publish forthwith if you please and on your so doing the letters shall be sent you they will make a four or fivesheet book yet i expect no more than what will barely pay a transcriber that the originals may be preserved in mine or your hands to vouch the truth of them i am of opinion these alone will contain his whole history if you add to them what you formerly printed of those to henry cromwell esquire here a part of the letter is cut off and the following words indorsd by curl  but you must put out an advertisement for   otherwise i shall not be justified to some people who have influence and on whom i have some dependence unless it seem to the public eye as no entry act of mine but i may be justified and excused if after they see such a collection is made by you i acknowledge i sent some letters to contribute thereto they who know what has passed betwixt mr pope and me formerly may otherwise think it dishonorable i should set such a thing afoot therefore print the advertisement i sent you and you shall instantly hear from or see me  adieu t p  here a postscript is cut off   there appears no other letter from p t till one of april the  th which must be in      as it relates plainly to mr popes advertisement in answer to curls letter to him of march   d which see above no    no vi april   i see an advertisement in the daily advertisements which i take to relate to me i did not expect you of all men would have betrayed me to squire pope but you and he both shall soon be convinced it was no forgery for since you would not comply with my proposal to advertise i have printed them at my own expense being advised that i could safely do so i would still give you the preference if you will pay the paper and print and allow me handsomely for the copy but i shall not trust you to meet and converse upon it after the suspicion i have of your dealings with master p unless i see my advertisement of the book printed first within these four or five days if you are afraid of mr p and dare not set your name to it as i proposed at first i do not insist thereupon so i be but concealed by this i shall determine and if you will not another will it makes a five shilling book i am  your servant p t   no vii on a scrap of paper torn from a letter the direction crossed out  sir i should not deal thus cautiously or in the dark with you but that it is plain from your own advertisement that you have been treating with mr pope   no viii on another piece cut off  i still give you sir the preference if you will give me   l a score for   0 each book containing   0 pages  vo and pay down    l of the same the whole impression shall be yours and there are letters enough remaining if you require to make another  0 sheets   vo a five shillings book you need only answer thus in the daily post or advertiser in four days  e c will meet p t at the rose tavern by the playhouse at seven in the evening april   d and one will come and show you the sheets   mr curls answers no ix sir   th april      i have not ever met with any thing more inconsistent than the several proposals of your letters the first bearing date oct   th      gives some particulars of mr popes life which i shall shortly make a public use of in his life now going to the press  the second of your letters of nov   th      informs me that if i would publish an advertisement of a collection of mr popes letters in your custody the originals should be forthwith sent me and for which you would expect no more than what would pay for a transcript of em  in your third letter of the fourth instant you groundlesly imagine i have attempted to betray you to mr pope say you have printed these letters your self and now want to be handsomely allowed for the copy viz   l a score which is   l more than they cost printing appoint a meeting at the rose on the   d instant where i was to see the sheets dealing thus as you truly call it in the dark  april    you put off this meeting fearing a surprise from mr pope how should he know of this appointment unless you gave him notice i fear no such besettings either of him or his agents that the paying of seventyfive pounds would bring you to town in a fortnight would i be so silly as to declare it by your last letter of last night a gentleman is to be at my door at eight this evening who has full commission from you  you want seventyfive pounds for a person you would serve that sum i can easily pay if i think the purchase would be of any service to me but in one word sir i am engaged all this evening and shall not give my self any further trouble about such jealous groundless and dark negociations an honorable and open dealing is what i have been always used to and if you will come into such a method i will meet you anywhere or shall be glad to see you at my own house otherwise apply to whom you please  yours e c for p t or the gentleman who comes from him at eight this evening  this appears to be the first time curl had any personal conference with r smith the clergyman  no x to the reverend mr  sir i am ready to discharge the expense of paper print and copymoney and make the copy my own if we agree but if i am to be your agent then i insist to be solely so and will punctually pay every week for what i sell to you    no xi answer to p ts of  d of may  sir you shall as all i have ever had any dealings with have find a just and honorable treatment from me but consider sir as the public by your means entirely have been led into an initial correspondence betwixt e c and p t and betwixt a p and e c the secret is still as recondite as that of the freemasons p t are not i dare say the true initials of your name or if they were mr pope has publicly declared that he knows no such person as p t how then can any thing you have communicated to me discover you or expose you to his resentment  i have had letters from another correspondent who subscribes himself e p which i shall print as vouchers in mr popes life as well as those from p t which as i take it were all sent me for that purpose or why were they sent at all  your friend was with me on wednesday last but i had not your last till this morning saturday  d of may i am sir  yours e c p s what you say appears by my advertisement in relation to mr pope i faithfully told your friend the clergyman i wrote to mr pope to acquaint him that i was going to print a new edition of his letters to mr cromwell and offered him the revisal of the sheets hoping likewise that it was now time to close all former resentments which on honorable terms i was ready to do i told him likewise i had a large collection of others of his letters which from your two years silence on that head i thought was neither unjust nor dishonorable     no xii  i cannot send the p t s letters to curl letters now because i have them not all by me but either this evening or tomorrow you shall not fail of them for some of them are in a scrutore of mine out of town and i have sent a messenger for them who will return about three or four this afternoon be not uneasy i never break my word and as honorable and just treatment shall be shown by me i shall expect the same return  the estimate and letters you shall have together but i desire the bearer may bring me fifty more books pray come to night if you can  i am faithfully yours e curl for the reverend mr smith half an hour past ten  curl was now so elated with his success the books in his hands and as he thought the men too that he raised the style of his advertisement which he published on the   th of may in these words in the daily postboy  no xiii this day are published and most beautifully printed price five shillings mr popes literary correspondence for thirty years from   0  to

manuscripts of which affidavit is made may be seen at mr curls house by all who desire it  and immediately after he writes thus to smith  no xiv sir   th may      your letter written at two afternoon on saturday i did not receive till past ten at night the title will be done to day and according to your promise i fully depend on the books and mss tomorrow i hope you have seen the postboy and by this it appears it was of curls own drawing up which he denied to the lords approve the manner of the advertisement i shall think every hour a long period of time till i have more books and see you being sir  for the reverend mr smith sincerely yours e curl   but the tables now began to turn it happened that the booksellers bill for so it was properly called though entitled an act for the better encouragement of learning came on this day in the house of lords some of their lordships having seen an advertisement of so strange a nature thought it very unfitting such a bill should pass without a clause to prevent such an enormous license for the future and the earl of i  y having read it to the house observed further that as it pretended to publish several letters to lords with the respective answers of each correspondent it was a breach of privilege and contrary to a standing order of the house whereupon it was ordered that the gentleman usher of the black rod do forthwith seize the the impression of the said book and that the said e curl with j wilford for whom the daily postboy is printed do attend the house tomorrow and it was also ordered that the bill for the better encouragement of learning be read a second time on this day sevennight by this incident the booksellers bill was thrown out  may         the order made yesterday upon complaint of an advertisement in the postboy of the publication of a book entitled mr popes literary correspondence for thirty years past being read mr wilford the publisher and mr e curl were severally called in and examined and being withdrawn  ordered that the matter of the said complaint be referred to a committee to meet tomorrow and that e curl do attend the said committee and that the black rod do attend with some of the said books  may    p t writes to curl on the unexpected incident of the lords to instruct him in his answers to their examination and with the utmost care to conceal himself to this effect  no xv that he congratulates him on his victory over the lords the pope and the devil that the lords could not touch a hair of his head if he continued to behave boldly that it would have a better air in him to own the printing as well as the publishing since he was no more punishable for one than for the other that he should answe nothing more to their interrogatories tha that he received the letters from different hands that some of them he bought other were given him and that some of the originals he had and the rest he should shortly have p t tells him further that he shall soon take off the mask he complains of that he is not a man of quality as he imagined but one conversant with such and was concerned particularly with a noble friend of mr popes in preparing for the press the letters to mr wycherly that he caused a number over and above to be printed having from that time conceived the thought of publishing a volume of ps letters which he went on with and ordered as nearly as possible to resemble that impression but this was only in ordine ad to another more material volume of his correspondence with bishop atterbury and the late lord oxford and bolingbroke and he confesses he made some alterations in these letters with a view to those which mr curl shall certainly have if he behaves as he directs and every way conceals p t   we have not this original letter but we hope mr curl will print it if not it can only be for this reason that as it preceded their quarrel but one day it proves the letters to bishop atterbury lord bollingbroke etc cannot be in curls hands though he has pretended to advertise them  the next day curl answers him thus  no xvi thursday   mane   th may      dear sir i am just again going to the lords to finish pope i desire you to send me the sheets to perfect the first fifty books and likewise the remaining three hundred books and pray be at the standard tavern this evening and i will pay you twenty pounds more my defense is right i only told the lords i did not know from whence the books came and that my wife received them this was strict truth and prevented all further enquiry the lords declared they had been made popes tool i put my self upon this single point and insisted as there was not any peers letter in the book i had not been guilty of any breach of privilege  lord delawar will be in the chair by ten this morning and the house will be up before three  i depend that the books and the imperfections will be sent and believe of p t what i hope he believes of me  for the reverend mr smith  the book was this day produced and it appearing that contrary to the advertisement there were no letters of lords contained in it and consequently not falling under the order of the house the books were redeliverd  at the same time curl produced and showed to several of the lords the foregoing letter of p t which seems extraordinary unless they had begun to quarrel about profits before that day but after it it is evident from the next letter that they had an information of his willingness to betray them and so get the whole impression to himself  no xvii to the reverend mr smith rose street past three friday    may      sir   i am falsely accused   i value not any mans change of temper i will never change my veracity for falsehood in owning a fact of which i am innocent   i did not own the books came from across the water nor ever named you all i said was that the books came by water   when the books were seized i sent my son to convey a letter to you and as you told me every body knew you in southwark i bid him make a strict enquiry as i am sure you would have done in such an exigency   sir i have acted justly in this affair and that is what i shall always think wisely   i will be kept no longer in the dark p t is will of the wisp all the books i have had are imperfect the first  0 had no titles nor prefaces the last   bundles seized by the lords contained but    in each bundle which amounts to   0 and  0 is in all but   0 books   as to the loss of a future copy i despise it nor will i be concerned with any more such dark suspicious dealers but now sir i will tell you what i will do when i have the books perfected which i have already received and the rest of the impression i will pay you for them but what do you call this usage first take a note for a month and then want it to be changed for one of sir richard hoares  my note is as good for any sum i give it as the bank and shall be as punctually paid i always say gold is better than paper and  0 l i will pay if the books are perfected to morrow morning and the rest sent or to night is the same thing to me but if this dark converse goes on i will instantly reprint the whole book and as a supplement to it all the letters p t ever sent me of which i have exact copies together with all your originals and give them in upon oath to my lord chancellor you talk of trust p t has not reposed any in me for he has my money and notes for imperfect books let me see sir either p t or your self or you will find the scots proverb verified  nemo me impune lacessit your abused humble servant e curl p s lord  i attend this day lord delawar i sup with to night where pope has one lord i have twenty     mr curl just after in the london post or daily advertiser printed this advertisement  no xviii  mr popes litterary correspondence etc with a supplement of the initial correspondence of p t e p r s etc  to which in two days more his correspondents returned the following  no xix to manifest to the world the insolence of e curl we hereby declare that neither p t much less r s his agent ever did give or could pretend to give any title whatever in mr popes letters to the said e curl and he is hereby challenged to produce any pretense to the copy whatsoever  we helped the said e curl to the letters and joined with him on condition he should pay a certain sum for the books as he sold them accordingly the said e curl received   0 books which he sold perfect and imperfect at   shill each and for all which he never paid more than  0 guineas and gave notes for the rest which proved not negotionable besides which p t was persuaded by r s at the instigation of e curl to pay the expense of the whole impression viz    l no part whereof was repaid by the said curl therefore every bookseller will be indemnifyd every way from any possible prosecution or molestation of the said e curl and whereas the said e curl threatens to publish our correspondence and as much as in him lies to betray his benefactors we shall also publish his letters to us which will open a scene of baseness and foul dealing that will sufficiently show to mankind his character and conduct  may   d      p t r s   the effect of this quarrel has been the putting into our hands all the correspondence above which having given the reader to make what reflections he pleases on we have nothing to add but our hearty wishes in which we doubt not every honest man will concur that the next sessions when the booksellers bill shall be again brought in the legislature will be pleased not to extend the privileges without at the same time restraining the license of bookellers since in a case so notorious as the printing a gentlemans private letters most eminent both printers and booksellers conspired to assist the pyracy both in printing and in vending the same  p s we are informed that notwithstanding the pretenses of edmund curl the original letters of mr pope with the postmarks upon them remain still in the books from whence they were copied and that so many omissions and interpolations have been made in this publication as to render it impossible for mr p to own them in the condition they appear  finis
