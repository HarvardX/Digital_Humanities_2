lives in burrows which it forms about an inch or more below the surface of the ground the female deposits a large bed of eggs about the size of small pease rather of an oval form and brownish color they are laid in a circular cavity which is two or three inches wide and near an inch in height an aperture is made on one side with an easy ascent to the surface of the ground and is ingeniously covered at the top with loose earth when the young larvae are first hatched they scarcely exceed the twelfth of an inch in length they ascend through the opening and subsist on the plants nearest their habitation till their fore claws have acquired sufficient strength to burrow into the earth in the larva state they nearly equal the perfect insect in size and resemble it in every respect except that they have no wings the shells appear first this is the pupa state and shortly after the membraneous wings appear also it makes very little use of its wings as they are too weak to support its body long and indeed it has not much occasion for them as it lives in the same manner as the mole and like it is furnished with powerful claws with which it can burrow through the ground to a very considerable distance  this destructive creature is generally found in great numbers wherever they once deposit their eggs for it is impossible to pursue and destroy them without doing much injury to the ground they infest if they find a way into a kitchengarden they sometimes destroy whole beds of young plants in the space of one night and this is not astonishing when we consider that they seldom eat any part except the roots which they nip very close and consequently the other parts must perish they seem particularly fond of lettuces  fig i one of the fore claws   plate cxlviii phalaena

destroy them but a gentleman who happened to pass by at the same instant having either more curiosity or less apprehension of danger from touching them took them up and preserved them we conclude they

who are not in the habit of collecting insects that their occasional endeavors would be likely to extend the science of entomology for it often happens that the most assiduous naturalists are indebted to such persons for the rarest specimens their cabinets can boast  the moths were found late in june on examining the crevices of some of the trees near the spot we found a quantity of the eggs they were rather of an oval form and linked together like a chain as shown in the plate and having carefully preserved them in a branch of a plumbtree i frequently find when the plant of an insect is unknown that they will live on the plumbtree when they refuse other food under the bark we had the satisfaction to see some young caterpillars produced in a few weeks but either owing to the want of proper food or good management they all died soon after except two or three and these never arrived at their full size the caterpillar from which the figure in the annexed is copied was found under the bark of one of the elmtrees in st jamess park but being disturbed it never became a pupa the caterpillar makes a case of the dust of the wood which it gnaws and cements together and in this it lies concealed beneath the bark the head of the caterpillar is hard and the first ring is furnished with a strong horny substance  harris about twenty years ago was so fortunate as to breed this moth from the caterpillar and we are not acquainted with any similar instance since that time in the plates of roesel vol   a figure of the caterpillar is given but without either pupa or moth so that were it not for the reference and authority of linnaeus and since his time of fabricius it would scarcely be known to what insect it belonged the eggs we have not found either figured or described though they are so very singularly united together and would certainly have been noticed by the ingenious roesel if he had met with them  the antennae of the female are setaceous or like a bristle but that

there are a few species whose manners are so peculiar and their changes so astonishing that they seem to demand more than ordinary attention and of this description we consider the subject of the annexed plate if we speak of it as to its manners collectively one peculiarity implies a contradiction of the other for it is an aquatic a terrestrial and an aerial creature few insects that inhabit the water in the perfect state ever quit it and the generality of those whose larvae live in that element could exist for a few minutes only in it after they become winged insects this is particularly noticed of the libellulae phryganeae ephemerae tipulae and an immense crowd of other insects that are bred in the water but it appears this insect in the larva state can leave the water without injury and in the last state though a winged creature it lives for the most part in the water and quits it only in the evenings or when the pool dries up it uses its wings in search of another  in the larva state it is not less remarkable for its savage disposition than its formidable appearance the whole body is covered with a hard shell or coat of mail and the head is armed with two long semicircular sharppointed forceps it is very alert in the water and when it takes its prey which consists of smaller aquatic insects it plunges these weapons into them and through a minute aperture at the extremity it extracts all their juices when the time arrives in which it is to become a pupa it leaves the water and forms a cavity just below the surface of the earth of an oval form how long it remains in this cavity in the pupa state is uncertain the beetle comes forth in may  much doubt has arose respecting the female of this species linnaeus in the systema naturae described the supposed female as b dysticus semistriatus fabricius in the species insectorum adds a long list of synonyms from different entomological writers several of whom had figured or described it as a distinct species before the time of linnaeus and some subsequent authors have held the same opinion but in the last work entomologia systema fabricius considers it to be the female and includes only a few of his former references upon the first view of these opinions the point seems undetermined and though we partly assent to the opinion of the last writer we must endeavor to be entirely satisfied before we give a figure of dytiscus semistriatus  the upper side of this insect is generally described black this is not the color in living specimens it is of a fine glossy blackgreen and the marginal color brighter than in those that have been dead some time the greenish hue on the back seldom entirely disappears  the fore feet of this beetle have an appendage of a very singular structure it is nearly round flat beneath and has in the middle two remarkable circular cavities with many others more minute it is supposed that through minute apertures in these cavities it can emit a kind of oily fluid or that by their assistance it can collect air bubbles to raise itself from the deep parts of the water to the surface in an instant the larva of the musca chamaelion which lives in the water collects the air in a bubble within the rays of its tail and thereby raises itself to the surface in like manner  fig   the eggs fig   the larva fig   the pupa   plate clxii fig i ii lepisma polypoda aptera no

fifteen years ago is evident from this circumstance few collections of british insects that were in the hands of eminent collectors are without an english specimen which was procured about that time and harris in      as well as some other writers about the same period speak confidently of its being found in this country berkenhout in his synopsis says it is  frequent about ealing in middlesex but this we can on the best authority dispute it never was frequent in that place though it has several times been met with by collectors of insects a parcel of eggs being obtained from them and hatching many caterpillars were procured and these being carefully attended several moths were also produced this is not a very extraordinary circumstance as many of the rarest insects may become common when the eggs or a brood of caterpillars can be discovered  we are willing to acknowledge that we have not been more fortunate in our researches for the caterpillar or moth of this species than any others engaged in the science of entomology but we have procured from germany a collection containing many valuable rarities that have been found in this country at different times amongst these we have most perfect and finely preserved specimens of phalaena dispar in its several states and these perfectly agree with those formerly collected in england our plate contains only one figure of the caterpillar and that is of the female the male differs only in being smaller and in the size of the head which is less in proportion than that of the female  in this instance we trust any apology will be unnecessary though the original specimens were not found in this country it must be an advantage to the work to contain figures of the rarest insects and should any of our readers be so fortunate as to find the caterpillar they will be able to determine the species and the proper food to rear it on or if the brood be extinct the plate will be more interesting as there cannot remain a doubt of its having been indigenous in england  in foreign countries it is very injurious to gardens and fruit trees in particular berkenhout says it feeds on oak ash apple trees etc but we are rather inclined to doubt his information except as to the latter though he is partly sanctioned by linnaeus geoffroy says it feeds on the elm  for the time of its appearance we are indebted to harris he says

skin several times before it becomes a pupa its exuviae we frequently find adhering to roseleaves when the larva is in its last skin it is yellowish inclining to orange with many minute black specks disposed in ringlets on every joint but in the early stages of its growth we find them of several shades of colors between green and orange and some partake of both colors and are speckled with black as in the last skin the larva is very tender and we suspect is liable to some distemper of a very different kind from any noticed to affect other insects it then appears sickly and is covered with a whitish down or powder which flies off on the slightest touch we have often found the larva of another species of the same genus covered with this kind of white powder but as they always died it is impossible to determine to what insect they belonged  in the pupa state the outer case is not perfectly oval but rather flattened on the sides it is generally fastened on a stalk the perfect insect is found in great plenty during most of the summer months  several early systematic writers placed this insect amongst those whose antennae consisted of seven joints or articulations whence linnaeus in the last edition of the syst not antennis septemnodiis etc is changed for antennis clavato filiformibus etc included the number of the joints with the specific character and in the species insectorum fabricius has followed the same arrangement though with the assistance of a microscope we may discover in this and other species the exact number of the articulations described yet they are too minute to serve as part of a good specific character which should if possible be selected from the most conspicuous and peculiar parts of the insect fabricius seems to have been aware of this in his last

part of the european continent and though unfortunately the descriptions are written in a language so little understood as to be wholly useless the figures are very interesting in this instance we have deviated no more from our original plan than when we introduced the larva of sphinx euphorbiae and phalaena fraxini and we flatter ourselves in thus endeavoring to give the history of a rare insect complete the approbation expressed by our subscribers on former occasions will not be withheld on the present  roesel in      published the insecten belustigung in which work we find a figure

collar being red instead of blue  as this part of his work is scarcely known and has not yet been noticed by fabricius we cannot collect the opinion of any systematical writer whether it be the other sex or only a different skin  the pupa we received with the moths and the eggs figured in plate     were taken from the body of the female   plate clxxviii phalaena pini pine lappet moth lepidoptera

of those species of insects that we can have no doubt are natives of this country from the concurrent testimony of the respectable authors though from the scarcity of many amongst them we should be scarcely inclined to admit them into an english collection without such authority perhaps the rarity of some of those insects should be rather attributed to the little attention bestowed on the science of entomology by such as reside in parts of the kingdom that are most favorable to the increase of insects in general or to those particularly rare species that are local or feed only on plants of one kind such as the sphinx euphorbiae and many others  wilks has given the pine lappet moth in the third plate of the english butterflies harris has not figured it in the aurelian published in       but in the pocket companion      he not only describes it amongst the english lepidoptera but says the time of its changing into chrysalis is may and that it appears in the winged state in june from this we must suppose that he had reared it from the caterpillar berkenhout in his synopsis of the natural history of great britain       has given it without hesitation as an english insect and the authority of a little tract on insects by martin       may be adduced as a further confirmation of its being a native of this country  this insect is not uncommon in germany schaeffer has figured it amongst the insects that are to be found in the environs of ratisbon and roesel without considering it a local species has given it as a native of germany whether it is found in other parts of europe except switzerland and germany we cannot decide but we have the precise species from georgia in north america  we observe a considerable difference between the coloring of this moth in the works of schaeffer and roesel which is the more remarkable as they both describe the insects of the same country the figure given by the latter is much darker in the chestnut color and the gray has no appearance of an intermixture of red specks and markings like that figured in schaeffer which inclines very much to red or flesh color throughout roesel has only figured the female schaeffer has given
