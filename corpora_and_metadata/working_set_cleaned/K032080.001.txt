the natural history of british shells including figures and descriptions of all the species hitherto discovered in great britain systematically arranged in the linnean manner with scientific and

st pauls churchyard by bye and law st johns square clerkenwell   0   advertisement the present work is submitted with the utmost deference to the reader as a general and very copious elucidation of all the larger kinds of shells found in this country  at the commencement of this undertaking the author proposed that the five volumes of which this work consists should include figures and descriptions of all the british shells so far at least as they could be correctly ascertained the amount of these collectively he was induced to think might be very nearly appreciated from the several works of lister merret petiver walker pennant and da costa from the number of nondescript british shells that came into his possession with the original collection of the latter writer together with those in his own cabinet independent of them the whole amount of which was far from inconsiderable  in this estimate which the author at first conceived would be completely adequate to every purpose of his design he afterward perceived himself in some degree mistaken during the course of publication he has in various instances been kindly favored with british shells not before described neither are the acquisitions which he has himself discovered in several remote parts of the country altogether unworthy of attention many of the species thus obtained were deemed too interesting to be omitted in a work of this nature and it was therefore thought advisable to exclude those which from their extreme minuteness are usually denominated microscopic shells in order to admit the most important of them the omission of the more diminutive species for the sake of inserting shells of conspicuous figure that had not been before described as english the author trusts will rather be considered as an advantage than detriment to this work nothing of material consequence either in the collection of the author or the cabinets of his friends to which he has access has been neglected in this selection and he could not feel himself completely justified in extending the work beyond the limits originally prescribed for no other purpose than to introduce the microscopic shells  table of contents

regards both the shell and its inhabitant in the definition of species the former only is attended to there are very strong arguments against the method of arranging this tribe by the animals although

history london        the testacea are vermes of the soft and simple kind and are covered with a calcareous habitation these are separated into three divisions according to the number of valves of which the shell consists the first division includes only three genera chiton lepas and pholas these are called multivalves and are formed of many valves or pieces disposed transversely on each other the second division consists of bivalves or shells of two pieces connected together with a hinge or cartilage the third division is of univalves and have the shell complete in one piece as the word

brown the latter are the most elegant varieties of b lapillus  these shells are found in great abundance near low watermark on many of the shores of great britain it is one of the species that yields the purple dye analogous to the purpura of the ancients and though the value of its dye has been long superseded by the cochineal insect the shells that produced it are objects of curiosity the tyrian purple was the most admired and is known to have been extracted from a species of the murex but other purples of inferior luster are also mentioned by the ancients da costa imagines that the liquor of this whelke buccinum lapillus was a valuable purple to the ancient english and quotes the authority of bid who lived about the seventh century for this opinion there are says bid snails in very great

being harder than most of other kinds are to be broken with a smart stroke with a hammer on a plate of iron or firm piece of timber with their mouths downwards so as not to crush the body of the fish within the broken pieces being picked off there will appear a white vein lying transversely in a little furrow or cleft next to the head of the fish which must be dug out with the stiff point of a horsehair pencil being made short and tapering the letters figures or what else shall be made on the linen and perhaps silk too will presently appear of a pleasant light green color and if placed in the sun will change into the following colors i e if in winter about noon if in summer an hour or two after sunrising and so much before setting for in the heat of the day in summer the colors will come on so fast that the succession of each color will be scarcely distinguished next to the first light green it will appear of a deep green and in a few minutes change into a seagreen after which in a few minutes more it will alter into a watchetblue from that in a little time more it will be of a purplishred after which lying an hour or two supposing the sun still shining it will be of a very deep purplered beyond which the sun can do no more  but then the last and most beautiful color after washing in scalding water and soap will the matter being again put into the sun or wind to dry be of a fair bright crimson or near to the princes color which afterward notwithstanding there is no use of any stiptick to bind the color will continue the same if well ordered as i have found in handkerchiefs that have been washed more than forty times only it will be somewhat allayed from what it was after the first washing while the cloth so writ upon lies in the sun it will yield a very

little island that lies in the pightland frith he found them on some parts of the orkneys where he observed extraordinary cross and strong tides the irregular form of these pectines rather surprised him he adds i cannot think the odd strange tumbling the tides make there can contribute any thing to that frame yet after all i never see them in any other place  these shells are now found on several of the english shores as yorkshire scarborough mouth of the river tees and dorsetshire and are also frequent in the fossil state in the chalk pits of kent and surry both valves are unequal and much distorted but the under one is usually the most irregular the ribs are numerous close set longitudinal and prominent the inside of the lower valve is smooth and white when alive and that of the upper has a pearly gloss the outside is generally of a dingy white or yellowish cast sometimes pale violet or russety or white mottled and varied with brown or brilliant red  the ears of this shell are large and nearly equal but are often so distorted as to appear much otherwise it is proper to observe that though the irregular form this shell assumes may be attributed to some injury is has sustained in its growth every shell of this species is constantly found with the same distorted appearance this circumstance leaves no reason to doubt that such distortions are characteristic of this
