watch over all her ways conduct and guide the goodnese you inspired that she may prove if ever distress like mine invade the land a parent to her people stretch the ray of filial piety to times unborn that men may hear her unexampled virtue and learn to emulate the grecian daughter  finis postscript the tragedy here offered to the public is founded on a passage in valerius maximus vide valor max lib   c   de pictate in parents    we are told by that author that a woman of ingenuous birth was convicted before the praetor of a capital crime and delivered over to the triumvir to be put to death in prison the jailer received her into his custody but touched with compassion did not proceed immediately to execute the sentence his humanity went so far as to admit the daughter of the unhappy criminal into the goal but not without a previous search left any nourishment should be secretly conveyed to starve the prisoner to death was his design several days passed when it became a matter of wonder how the poor woman subsisted so long the jailers curiosity was excited he watched the daughter narrowly and saw her give her breast to the famished mother and with her milk supply the cravings of nature touched by the novelty of so affecting a sight he made his report to the triumvir from whom it reached the praetor and the whole matter being referred to the judicial magistrates the mother received a free pardon what will not filial piety undertake  what place will it not penetrate  what will it not devise when in a dungeon it finds unheard of means to preserve a parents life  is there in the course of human affairs a scene so big with wonder as a mother nourished at the daughters breast  the incident might at the first view be thought repugnant to the order of nature if to love our parents were not the first law stamped by the hand of nature on the human heart thus far valerius maximus he goes on in the same place and tells a greek tale in which the heroine performs the fame act of piety to a father in the decline of life for the purposes of the drama the latter story has been preferred the painters long since seized the subject and by them it has been called roman charity the author has taken the liberty to place it in the reign of dionysius the younger at the point of time when timoleon laid siege to syracuse the general effect it was thought would be better produced if the whole had an air of real history  atque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum the author does not wish to conceal that the subject of his tragedy has been touched in some foreign pieces but he thinks it has been only touched the zelmire of mons belloy begins after the daughter has delivered her father out of prison the play indeed has many beauties and if the sentiments and business of that piece coincided with the design of the grecian daughter the author would not have blushed to tread in his steps but a new fable was absolutely necessary and perhaps in the present humor of the times it is not unlucky that no more than three lines could be adopted from mons belloy every writer who makes up a story with characters and incidents already hackneyed on the english stage and invents nothing cries out with an air of triumph that he has not borrowed from the wits of france in the isle of man it is said there is an epitaph in these words he who lies here interred was never out of this island the poor man was to be pitied a similar inscription upon the tombstone of a modern poet would perhaps do as little honor to the memory of the deceased  the author cannot dismiss his play without declaring that though in love with the subject he has not satisfied even his own ideas of the drama he laments that he had neither time nor ability to make it better to heighten it with additional beauties was reserved for the decorations with which the zeal of mr garrick has embellished the representation for the admirable performance of mr barry and above all for the enchanting powers and the genius of mrs barry  lincolns inn feb         this day is published price  s  d  a new edition being the third of zenobia  a tragedy written by
