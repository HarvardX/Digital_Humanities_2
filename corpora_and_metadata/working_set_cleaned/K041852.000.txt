enter lucinda and bellfield bellfield and so my dear lucinda you think you know your own mind so well that you can answer for it i shall never have the rights of an husband over that pretty person of yours   lucinda no never positively never   bellfield and on my part i positively pronounce that you will one day or other make me the happy man   lucinda pray mr bellfield have you a patent for my inclinations or do you intend to lay violent hands upon a weak defenseless woman and make me your own by force of arms   bellfield o fie no force  like a goodnatured general i invite you to capitulate rather than urge me to the necessity of carrying the town by storm   lucinda but i find the garrison still able to hold out  the citadel laying her hand on her heart is still proof against all the artillery you have played off  i think you have not been able to throw in much fire mr bellfield   bellfield ha ha you little know that i have a secret friend in that very citadel that will betray the place to me   lucinda indeed you flatter yourself  there is not a single sentiment not one desire or inclination here that has ever whispered the smallest good word in your favor   bellfield well well there is a little destiny in these matters  that is all   lucinda destiny and so your system in loveaffairs is like that of certain heroes in military matters  you think i suppose that every heart like every cannonball has its billet   bellfield even so madam nature like a skilful bowler delivers every heart out of hand with a secret bias to its proper object   lucinda there is something agreeably impudent in the fellows vanity aside but you will allow that nature gives little secret antipathies too   bellfield oh certainly  she delights in blending contradictions in order to embellish the fair and give her the graces of variety a sort of mosaic work where folly is inlaid with talents a love of pleasure with virtue a power of pleasing with a delight in giving pain and as the poet says  fixed principles with fancy ever new shakes all together and produces you  lucinda upon my word this is altogether a new way of making love by convincing me that you can with curious discernment spy out all the little foibles of the fair you think to recommend yourself to my notice have a care mr bellfield remember apollos sentence upon the critic who found out all the faults in a celebrated poem he laid before him a sack of wheat and bid him separate the chaff which he gave him for his pains   bellfield that madam was because the man was so unfortunate as to have no relish for the beauties whereas my admiration    lucinda oh sir you manage your admiration as certain prodigals do their money you grudge the smallest part to your neighbors and squander all most profusely on yourself and therefore it is you have been entered in my black list let me see how long  let me see takes out a pocketbook ay this is it reads a list of those i am determined not to marry let me see mr worthless condemned may the nineteenth        bellfield worthless what he that married the great fortune   lucinda and took on so prodigiously at her death  he made love to me while he had weepers on for his deceased wife and so i hated him for an impostor worse than maria does dr wolf in the nonjuror  but where are you you creature lord hazard this was a man of rank with a pale quality face and a genteel enervated figure i perceived by his passion for play that the queen of trumps was in his eyes the greatest beauty in the world so i acquainted his lordship that i had no further occasion for his services and he told his friends that he resigned   bellfield ha ha  i see plainly i must be the man  aside lucinda where the deuce is your name morelove  ranger  dorimant  blackacre  well this mr blackacre was a perfect curiosity instead of saying civil things of my person he talked of nothing but my estate and assured me when the present leases expired he would let the whole at an improved rent   bellfield why such a fellow was fitter to be bailiff or steward of your manor   lucinda there was something handsome about him too  no not handsome neither  i dont know how to describe him a sort of symmetry of features and a faint bloom that made a comely kind of deformity no symptoms of sensibility no expression of a feeling mind and he appeared to me likely to make that sort of husband who has no manner of vice gets up in a morning regularly eats his breakfast looks over his accounts goes to the coffeehouse comes home to dinner reads his letters goes to the coffeehouse again reads the eveningpapers comes home to supper and goes tobed  ha ha   bellfield ha ha why you give portraits in miniature as well as any painter of them all   lucinda ha ha i laugh whenever i think of the man  he brought me all the news of the day   bellfield ay   lucinda oh all but none that i valued no news about the little victories this figure obtained in the world no advices of what was said about my last new cap  the happy arrangement of a patch no intelligence about a particular bloom of my complexion never came with a we hear from ranelagh that lucindas eyes scattered death and torment among all the beaus last fridaynight no no such thing it was all political intelligence and being a favorite i had it warm from the mint at ten in the morning there was an action in germany and the french lost ten thousand men upon the field of battle three princes of the blood and five marshals of france at twelve the news was premature at two an express was arrived at the secretary of states in the evening the victory was not so complete and a noble lord was heard to say that if a certain general had done his duty the balance of europe would have been settled at night the whole report was false and there was no battle at all   bellfield you would have had all the joys of dear variety with such an husband   lucinda oh horrid  i told him at length that i could not consider him in the light of a lover but that really he was a very good newspaper and that whenever he was out of hand or not bespoke i should be glad to be entertained with the topic of the day  ha ha   bellfield and so ordered your servants to take him in instead of the chronicle or public ledger  ha ha  by laughing at all her lovers she is determined to have me aside  upon my soul lucinda you have a very pretty groupe of humourists   lucinda enough to furnish our a comedy  the vain the proud the formal the brisk every species of the ridiculous and absurd has been my most obedient very humble servant  and here  here is another character to help out the piece  mr bellfield   bellfield well let us hear   lucinda condemned august the sixteenth      for looking at himself in the glass for a full half hour while he was directing his discourse to me there you are outlawed for open rebellion against my beauty  hold up your hand  and what have you to say why judgment of death should not pass upon you   bellfield why i have your pardon in my pocket   lucinda oh to be sure i who claim homage from every pretty fellow am likely to forgive the disaffected person who disputes my title and becomes a vain pretender to it himself   bellfield how can you talk thus when you know i have worshipped you even to idolatry and have offered up prayers on my very knees to you   lucinda but i require true devotion in your prayers would it not provoke the patience of a saint to have a wellpowderd fop kneel at his shrine with a there is a handsome fellow for you mind my clothes brussels lace diamondring saucy snuff box and impudent face and this too under the notion of asking a blessing   bellfield my dear lucinda i never knew you so much out would not you have a man go to his prayers with a good conscience and what are the pleasures of a good conscience the applauses of ones own heart  now my dear maam if when i approach you i have some selfapproving airs am not i therefore the better entitled to you   lucinda heavens i am frightened at you  you are a freethinker in love  preach this doctrine to the ladies and they will call it downright heresy   bellfield very like but surely were i to make my advances with darts and flames and cupid and venus and the graces i should be a mere uninstructed pagan wheeas at present i only want to discard superstition and idle ceremonials and so establish the true system of love   lucinda which you take to consist in    bellfield in the language of the heart  as instance  i love you shall study your happiness and so let me call the parson   lucinda easy and impudent  but loves religion is a sort of popery and requires penance and fasting and watching and that you should pray for favors in a language almost unintelligible  but you say your prayers in the vulgar tongue and so let me call the parson why you might as well come most cavalierly to my house take possession of an arm chair and here bring me my nightgown and slippers   bellfield and as all the sighs and verses and fine things of lovers must end in that you had better wave ceremony for as to careless though you may think you have hold of his heart    lucinda careless  i desire you will never mention him  careless  a senseless wretch  a vile inconstant  who abandons me as if age had suddenly rendered me loathlome   bellfield why faith though i detest the treachery i cannot upon this occasion quarrel with the traitor   lucinda oh sir i dare say you applaud his conduct and would like him declare that i might pass very well for a mistress to toy an hour with and must shortly come to that  but for a wife  oh shocking   bellfield has he dared talk thus lucinda   lucinda even to the lowest wretch on earth to that fellow la jeunesse who dressed my hair about half an hour ago  oh if my brother were in england he should find i do not want a friend to assert my honor   bellfield by heaven i will do it this very day myself  now you shall have proof of the sincerity with which i love  pronounce me unworthy of you if your wrongs are not redressed within this hour  exit lucinda yet why should vexation thus get the better of me  mr bellfield gone heavens he talked something of calling this base man to an account  i hope he will not be mad enough to think of such a thing  so so mr careless coming this way  i will not even condescend to upbraid him with his baseness  i will swear i could almost find in my heart to throw myself into bellfields arms to pique the wretch  exit enter careless and wisely careless ha ha is not he a ridiculous character   wisely yes something singular in his way   careless poor sir philip  a passion for dancing when the use of his limbs has almost left him  i am glad we have got rid of him  ha ha  sdeath here he comes

a bright project conceived this instant   brazen i wait but your commands sir   wisely i know you faithful and dextrous  you have not been long enough at windsor to be known by any body  hey is not that hortensia yonder walking this way arm in arm with lucinda  i will found a retreat like a prudent general and send you to skirmish with the enemy brazen  this way  follow me   brazen and i will bring on a general action i warrant me  exeunt enter lucinda and hortensia lucinda my dear hortensia that is carrying it too far  you grow captious  there is no harm in a little raillery sure   hortensia but will not you allow me to be deeper in my own secrets than any body else   lucinda no by no means we are all very ingenious in deceiving ourselves our passions wear so many cunning disguises we hardly know them  spleen shall pass for wit avarice  onomy and the love of a man shall often be thought a mere female vanity in hearing the praises of a shape or a feature   hortensia so that if i suffer a civil thing from a pretty fellow the pleasure i find from the compliment makes a quick transition to a liking of the man   lucinda instantly and almost imperceptibly to ourselves and when we think we are putting him off with our arts of cold delay it is at the bottom but mere coquetry to draw him on the more like playing with edge tools till we cut ourselves   hortensia still i am not wounded   lucinda iii lay you a pot of coffee you are married before me   hortensia you will lose  there is nothing in my conduct that can    lucinda i beg your pardon  there is in you serious people a sedate love of pleasure that we giddy creatures never come up to we receive slight impressions and slight impressions chatter away and evaporate in the whirl of our fancy now you demure ones dwell upon what gains access to your hearts and then your thoughts are like what they tell me of white powder  they make no noise but are full of mischief   hortensia this is very strange  but let me assure you i have not forgot my poor deceased husband   lucinda ay but that tender melancholy will so dispose your mind to receive the kindred passion of love that i should not wonder if  in short grief is very amorous my dear   hortensia mighty fine  but the man who makes me sacrifice my liberty must have an extraordinary merit   lucinda there again now  another of the masquerade habits our passions wear  when you are in love with a mans person you fancy it is a refined esteem for his merit  oh hortensia under that illusion the heart of a woman will soften and melt prodigiously  do you think it possible to have a lasting esteem for a man merely on the score of his merit   hortensia surely is not it natural to love virtue   lucinda why to speak a plain truth which i would not have a man hear from me for the world whims passions and desires are the groundworks of our minds and virtue i am afraid is but inlaid   hortensia o fie lucinda   lucinda o fie hypocrite   hortensia pray now let me ask you have you no esteem for mr careless   lucinda a propos i forgot to tell you  well i adore my ease on this occasion  sure every thing is at an end between me and that gentleman   hortensia you amaze me  was not the wedding day fixed   lucinda yes i was under sentence of matrimony  but he has sent me a reprieve   hortensia can it be possible   lucinda he is going to be married to another   hortensia you astonish me  she does not suspect me aside  going to be married to another  no woman of delicacy would hearken to him considering how far matters have been carried with you   lucinda why if there is any lady really smitten the dispute between her love and her delicacy will not last long  delicacy may talk of nice points of honor but that will only reach the head while every syllable from that little urchin love will make its way directly to the heart and while delicacy is reading lectures love will persuade and so the business is over  but pray my dear had not you heard this before   hortensia i my dear  i hope he has not divulged any thing aside  how can you ask such a question  i am not in a course of towntalk   lucinda why i dont know  one is always saying one silly thing or another  let us change the subject the man is not worth a moments thought his indiscretion is the smallest of his faults  my rest shall not suffer a single wink for him   hortensia that is right lucinda give me your hand and take my advice  if the false man deserts you show yourself a girl of spirit on the occasion  the wretch is not worth a single smile from any of our sex  an idle vain boaster  to trust him is taking up water with a sieve  so resolve at once to look down with scorn both on him and the vain beauty that prides herself in the conquest  wish her joy of her bargain my dear and think no more about him   enter brazen in a livery brazen madam hortensia my master presents his compliments    hortensia carelesss livery aside  who is your master

snuff box says he and as i have damaged it a little if she will get it mended i will pay for it   lucinda ho ho ho  i shall die i shall die   hortensia vexation  this absurd man   brazen any commands for my master madam   hortensia let me hear no more of your insolence sir   brazen what shall i say to poor mr careless  no parting pang no kind adieu   hortensia tell him he is a villain a perfidious wretch a monster of ingratitude   brazen ay i know him well  he is all that and worse  well done brazen this will do rarely  exit lucinda my dear madam you will excuse me  but if my life depended upon it i cannot help laughing   hortensia you need not triumph on the occasion you are welcome to the gentleman   lucinda no doubt  the man that insinuates himself into your good graces must have an extraordinary merit   hortensia mighty well  if you must run on    lucinda besides you have not as yet forgot your poor deceased husband   hortensia this raillery is unseasonable madam   lucinda well now do you know that i was weak enough to suppose that no woman of delicacy stifles a laugh considering how far things had been carried with me   laughs out hortensia oh shame shame all my ill stars combined    lucinda come come give me your hand hortensia if the false man deserts you show your self a woman of spirit on the occasion   hortensia oh insupportable  breaks away lucinda following her

you looking after her poor disconsolate dido  oh i shall expire with laughing  well i feel my heart much lighter  certainly revenge is the ruling passion of the female breast it is the second passion at least  but stay stay stay  what is to be done  shall i to complete my triumph marry careless  why revenge says so  but love slily whispers have not you a secret tender for mr bellfield  i dont know

ye not pleased with the touch of his  guilty  they plead guilty what say my hands when he has drawn a glove on you looking at one hand or gently clasped you looking at the other to lead me to my chair  ah those tremblings were the anxieties of love  ears  oh they were pleased with the accents of his flattery  i must call no more witnesses for fear every circumstance should plead against me  but

that ever studied the exercise of the fan   lucinda scandalous wretch   careless a lover with you has as bad a time as a poor animal in a philosophers airpump  when your false refinements are too thin for him to subsist upon they are rendered somewhat more substantial by letting in a little air of commonsense that you may have the pleasure of ratifying all away again and so leave a poor deluded fellow panting for his existence   lucinda why i like to try experiments upon em  but mr careless you tried the most admirable experiment today that ever yet was thought of  ha ha  i must laugh with

romps in a countrydance as i ever desire to cast off and figure in with  i think one of you should take the gentleman out   lucinda for my part i am engaged  shall i make interest for you maam   hortensia the character the gentleman bears and the light you have made him appear in are sufficient to warn a woman of prudence against so dangerous a risk   careless blessngs on her discretion and

hortensia you own it false man do you  aside lucinda and are you insensible to the ladys superior beauty and that distinguished prudence with which she moves so orderly in every sphere of life   careless prudence  why faith prudence may be a very useful qualification in trade and may answer the purposes of a mercer upon ludgate hill or a moneyscrivener in the city  but i wish may die if i

you have abused the ladys distinguishing perfection to her face   careless to deceive the company  a stroke of judgment and discretion   blunt but she seemed to speak with acrimony   careless oh i adored her for that  she is a charming woman and a word of abuse out of her mouth is worth all the praises of the rest of her sex  ha ha  it was the luckiest interview  and gave me the finest opportunity of shining  ha ha  she carried it off finely too  when women praise their passions gently move but if they rail then with a rage they love  end of the second act act iii enter bellfield
