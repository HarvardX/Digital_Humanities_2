personae sweet are yon hills that crown this fertile vale ye genial springs pierian waters hail hail woods and lawns yes  often i will tread yon pineclad mountains side often trace the gay enameled mead where avon rolls his pride sure next to fair castalias streams and pindus flowery path apollo most the springs esteems and verdant meads of bath the muses haunt these hallowed groves and here their vigils keep here teach fond swains their hapless loves in gentle strains to weep from water sprung like flowers from dew what troops of bards appear the god of verse and physic too inspires them twice a year take then my friend the sprightly rhyme while you inglorious waste your prime at home in cruel durance pent on dull domestic cares intent forbid by parents harsh decree to share the joys of bath with me illjudging parent blind to merit thus to confine a nymph of spirit with all thy talents doomed to fade and wither in the unconscious shade i vow my dear it moves my spleen such frequent instances i have seen of fathers cruel and unkind to all paternal duty blind what wretches do we meet with often whose hearts no tenderness can soften sure all good authors should expose such parents both in verse and prose and nymphs inspire with resolution never to submit to persecution this wholesome satyr much enhances the merit of our best romances and modern plays that i could mention with judgment fraught and rare invention are wrote with much the same intention but thank my stars that worthy pair who undertook a guardians care my spirit never have confined an instance of their generous mind for lady b  n  r  d my aunt herself proposed this charming jaunt all from redundancy of care for sim her favorite son and heir to him the joyous hours i owe that baths enchanting scenes bestow thanks to her book of choice receipts that pampered him with savry meats nor less that day deserves a blessing she crammed his sister to excess in for now she sends both son and daughter for crudities to drink the water and here they are all bile and spleen the strangest fish that ever were seen with tabby runt their maid poor creature the queerest animal in nature i am certain none of hogarths sketches ever formed a set of stranger wretches i own my dear it hurts my pride to see them blundring by my side my spirits flag my life and fire is mortified au desespoir when sim unfashionable ninny in public calls me cousin jenny and yet to give the wight his due he has some share of humor too a comic vein of pedant learning his conversation you will discern in the oddest compound you can see of shrewdness and simplicity with natural strokes of awkward wit that often like parthian arrows hit for when he seems to dread the foe he always strikes the hardest blow and when you would think he means to flatter his panegyrics turn to satire but then no creature you can find knows half so little of mankind seems always blundring in the dark and always making some remark remarks that so provoke ones laughter one cannot imagine what he is after and sure you will thank me for exciting in sim a wondrous itch for writing with all his serious grimace to give descriptions of the place no doubt his mother will produce his poetry for general use and if his bluntness does not fright you his observations must delight you for truly the good creatures mind is honest generous and kind if unprovoked will never displease ye or ever make one soul uneasy  i will try to make his sister prue take a small trip to pindus too and me the nine shall all inspire to tune for thee the warbling lyre for thee the muse shall every day speed by the post her rapid way for thee my friend i will often explore deep treasures of romantic lore nor wonder if i gods create as all good bards have done of late twill make my verse run smooth and even to call new deities from heaven come then thou goddess i adore but soft  my chairmans at the door the balls begun  my friend no more j  w  d

a wonderful distance from home two hundred and sixty long miles are we come and sure you will rejoice my dear mother to hear we are safely arrived at the sign of the bear it is a plaguey long way  but i never can repine as my stomach is weak and my spirits decline for the people say here  be whatever your case you are sure to get well if you come to this place  miss jenny made fun as she always is wont of prudence my sister and tabitha runt and every moment she heard me complain declared i was vapourd and laughed at my pain what though at devizes i fed pretty hearty and made a good meal like the rest of the party when i came here to bath not a bit could i eat though the man at the bear had provided a treat and so i went quite out of spirits to bed with wind in my stomach and noise in my head as we all came for health as a body may say i sent for the doctor the very next day and the doctor was pleased though so short was the warning to come to our lodgings betimes in the morning he looked very thoughtful and grave to be sure and i said to myself  there is no hopes of a cure but i thought i should faint when i saw him dear mother feel my pulse with one hand with a watch in the other no token of death that is heard in the night could ever have put me so much in a fright thinks i  it is all over  my sentence is past and now he is counting how long i may last  then he looked at  and his face grew so long i am sure he thought something within me was wrong  he determined our cases at length gd preserve us i am bilious i find and the women are nervous their systems relaxed and all turned topsyturvy with hypochondriacs obstructions and scurvy and these are distempers he must know the whole on for he talked of the peritoneum and colon of phleghmatic humors oppressing the women from soeculent matter that swells the abdomen but the noise i have heard in my bowels like thunder is a flatus i find in my left hypochonder so plenty of medicines each day does he send post singulas liquidas seeds sumend ad crepitus vesper and man promovend in english to say we must swallow a potion for driving out wind after every motion the same to continue for three weeks at least before we may venture the waters to taste five times have i purged  yet i am sorry to tell ye i find the same gnawing and wind in my belly but without any doubt i shall find myself stronger when i have took the same physic a week or two longer he gives little tabby a great many doses for he says the poor creature has got the chlorosis or a ravenous pica so brought on the vapors by swallowing stuff she has read in the papers and often i have marveld she spent so much money in waterdock essence and balsam of honey such tinctures elixirs such pills have i seen i never could wonder her face was so green yet he thinks he can very soon set her to right with testic equin that she takes every night and when to her spirits and strength he has brought her he thinks she may venture to bathe in the water  but prudence is forced every day to ride out for he says she wants thoroughly jumbling about now it happens in this very house is a lodger whose names nicodemus but some call him roger and rogers so good as my sister to bump on a pillion as soon as she comes from the pump he is a pious good man and an excellent scholar and i think it is certain no harm can befall her for roger is constantly saying his prayers and singing of spiritual hymns on the stairs but my cousin miss jennys as fresh as a rose and the captain attends her wherever she goes the captains a worthy good sort of a man for he calls in upon us whenever he can and often a dinner or supper he takes here and jenny and he talk of milton and shakespeare for the life of me now i cannot think of his name but we all got acquainted as soon as we came dont wonder dear mother in verse i have writ for jenny declares i have a good pretty wit she says that she frequently sends a few verses to friends and acquaintance and often rehearses declares it is the fashion and all the world knows there is nothing so filthy so vulgar as prose and i hope as i write without any connection i shall make a great figure in dodsleys collection at least when he chooses his book to increase i may take a small flight as a fugitive piece  but now my dear mother i am quite at a stand so i rest your most dutiful son to command

letter iv a consultation of physicians dear mother my time has been wretchedly spent with a gripe or a hickup wherever i went my stomach all swelled till i thought it would burst sure never poor mortal with wind was so cursed if ever i ate a good supper at night i dreamed of the devil and waked in a fright and so as i grew every day worse and worse the doctor advised me to send for a nurse and the nurse was so willing my health to restore she begged me to send for a few doctors more for when any difficult works to be done many heads can dispatch it much sooner than one and i find there are doctors enough at this place if you want to consult in a dangerous case so they all met together and thus began talking good doctor i am yours  it is a fine day for walking  sad news in the papers  gd knows who is to blame  the colonies seem to be all in a flame  this stamp act no doubt might be good for the crown  but i sear it is a pill that will never go down  what can portugal mean  is she going to stir up convulsions and heats in the bowels of europe twill be fatal if england relapses again from the ill blood and humors of bourbon and spain  says i my good doctors i cannot understand why the deuce ye take so many patients in hand yeve a great deal of practice as far as i find but since you are come hither do pray be so kind to write me down something that is good for the wind no doubt ye are all of ye great politicians but at present my bowels have need of physicians consider my case in the light it deserves and pity the state of my stomach and nerves  but a tight little doctor began a dispute about administrations new  le and b  e talked much of economy much of prosuseness  says another  this case which at first was a looseness is become a tenesmus and all we can do is to give him a gentle cathartic or two first get off the phlegm that adheres to the plicae then throw in a medicine that is pretty and spicy  a peppermint draught  or a  come let us be gone we have another bad case to consider at one so thus they brushed off each his cane at his nose when jenny came in who had heard all their prose i will teach them says she at their next consultation to come and take fees for the good of the nation i could not conceive what the devil she meant but she seized all the stuff that the doctor had sent and out of the window she flung it down souse as the first politician went out of the house decoctions and syrups around him all flew the pill bolus julep and apozem too his wig had the luck a cathartic to meet and squash went the gallipot under his feet she said twas a shame i should swallow such stuff when my bowels were weak and the physic so rough declared she was shocked that so many should come to be doctord to death such a distance from home at a place where they tell you that water alone can cure all distempers that ever were known but what is the pleasantest part of the story she has ordered for dinner a piper and dory for today captain cormorants coming to dine that worthy acquaintance of jennys and mine it is a shame to the army that men of such spirit should never obtain the reward of their merit for the captains as gallant a man i will be sworn and as honest a fellow as ever was born after so many hardships and dangers incurred he himself thinks he ought to be better preferred and roger or what is his name nicodemus appears full as kind and as much to esteem us our prudence declares he is an excellent preacher and by night and by day is so good as to teach her his doctrine so sound with such spirit he gives she never can forget it as long as she lives i told you before that he is often so kind as to go out a riding with prudence behind so frequently dines here without any pressing and now to the fish he is giving his blessing and as that is the case though i have taken a griper i will venture to peck at the dory and piper and now my dear mother etc etc etc s  b  n  r  d bath      mr s  b  n  r  d to lady b  n  r  d at  hall north letter v salutations of bath and an adventure of mr b  n  r  ds in consequence thereof no city dear mother this city excels for charming sweet sounds both of fiddles and bells i thought like a fool that they only would ring for a wedding or judge or the birth of a king but i found twas for me that the goodnatured people rung so hard that i thought they would pull down the steeple so i took out my purse as i hate to be shabby and paid all the men when they came from the abbey yet some think it strange they should make such a riot in a place where sick folk would be glad to be quiet but i hear it is the business of this corporation to welcome in all the great men of the nation for you know there is nothing diverts or employs the minds of great people like making a noise so with bells they contrive all as much as they can to tell the arrival of any such man if a broker or statesman a gamester or peer a natralizd jew or a bishop comes here or an eminent trader in cheese should retire just to think of the business the state may require with horns and with trumpets with fiddles and drums they will strive to divert him as soon as he comes it is amazing they find such a number of ways of employing his thoughts all the time that he stays if by chance the great man at his lodging alone is he may view from his window the colliers ponies on both the parades where they tumble and kick to the great entertainment of those that are sick what a number of turnspits and builders he will find for relaxing his cares and unbending his mind while notes of sweet music contend with the cries of fine potted laver fresh oysters and pies and musics a thing i shall truly revere since the citymusicians so tickled my ear for when we arrived here at bath the other day they came to our lodgings on purpose to play and i thought it was right as the music was come to foot it a little in tabithas room for practice makes perfect as often i have read and to heels is of service as well as the head but the lodgers were shocked such a noise we should make and the ladies declared that we kept them awake lord ringbone who lay in the parlour below on account of the gout he had got in his toe began on a sudden to curse and to swear i protest my dear mother twas shocking to hear the oaths of that reprobate gouty old peer all the devils in hell sure at once have concurred to make such a noise here as never was heard some blundering blockhead while i am in bed treads as hard as a coachhorse just over my head i cannot conceive what a plague he is about are the fiddlers come hither to make all this rout with their dmnd squeaking catgut that is worse than the gout if the aldermen bad em come hither i swear i wish they were broiling in hell with the mayr may flames be my portion if ever i give those rascals one farthing as long as i live  so while they were playing their musical airs and i was just dancing the hay round the chairs he roared to his frenchman to kick them down stairs the frenchman came forth with his outlandish lingo just the same as a monkey and made all the men go i could not make out what he said not a word and his lordship declared i was very absurd says i master ringbone i have nothing to fear though you be a lord and your man a mounseer for the mayr and the aldermen bad them come here   as absurd as i am i dont care a damn for you nor your valee de sham for a lord do you see is nothing to me any more than a flea and your frenchman so eager with all his soup meagre is no more than a mouse or a bug or a louse and i will do as i please while i stay in the house for the b  n  r  d family all can afford to part with their money as free as a lord   so i thanked the musicians and gave them a guinea though the ladies and gentlemen called me a ninny and i will give them another the next time they play for men of good fortune encourage they say all arts and all sciences too in their way and the men were so kind as to hallow and bawl gd bless you sir thank you good fortune befall yourself and the b  n  r  d family all  excuse any more  for i very well know both my subject and verse  is exceedingly low but if any great critic finds fault with my letter he has nothing to do but to send you a better and now my dear mother etc etc etc s  b  n  r  d bath      mr s  b  n  r  d to lady b  n  r  d at  hall north letter vi in which mr b  n  r  d gives a description of the bathing this morning dear mother as soon as twas light i was waked by a noise that astonished me quite for in tabithas chamber i heard such a clatter i could not conceive what the deuce was the matter and would you believe it i went up and found her in a blanket with two lusty fellows around her who both seemed a going to carry her off in a little black box just the size of a coffin pray tell me says i what you are doing of there why master it is hard to be bilkd of our fare and so we were thrusting her into a chair we dont see no reason for using us so for she bad us come hither and now she will not go we are earned all the fare for we both came and knocked her up as soon as twas light by advice of the doctor and this is a job that we often go ater for ladies that choose to go into the water but pray says i tabitha what is your drift to be covered in flannel instead of a shift tis all by the doctors advice i suppose that nothing is left to be seen but your nose i think if you really intend to go in twould do you more good if you stripped to the skin and if you have a mind for a frolic ifath ill just step and see you jump into the bath so they hoisted her down just as safe and as well and as snug as a hodmandod rides in his shell i fain would have gone to see tabitha dip but they turned at a corner and gave me the slip yet in searching about i had better success for i got to a place where the ladies undress thinks i to myself they are after some fun and i will see what they are doing as sure as a gun so i peeped at the door and i saw a great mat that covered a table and got under that and laid myself down there as snug and as still as a body may say like a thief in a mill and of all the fine sights i have seen my dear mother i never expect to behold such another how the ladies did giggle and set up their clacks all the while an old woman was rubbing their backs oh twas pretty to see them all put on their flannels and then take the water like so many spaniels and though all the while it grew hotter and hotter they swam just as if they were hunting an otter twas a glorious sight to behold the fair sex all wading with gentlemen up to their necks and view them so prettily tumble and sprawl in a great smoking kettle as big as our hall and today many persons of rank and condition were boiled by command of an able physician dean spavin dean mangey and doctor drsquirt were all sent from cambridge to rub off their dirt judge scrub and the worthy old counselor pest joined issue at once and went in with the rest and this they all said was exceedingly good for strengthening the spirits and mending the blood it pleased me to see how they all were inclined to lengthen their lives for the good of mankind for i never would believe that a bishop or judge can fancy old satan may owe him a grudge though some think the lawyer may choose to demur and the priest till another occasion defer and both to be better prepared for hereater take a smack of the brimstone contained in the water but what is surprising no mortal ever viewed any one of the physical gentlemen stewed vide old bath guide since the day that king bladud first found out the bogs and thought them so good for himself and his hogs not one of the faculty ever has tried these excellent waters to cure his own hide though many a skilful and learned physician with candor good sense and profound erudition obliges the world with the fruits of his brain their nature and hidden effects to explain thus chiron advised madam thetis to take and dip her poor child in the stygian lake but the worthy old doctor was not such an elf as ever to venture his carcass himself so jasons good wife used to set on a pot and put in at once all the patients she got but thought it sufficient to give her direction without being coddled to mend her complexion and i never have heard that she wrote any treatise to tell what the virtue of water and heat is you cannot conceive what a number of ladies were washed in the water the same as our maid is old baron vanteazer a man of great wealth brought his lady the baroness here for her health the baroness bathes and she says that her case has been hit to a hair and is mending apace and this is a point all the learned agree on the baron has met with the fate of acteon who while he peeped into the bath had the luck to find himself suddenly changed to a buck miss scratchit went in and the countess of scales both ladies of very great fashion in wales then all on a sudden two persons of worth my lady pandora macscurvey came forth with general sulphur arrived from the north so tabby you see had the honor of washing with folk of distinction and very high fashion but in spite of good company poor little soul she shook both her ears like a mouse in a bowl ods bobs how delighted i was unawares with the fiddles i heard in the room above stairs for music is wholesome the doctors all think for ladies that bathe and for ladies that drink and that is the opinion of robin our driver who whistles his nags while they stand at the river they say it is right that for every glass a tune you should take that the water may pass so while little tabby was washing her rump the ladies kept drinking it out of a pump i have a deal more to say but am loath to intrude on your time my dear mother so now i will conclude s  b  n  r  d bath      mr s  b  n  r  d to lady b  n  r  d at  hall north letter vii a panegyric on bath and a moravian hymn of all the gay places the world can afford by gentle and simple for pastime adored fine balls and fine concerts fine buildings and springs fine walks and fine views and a thousand fine things not to mention the sweet situation and air what place my dear mother with bath can compare let bristol for commerce and dirt be renowned at salsbury penknives and scissars be ground the towns of devizes of bradford and from may boast that they better can manage the loom i believe that they may  but the world to refine in manners in dress in politeness to shine o bath  let the art let the glory be thine i am sure i have traveled our county all over and never was so civilly treated before would you think my dear mother without the least hint that we all should be glad of appearing in print the newswriters here were so kind as to give all the world an account of our happy arrival  you scarce can imagine what numbers i have met though to me they are perfectly strangers as yet who all with address and civility came and seemed vastly proud of subscribing our name young timothy canvass is charmed with the place who i hear is come hither his fibers to brace poor man at thelection he threw the other day all his victuals and liquor and money away and some people think with such haste he began that soon he the constable greatly outran and is qualified now for a parliament man goes every day to the coffeehouse where the wits and the great politicians repair harangues on the funds and the state of the nation and plans a good speech for an administration in hopes of a place which he thinks he deserves as the love of his country has ruined his nerves  our neighbor sir easterlin widgeon has swore he never will return to his bogs any more the thicksculls are settled we have had invitations with a great many more on the score of relations the loungers are come too  old stucco has just sent his plan for a house to be built in the crescent twill soon be complete and they say all their work is as strong as st pauls or the minster at york dont you think twould be better to lease our estate and buy a good house here before it is too late you never can go my dear mother where you so much have to see and so little to do i write this in haste for the captain is come and so kind as to go with us all to the room but be sure by the very next post you shall hear of all i have the pleasure of meeting with there for i scribble my verse with a great deal of ease and can send you a letter whenever i please and while at this place i have the honor to stay i think i can never want something to say but now my dear mother etc etc s  b  n  r  d bath      postscript i am sorry to find at the city of bath many folk are uneasy concerning their faith nicodemus the preacher strives all he can do to quiet the conscience of good sister prue but tabby from scruples of mind is released since she met with a learned moravian priest who says there is neither transgression nor sin a doctrine that brings many customers in she thinks this the prettiest ode upon earth which he made on his infant that died in the birth ode the learned moravian has pirated this ode from count zinzendorfs book of hymns vid h     chicken blessed and caressed little be on jesus breast from the hurry and the flurry of the earth you are now at rest   mr s  b  n  r  d to lady b  n  r  i at  hall north letter viii mr b  n  r  d goes to the rooms  his opinion of gaming from the earliest ages dear mother till now all statesmen and great politicians allow that nothing advances the good of a nation like giving all money a free circulation this question from members of parliament draws many speeches that meet universal applause and if ever dear mother i live to be one i will speak on this subject as sure as a gun for bath will i speak and i will make an oration shall obtain me the freedom of this corporation i have no kind of doubt but the speaker will beg all the members to hear when i set out my leg circulation of cash  circulation decayed  is at once the destruction and ruin of trade  circulation  i say  circulation it is gives life to commercial countries like this what thanks to the city of bath then are due from all who this patriot maxim pursue for in no place whatever that national good is practiced so well and so well understood what infinite merit and praise does she claim in her ways and her means for promoting of gaming and gaming no doubt is of infinite use that same circulation of cash to produce what true publicspirited people are here who for that very purpose come every year all eminent men who no trade ever knew but gaming the only good trade to pursue all other professions are subject to fail but gamings a business will ever prevail besides it is the only good way to commence an acquaintance with all men of spirit and sense we may grub on without it through life i suppose but then it is with people  that nobody knows we never can expect to be rich wise or great or looked upon fit for employments of state it is your men of fine heads and of nice calculations that afford so much service to administrations who by frequent experience know how to devize the speediest methods of raising supplies it is such men as these men of honor and worth that challenge respect from all persons of birth and is it not right they should all be carest when they are all so polite and so very well dressed when they circulate freely the money they have won and wear a laced coat though their fathers wore none our trade is encouraged as much if not more by the tender soft sex i shall ever adore but their husbands those brutes have been known to complain and swear they will never set foot here again  ye wretches ingrate to find fault with your wives the comfort the solace and joy of your lives dont solomon speak of such women with rapture in verse his eleventh and thirtyfirst chapter he says if you find out a virtuous wife she will do a man good all the days of her life she deals like a merchant she sits up late and you will find it is written in verse twentyeight her husband is sure to be known at the gate he never has need or occasion for spoil when his wife is much better employed all the while she seeks fine wool and fine linen she buys and is clothed in purple and scarlet likewise   now pray dont your wives do the very same thing and follow the advice of this worthy old king do they spare for expenses themselves in adorning dont they go about buying fine things all the morning and at cards all the night take the trouble to play to get back the money they spent in the day and sure there is no sort of occasion to show ye are known at the gate or wherever ye go pray are not your ladies at bath better placed than the wife of a king who herself so disgraced and at ithaca lived in such very bad taste poor soul while her husband thought proper to leave her she slavd all the day like a spitalfields weaver and then like a fool when her web was half spun pulled topieces at night all the work she had done but these to their husbands more profit can yield and are much like a lilly that grows in the field they toil not indeed nor indeed do they spin yet they never are idle when once they begin but are very intent on increasing their store and always keep shuffling and cutting for more industrious creatures that make it a rule to secure half the fish while they manage the pool so they win to be sure yet i very much wonder why they put so much money the candlestick under for up comes a man on a sudden slapdash snuffs the candles and carries away all the

numbers one sees who for that very reason come to make such a figure at bath every season it is this that provokes mrs shenkin apleek to dine at the ordinary twice in a week though at home she might eat a good dinner in comfort nor pay such a cursed extravagant sum for it but then her acquaintance would never have known mrs shenkin apleek had acquired a bon ton never shown how in taste the apleeks can excel the duchess of truffles and lady morell had never been adored by sir pie macaroni and count vermicelli his intimate crony both men of such taste their opinions are taken from an ortolan down to a rusher of bacon what makes kitty spice and little miss sago to auctions and milliners shops every day go what makes them to vie with each other and quarrel which spends the most money for splendid apparel why spirit  to show they have much better sense than their fathers who raised it by shillings and pence what sends peter tewksbury every night to the play with such infinite joy and delight why peters a critic with true attic salt can damn the performers can hiss and find fault and tell when we ought to express approbation by thumping and clapping and vociferation so he gains our attention and all must admire young tewksburys judgment his spirit and fire but jack dilettante despises the playrs to concerts and musical parties repairs with benefittickets his pockets he fills like a mountebank doctor distributes his bills and thus his importance and interest shows by conserring his favors wherever he goes he is extremely polite both to me and my cousen for he often desires us to take off a dozen he has taste without doubt and a delicate ear no vile oratorios ever could bear but talks of the opras and his signiora cries bravo benissimo bravo encora and often is so kind as to thrust in a note while old lady cuckoo is straining her throat or little miss wren who is an excellent singer then he points to the notes with a ring on his finger and shows her the crotchet the quaver and bar all the time that she warbles and plays the guitar yet i think though she is at it from morning till noon her queer little thingumbobs never in tune thank heaven of late my dear mother my face is not a little regarded at all public places for i ride in a chair with my hands in a muff and have bought a silk coat and embroidered the cuff but the weather was cold and the coat it was thin so the tailor advised me to line it with skin but what with my nivernois hat can compare bagwig and laced ruffles and black solitair and what can a man of true fashion denote like an ell of good ribbon tied under the throat my buckles and box are in exquisite taste the one is of paper the other of paste and sure no camayeu was ever yet seen like that which i purchased at wicksteds machine my stockings of silk are just come from the hosier for tonight i am to dance with the charming miss tozier so i would have them to know when i go to the ball i shall show as much taste as the best of them all for a man of great fashion was heard to declare he never beheld so engaging an air and swears all the world must my judgment confess my solidity sense understanding in dress my manners so formed and my wig so well curled i look like a man of the very first world but my person and figure you will best understand from the picture i have sent by an eminent hand show it young

the bright circle encompassed around each moment with transport my bosom felt warm for what my dear mother like beauty can charm the remembrance alone while their praise i rehearse gives life to my

of jove when joined with the graces fair venus appears ambrosial sweet odours perfume all the spheres but the goddess of love and the graces and all must yield to the beauties i have seen at the ball for jove never felt such a joy at his heart such a heat as these charming sweet creatures impart in short  there is something in very fine women when they meet all together  that is quite overcoming then say o ye nymphs that inhabit the shades of pindus sweet banks heliconian maids celestial muses ye powers divine o say for your memorys better than mine what troops of fair virgins assembled around what squadrons of heroes for dancing renowned were roused by the fiddles harmonious sound what goddess shall first be the theme of my song whose name the clear avon may murmur along and echo

shone excepting the lovely miss towzer alone it is she that has long been the toast of the town though all the world knows her complexion is brown if some people think that her mouth be too wide miss towzer has numberless beauties beside a countenance noble with sweet pouting lips and a delicate shape from her waist to her hips besides a prodigious rough black head of hair that is frizzled and curled over her neck that is bare i have seen the sweet creature but once i confess but her air and her manner and pleasing address all made me feel something i never can express but lo on a sudden what multitudes pour from cambrian mountains from indian shore bright maidens bright widows and fortunate swains who cultivate liffys sweet borders and plains and they who their flocks in fair albion seed rich flocks and rich herds so the gods have decreed since they quitted the pleasanter banks of the tweed yet here no confusion no tumult is known fair order and beauty establish their throne for

minuet known since the day that for dancing his talents were shown where the science is practiced by gentlemen grown for in every science in every profession we make the best progress at years of discretion how he puts on his hat with a smile on his face and delivers his hand with an exquisite grace how genteelly he offers miss carrot before us miss carrot eitzoozer a niece of lord porus how nimbly he paces how active and light one never can judge of a man at first sight but as near as i guess from the size of his calf he may weigh about twentythree stone and a half now why should i mention a hundred or more who went the same circle as others before to a tune that they played us a hundred times over see little bob jerome old chrysostoms son with a chitterlin shirt and a buckle of stone what a cropped head of hair the young parson has on emergd from his grizzle thunfortunate sprig seems as if he was hunting all night for his wig not perfectly pleased with the coat on his back though the coats a good coat but alas it is black with envious eyes he is doomed to behold the captains red suit that is embroidered with gold how seldom mankind is content with their lot bob jerome two very good livings has got yet still he accuses his parents deceased for making a man of such spirit a priest not so master marmozet sweet little boy mrs danglecubs hopes her delight and her joy his pidgeonwingd head was not dressed quite so soon for it took up a barber the whole afternoon his jackets well laced and the ladies protest master marmozet dances as well as the best yet some think the boy would be better at school but i hear mrs danglecubs not such a fool to send a poor thing with a spirit so meek to be flogd by a tyrant for latin and greek she wonders that parents to eton should send five hundred great boobies their manners to mend she says that her son will his fortune advance by learning so early to fiddle and dance so she brings him to bath which i think is quite right for they do nothing else here from morning till night and this is a lesson all parents should know to train up a child in the way he should go for as solomon says you may safely uphold he never will depart from the same when he is old no doubt she is a woman of fine understanding her air and her presence there is something so grand in so wise and discreet and to give her her due dear mother she is just such a woman as you but who is that bombazine lady so gay so profuse of her beauties in sable array how she rests on her heel how she turns out her toe how she pulls down her stays with her head up to show her lillywhite bosom that rivals the snow it is the widow quicklackit whose husband last week poor stephen went suddenly forth in a pique and pushed off his boat for the stygian creek poor stephen he never returned from the bourn but left the disconsolate widow to mourn three times did she faint when she heard of the news six days did she weep and all comfort refuse but stephen no sorrow no tears can recall  so she hallows the seventh and comes to the ball for music sweet music has charms to control and tune up each passion that ruffles the soul what things have i read and what stories been told of feats that were done by musicians of old i saw the other day in a thing called an ode as it lay in a snug little house on the road how saul was restored though his sorrow was sharp when david the bethlemite played on the harp twas music that brought a mans wife from old nick and at bath has the power to recover the sick thus a lady was cured the other day  but it is time to seal up my letter and finish my rhyme s  b  n  r  d bath      mr s  b  n  r  d to lady b  n  r  d at  hall north letter xii a modern headdress with a little polite conversation what base and unjust accusations we find arise from the malice and spleen of mankind one would hope my dear mother that scandal would spare the tender the helpless and delicate fair but alas the sweet creatures all find it the case that bath is a very censorious place would you think that a person i met since i came i hope you will excuse my concealing his name a splenetic illnatured fellow before a room full of very good company swore that in spite of appearance twas very well known their hair and their faces were none of their own and thus without wit or the least provocation began an impertinent formal oration shall nature thus lavish her beauties in vain for art and nonsensical fashion to stain the fair jezebella what art can adorn whose cheeks are like roses that blush in the morn as bright were her locks as in heaven are seen presented for stars by the egyptian queen but alas the sweet nymph they no longer must deck no more shall they flow over her ivory neck some runaway valet some outlandish shaver has spoiled all the honors that nature has gave her her head has he robbed with as little remorse as a foxhunter crops both his dogs and his horse a wretch that so far from repenting his theft makes a boast of tormenting the little that is left and first at her porcupine head he begins to fumble and poke with his irons and pins then fires all his crackers with horrid grimace and puffs his vile rocambol breath in her face discharging a steam that the devil would choke from paper pomatum from powder and smoke the patient submits and with due resignation prepares for her fate in the next operation when lo on a sudden a monster appears a horrible monster to cover her ears what sign of the zodiac is it he bears is it tauruss tail or the tete de mouton or the beard of the goat that he dares to put on it is a wig en vergette that from paris was brought un tete comme il faut that the varlet has bought of a beggar whose head he has shaved for a groat now fixed to her head does he frizzle and dab it her foretops no more  it is the skin of a rabbit  it is a muff  it is a thing that by all is confessed is in color and shape like a chalfinchs nest o cease ye fair virgins such pains to employ the beauties of nature with paint to destroy see venus lament see the loves and the graces how they pine at the injury done to your faces ye have eyes lips and nose but your heads are no more than a dolls that is placed at a milliners door   i am ashamed to repeat what he said in the sequel aspersions so cruel as nothing can equal i declare i am shocked such a fellow should vex and spread all these lies of the innocent sex for whom while i live i will make protestation i have the highest esteem and profound veneration i never so strange an opinion will harbor that they buy all the hair they have got of a barber nor ever believe that such beautiful creatures can have any delight in abusing their features one thing though i wonder at much i confess is thappearance they make in their different dresses for indeed they look very much like apparitions when they come in the morning to hear the musicians and some i am apt to mistake at first sight for the mothers of those i have seen over night it shocks me to see them look paler than ashes and as dead in the eye as the busto of nash is who the evening before were so blooming and plump  i am grieved to the heart when i go to the pump for i take every morning a sup at the water just to hear what is passing and see what they are ater for i am told the discourses of persons refined are better than books for improving the mind but a great deal of judgments required in the skimming the polite conversation of sensible women for they come to the pump as before i was saying and talk all at once while the music is playing your servant miss fitchet good morning miss stote my dear lady riggledum how is your throat your ladyship knows that i sent you a scrawl last night to attend at your ladyships call but i hear that your ladyship went to the ball   oh fitchet  dont ask me  good heavens preserve i wish there was no such a thing as a nerve half dead all the night i protest and declare  my dear little fitchet who dresses your hair  you will come to the rooms all the world will be there sir toby macnegus is going to settle his teadrinking night with sir philip okettle i hear that they both have appointed the same the majority think that sir philips to blame i hope they will not quarrel they are both in a flame sir toby macnegus much spirit has got and sir philip okettle is apt to be hot   have you read the bath guide that ridiculous poem what a scurrilous author does nobody know him young billy penwaggle and simius chatter declare it is an illnatured halfwitted satire you know i am engaged my dear creature with you and mrs pamtickle this morning at loo poor thing though she hobbled last night to the ball today she is so lame that she hardly can crawl major lignum has trod on the first joint of her toe    that thing they played last was a charming concerto i dont recollect i have heard it before the minuets good but the jig i adore pray speak to sir toby to cry out encore dear mother i think this is excellent fun but if all i must write i should never have done so myself i subscribe your most dutiful son s  b  n  r  d bath      mr s  b  n  r  d to lady b  n  r  d at  hall north letter xiii a public breakfast what blessings attend my dear mother all those who to crowds of admirers their persons expose do the gods such a noble ambition inspire or gods do we make of each ardent desire o generous passion it is yours to afford the splendid assembly the plentiful board to thee do i owe such a breakfast this morn as i never saw before since the hour i was born twas you made my lord raggamuffenn come here who they say has been lately created a peer and today with extreme complaisance and respect asked all the people at bath to a general breakfast you have heard of my lady bunbutter no doubt how she loves an assembly fandango or rout no lady in london is half so expert at a snug private party her friends to divert but they say that of late she is grown sick of the town and often to bath condescends to come down her ladyships favorite house is the bear her chariot and servants and horses are there my lady declares that retiring is good as all with a separate maintenance should for when you have put out the conjugal fire it is time for all sensible folk to retire if hymen no longer his fingers will scorch little cupid for others can whip in his torch so pert is he grown since the custom began to be married and parted as quick as you can now my lord had the honor of coming down post to pay his respects to so famous a toast in hopes he her ladyships favor might win by playing the part of a host at an inn i am sure he is a person of great resolution though delicate nerves and a weak constitution for he carried us all to a place cross the river and vowed that the rooms were too hot for his liver he said it would greatly our pleasure promote if we all for springgardens set out in a boat i never as yet could his reason explain why we all sallied sorth in the wind and the rain for sure such confusion was never yet known here a cap and a hat there a cardinal blown while his lordship embroidered and powdered all over was bowing and handing the ladies ashore how the misses did huddle and scuddle and run one would think to be wet must be very good fun for by waggling their tails they all seemed to take pains to moisten their pinions like ducks when it rains and twas pretty to see how like birds of a feather the people of quality flocked all together all pressing addressing caressing and fond just the same as those animals are in a pond you have read all their names in the news i suppose but for fear you have not take the list as it goes there was lady greasewrister and madam vantwister her ladyships sister lord cram and lord vultur sir brandish of culter with marshal carouzer and old lady mowzer and the great hanoverian baron pansmowzer besides many others who all in the rain went on purpose to honor this grand entertainment the company made a most brilliant appearance and ate bread and butter with great perseverance all the chocolate too that my lord set before em the ladies dispatched with the utmost decorum soft musical numbers were heard all around the horns and the clarions echoing sound sweet were the strains as odorous gales that blow over fragrant banks where pinks and roses grow the peer was quite ravished while close to his side sat lady bunbutter in beautiful pride often turning his eyes he with rapture surveyed all the powerful charms she so nobly displayed as when at the feast of the great alexander timotheus the musical son of thersander breathed heavenly measures the prince was in pain and could not contain while thais was sitting beside him but before all his peers was for shaking the spheres such goods all the gods did provide him grew bolder and bolder and cocked up his shoulder like the son of great jupiter ammon till at length quite oppressed he sunk on her breast and lay there as dead as a salmon o had i a voice that was stronger than steel with twice fifty tongues to express what i feel and as many good mouths yet i never could utter all the speeches my lord made to lady bunbutter so polite all the time that he never touched a bit while she ate up his rolls and applauded his wit for they tell me that men of true taste when they treat must talk a great deal but they never should eat and if that be the fashion i never will give any grand entertainment as long as i live for i am of opinion it is proper to cheer the stomach and bowels as well as the ear nor me did the charming concerto of abel regale like the breakfast i saw on the table i freely will own i the muffins preferred to all the genteel conversation i heard even though i would the honor of sitting between my lady stuffdamask and peggy moreen who both flew to bath in the london machine cries peggy this place is enchantingly pretty we never can see such a thing in the city you may spend all your lifetime in cateaton street and never so civil a gentleman meet you may talk what you please you may search london through you may go to carlisles and to almanacs too and i will give you my head if you find such a host for coffee tea chocolate butter and toast how he welcomes at once all the world and his wife and how civil to folk he never saw in his life   these horns cries my lady so tickle ones ear lard what would i give that sir simon was here to the next public breakfast sir simon shall go for i find here are folks one may venture to know sir simon would gladly his lordship attend and my lord would be pleased with so cheerful a friend so when we had wasted more bread at a breakfast than the poor of our parish have ate for this week past i saw all at once a prodigious great throng come bustling and rustling and jostling along for his lordship was pleased that the company now to my lady bunbutter should curtsey and bow and my lady was pleased too and seemed vastly proud at once to receive all the thanks of a crowd and when like chaldeans we all had adored this beautiful image set up by my lord some few insignificant folk went away just to follow themployments and calls of the day but those who knew better their time how to spend the fiddling and dancing all chose to attend miss clunch and sir toby performed a cotillon much the same as our susan and bob the postilion all the while her mamma was expressing her joy that her daughter the morning so well could employ  now why should the muse my dear mother relate the misfortunes that fall to the lot of the great as homeward we came  it is with sorrow you will hear what a dreadful disaster attended the peer for whether some envious god had decreed that a naid should long to ennoble her breed or whether his lordship was charmed to behold his face in the stream like narcissus of old in handing old lady bumfidget and daughter this obsequious lord tumbled into the water some nymph of the flood brought him safe to the boat and i left all the ladies a cleaning his coat  thus the feast was concluded as far as i hear to the great satisfaction of all that were there o may he give breakfast as long as he stays for i never ate a better in all my born days in haste i conclude etc etc etc s  b  n  r  d bath      miss prudence b  r  d to lady eliz m  d  ss at  castle north letter

fiery gulf of hell brother simkins grown a rakehell cards and dances every day jenny laughs at tabernacle tabby runt is gone astray blessed i though once rejected like a little wandering sheep who this morning was elected by a vision in my sleep for i dreamed an apparition came like roger from above saying by divine commission i must fill you full of love just with rogers head of hair on rogers mouth and pious smile sweet methinks as beard of aaron dropping down with holy oil i began to fall a kicking panted struggled strove in vain when the spirit whipped so quick in i was cured of all my

of mr b  r  d  his bill of expenses  a farewell to bath alas my dear mother our evil and good by few is distinguished by few understood how often are we doomed to repent at the end the events that our pleasantest prospects attend as solon declared in the last scene alone all the joys of our life all our sorrows are known when first i came hither for vapors and wind to cure all distempers and study mankind how little i dreamed of the tempest behind i never once thought what a furious blast what storms of distress would overwhelm me at last how wretched am i what a fine declamation might be made on the subject of my situation i am a fable  an instance  and serve to dispense an example to all men of spirit and sense to all men of fashion and all men of wealth who come to this place to recover their health for my means are so small and my bills are so large i never can come home till you send a discharge let the muse speak the cause if a muse yet remain to supply me with rhimes and express all my pain paid bells and musicians drugs nurse and physicians balls raffles subscriptions and chairs wigs gowns skins and trimming good books for the women plays concerts tea negus and prayers paid the following schemes of all who it seems make charity business their care a gamester decayed and a prudish old maid by gaiety brought to despair a fiddler of note who for lace on his coat to his tailor was much in arrears an author of merit who wrote with such spirit the pillory took off his ears a sum my dear mother far heavier yet captain cormorant won when i learned lansquenet two hundred i paid him and five am in debt for the five i had nothing to do but to write for the captain was very well bred and polite and took as he saw my expenses were great my bond to be paid on the clodpole estate and asks nothing more while the money is lent than interest paid him at twenty per cent but i am shocked to relate what distresses befall miss jenny my sister and tabby and all miss jenny poor thing from this bath expedition was in hopes very soon to have changed her condition but rumor has brought certain things to her ear which i never will believe yet am sorry to hear that the captain her lover her dear romeo was banished the army a great while ago that his friends and his foes he alike can betray and picks up a scandalous living by play but if ever i could think that the captain had cheated or my dear cousin jenny unworthily treated by all that is sacred i swear for his pains i would cudgel him first and then blow out his brains for the man i abhor like the devil dear mother who one thing conceals and professes another o how shall we know the right way to pursue  do the ills of mankind from religion accrue  religion designed to relieve all our care has brought my poor sister to grief and despair now she talks of damnation and screws up her face then prates about roger and spiritual grace her senses alas seem at once gone astray  no pen can describe it no letter convey but the man without sin that moravian rabbi has perfectly cured the chlorosis of tabby and if right i can judge from her shape and her face she soon may produce him an infant of grace now they say that all people in our situation are very fine subjects for regeneration but i think my dear mother the best we can do is to pack up our all and return back to you farewell then ye streams ye poetical themes sweet fountains for curing the spleen i am grieved to the heart without cash to depart and quit this adorable scene where gaming and grace each other embrace dissipation and piety meet  may all who have a notion of cards or devotion make bath their delightful retreat s b  d  finis
