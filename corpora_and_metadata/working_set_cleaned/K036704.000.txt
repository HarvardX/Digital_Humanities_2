arrived   bronze no maam but he is hourly expected   ellen do they say he is well  quite recovered   bronze i dont know maam  upon my soul  i beg pardon but really the baronets house is horrid vulgar compared to your uncles the nabobs here i peeped through my glass into an old hall and beheld fifty paupers at dinner such wretches and the baronet himself walking round the table to see them properly fed  how damned low  ugh i would bett a rump and dozen our second table is more genteelerer than sir huberts own  but i must away for we expect the rich miss vortex  i beg pardon but your name and the nabobs daughter being the same we call her the rich to distinguish    ellen and you do wisely  no term of distinction could possibly be more significant or better understood by the world than that you have adopted   bronze hope no offense maam   ellen none bronze go in    bronze the last man on earth to offend a fine woman   exit ellen the rich miss vortex  most true  but now my dear charles stanley is returned i claim the superior title of the happy oh charles when we parted last at spa how great the contrast thy animated form was imprisoned in the icy fetters of disease thy pale and quivering lip refused a last adieu  but ah a smile that seemed borrowed from a seraph who waited to bear thee up to heaven swore for thee everlasting love that smile supported me in solitude  but to solitude i have now bade adieu and to be near the lord of my heart have again entered this house the palace of ruinous luxury and licentious madness but here comes its whimsical proprietor   enter mr vortex with a paper in his hand attended by black and white servants vortex sublime  oh the fame of this speech will spread to indostan eh  dont i smell the pure air in this room oh you villains would you destroy me throw about the perfumes for legislative profundity for fancy and decoration  it is a speech    ellen what speech is it sir   vortex ah ellen  why my maiden speech in parliament  it will alarm all europe  i will speak it to you    ellen no my dear uncle not just now  i hear you have been ill   vortex oh very  a strange agitation at my heart and such a whizzing and spinning in my head    ellen i hope you have had advice    vortex oh yes i have had them all  one physician told me it was caused by too brilliant and effervescent a genius  the next said it was the scurvy  a third it proceeded from not eating pepper to a melon  another had the impudence to hint it was only little qualms that agitated some gentlemen who had made fortunes in india  one recommended a sea voyage  another a flannel nightcap  one prescribed water  the other brandy but however they all agreed in this essential point that i am not to be contradicted but have my way in every thing   ellen an extremely pleasant prescription certainly but under these circumstances do you hold it prudent uncle to become a parliamentary orator i believe a little gentle contradiction is usual in that house   vortex i know it  but if you will hear my speech you will see how i manage  i begin  sir    enter servant serve your daughter sir is arrived from town   ellen thank you cousin for this relief    aside vortex zounds i am not to be interrupted   serve she is here sir   enter miss vortex miss vor my dear nabob uncommon glad to see you ah ellen what tired of seclusion and a cottage   ellen i hope cousin i am welcome to you   miss vor certainly you know we are uncommon glad to see any body in the country  but my dear nabob you dont inquire about the opening of our townhouse   vortex i was thinking of my speech   miss vor the most brilliant housewarming  uncommon full above a thousand people  every body there   ellen pray cousin do you then visit every body   miss vor certainly they must ask me   ellen must i should imagine that would depend on inclination   miss vor inclination psha i beg your pardon but you are really uncommon ignorant my dear they must ask me i tell you  now suppose a duchess rash enough to shut me from her parties  very well  she names a night  i name the same and give an entertainment greatly surpassing here is in splendor and profusion  what is the consequence  why that her rooms are as deserted as an exministers levee and mine crammed to suffocation with her graces most puissant and noble friends  ha ha my dear ellen the court of st jamess run after a good supper as eagerly as the court of aldermen  ha ha your being in this country nabob was thought quite charming  a host not being at home to receive his guests is uncommon new and elegant is not  here we improve my dear on ancient hospitality  those little memorandums nabob will give you an idea of the sort of thing   vortex reads march  oh that is a delightful month when nature produces nothing and every thing is forced  let me see    0 quarts of green peace at five guineas a quart  that was pretty well   00 peaches  at what   a guinea each  oh too cheap   miss vor it is very true but i assure you i tried every where to get them dearer but could not   vortex and i suppose the new white satin furniture was all spoiled   miss vor oh entirely  and the pier glasses shivered to pieces so delightfully   vortex well i hope you had the whole account put in the papers   miss vor certainly else what would have been the use of giving the fete then the company such charming eccentricity such characters out of character  we had a noble peer bowing for custom to his shop and an alderman turning over the music leaves for the celebrated soprano an orators lady detailing her hnsbands three hours speech in parliament and the orator himself describing how puppets are managed at the fantoccini we had grandmothers making assignations with boys and the children of israel joining the host of pharaoh  oh my dear miss vortex why dont you partake in these charming scenes   ellen my dear miss vortex six suppers would annihilate my fortune   miss vor oh true i forgot your uncommon small fortune but i dont think it much signifies i swear people of fashion in town seem to do as well without money as with it you might be successful at play there are points to be learnt which certainly do not give you the worst of the game come will you be my protegee   ellen excuse me coussn i dare say i ought to be covered with blushes when i own a vulgar detestation of the character of a female gamester and i must decline the honor of your introduction to the haut ton till at least they have justice on their side   miss vor an uncommon odd girl nabob   ellen heavens to what state of abject degradation must fashionable society be reduced when officers of police are as much dreaded by ladies in the purlieus of st jamess as they are by cut purses in the wretched haunts of st giles   miss vor for shame ellen to censure your own sex   ellen no madam i am its advocate and in that sexs name protest an abhorrence of those women who do not consider any thing shameful but to be ashamed of any thing whose resemblance to nature and innocence exists but in their nakedness and to whom honor is only known as a pledge at a gaming table   exit miss vor did you ever hear nabob   vortex i did not hear a word she said i was thinking of my speech   miss vor a pert gothic lowbred creature but her contemptible fortune suits uncommon well with her grovelling ideas   vortex dont talk of her fortune it always makes my poor head worse you know at the time i gave her five thousand pounds in lieu of what i called her expectations i had in my hands an enormous sum of here is o dear i am afraid the doctor was right  ah mine are certainly east india qualms  i wonder if giving her fifty thousand back again would do my heart any good   miss vor what my dear nabob i declare you quite shock me   vortex oh conscience   miss vor conscience he he a thing so uncommon vulgar a thing so completely chausseed besides yon know very well it is absolutely impossible to exist under  0000l a year   vortex that is very true   miss vor some people certainly do contrive to grub on with ten thousand but how they do it is to me miraculous then think of your intention of marrying me to the son of your great rival the baronet think of his borough   vortex ah very true  conscience avaunt i have made a motion on matrimony to sir hubert   miss vor and young stanleys arrival oh what a sweet youth   vortex oh what a sweet borough interest but i am glad your heart is interested   miss vor heart interested lud how can you suspect me of so uncommon vulgar a sensation i trust my joy is occasioned by ideas more becoming a woman of fashion  i am charmed because his fortune is large his family ancient and because my marriage will render all my female friends so uncommon miserable and because i suspect that ellen met young stanley at spa and that she dares aspire to    vortex i wish she were out of the house   miss vor no  she shall stay to witness my triumph   vortex shall stay  i am not to be contradicted you know  my physicians    miss vor certainly not my dear nabob but i may recommend i am sure no physician would object to your taking advice ah does ellen love you as i do  will she listen to your speech as i intend to do  would she throw away thousands for you in a night as i do   vortex very true very true   exeunt scene iii  a pleasure ground and view of

been a very unthrift to thee   charles oh sir   sir hub listen to me  you have heard how my father kept alive the benevolent hospitality that once distinguished old england and i not finding in modern ethics aught likely to improve either the morals or happiness of mankind determined to persevere in the ways of my fathers soon after you went abroad the adjoining estate was purchased by an east indian groaning under wealth produced by groans like the viper after collecting in the warm sunshine his bag of venom he came to the abode of peace and innocence and disseminated his poison but mark me  think me not so unjust boy as with random slander to censure any body of men no thank heaven there are numbers whom providence in addition to the power has added the will to render wealth a blessing to all around them   charles you are ever just and liberal   sir hub but for this vile exception this mr vortex i tell thee riot contention indolence and vice succeeded i struggled against this mischies which spurred him on to oppose me in my election this contest i trust charlea you think the dignity of your family demanded it  this contest i say obliged me to mortgage my estate to a considerable amount and i fear boy even that will not suffice  do thou not blame thy father   charles blame sir my fortune nay my life is held but to promote your happiness   sir hub glorious boy then all will be well again  thy estate restored thy wealth enlarged   charles how   sir hub by marriage charles   charles averts his face with dejection charles marriage sir  to conceal the passion that triumphs here were but to deceive a father and injure the bright excellence i love when i was ill at spa the votaries of pleasure avoided me as the harbinger of melancholy and i was despised as a thing passing into oblivion by all but one fair creature i obtained an opportunity to thank her for the charitable pity her eye had beamed on me love soon kindled his torch at pitys altar for i found in miss vortex such excellence    sir hub who   charles miss vortex sir   sir hub from india   charles the same   sir hub she that is now proposed for your alliance   charles is it possible   sir hub
