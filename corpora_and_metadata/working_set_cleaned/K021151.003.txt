what befell mr jones on his arrival in london the learned dr misaubin used to say that the proper direction to him was to dr misaubin in the world intimating that there were few people in it to whom his great reputation was not known and perhaps upon a very nice examination into the matter we shall find that this circumstance bears no inconsiderable part among the many blessings of grandeur  the great happiness of being known to posterity with the hopes of which we so delighted ourselves in the preceding chapter is the portion of few to have the several elements which compose our names as sydenham expresses it repeated a thousand years hence is a gift beyond the power of title and wealth and is scarce to be purchased unless by the sword and the pen but to avoid the scandalous imputation while we yet live of being one whom nobody knows a scandal by the by as old as the days of homer see the  d odyssey ver      will always be the envied portion of those who have a legal title either to honor or estate  from that figure therefore which the irish peer who brought sophia to town has already made in this history the reader will conclude doubtless it must have been an easy matter to have discovered his house in london without knowing the particular street or square which he inhabited since he must have been one whom every body knows to say the truth so it would have been to any of those tradesmen who are accustomed to attend the regions of the great for the doors of the great are generally no less easy to find than it is difficult to get entrance into them but jones as well as partridge was an entire stranger in london and as he happened to arrive first in a quarter of the town the inhabitants of which have very little intercourse with the householders of hanover or grosvenor square for he entered through grays inn lane so he rambled about some time before he could even find his way to those happy mansions where fortune segregates from the vulgar those magnanimous heroes the descendants of ancient britons saxons or danes whose ancestors being born in better days by sundry kinds of merit have entailed riches and honor on their posterity  jones being at length arrived at those terrestrial elysian fields would now soon have discovered his lordships mansion but the peer unluckily quitted his former house when he went for ireland and as he was just entered into a new one the fame of his equipage had not yet sufficiently blazed in the neighborhood so that after a successless enquiry till the clock had struck eleven jones at last yielded to the advice of partridge and retreated to the bull and gate in holborn that being the inn where he had first alighted and where he retired to enjoy that kind of repose which usually attends persons in his circumstances  early in the morning he again set forth in pursuit of sophia and many a weary step he took to no better purpose than before at last whether it was that fortune relented or whether it was no longer in her power to disappoint him he came into the very street which was honored by his lordships residence and being directed to the house he gave one gentle rap at the door  the porter who from the modesty of the knock had conceived no high idea of the person approaching conceived but little better from the appearance of mr jones who was dressed in a suit of fustian and had by his side the weapon formerly purchased of the sergeant of which though the blade might be composed of welltempered steel the handle was composed only of brass and that none of the brightest when jones therefore enquired after the young lady who had come to town with his lordship this fellow answered surlily that there were no ladies there jones then desired to see the master of the house but was informed that his lordship would see no body that morning and upon growing more pressing the porter said he had positive orders to let no person in but if you think proper said he to leave your name i will acquaint his lordship and if you call another time you shall know when he will see you  jones now declared that he had very particular business with the young lady and could not depart without seeing her upon which the porter with no very agreeable voice or aspect affirmed that there was no young lady in that house and consequently none could he see adding sure you are the strangest man i ever met with for you will not take an answer  i have often thought that by the particular description of cerberus the porter of hell in the  th aeneid virgil might possibly intend to satyrize the porters of the great men in his time the picture at least resembles those who have the honor to attend at the doors of our great men the porter in his lodge answers exactly to cerberus in his den and like him must be appeased by a sop before access can be gained to his master perhaps jones might have seen him in that light and have recollected the passage where the sybil in order to procure an entrance for aeneas presents the keeper of the stygian avenue with such a sop jones in like manner now began to offer a bribe to the human cerberus which a footman overhearing instantly advanced and declared if mr jones would give him the sum proposed he would conduct him to the lady jones instantly agreed and was forthwith conducted to the lodging of mrs fitzpatrick by the very fellow who had attended the ladies thither the day before  nothing more aggravates ill success than the near approach to good the gamester who loses his party at piquet by a single point laments his bad luck ten times as much as he who never came within a prospect of the game so in a lottery the proprietors of the next numbers to that which wins the great prize are apt to account themselves much more unfortunate than their fellowsufferes in short these kind of hairbreadth missings of happiness look like the insults of fortune who may be considered as thus playing tricks with us and wantonly diverting herself at our expense  jones who more than once already had experienced this frolicksome disposition of the heathen goddess was now again doomed to be tantalized in the like manner for he arrived at the door of mrs fitzpatrick about ten minutes after the departure of sophia he now addressed himself to the waiting woman belonging to mrs fitzpatrick who told him the disagreeable news that the lady was gone but could not tell him whither and the same answer he afterward received from mrs fitzpatrick herself for as that lady made no doubt but that mr jones was a person detached from her uncle western in pursuit of his daughter so she was too generous to betray her  though jones had never seen mrs fitzpatrick yet he had heard that a cousin of sophia was married to a gentleman of that name this however in the present tumult of his mind never once recurred to his memory but when the footman who had conducted him from his lordships acquainted him with the great intimacy between the ladies and with their calling each other cousin he then recollected the story of the marriage which he had formerly heard and as he was presently convinced that this was the same woman he became more surprised at the answer which he had received and very earnestly desired leave to wait on the lady herself but she as positively refused him that honor  jones who though he had never seen a court was better bred than most who frequent it was incapable of any rude or abrupt behavior to a lady when he had received therefore a peremptory denial he retired for the present saying to the waiting woman that if this was an improper hour to wait on her lady he would return in the afternoon and that he then hoped to have the honor of seeing her the civility with which he uttered this added to the great comeliness of his person made an impression on the waiting woman and she could not help answering perhaps sir you may and indeed she afterward said every thing to her mistress which she thought most likely to prevail on her to admit a visit from the handsome young gentleman for so she called him  jones very shrewdly suspected that sophia herself was now with her cousin and was denied to him which he imputed to her resentment of what had happened at upton having therefore dispatched partridge to procure him lodgings he remained all day in the street watching the door where he thought his angel lay concealed but no person did he see issue forth except a servant of the house and in the evening he returned to pay his visit to mrs fitzpatrick which that good lady at last condescended to admit  there is a certain air of natural gentility which it is neither in the power of dress to give nor to conceal mr jones as has been before hinted was possessed of this in a very eminent degree he met therefore with a reception from the lady somewhat different from what his apparel seemed to demand and after he had paid her his proper respects was desired to sit down  the reader will not i believe be desirous of knowing all the particulars of this conversation which ended very little to the satisfaction of poor jones for though mrs fitzpatrick soon discovered the lover as all women have the eyes of hawks in those matters yet she still thought it was such a lover as a generous friend of the lady should not betray her to in short she suspected this was the very mr blifil from whom sophia had flown and all the answers which she artfully drew from jones concerning mr allworthys family confirmed her in this opinion she therefore strictly denied any knowledge concerning the place whither sophia was gone nor could jones obtain more than a permission to wait on her again the next evening  when jones was departed mrs fitzpatrick communicated her suspicion concerning mr blifil to her maid who answered sure madam he is too pretty a man in my opinion for any woman in the world to run away from i had rather fancy it is mr jones  mr jones said the lady what jones for sophia had not given the least hint of any such person in all their conversation but mrs honor had been much more communicative and had acquainted her sister abigail with the whole history of jones which this now again related to her mistress  mrs fitzpatrick no sooner received this information than she immediately agreed with the opinion of her maid and what is very unaccountable saw charms in the gallant happy lover which she had overlooked in the slighted squire betty says she you are certainly in the right he is a very pretty fellow and i dont wonder that my cousins maid should tell you so many women are fond of him i am sorry now i did not inform him where my cousin was and yet if he be so terrible a rake as you tell me it is a pity she should ever see him any more for what but her ruin can happen from marrying a rake and a beggar against her fathers consent i protest if he be such a man as the wench described him to you it is but an office of charity to keep her from him and i am sure it would be unpardonable in me to do otherwise who have tasted so bitterly of the misfortunes attending such marriages  here she was interrupted by the arrival of a visitor which was no other than his lordship and as nothing passed at this visit either new or extraordinary or any ways material to this history we shall here put an end to this chapter  chap iii a project of mrs fitzpatrick and her visit to lady bellaston when mrs fitzpatrick retired to rest her thoughts were entirely taken up by her cousin sophia and mr jones she was indeed a little offended with the former for the disingenuity which she now discovered in which meditation she had not long exercised her imagination before the following conceit suggested itself that could she possibly become the means of preserving sophia from this man and of restoring her to her father she should in all human probability by so great a service to the family reconcile to herself both her uncle and her aunt western  as this was one of her most favorite wishes so the hope of success seemed so reasonable that nothing remained but to consider of proper methods to accomplish her scheme to attempt to reason the case with sophia did not appear to her one of those methods for as betty had reported from mrs honor that sophia had a violent inclination to jones she conceived that to dissuade her from the match was an endeavor of the same kind as it would be very heartily and earnestly to entreat a moth not to fly into a candle  if the reader will please to remember that the acquaintance which sophia had with lady bellaston was contracted at the house of mrs western and must have grown at the very time when mrs fitzpatrick lived with this latter lady he will want no information that mrs fitzpatrick must have been acquainted with her likewise they were besides both equally her distant relations  after much consideration therefore she resolved to go early in the morning to that lady and endeavor to see her unknown to sophia and to acquaint her with the whole affair for she did not in the least doubt but that the prudent lady who had often ridiculed romantic love and indiscreet marriages in her conversation would very readily concur in her sentiments concerning this match and would lend her utmost assistance to prevent it  this resolution she accordingly executed and the next morning before the sun she huddled on her clothes and at a very unfashionable unseasonable unvisitable hour went to lady bellaston to whom she got access without the least knowledge or suspicion of sophia who though not asleep lay at that time awake in her bed with honor snoring by her side  mrs fitzpatrick made many apologies for this early abrupt visit at an hour when she said she should not have thought of disturbing her ladyship but upon business of the utmost consequence she then opened the whole affair told all she had heard from betty and did not forget the visit which jones had paid to herself the preceding evening  lady bellaston answered with a smile then you have seen this terrible man madam pray is he so very fine a figure as he is represented for etoff entertained me last night almost two hours with him the wench i believe is in love with him by reputation here the reader will be apt to wonder but the truth is that mrs etoff who had the honor to pin and unpin the lady bellaston had received complete information concerning the said mr jones and had faithfully conveyed the same to her lady last night or rather that morning while she was undressing on which accounts she had been detained in her office above the space of an hour and half  the lady indeed though generally well enough pleased with the narratives of mrs etoff at those seasons gave an extraordinary attention to her account of jones for honor had described him as a very handsome fellow and mrs etoff in her hurry added so much to the beauty of his person to her report that lady bellaston began to conceive him to be a kind of miracle in nature  the curiosity which her woman had inspired was now greatly increased by mrs fitzpatrick who spoke as much in favor of the person of jones as she had before spoken in dispraise of his birth character and fortune  when lady bellaston had heard the whole she answered gravely indeed madam this is a matter of great consequence nothing can certainly be more commendable than the part you act and i shall be very glad to have my share in the preservation of a young lady of so much merit and for whom i have so much esteem  doth not your ladyship think says mrs fitzpatrick eagerly that it would be the best way to write immediately to my uncle and acquaint him where my cousin is  the lady pondered a little upon this and thus answered  why no madam i think not di western has described her brother to me to be such a brute that i cannot consent to put any woman under his power who has escaped from it i have heard he behaved like a monster to his own wife for he is one of those wretches who think they have a right to tyrannize over us and from such i shall ever esteem it the cause of my sex to rescue any woman who is so unfortunate to be under their power  the business dear cousin will be only to keep miss western from seeing this young fellow till the good company which she will have an opportunity of meeting here give her a proper turn  if he should find her out madam answered the other your ladyship may be assured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her  but madam replied the lady it is impossible he should come here  though indeed it is possible he may get some intelligence where she is and then may lurk about the house  i wish therefore i knew his person  is there no way madam by which i could have a sight of him for otherwise you know cousin she may contrive to see him here without my knowledge mrs fitzpatrick answered that he had threatened her with another visit that afternoon and that in her ladyship pleased to do her the honor of calling upon her then she would hardly fail of seeing him between six and seven and if he came earlier she would by some means or other detain him till her ladyships arrival  lady bellaston replied she would come the moment she could get from dinner which she supposed would be by seven at farthest for that it was absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his person upon my word madam says she it was very good to take this care of miss western but common humanity as well as regard to our family requires it of us both for it would be a dreadful match indeed  mrs fitzpatrick failed not to make a proper return to the compliment which lady bellaston had bestowed on her cousin and after some little immaterial conversation withdrew and getting as fast as she could into her chair unseen by sophia or honor returned home  chap iv which consists of visiting mr jones had walked within sight of a certain door during the whole day which though one of the shortest appeared to him to be one of the longest in the whole year at length the clock having struck five he returned to mrs fitzpatrick who though it was a full hour earlier than the decent time of visiting received him very civilly but still persisted in her ignorance concerning sophia  jones in asking for his angel had dropped the word cousin upon which mrs fitzpatrick said then sir you know we are related and as we are you will permit me the right of enquiring into the particulars of your business with my cousin here jones hesitated a good while and at last answered he had a considerable sum of money of hers in his hands which he desired to deliver to her he then produced the pocketbook and acquainted mrs fitzpatrick with the contents and with the method in which they came into his hands he had scarce finished his story when a most violent noise shook the whole house to attempt to describe this noise to those who have heard it would be in vain and to aim at giving any idea of it to those who have never heard the like would be still more vain for it may be truly said   non acuta sic geminant corybantes era the priests of cybele do not so rattle their sounding brass in short a footman knocked or rather thundered at the door jones was a little surprised at the sound having never heard it before but mrs fitzpatrick very calmly said that as some company were coming she could not make him any answer now but if he pleased to stay till they were gone she intimated she had something to say to him  the door of the room now flew open and after pushing in her hoop sideways before her entered lady bellaston who having first made a very low curtesy to mrs fitzpatrick and as low a one to mr jones was ushered to the upper end of the room  we mention these minute matters for the sake of some country ladies of our acquaintance who think it contrary to the rules of modesty to bend their knees to a man  the company were hardly well settled before the arrival of the peer lately mentioned caused a fresh diurbance and a repetition of ceremonials  here being over the conversation began to be as the phrase is extremely brilliant however as nothing past in it which can be thought material to this history or indeed very material in itself i shall omit the relation the rather as i have known some very fine polite conversation grow extremely dull when transcribed into books or repeated on the stage indeed this mental repast is a dainty of which those who are excluded from polite assemblies must be contented to remain as ignorant as they must of the several dainties of french cookery which are only served at the tables of the great to say the truth as neither of these are adapted to every taste they might both be often thrown away on the vulgar  poor jones was rather a spectator of this elegant scene than an actor in it for though in the short interval before the peers arrival lady bellaston first and afterward mrs fitzpatrick had addressed some of their discourse to him yet no sooner was the noble lord entered than he engrossed the whole attention of the two ladies to himself and as he took no more notice of jones than if no such person had been present unless by now and then staring at him the ladies followed his example  the company had now staid so long that mrs fitzpatrick plainly perceived they all designed to stay out each other she therefore resolved to rid herself of jones he being the visitant to whom she thought the least ceremony was due taking therefore an opportunity of a cessation of chat she addressed herself gravely to him and said sir i shall not possibly be able to give you an answer tonight as to that business but if you please to leave word where i may send to you tomorrow   jones had natural but not artificial good breeding instead therefore of communicating the secret of  is lodgings to a servant he acquainted the lady eself with it particularly and soon after very ceremoniously withdrew  he was no sooner gone than the great personages who had taken no notice of him present began to take much notice of him in his absence but if the reader has already excused us from relating the more brilliant part of this conversation he will surely be very ready to excuse the repetition of what may be called vulgar abuse though perhaps it may be material to our history to mention an observation of lady bellaston who took her leave in a few minutes after him and then said to mrs fitzpatrick at her departure i am satisfied on the account of my cousin she can be in no danger from this fellow  our history shall follow the example of lady bellaston and take leave of the present company which was now reduced to two persons between whom as nothing passed which in the least concerns us or our reader we shall not suffer ourselves to be diverted by it from matters which must seem of more consequence to all those who are at all interested in the affairs of our hero  chap v an adventure which happened to mr jones at his lodgings with some account of a young gentleman who lodged there and of the mistress of the house and her two daughters the next morning as early as it was decent jones attended at mrs fitzpatricks door where he was answered that the lady was not at home an answer which surprised him the more as he had walked backwards and forwards in the street from break of day and if she had gone out he must have seen her this answer however he was obliged to receive and not only now but to five several visits which he made her that day to be plain with the reader the noble peer had from some reason or other perhaps from a regard for the ladys honor insisted that she should not see mr jones whom he looked on as a scrub any more and the lady had complied in making that promise to which we now see her so strictly adhere  but as our gentle reader may possibly have a better opinion of the young gentleman than her ladyship and may even have some concern should it be apprehended that during this unhappy separation from sophia he took up his residence either at an inn or in the street we shall now give an account of his lodging which was indeed in a very reputable house and in a very good part of the town  mr jones then had often heard mr allworthy mention the gentlewoman at whose house he used to lodge when he was in town this person who as jones likewise knew lived in bondstreet was the widow of a clergyman and was left by him at his decease in possession of two daughters and of a complete set of manuscript sermons  of these two daughters nancy the elder was now arrived at the age of seventeen and betty the younger at that of ten  hither jones had dispatched partridge and in this house he was provided with a room for himself in the second floor and with one for partridge in the fourth  the first floor was inhabited by one of those young gentlemen who in the last age were called men of wit and pleasure about town and properly enough for as men are usually denominated from their business or profession so pleasure may be said to have been the only business or profession of those gentlemen to whom fortune had made all useful occupations unnecessary play houses coffeehouses and taverns were the scenes of their rendezvous wit and humor were the entertainment of their looser hours and love was the business of their more serious moments wine and the muses conspired to kindle the brightest flames in their breasts nor did they only admire but some were able to celebrate the beauty they admired and all to judge of the merit of such compositions  such therefore were properly called the men of wit and pleasure but i question whether the same appellation may with the same propriety be given to those young gentlemen of our times who have the same ambition to be distinguished for parts wit certainly they have nothing to do with to give them their due they soar a step higher than their predecessors and may be called men of wisdom and virtue take heed you do not read virtue thus at an age when the gentlemen abovementioned employed their time in toasting the charms of a woman or in making sonnets in her praise in giving their opinion of a play at the theater or of a poem at wills or buttons these gentlemen are considering of methods to bribe a corporation or meditating speeches for the house of commons or rather for the magazines but the science of gaming is that which above all others employs their thoughts these are the studies of their graver hours while for their amusements they have the vast circle of connoisseurship painting music statuary and natural philosophy or rather unnatural which deals in the wonderful and knows nothing of nature except her monsters and imperfections  when jones had spent the whole day in vain enquiries after mrs fitzpatrick he returned at last disconsolate to his apartment here while he was venting his grief in private he heard a violent uproar below stairs and soon after a female voice begged him for heavens sake to come and prevent murder jones who was never backward on any occasion to help the distressed immediately ran down stairs when stepping into the dining room whence all the noise issued he beheld the young gentleman of wisdom and virtue just before mentioned pinned close to the wall by his footman and a young woman standing by wringing her hands and crying out he will be murdered he will be murdered and indeed the poor gentleman seemed in some danger of being choked when jones flew hastily to his assistance and rescued him just as he was breathing his last from the unmerciful clutches of the enemy  though the fellow had received several kicks and cuffs from the little gentleman who had more spirit than strength he had made it a kind of scruple of conscience to strike his master and would have contented himself with only choking him but toward jones he bore no such respect he no sooner therefore found himself a little roughly handled by his new antagonist than he gave him one of those punches in the guts which though the spectators at broughtons amphitheatre have such exquisite delight in seeing them convey but very little pleasure in the feeling  the lusty youth had no sooner received this blow than he meditated a most grateful return and now ensued a combat between jones and the footman which was very fierce but short for this fellow was no more able to contend with jones than his master had before been to contend with him  and now fortune according to her usual custom reversed the face of affairs the former victor lay breathless on the ground and the vanquished gentleman had recovered breath enough to thank mr jones for his seasonable assistance he received likewise the hearty thanks of the young woman present who was indeed no other than miss nancy the eldest daughter of the house  the footman having now recovered his legs shook his head at jones and with a sagacious look cried  o d  n me i will have nothing more to do with you you have been upon the stage or i am d  nably mistaken and indeed we may forgive this his suspicion for such was the agility and strength of our hero that he was perhaps a match for one of the first rate boxers and could with great ease have beaten all the muffled lest posterity should be puzzled by this epithet i think proper to explain it by an advertisement which was published feb        n b mr broughton proposes with proper assistance to open an academy at his house in the haymarket for the instruction of those who are willing to be initiated in the mystery of boxing where the whole theory and practice of that truly british art with all the various stops blows crossbuttocks etc incident to combatants will be fully taught and explained and that persons of quality and distinction may not be deterred from entering into a course of these lectures they will be given with the utmost tenderness and regard to the delicacy of the frame and constitution of the pupil for which reason mufflers are provided that will effectually secure them from the inconveniency of black eyes broken jaws and bloody noses   graduates of mr broughtons school  his master foaming with wrath ordered his man immediately to strip to which the latter very readily agreed on condition of receiving his wages this condition was presently complied with and the fellow was discharged  and now the young gentleman whose name was nightingale very strenuously insisted that his deliverer should take part of a bottle of wine with him to which jones after much entreaty consented though more out of complaisance than inclination for the uneasiness of his mind fitted him very little for conversation at this time miss nancy likewise who was the only female then in the house her mamma and sister being gone to the play condescended to favor them with her company  when the bottle and glasses were on the table the gentleman began to relate the occasion of the preceding disturbance  i hope sir said he to jones you will not from this accident conclude that i make a custom of striking my servants for i assure you this is the first time i have been guilty of it in my remembrance and i have passed by many provoking faults in this very fellow before he could provoke me to it but when you hear what has happened this evening you will i believe think me excuseable i happened to come home several hours before my usual time when i found four gentlemen of the cloth at whisk by my fire  and my hoyle sir  my best hoyle which cost me a guinea lying open on the table with a quantity of porter spilt on one of the most material leaves of the whole book this you will allow was provoking but i said nothing till the rest of the honest company were gone and then gave the fellow a gentle rebuke who instead of expressing any concern made me a pert answer that servants must have their diversions as well as other people that he was sorry for the accident which had happened to the book but that several of his acquaintance had bought the same for a shilling and that i might stop as much in his wages if i pleased i now gave him a severer reprimand than before when the rascal had the insolence to  in short he imputed my early coming home to  in short he cast a reflection  he mentioned the name of a young lady in a manner  in such a manner that incensed me beyond all patience and in my passion i struck him  jones answered that he believed no person living would blame him for my part said he i confess i should on the last mentioned provocation have done the same thing  our company had not sat long before they were joined by the mother and daughter at their return from the play and now they all spent a very cheerful evening together for all but jones were heartily merry and even he put on as much constrained mirth as possible indeed half his natural flow of animal spirits joined to the sweetness of his temper was sufficient to make a most amiable companion and notwithstanding the heaviness of his heart so agreeable did he make himself on the present occasion that at their breaking up the young gentleman earnestly desired his further acquaintance miss nancy was well pleased with him and the widow quite charmed with her new lodger invited him with the other next morning to breakfast  jones on his part was no less satisfied as for miss nancy though a very little creature she was extremely pretty and the widow had all the charms which can adorn a woman near fifty as she was one of the most innocent creatures in the world so she was one of the most cheerful she never thought nor spoke nor wished any ill and had constantly that desire of pleasing which may be called the happiest of all desires in this that it scarce ever fails of attaining its ends when not disgraced by affectation in short though her power was very small she was in her heart one of the warmest friends she had been a most affectionate wife and was a most fond and tender mother  as our history does not like a newspaper give great characters to people who never were heard of before nor will ever be heard of again the reader may hence conclude that this excellent woman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history  nor was jones a little pleased with the young gentleman himself whose wine he had been drinking he thought he discerned in him much good sense though a little too much tainted with town foppery but what recommended him most to jones were some sentiments of great generosity and humanity which occasionally dropped from him and particularly many expressions of the highest disinterestedness in the affair of love on which subject the young gentleman delivered himself in a language which might have very well become an arcadian shepherd of old and which appeared very extraordinary when proceeding from the lips of a modern fine gentleman but he was only one by imitation and meant by nature for a much better character  chap vi what arrived while the company were at breakfast with some hints concerning the government of daughters our company brought together in the morning the same good inclinations toward each other with which they had separated the evening before but poor jones was extreme disconsolate for he had just received information from partridge that mrs fitzpatrick had left her lodging and that he could not learn whither she was gone this news highly affected him and his countenance as well as his behavior in defiance of all his endeavors to the contrary betrayed manifest indications of a disordered mind  the discourse turned at present as before on love and mr nightingale again expressed many of those warm generous and disinterested sentiments upon this subject which wise and sober men call romantic but which wise and sober women generally regard in a better light mrs miller for so the mrs of the house was called greatly approved these sentiments but when the young gentleman appealed to miss nancy she answered only that she believed the gentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling the most  this compliment was so apparently directed to jones that we should have been sorry had he passed it by unregarded he made her indeed a very polite answer and concluded with an oblique hint that her own silence subjected her to a suspicion of the same kind for indeed she had scarce opened her lips either now or the last evening  i am glad nanny says mrs miller the gentleman has made the observation i protest i am almost of his opinion what can be the matter with you child i never saw such an alteration what is become of all your gayety would you think sir i used to call her my little prattler she has not spoke twenty words this week  here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a maidservant who brought a bundle in her hands which she said was delivered by a porter for mr jones she added that the man immediately went away saying it required no answer  jones expressed some surprise on this occasion and declared it must be some mistake but the maid persisting that she was certain of the name all the women were desirous of having the bundle immediately opened which operation was at length performed by little betsy with the consent of mr jones and the contents were found to be a domino a mask and a masquerade ticket  jones was now more positive than ever in asserting that these things must have been delivered by mistake and mrs miller herself expressed some doubt and said she knew not what to think but when mr nightingale was asked he delivered a very different opinion all i can conclude from it sir said he is that you are a very happy man for i make no doubt but these were sent you by some lady whom you will have the happiness of meeting at the masquerade  jones had not a sufficient degree of vanity to entertain any such flattering imagination nor did mrs miller herself give much assent to what mr nightingale had said till miss nancy having lifted up the domino a card dropped from the sleeve in which was written as follows  to mr jones the queen of the fairies sends you this use her favors not amiss  mrs miller and miss nancy now both agreed with mr nightingale nay jones himself was almost persuaded to be of the same opinion and as no other lady but mrs fitzpatrick he thought knew his lodging he began to flatter himself with some hopes that it came from her and that he might possibly see his sophia these hopes had surely very little foundation but as the conduct of mr fitzpatrick in not seeing him according to her promise and in quitting her lodgings had been very odd and unaccountable he conceived some faint hopes that she of whom he had formerly heard a very whimsical character might possibly intend to do him that service in a strange manner which she declined doing by more ordinary methods to say the truth as nothing certain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an incident he had the greater latitude to draw what imaginary conclusions from it he pleased as his temper therefore was naturally sanguine he indulged it on this occasion and his imagination worked up a thousand conceits to favor and support his expectations of meeting his dear sophia in the evening  reader if thou have any good wishes toward me i will fully repay them by wishing thee to be possessed of this sanguine disposition of mind since after having read much and considered long on that subject of happiness which has employed so many great pens i am almost inclined to fix it in the possession of this temper which puts us in a manner out of the reach of fortune and makes us happy without her assistance indeed the sensations of pleasure it gives are much more constant as well as much keener than those which that blind lady bestows nature having wisely contrived that some satiety and languor should be annexed to all our real enjoyments lest we should be so taken up by them as to be stopped from further pursuits i make no manner of doubt but that in this light we may see the imaginary future chancellor just called to the bar the archbishop in crape and the prime minister at the tail of an opposition more truly happy than those who are invested with all the power and profit of these respective offices  mr jones having now determined to go to the masquerade that evening mr nightingale offered to conduct him thither the young gentleman at the same time offered tickets to miss nancy and her mother but the good woman would not accept them she said she did not conceive the harm which some people imagined in a masquerade but that such extravagant diversions were only proper for persons of quality and fortune and not for young women who were to get their living and could at best hope to be married to a good tradesman   a tradesman cries nightingale you shall not undervalue my nancy there is not a nobleman upon earth above her merit o fie mr nightingale answered mrs miller you must not fill the girls head with such fancies but if it was her good luck says the mother with a simper to find a gentleman of your generous way of thinking i hope she would make a better return to his generosity than to give her mind up to extravagant pleasures indeed where young ladies bring great fortunes themselves they have some right to insist on spending what is their own and on that account i have heard the gentlemen say a man has sometimes a better bargain with a poor wife than with a rich one  but let my daughters marry whom they will i shall endeavor to make them blessings to their husbands  i beg therefore i may hear of no more masquerades nancy is i am certain too good a girl to desire to go for she must remember when you carried her thither last year it almost turned her head and she did not return to herself or to her needle in a month afterward  though a gentle sigh which stole from the bosom of nancy seemed to argue some secret disapprobation of these sentiments she did not dare openly to oppose them for as this good woman had all the tenderness so she had preserved all the authority of a parent and as her indulgence to the desires of her children was only restrained by her fears for their safety and future welfare so she never suffered those commands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or disputed and this the young gentleman who had lodged two years in the house knew so well that he presently acquiesced in the refusal  mr nightingale who grew every minute fonder of jones was very desirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern where he offered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance but jones begged to be excused as his clothes he said were not yet come to town  to confess the truth mr jones was now in a situation which sometimes happens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than himself in short he had not one penny in his pocket a situation in much greater credit among the ancient philosophers than among the modern wise men who live in lombard street or those who frequent whites chocolate house and perhaps the great honors which those philosophers have ascribed to an empty pocket may be one of the reasons of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid street and chocolatehouse  now if the ancient opinion that men might live very comfortably on virtue only be as the modern wise men just abovementioned pretend to have discovered a notorious error no less false is i apprehend that position of some writers of romance that a man can live altogether on love for however delicious repasts this may afford to some of our senses or appetites it is most certain it can afford none to others those therefore who have placed too great a confidence in such writers have experienced their error when it was too late and have found that love was no more capable of allaying hunger than a rose is capable of delighting the ear or a violin of gratifying the smell  notwithstanding therefore all the delicacies which love had set before him namely the hopes of seeing sophia at the masquerade on which however illfounded his imagination might be he had voluptuously feasted during the whole day the evening no sooner came than mr jones began to languish for some food of a grosser kind partridge discovered this by intution and took the occasion to give some oblique hints concerning the bankbill and when those were rejected with disdain he collected courage enough once more to mention a return to mr allworthy  partridge cries jones you cannot see my fortune in a more desperate light than i see it myself and i begin heartily to repent that i suffered you to leave a place where you was settled and to follow me however i insist now on your returning home and for the expense and trouble which you have so kindly put yourself to on my account all the clothes i left behind in your care i desire you would take as your own i am sorry i can make you no other acknowledgment  he spoke these words with so pathetic an accent that partridge among whose vices ill nature or hardness of heart were not numbered burst into tears and after swearing he would not quit him in his distress he began with the most earnest entreaties to urge his return home for heavens sake sir says he do but consider what can your honor do how is it possible you can live in this town without money do what you will sir or go wherever you please i am resolved not to desert you  but pray sir consider  do pray sir for your own sake take it into your consideration and i am sure says he that your own goodsense will bid you return home  how often shall i tell thee answered jones that i have no home to return to had i any hopes that mr allworthys doors would be open to receive me i want no distress to urge me  nay there is no other cause upon earth which could detain me a moment from flying to his presence but alas that i am for ever banished from it his last words were  o partridge they still ring in my ears  his last words were when he gave me a sum of money what it was i know not but considerable i am sure it was  his last words were  i am resolved from this day forward on no account to converse with you any more  here passion stopped the mouth of jones as surprise for a moment did that of partridge but he soon recovered the use of speech and after a short preface in which he declared he had no inquisitiveness in his temper enquired what jones meant by a considerable sum he knew not how much and what was become of the money  in both these points he now received full satisfaction on which he was proceeding to comment when he was interrupted by a message from mr nightingale who desired his masters company in his apartment  when the two gentlemen were both attired for the masquerade and mr nightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for a circumstance of distress occurred to jones which will appear very ridiculous to many of my readers this was how to procure a shilling but if such readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from the want of a thousand pound or perhaps of ten or twenty to execute a favorite scheme they will have a perfect idea of what mr jones felt on this occasion for this sum therefore he applied to partridge which was the first he had permitted him to advance and was the last he intended that poor fellow should advance in his service to say the truth partridge had lately made no offer of this kind whether it was that he desired to see the bankbill broke in upon or that distress should prevail on jones to return home or from what other motive it proceeded i will not determine  chap vii containing the whole humors of a masquerade our cavaliers now arrived at that temple where heydegger the great arbiter deliciarum the great high priest of pleasure presides and like other heathen priests imposes on his votaries by the pretended presence of the deity when in reality no such deity is there  mr nightingale having taken a turn or two with his companion soon left him and walked off with a female saying now you are here sir you must beat about for your own game  jones began to entertain strong hopes that his sophia was present and these hopes gave him more spirits than the lights the music and the company though these are pretty strong antidotes against the spleen he now accosted every woman he saw whose stature shape or air bore any resemblance to his angel to all of whom he endeavored to say something smart in order to engage an answer by which he might discover that voice which he thought it impossible he should mistake some of these answered by a question in a squeaking voice do you know me much the greater numbers said i dont know you sir and nothing more some called him an impertinent fellow some made him no answer at all some said indeed i dont know your voice and i shall have nothing to say to you and many gave him as kind answers as he could wish but not in the voice he desired to hear  whilst he was talking with one of these last who was in the habit of a shepherdess a lady in a domino came up to him and slapping him on the shoulder whispered him at the same time in the ear if you talk any longer with that trollop i will acquaint miss western  jones no sooner heard that name than immediately quitting his former companion he applied to the domino begging and entreating her to show him the lady she had mentioned if she was then in the room  the mask walked hastily to the upper end of the innermost apartment before she spoke and then instead of answering him sat down and declared she was tired jones sat down by her and still persisted in his entreaties at last the lady coldly answered i imagined mr jones had been a more discerning lover than to suffer any disguise to conceal his mistress from him is she here then madam replied jones with much vehemence upon which the lady cried  hush sir you will be observed  i promise you upon my honor miss western is not here  jones now taking the mask by the hand fell to entreating her in the most earnest manner to acquaint him where he might find sophia and when he could obtain no direct answer he began to upbraid her gently for having disappointed him the day before and concluded saying indeed my good fairy queen i know your majesty very well notwithstanding the affected disguise of your voice indeed mrs fitzpatrick it is a little cruel to divert yourself at the expense of my torments  the mask answered though you have so ingeniously discovered me i must still speak in the same voice lest i should be known by others and do you think good sir that i have no greater regard for my cousin than to assist in carrying on an affair between you two which must end in her ruin as well as your own besides i promise you my cousin is not mad enough to consent to her own destruction if you are so much her enemy as to tempt her to it  alas madam said jones you little know my heart when you call me an enemy of sophia  and yet to ruin any one cries the other you will allow is the act of an enemy and when by the same act you must knowingly and certainly bring ruin on yourself is it not folly or madness as well as guilt now sir my cousin has very little more than her father will please to give her very little for one of her fashion  you know him and you know your own situation  jones vowed he had no such design on sophia that he would rather suffer the most violent of deaths than sacrifice her interest to his desires he said he knew how unworthy he was of her every way that he had long ago resolved to quit all such aspiring thoughts but that some strange accidents had made him desirous to see her once more when he promised he would take leave of her for ever no madam concluded he my love is not of that base kind which seeks its own satisfaction at the expense of what is most dear to its object i would sacrifice every thing to the possession of my sophia but sophia herself  though the reader may have already conceived no very sublime idea of the virtue of the lady in the mask and though possibly she may hereafter appear not to deserve one of the first characters of her sex yet it is certain these generous sentiments made a strong impression upon her and greatly added to the affection she had before conceived for our young hero  the lady now after a silence of a few moments said she did not see his pretensions to sophia so much in the light of presumption as of imprudence young fellows says she can never have too aspiring thoughts i love ambition in a young man and i would have you cultivate it as much as possible perhaps you may succeed with those who are infinitely superior in fortune nay i am convinced there are women  but dont you think me a strong creature mr jones to be thus giving advice to a man with whom i am so little acquainted and one with whose behavior to me i have so little reason to be pleased  here jones began to apologize and to hope he had not offended in any thing he had said of her cousin  to which the mask answered and are you so little versed in the sex to imagine you can well affront a lady more than by entertaining her with your passion for another woman if the fairy queen had had no better opinion of your gallantry she would scarce have appointed you to meet her at a masquerade  jones had never less inclination to an amor than at present but gallantry to the ladies was among his principles of honor and he held it as much incumbent on him to accept a challenge to love as if it had been a challenge to fight nay his very love to sophia made it necessary for him to keep well with the lady as he made no doubt but she was capable of bringing him into the presence of the other  he began therefore to make a very warm answer to her last speech when a mask in the character of an old woman joined them this mask was one of those ladies who go to a masquerade only to vent ill nature by telling people rude truths and by endeavoring as the phrase is to spoil as much sport as they are able this good lady therefore having observed jones and his friend whom she well knew in close consultation together in a corner of the room concluded she could no where satisfy her spleen better than by interrupting them she attacked them therefore and soon drove them from their retirement nor was she contented with this but pursued them to every place which they shifted to avoid her till mr nightingale seeing the distress of his friend at last relieved him and engaged the old woman in another pursuit  while jones and his mask were walking together about the room to rid themselves of the teazer he observed his lady speak to several masks with the same freedom of acquaintance as if they had been barefaced he could not help expressing his surprise at this saying sure madam you must have infinite discernment to know people in all disguises to which the lady answered you cannot conceive any thing more insipid and childish than a masquerade to the people of fashion who in general know one another as well here as when they meet in an assembly or a drawing room nor will any woman of condition converse with a person with whom she is not acquainted in short the generality of persons whom you see here may more properly be said to kill time in this place than in any other and generally retire from hence more tired than from the longest sermon to say the truth i begin to be in that situation myself and if i have any faculty at guessing you are not much better pleased i protest it would be almost charity in me to go home for your sake i know but one charity equal to it cries jones and that is to suffer me to wait on you home sure answered the lady you have a strange opinion of me to imagine that upon such an acquaintance i would let you into my doors at this time onight i fancy you impute the friendship i have shown my cousin to some other motive confess honestly dont you consider this contrived interview as little better than a downright assignation are you used mr jones to make these sudden conquests i am not used madam said jones to submit to such sudden conquests but as you have taken my heart by surprise the rest of my body has a right to follow so you must pardon me if i resolve to attend you wherever you go he accompanied these words with some proper actions upon which the lady after a gentle rebuke and saying their familiarity would be observed told him she was going to sup with an acquaintance whither she hoped he would not follow her for if you should said she i shall be thought an unaccountable creature though my friend indeed is not censorious yet i hope you will not follow me i protest i shall not know what to say if you do  the lady presently after quitted the masquerade and jones notwithstanding the severe prohibition he had received presumed to attend her he was now reduced to the same dilemma we have mentioned before namely the want of shilling and could not relieve it by borrowing as before he therefore walked boldly on after the chair in which his lady rode pursued by a grand huzza from all the chairmen present who wisely take the best care they can to discountenance all walking afoot by their betters luckily however the gentry who attend at the operahouse were too busy to quit their stations and as the lateness of the hour prevented him from meeting many of their brethren in the street he proceeded without molestation in a dress which at another season would have certainly raised a mob at his heels  the lady was set down in a street not far from hanoversquare where the door being presently opened she was carried in and the gentleman without any ceremony walked in after her  jones and his companion were now together in a very wellfurnished and wellwarmd room when the female still speaking in her masquerade voice said she was surprised at her friend who must absolutely have forgot her appointment at which after venting much resentment she suddenly expressed some apprehension from jones and asked him what the world would think of their having been alone together in a house at that time of night but instead of a direct answer to so important a question jones began to be very importunate with the lady to unmask and at length having prevailed there appeared not mrs fitzpatrick but the lady bellaston herself  it would be tedious to give the particular conversation which consisted of very common and ordinary occurrences and which lasted from two till six oclock in the morning it is sufficient to mention all of it that is any wise material to this history and this was a promise that the lady would endeavor to find out sophia and in a few days bring him to an interview with her on condition that he would then take his leave of her when this was thoroughly settled and a second meeting in the evening appointed at the same place they separated the lady returned to her house and jones to his lodgings  chap viii containing a scene of distress which will appear very extraordinary to most of our readers jones having refreshed himself with a few hours sleep summoned partridge to his presence and delivering him a bank note of fifty pounds ordered him to go and change it partridge received this with sparkling eyes though when he came to reflect farther it raised in him some suspicions not very advantageous to the honor of his master to these the dreadful idea he had of the masquerade the disguise in which his master had gone out and returned and his having been abroad all night contributed in plain language the only way he could possibly find to account for the possession of this note was by robbery and to confess the truth the reader unless he should suspect it was owing to the generosity of lady bellaston can hardly imagine any other  to clear therefore the honor of mr jones and to do justice to the liberality of the lady he had really received this present from her who though she did not give much in to the hackney charities of the age such as building hospitals etc was not however entirely void of that christian virtue and conceived very righty i think that a young fellow of merit without a shilling in the world was no improper object of this virtue  mr jones and mr nightingale had been invited to dine this day with mrs miller at the appointed hour therefore the two young gentlemen with the two girls attended in the parlour where they waited from three till almost five before the good woman appeared she had been out of town to visit a relation of whom at her return she gave the following account  i hope gentlemen you will pardon my making you wait i am sure if you knew the occasion  i have been to see a cousin of mine about six miles off who now lies in  it should be a warning to all persons says she looking at her daughters how they marry indiscreetly there is no happiness in this world without a competency o nancy how shall i describe the wretched condition in which i found your poor cousin she has scarce lain in a week and there was she this dreadful weather in a cold room without any curtains to her bed and not a bushel of coals in her house to supply her with fire her second son that sweet little fellow lies ill of a quinzy in the same bed with his mother for there is no other bed in the house poor little tommy i believe nancy you will never see your favorite any more for he is really very ill the rest of the children are in pretty good health but molly i am afraid will do herself an injury she is but thirteen years old mr nightingale and yet in my life i never saw a better nurse she tends both her mother and her brother and what is wonderful in a creature so young she shows all the cheerfulness in the world to her mother and yet i saw her  i saw the poor child mr nightingale turn about and privately wipe the tears from her eyes here mrs miller was prevented by her own tears from going on and there was not i believe a person present who did not accompany her in them at length she a little recovered herself and proceeded thus in all this distress the mother supports her spirits in a surprising manner the danger of her son sits heaviest upon her and yet she endeavors as much as possible to conceal even this concern on her husbands account her grief however sometimes gets the better of all her endeavors for she was always extravagantly fond of this boy and a most sensible sweettempered creature it is i protest never was i more affected in my life than when i heard the little wretch who is hardly yet seven years old while his mother was wetting him with her tears beg her to be comforted  indeed mamma cried the child i shall not die god almighty i am sure wont take tommy away let heaven be ever so fine a place i had rather stay here and starve with you and my papa than go to it  pardon me gentlemen i cannot help it saus she wiping her eyes such sensibility and affection in a child  and yet perhaps he is least the object of pity for a day or two will most probably place him beyond the reach of all human evils the father is indeed most worthy of compassion poor man his countenance is the very picture of horror and he looks rather like one dead than alive oh heavens what a scene did i behold at my first coming into the room the good creature was lying behind the bolster supporting at once both his child and his wife he had nothing on but a thin waistcoat for his coat was spread over the bed to supply the want of blankets  when he rose up at my entrance i scarce knew him as comely a man mr jones within this fortnight as you ever beheld mr nightingle had seen him his eyes sunk his face pale with a long beard his body shivering with cold and worn with hunger too for my cousin says she can hardly prevail upon him to eat  he told me himself in a whisper  he told me  i cannot repeat it  he said he could not bear to eat the bread his children wanted and yet can you believe it gentlemen in all this misery his wife has as good a cawdle as if she lay in in the midst of the greatest affluence i tasted it and i scarce ever tasted better  the means of procuring her this he said he believed was sent him by an angel from heaven i know not what he meant for i had not spirits enough to ask a single question  this was a lovematch as they call it on both sides that is a match between two beggars i must indeed say i never saw a fonder couple but what is their fondness good for but to torment each other indeed mamma cries nancy i have always looked on my cousin anderson for that was her name as one of the happiest of women i am sure says mrs miller the case at present is much otherwise for any one might have discerned that the tender consideration of each others sufferings makes the most intolerable part of their calamity both to the husband and the wife compared to which hunger and cold as they affect their own persons only are scarce evils nay the very children the youngest which is not two years old excepted feel in the same manner for they are a most loving family and if they had but a bare competency would be the happiest people in the world i never saw the least sign of misery at her house replied nancy i am sure my heart bleeds for what you now tell me  o child answered the mother she has always endeavored to make the best of every thing they have always been in great distress but indeed this absolute ruin has been brought upon them by others the poor man was bail for the villain his brother and about a week ago the very day before her lyingin their goods were all carried away and sold by an execution he sent a letter to me of it by one of the bailiffs which the villain never delivered  what must he think of my suffering a week to pass before he heard of me  it was not with dry eyes that jones heard this narrative when it was ended he took mrs miller apart with him into another room and delivering her his purse in which was the sum of  0 l desired her to send as much of it as she thought proper to these poor people the look which mrs miller gave jones on this occasion is not easy to be described she burst into a kind of agony of transport and cried out  good heavens is there such a man in the world  but recollecting herself she said indeed i know one such but can there be another i hope madam cries jones there are many who have common humanity for to relieve such distresses in our fellow creatures can hardly be called more mrs miller then took ten guineas which were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept and said she would find some means of conveying them the next morning adding that she had herself done some little matter for the poor people and had not left them in quite so much misery as she found them  they then returned to the parlour where nightingale expressed much concern at the dreadful situation of these wretches whom indeed he knew for he had seen them more than once at mrs millers he inveighed against the folly of making ones self liable for the debts of others vented many bitter execrations against the brother and concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate family suppose madam said he you should recommend them to mr allworthy or what think you of a collection i will give them a guinea with all my heart  mrs miller made no answer and nancy to whom her mother had whispered the generosity of jones turned pale upon the occasion though if either of them was angry with nightingale it was surely without reason for the liberality of jones  he had known it was not an example which he had any obligation to follow and there are thousands who would not have contributed a single halfpenny as indeed he did not in effect for he made no tender of any thing and therefore as the others thought proper to make no demand he kept his money in his pocket  i have in truth observed and shall never have a better opportunity than at present to communicate my observation that the world are in general divided into two opinions concerning charity which are he very reverse of each other one party seems to old that all acts of this kind are to be esteemed as oluntary gifts and however little you give if ineed no more than your good wishes you acquire a reat degree of merit in so doing  others on the ontrary appear to be as firmly persuaded that beeficence is a positive duty and that whenever the ich fall greatly short of their ability in relieving the distresses of the poor their pitiful largesses are so r from being meritorious that they have only perormed their duty by halves and are in some sense more contemptible than those who have entirely nelected it  to reconcile these different opinions is not in my power i shall only add that the givers are generally of the former sentiment and the receivers are almost universally inclined to the latter  chap ix which treats of matters of a very different kind from those in the preceding chapter in the evening jones met his lady again and a long conversation again ensued between them but as it consisted only of the same ordinary occurrences as before we shall avoid mentioning particulars which we despair of rendering agreeable to the reader unless he is one whose devotion to the fair sex like that of the papists to their saints wants to be raised by the help of pictures but i am so far from desiring to exhibit such pictures to the public that i would wish to draw a curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain french novels very bungling copies of which have been presented us here under the name of translations  jones grew still more and more impatient to see sophia and finding after repeated interviews with lady bellaston no likelihood of obtaining this by her means for on the contrary the lady began to treat even the mention of the name of sophia with resentment he resolved to try some other method he made no doubt but that lady bellaston knew where his angel was so he thought it most likely that some of her servants should be acquainted with the same secret partridge therefore was employed to get acquainted with those servants in order to fish this secret out of them  few situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor master was at present reduced for besides the difficulties he met with in discovering sophia besides the fears he had of having disobliged er and the assurances he had received from the lady bellaston of the resolution which sophia had taken against him and of her having purposely concealed herself from him which he had sufficient reason to believe might be true he had still a difficulty to combat which it was not in the power of his mistress to remove however kind her inclination might have been this was the exposing of her to be disinherited of all her fathers estate the almost inevitable consequence of their coming together without a consent which he had no hopes of ever obtaining  add to all these the many obligations which lady bellaston whose violent fondness we can no longer conceal had heaped upon him so that by her means he was now become one of the best dressed men about town and was not only relieved from those ridiculous distresses we have before mentioned but was actually raised to a state of affluence beyond what he had ever known  now though there are many gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their consciences to possess themselves of the whole fortune of a woman without making her any kind of return yet to a mind the roprietor of which does not deserve to be hanged nothing is i believe more irksome than to support love with gratitude only especially where inclinaion pulls the heart a contrary way such was the unhappy case of jones for though the virtuous love which he bore to sophia and which left very little affection for any other woman had been entirely out of the question he could never have been able to ave made an adequate return to the generous pasion of this lady who had indeed been once an obect of desire but was now entered at least into the autumn of life though she wore all the gayety of youth both in her dress and manner nay she contrived still to maintain the roses in her cheeks but these like flowers forced out of season by art had none of that lively blooming freshness with which nature at the proper time bedecks her own productions she had besides a certain imperfection which renders some flowers though very beautiful to the eye very improper to be placed in a wilderness of sweets and what above all others is most disagreeable to the breath of love  though jones saw all these discouragements on the one side he felt his obligations full as strongly on the other nor did he less plainly discern the ardent passion whence these obligations proceeded the extreme violence of which if he failed to equal he well knew the lady would think him ungrateful and what is worse he would have thought himself so he knew the tacit consideration upon which all her favors were conferred and as his necessity obliged him to accept them so his honor he concluded forced him to pay the price this therefore he resolved to do whatever misery it cost him and to devote himself to her from that great principle of justice by which the laws of some countries oblige a debtor who is no otherwise capable of discharging his debt to become the slave of his creditor  while he was meditating on these matters he received the following note from the lady  a very foolish but a very perverse accident has happened since our last meeting which makes it improper i should see you any more at the usual place i will if possible contrive some other place by tomorrow in the mean time adieu  this disappointment perhaps the reader may conclude was not very great but if it was he was quickly relieved for in less than an hour afterward another note was brought him from the same hand which contained as follows  i have altered my mind since i wrote a change which if you are no stranger to the tenderest of all passions you will not wonder at i am now resolved to see you this evening at my own house whatever may be the consequence come to me exactly at seven i dine abroad but will be at home by that time a day i find to those that sincerely love seems longer than i imagined  if you should accidentally be a few moments before me bid them show you into the drawing room  to confess the truth jones was less pleased with this last epistle than he had been with the former as he was prevented by it from complying with the earnest entreaties of mr nightingale with whom he had now contracted much intimacy and friendship these entreaties were to go with that young gentleman and his company to a new play which was to be acted that evening and which a very large party had agreed to damn from some dislike they had taken to the author who was a friend to one of mr nightingales acquaintance and this sort of funn our hero we are ashamed to confess would willingly have preferred to the above kind appointment but his honor got the better of his inclination  before we attend him to this intended interview with the lady we think proper to account for both the preceding notes as the reader may possibly be not a little surprised at the imprudence of lady bellaston in bringing her lover to the very house where her rival was lodged  first then the mistress of the house where these lovers had hitherto met and who had been for some years a pensioner to that lady was now become a methodist and had that very morning waited upon her ladyship and after rebuking her severely for her past life had positively declared that she would on no account be instrumental in carrying on any of her affairs for the future  the hurry of spirits into which this accident threw the lady made her despair of possibly finding any other convenience to meet jones that evening but as she began a little to recover from her uneasiness at the disappointment she set her thoughts to work when luckily it came into her head to propose to sophia to go to the play which was immediately consented to and a proper lady provided for her companion mrs honor was likewise dispatched with mrs etoff on the same errand of pleasure and thus her own house was left free for the safe reception of mr jones with whom she promised herself two or three hours of uninterrupted conversation after her return from the place where she dined which was at a friends house in a pretty distant part of the town near her old place of assignation where she had engaged herself before she was well apprized of the revolution that had happened in the mind and morals of her late confidante  chap x a chapter which though short may draw tears from some eyes mr jones was just dressed to wait on lady bellaston when mrs miller rappd at his door and being admitted very earnestly desired his company below stairs to drink tea in the parlour  upon his entrance into the room she presently introduced a person to him saying this sir is my cousin who has been so greatly beholden to your goodness for which he begs to return you his sincerest thanks  the man had scarce entered upon that speech which mrs miller had so kindly prefaced when both jones and he looking steadfastly at each other showed at once the utmost tokens of surprise the voice of the latter began instantly to faulter and instead of finishing his speech he sunk down into a chair crying it is so i am convinced it is so  bless me what is the meaning of this cries mrs miller you are not ill i hope cousin some water a dram this instant  be not frighted madam cries jones i have almost as much need of a dram as your cousin we are equally surprised at this unexpected meeting your cousin is an acquaintance of mine mrs miller  an acquaintance cries the man  oh heaven  ay an acquaintance repeated jones and an honored acquaintance too when i do not love and honor the man who dares venture every thing to preserve his wife and children from instant destruction may i have a friend capable of disowning me in adversity  o you are an excellent young man cries mrs miller  yes indeed poor creature he has ventured every thing  if he had not had one of the best of constitutions it must have killed him  cousin cries the man who had now pretty well recovered himself this is the angel from heaven whom i meant this is he to whom before i saw you i owed the preservation of my peggy he it was to whose generosity every comfort every support which i have procured for her was owing he is indeed the worthiest bravest noblest of all human beings o cousin i have obligations to this gentleman of such a nature  mention nothing of obligations cries jones eagerly not a word i insist upon it not a word meaning i suppose that he would not have him betray the affair of the robbery to any person  if by the trifle you have received from me i have preserved a whole family sure pleasure was never bought so cheap  o sir cries the man i wish you could this instant see my house if any person had ever a right to the pleasure you mention i am convinced it is yourself my cousin tells me she acquainted you with the distress in which she found us that sir is all greatly removed and chiefly by your goodness  my children have now a bed to lie on  and they have  they have  eternal blessings reward you for it  they have bread to eat my little boy is recovered my wife is out of danger and i am happy all all owing to you sir and to my cousin here one of the best of women indeed sir i must see you at my house  indeed my wife must see you and thank you  my children too must express their gratitude  indeed sir they are not without a sense of their obligation but what is my feeling when i reflect to whom i owe that they are now capable of expressing their gratitude  oh sir the little hearts which you have warmed had now been cold as ice without your assistance    here jones attempted to prevent the poor man from proceeding but indeed the overflowing of his own heart would of itself have stopped his words and now mrs miller likewise began to pour forth thanksgivings as well in her own name as in that of her cousin and concluded with saying she doubted not but such goodness would meet a glorious reward  jones answered he had been sufficiently rewarded already your cousins account madam said he has given me a sensation more pleasing than i have ever known he must be a wretch who is unmoved at hearing such a story how transporting then must be the thought of having happily acted a part in this scene if there are men who cannot feel the delight of giving happiness to others i sincerely pity them as they are incapable of tasting what is in my opinion a greater honor a higher interest and a sweeter pleasure than the ambitious the avaritious or the voluptuous man can ever obtain  the hour of appointment being now come jones was forced to take a hasty leave but not before he had heartily shaken his friend by the hand and desired to see him again as soon as possible promising that he would himself take the first opportunity of visiting him at his own house he then stepped into his chair and proceeded to lady bellastons greatly exulting in the happiness which he had procured to this poor family nor could he forbear reflecting without horror on the dreadful consequences which must have attended them had he listened rather to the voice of strict justice than to that of mercy when he was attacked on the high road  mrs miller sung forth the praises of jones during the whole evening in which mr enderson while he stayed so passionately accompanied her that he was often on the very point of mentioning the circumstances of the robbery however he luckily recalled himself and avoided an indiscretion which would have been so much the greater as he knew mrs miller to be extremely strict and nice in her principles he was likewise well apprised of the loquacity of this lady and yet such was his gratitude that it had almost got the better both of discretion and shame and made him publish that which would have defamed his own character rather than omit any circumstances which might do the fullest honor to his benefactor  chap xi in which the reader will be surprised mr jones was rather earlier than the time appointed and earlier than the lady whose arrival was hindered not only by the distance of the place where she dined but by some other cross accidents very vexatious to one in her situation of mind he was accordingly shown into the drawing room where he had not been many minutes before the door opened and in came  no other than sophia herself who had left the play before the end of the first act for this as we have already said being a new play at which two large parties met the one to damn and the other to applaud a violent uproar and an engagement between the two parties had so terrified our heroine that she was glad to put herself under the protection of a young gentleman who safely conveyed her to her chair  as lady bellaston had acquainted her that she should not be at home till late sophia expecting to find no one in the room came hastily in and went directly to a glass which almost fronted her without once looking toward the upper end of the room where the statue of jones now stood motionless  in this glass it was after contemplating her own lovely face that she first discovered the said statue when instantly turning about she perceived the reality of the vision upon which she gave a violent scream and scarce preserved herself from fainting till jones was able to move to her and support her in his arms  to paint the looks or thoughts of either of these lovers is beyond my power as their sensations from their mutual silence may be judged to have been too big for their utterance it cannot be supposed that i should be able to express them and the misfortune is that few of my readers have been enough in love to feel by their own hearts what past at this time in theirs  after a short pause jones with faultering accents said  i see madam you are surprised  surprized answered she oh heavens indeed i am surprised i almost doubt whether you are the person you seem indeed cries he my sophia pardon me madam for this once calling you so i am that very wretched jones whom fortune after so many disappointments has at last kindly conducted to you oh my sophia did you know the thousand torments i have suffered in this long fruitless pursuit  pursuit of whom said sophia a little recollecting herself and assuming a reserved air  can you be so cruel to ask that question cries jones need i say of you of me answered sophia hath mr jones then any such important business with me to some madam cries jones this might seem an important business giving her the pocketbook i hope madam you will find it of the same value as when it was lost sophia took the pocketbook and was going to speak when he interrupted her thus  let us not i beseech you lose one of these precious moments which fortune has so kindly sent us  o my sophia i have business of a much superior kind  thus on my knees let me ask your pardon  my pardon cries she  sure sir after what is past you cannot expect after what i have heard  i scarce know what i say answered jones by heavens i scarce wish you should pardon me o my sophia henceforth never cast away a thought on such a wretch as i am if any remembrance of me should ever intrude to give a moments uneasiness to that tender bosom think of my unworthiness and let the remembrance of what past at upton blot me for ever from your mind   sophia stood trembling all this while her face was whiter than snow and her heart was throbbing through her stays but at the mention of upton a blush arose in her cheeks and her eyes which before she had scarce lifted up were turned upon jones with a glance of disdain he understood this silent reproach and replied to it thus o my sophia my only love you cannot hate or despise me more for what happened there than i do myself but yet do me the justice to think that my heart was never unfaithful to you that had no share in the folly i was guilty of it was even then unalterably yours though i despaired of possessing you nay almost of ever seeing you more i doated still on your charming idea and could seriously love no other woman but if my heart had not been engaged she into whose company i accidentally fell at that cursed place was not an object of serious love believe me my angel i never have seen her from that day to this and never intend or desired to see her again sophia in her heart was very glad to hear this but forcing into her face an air of more coldness than she yet had assumed why said she mr jones do you take the trouble to make a defense where you are not accused if i thought it worth while to accuse you i have a charge of an unpardonable nature indeed what is it for heavens sake answered jones trembling and pale expecting to hear of his amor with lady bellaston oh said she how is it possible can every thing noble and every thing base be lodged together in the same bosom lady bellaston and the ignominious circumstance of having been kept rose again in his mind and stopped his mouth from any reply could i have expected proceeded sophia such treatment from you nay from any gentleman from any man of honor to have my name traduced in public in inns among the meanest vulgar to have any little favors that my unguarded heart may have too lightly betrayed me to grant boasted of there nay even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my love nothing could equal joness surprise at these words of sophia but yet not being guilty he was much less embarrassed how to defend himself than if she had touched that tender string at which his conscience had been alarmed by some examination he presently found that her supposing him guilty of so shocking an outrage against his love and her reputation was entirely owing to partridges talk at the inns before landlords and servants for sophia confessed to him it was from them that she received her intelligence he had no very great difficulty to make her believe that he was entirely innocent of an offense so foreign to his character but she had a great deal to hinder him from going instantly home and putting partridge to death which he more than once swore he would do this point being cleared up they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other that jones quite forgot he had begun the conversation with conjuring her to give up all thoughts of him and she was in a temper to have given ear to a petition of a very different nature for before they were aware they had both gone so far that he let fall some words that sounded like a proposal of marriage to which she replied that did not her duty to her father forbid her to follow her own inclinations ruin with him would be more welcome to her than the most affluent fortune with another man at the mention of the word ruin he started let drop her hand which he had held for some time and striking his breast with his own cried out oh sophia can i then ruin thee no by heavens no i never will act so base a part dearest sophia whatever it costs me i will renounce you i will give you up i will tear all such hopes from my heart as are inconsistent with your real good my love i will ever retain but it shall be in silence it shall be at a distance from you it shall be in some foreign land from whence no voice no sigh of my despair shall ever reach and disturb your ears and when i am dead  he would have gone on but was stopped by a flood of tears which sophia let fall in his bosom upon which she leaned without being able to speak one word he kissed them off which for some moments she allowed him to do without any resistance but then recollecting herself gently withdrew out of his arms and to turn the discourse from a subject too tender and which she found she could not support bethought herself to ask him a question she had never had time to put to him before how he came into that room he begun to stammer and would in all probability have raised her suspicions by the answer he was going to give when at once the door opened and in came lady bellaston  having advanced a few steps and seeing jones and sophia together she suddenly stopped when after a pause of a few moments recollecting herself with admirable presence of mind she said  though with sufficient indications of surprise both in voice and countenance  i thought miss western you had been at the play  though sophia had had no opportunity of learning of jones by what means he had discovered her yet as she had not the least suspicion of the real truth or that jones and lady bellaston were acquainted so she was very little confounded and the less as the lady had in all their conversations on the subject entirely taken her side against her father with very little hesitation therefore she went through the whole story of what had happened at the playhouse and the cause of her hasty return  the length of this narrative gave lady bellaston an opportunity of rallying her spirits and of considering in what manner to act and as the behavior of sophia gave her hopes that jones had not betrayed her she put on an air of good humor and said i should not have broke in so abruptly upon you miss western if i had known you had company  lady bellaston fixed her eyes on sophia whilst she spoke these words to which that poor young lady having her face overspread with blushes and confusion answered in a stammering voice i am sure madam i shall always think the honor of your ladyships company  i hope at least cries lady bellaston i interrupt no business  no madam answered sophia our business was at an end your ladyship may be pleased to remember i have often mentioned the loss of my pocketbook which this gentleman having very luckily found was so kind to return to me with the bill in it  jones ever since the arrival of lady bellaston had been ready to sink with fear he sat kicking his heels playing with his fingers and looking more like a fool if it be possible than a young boody squire when he is first introduced into a polite assembly he began however now to recover himself and taking a hint from the behavior of lady bellaston who he saw did not intend to claim any acquaintance with him he resolved as entirely to affect the stranger on his part he said ever since he had had the pocketbook in his possession he had used great diligence in enquiring out the lady whose name was writ in it but never till that day could be so fortunate to discover her  sophia had indeed mentioned the loss of her pocketbook to lady bellaston but as jones for some reason or other had never once hinted to her that it was in his possession she believed not one syllable of what sophia now said and wonderfully admired the extreme quickness of the young lady in inventing such an excuse the reason of sophias leaving the playhouse met with no better credit and though she could not account for the meeting between these two lovers she was firmly persuaded it was not accidental  with an affected smile therefore she said  indeed miss western you have had very good luck in recovering your money not only as it fell into the hands of a gentleman of honor but as he happened to discover to whom it belonged i think you would not consent to have it advertised  it was great good fortune sir that you found out to whom the note belonged  o madam cries jones it was enclosed in a pocketbook in which the young ladys name was written  that was very fortunate indeed cries the lady  and it was no less so that you heard miss western was at my house for she is very little known  jones had at length perfectly recovered his spirits and as he conceived he had now an opportunity of satisfying sophia as to the question she had asked him just before lady bellaston came in he proceeded thus why madam answered he it was by the luckiest chance imaginable i made this discovery i was mentioning what i had found and the name of the owner the other night to a lady at the masquerade who told me she believed she knew where i might see miss western and if i would come to her house the next morning she would inform me i went according to her appointment but she was not at home nor could i ever meet with her till this morning when she directed me to your ladyships house i came accordingly and did myself the honor to ask for your ladyship and upon my saying that i had very particular business a servant showed me into this room where i had not been long before the young lady returned from the play  upon his mentioning the masquerade he looked very slyly at lady bellaston without any fear of being remarked by sophia for she was visibly too much confounded to make any observations this hint a little alarmed the lady and she was silent when jones who saw the agitations of sophias mind resolved to take the only method of relieving her which was by retiring but before he did this he said i believe madam it is customary to give some reward on these occasions  i must insist on a very high one for my honesty  it is madam no less than the honor of being permitted to pay another visit here  sir replied the lady i make no doubt that you are a gentleman and my doors are never shut to people of fashion  jones then after proper ceremonials departed highly to his own satisfaction and no less to that of sophia who was terribly alarmed lest lady bellaston should discover what she knew already but too well  upon the stairs jones met his old acquaintance mrs honor who notwithstanding all she had said against him was now so wellbred to behave with great civility this meeting proved indeed a lucky circumstance as he communicated to her the house where he lodged with which sophia was unacquainted  chap xii in which the thirteenth book is concluded the elegant lord shaftsbury somewhere objects to telling too much truth by which it may be fairly inferred that in some cases to lie is not only excusable but commendable  and surely there are no persons who may so properly challenge a right to this commendable deviation from truth as young women in the affair of love for which they may plead precept education and above all the sanction nay i may say the necessity of custom by which they are restrained not from submitting to the honest impulses of nature for that would be a foolish prohibition but from owning them  we are not therefore ashamed to say that our heroine now pursued the dictates of the abovementioned right honorable philosopher as she was perfectly satisfied then that lady bellaston was ignorant of the person of jones so she determined to keep her in that ignorance though at the expense of a little fibbing  jones had not been long gone before lady bellaston cried upon my word a good pretty young fellow i wonder who he is for i dont remember ever to have seen his face before  nor i neither madam cries sophia i must say he behaved very handsomely in relation to my note  yes and he is a very handsome fellow said the lady dont you think so  i did not take much notice of him answered sophia but i thought he seemed rather awkward and ungenteel than otherwise  you are extremely right cries lady bellaston you may see by his manner that he has not kept good company nay notwithstanding his returning your note and refusing the reward i almost question whether he is a gentleman  i have always observed there is a something in persons wellborn which others can never acquire  i think i will give orders not to be at home to him  nay sure madam answered sophia one cannot suspect after what he has done  besides if your ladyship observed him there was an elegance in his discourse a delicacy a prettiness of expression that that    i confess said lady bellaston the fellow has words  and indeed sophia you must forgive me indeed you must  i forgive your ladyship said sophia  yes indeed you must answered she laughing for i had a horrible suspicion when i first came into the room  i vow you must forgive it but i suspected it was mr jones himself  did your ladyship indeed cries sophia blushing and affecting a laugh  yes i vow i did answered she i cannot imagine what put it into my head for give the fellow his due he was genteelly dressed which i think dear sophy is not commonly the case with your friend  this raillery cries sophia is a little cruel lady bellaston after my promise to your ladyship  not at all child said the lady  it would have been cruel before but after you have promised me never to marry without your fathers consent in which you know is implied your giving up jones sure you can bear a little raillery on a passion which was pardonable enough in a young girl in the country and of which you tell me you have so entirely got the better what must i think my dear sophy if you cannot bear a little ridicule even on his dress i shall begin to fear you are very far gone indeed and almost question whether you have dealt ingenuously with me  indeed madam cries sophia your ladyship mistakes me if you imagine i had any concern on his account  on his account answered the lady you must have mistaken me i went no farther than his dress  for i would not injure your taste by any other comparison  i dont imagine my dear sophy if your mr jones had been such a fellow as this    i thought says sophia your ladyship had allowed him to be handsome    whom pray cried the lady hastily  mr jones answered sophia  and immediately recollecting herself mr jones  no no i ask your pardon  i mean the gentleman who was just now here  o sophy sophy cries the lady this mr jones i am afraid still runs in your head  then upon my honor madam said sophia mr jones is as entirely indifferent to me as the gentleman who just now left us  upon my honor said lady bellaston i believe it forgive me therefore a little innocent raillery but i promise you i will never mention his name any more  and now the two ladies separated infinitely more to the delight of sophia than of lady bellaston who would willingly have tormented her rival a little longer had not business of more importance called her away as for sophia her mind was not perfectly easy under this first practice of deceit upon which when she retired to her chamber she reflected with the highest uneasiness and conscious shame nor could the peculiar hardship of her situation and the necessity of the case at all reconcile her conduct to her mind the frame of which was too delicate to bear the thought of having been guilty of a falsehood however qualified by circumstances nor did this thought once suffer her to close her eyes during the whole succeeding night  the history of a foundling book xiv containing two days chap i an essay to prove that an author will write the better for having some knowledge of the subject on which he writes as several gentlemen in these times by the wonderful force of genius only without the least assistance of learning perhaps without being well able to read have made a considerable figure in the republic of letters the modern critics i am told have lately begun to assert that all kind of learning is entirely useless to a writer and indeed no other than a kind of fetters on the natural spriteliness and activity on the imaginations which is thus weighed down and prevented from soaring to those high flights which otherwise it would be able to reach  this doctrine i am afraid is at present carried much too far for why should writing differ so much from all other arts the nimbleness of a dancing master is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move nor does any mechanic i believe exercise his tools the worse by knowing how to use them for my own part i cannot conceive that homer or virgil would have writ with more fire if instead of being masters of all the learning of their times they had really been as ignorant as most of the authors of the present age nor do i believe that all the imagination fire and judgment of pit could have produced those orations that have made the senate of england in these our times a rival in eloquence to greece and rome if he had not been so well read in the writings of demosthenes and cicero as to have transfused their whole spirit into his speeches and with their spirit their knowledge too  i would not here be understood to insist on the same fund of learning in any of my brethren as cicero persuades us is necessary to the composition of an orator on the contrary very little reading is i conceive necessary to the poet less to the critic and the least of all to the politician for the first perhaps bysses art of poetry and a few of our modern poets may suffice for the second a moderate heap of plays and for the last an indifferent collection of political journals  to say the truth i require no more than that a man should have some little knowledge of the subject on which he treats according to the old maxim of law quam quisque norit artem in ea se exerceat with this alone a writer may sometimes do tolerably well and indeed without this all the other learning in the world will stand him in little stead  for instance let us suppose that homer and virgil aristotle and cicero thucydides and livy could have met all together and have clubbed their several talents to have composed a treatise on the art of dancing i believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent treatise which mr essex has given us on that subject entitled the rudiments of genteel education and indeed should the excellent mr broughton be prevailed on to set fist to paper and to complete the abovesaid rudiments by delivering down the true principles of athletics i question whether the world will have any cause to lament that none of the great writers either ancient or modern have ever treated about that noble and useful art  to avoid a multiplicity of examples in so plain a case and to come at once to my point i am apt to conceive that one reason why many english writers have totally failed in describing the manners of upper life may possibly be that in reality they know nothing of it  this is a knowledge unhappily not in the power of many authors to arrive at books will give us a very imperfect idea of it nor will the stage a much better the fine gentleman formed upon reading the former will almost always turn out a pedant and he who forms himself upon the latter a coxcomb  nor are the characters drawn from these models better supported vanbrugh and congreve copied nature but they who copy them draw as unlike the present age as hogarth would do if he was to paint a rout or a drum in the dresses of titian and of vandyke in short imitation here will not do the business the picture must be after nature herself a true knowledge of the world is gained only by conversation and the manners of every rank must be seen in order to be known  now it happens that this higher order of mortals is not to be seen like all the rest of the human species for nothing in the streets shops and coffeehouses nor are they shown like the upper rank of animals for so much apiece in short this is a sight to which no persons are admitted without one or other of these qualifications viz either birth or fortune or what is equivalent to both the honorable profession of a gamester and very unluckily for the world persons so qualified very seldom care to take upon themselves the bad trade of writing which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer sort as it is a trade which many think requires no kind of stock to set up with  hence those strange monsters in lace and embroidery in silks and brocades with vast wigs and hoops which under the name of lords and ladies strut the stage to the great delight of attorneys and their clerks in the pit and of citizens and their apprentices in the galleries and which are no more to be found in real life than the centaur the chimera or any other creature of mere fiction but to let my reader into a secret this knowledge of upper life though very necessary for the preventing mistakes is no very great resource to a writer whose province is comedy or that kind of novels which like this i am writing is of the comic class  what mr pope says of women is very applicable to most in this station who are indeed so entirely made up of form and affection that they have no character at all at least none which appears i will venture to say the highest life is much the dullest and affords very little humor or entertainment the various callings in lower spheres produce the great variety of humorous characters whereas here except among the few who are engaged in the pursuit of ambition and the fewer still who have a relish for pleasure all is vanity and servile imitation dressing and cards eating and drinking bowing and curtesying make up the business of their lives  some there are however of this rank upon whom passion exercises its tyranny and hurries them far beyond the bounds which decorum prescribes of these the ladies are as much distinguished by their noble intrepidity and a certain superior contempt of reputation from the frail ones of meaner degree as a virtuous woman of quality is by the elegance and delicacy of her sentiments from the honest wife of a yeoman or shopkeeper lady bellaston was of this intrepid character but let not my country readers conclude from her that this is the general conduct of women of fashion or that we mean to represent them as such they might as well suppose that every clergyman was represented by thwackum or every soldier by ensign northerton  there is not indeed a greater error than that which universally prevails among the vulgar who borrowing their opinion from some ignorant satyrists have affixed the character of lewdness to these times on the contrary i am convinced there never was less of love intrigue carried on among persons of condition than now our present women have been taught by their mothers to fix their thoughts only on ambition and vanity and to despise the pleasures of love as unworthy their regard and being afterward by the care of such mothers married without having husbands they seem pretty well confirmed in the justness of those sentiments whence they content themselves for the dull remainder of life with the pursuit of more innocent but i am afraid more childish amusements the bare mention of which would ill suit with the dignity of this history in my humble opinion the true characteristick of the present beau monde is rather folly than vice and the only epithet which it deserves is that of frivolous  chap ii containing letters and other matters which attend amors jones had not long been at home before he received the following letter  i was never more surprised than when i found you was gone when you left the room i little imagined you intended to have left the house without seeing me again your behavior is all of a piece and convinces me how much i ought to despise a heart which can dote upon an idiot though i know not whether i should not admire her cunning more than her simplicity wonderful both for though she understood not a word of what passed between us she yet had the skill the assurance the  what shall i call it to deny to my face that she knows you or ever saw you before  was this a scheme laid between you and have you been base enough to betray me  o how i despise her you and all the world but chiefly myself for  i dare not write what i should afterward run mad to read but remember i can detest as violently as i have loved   jones had but little time given him to reflect on his letter before a second was brought him from e same hand and this likewise we shall set down n the precise words  when you consider the hurry of spirits in which i must have writ you cannot be surprised at any expressions in my former note  yet perhaps on reflection they were rather too warm at least i would if possible think all owing to the odious playhouse and to the impertinence of fool which detained me beyond my appointmen  how easy is it to think well of those w love  perhaps you desire i should think so i have resolved to see you to night so come to m immediately  p s i have ordered to be at home to none b yourself  p s mr jones will imagine i shall assist hi in his defense for i believe he cannot desir to impose on me more than i desire to impo on myself  p s come immediately     to the men of intrigue i refer the determination whether the angry or the tender letter gave the greatest uneasiness to jones certain it is he ha no violent inclination to pay more visits that evening unless to one single person however he though his honor engaged and had not this been moti sufficient he would not have ventured to blow the temper of lady bellaston into that flame of which he had reason to think it susceptible and of which he feared the consequence might be a discovery  sophia which he dreaded after some disconten walks therefore about the room he was prepari to depart when the lady kindly prevented him n by another letter but by her own presence s entered the room very disordered in her dress a very discomposed in her looks and threw herself i to a chair where having recovered her breath s said  you see sir when women have go one length too far they will stop at none if a person would have sworn this to me a week ag i would not have believed it of myself i hop madam said jones my charming lady bellaston will be as difficult to believe any thing against o who is so sensible of the many obligations she ha conferred upon him  indeed says she sensible of obligations did i expect to hear such cold language from mr jones pardon me my dear angel said he if after the letters i have received the terrors of your anger though i know not how i have deserved it  and have i then says she with a smile so angry a countenance  have i really brought a chiding face with me  if there be honor in man said he i have done nothing to merit your anger  you remember the appointment you sent me  i went in pursuance  i beseech you cried she do not run through the odious recital  answer me but one question and i shall be easy  have you not betrayed my honor to her  jones fell upon his knees and began to utter the most violent protestations when partridge came dancing and capering into the room like one drunk with joy crying out shes found she is found  here sir here she is here  mrs honor is upon the stairs stop her a moment cries jones  here madam step behind the bed i have no other room nor closet nor place on earth to hide you in sure never was so damned an accident  d  nd indeed said the lady as she went to her place of concealment and presently afterward in came mrs honor hey day says she mr jones what is the matter  that impudent rascal your servant would scarce let me come up stairs i hope he has not the same reason now to keep me from you as he had at upton  i suppose you hardly expected to see me but you have certainly bewitched my lady poor dear young lady to be sure i loves her as tenderly as if she was my own sister lord have mercy upon you if you dont make her a good husband and to be sure if you do not nothing can be bad enough for you jones begged her only to whisper for that there was a lady dying in the next room a lady cries she ay i suppose one of your ladies  o mr jones there are too many of them in the world i believe we are got into the house of one for my lady bellaston i dare to say is no better than she should be  hush hush cries jones every word is overheard in the next room i dont care a farthing cries honor i speaks no scandal of any one but to be sure the servants makes no scruple of saying as how her ladyship meets men at another place  where the house goes under the name of a poor gentlewoman but her ladyship pays the rent and manys the good thing besides they say she has of her  here jones after expressing the utmost uneasiness offered to stop her mouth  hey day why sure mr jones you will let me speak i speaks no scandal for i only says what i heard from others  and thinks i to myself much good may it do the gentlewoman with her riches if she comes by it in such a wicked manner to be sure it is better to be poor and honest the servants are villains cries jones and abuse their lady unjustly  ay to be sure servants are always villains and so my lady says and will not hear a word of it  no i am convinced says jones my sophia is above listening to such base scandal nay i believe it is no scandal neither cries honor for why should she meet men at another house  it can never be for any good for if she had a lawful design of being courted as to be sure any lady may lawfully give her company to men upon that account why where can be the sense  i protest cries jones i cannot hear all this of a lady of such honor and a relation of sophia besides you will distract the poor lady in the next room  let me entreat you to walk with me down stairs  nay sir you will not let me speak i have done  here sir is a letter from my young lady  what would some men give to have this but mr jones i think you are not over and above generous and yet i have heard some servants say but i am sure you will do me the justice to own i never saw the color of your money here jones hastily took the letter and presently after slipped five pieces into her hand he then returned a thousand thanks to his dear sophia in a whisper and begged her to leave him to read her letter she presently departed not without expressing much grateful sense of his generosity  lady bellaston now came from behind the curtain how shall i describe her rage her tongue was at first incapable of utterance but streams of fire darted from her eyes and well indeed they might for her heart was all in a flame and now as soon as her voice found way instead of expressing any indignation against honor or her own servants she began to attack poor jones you see said she what i have sacrificed to you my reputation my honor  gone for ever and what return have i found neglected slighted for a country girl for an idiot  what neglect madam or what slight cries jones have i been guilty of  mr jones said she it is in vain to dissemble if you will make me easy you must entirely give her up and as a proof of your intention show me the letter  what letter madam said jones nay surely said she you cannot have the confidence to deny your having received a letter by the hands of that trollop and can your ladyship cries he ask of me what i must part with my honor before i grant have i acted in such a manner by your ladyship could i be guilty of betraying this poor innocent girl to you what security could you have that i should not act the same part by yourself a moments reflection will i am sure convince you that a man with whom the secrets of a lady are not safe must be the most contemptible of wretches very well said she  i need not insist on your becoming this contemptible wretch in your own opinion for the inside of the letter could inform me of nothing more than i know already i see the footing you are upon  here ensued a long conversation which the reader who is not too curious will thank me for not inserting at length it shall suffice therefore to inform him that lady bellaston grew more and more pacified and at length believed or affected to believe his protestations that his meeting with sophia that evening was merely accidental and every other matter which the reader already knows and which as jones set before her in the strongest light it is plain that she had in reality no reason to be angry with him  she was not however in her heart perfectly satisfied with his refusal to show her the letter so dea are we to the clearest reason when it argues against our prevailing passions she was indeed well convinced that sophia possessed the first place in jones affections and yet haughty and amorous as this lady was she submitted at last to bear the second place or to express it more properly in a legal phrase wa contented with the possession of that of which another woman had the reversion  it was at length agreed that jones should for the future visit at the house for that sophia her mai and all the servants would place these visits to the account of sophia and that she herself would  considered as the person imposed upon  this scheme was contrived by the lady and highly relished by jones who was indeed glad to have prospect of seeing his sophia at any rate and the lady herself was not a little pleased with the imposition on sophia which jones she thought could not possibly discover to her for his own sake  the next day was appointed for the first visit and then after proper ceremonials the lady bellaston returned home  chap iii containing various matters jones was no sooner alone than he eagerly broke open his letter and read as follows  sir it is impossible to express what i have suffered since you left this house and as i have reason to think you intend coming here again i have sent honor though so late at night as she tells me she knows your lodgings to prevent you i charge you by all the regard you have for me not to think of visiting here for it will certainly be discovered nay i almost doubt from some things which have dropped from her ladyship that she is not already without some suspicion something favorable perhaps may happen we must wait with patience but i once more entreat you if you have any concern for my ease do not think of returning hither   this letter administered the same kind of consolation to poor jones which job formerly received from his friends besides disappointing all the hopes which he promised to himself from seeing sophia he was reduced to an unhappy dilemma with regard to lady bellaston for there are some certain engagements which as he well knew do very difficultly admit of any excuse for the failure and to go after the strict prohibition from sophia he was not to be forced by any human power at length after much deliberation which during that night supplied the place of sleep he determined to feign himself sick for this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed visit without incensing lady bellaston which he had more than one reason of desiring to avoid  the first thing however which he did in the morning was to write an answer to sophia which he enclosed in one to honor he then dispatched another to lady bellaston containing the abovementioned excuse and to this he soon received the following answer  i am vexed that i cannot see you here this afternoon but more concerned for the occasion take great care of yourself and have the best advice and i hope there will be no danger  i am so tormented all this morning with fools that i have scace a moments time to write to you adieu  p s i will endeavor to call on you this evening at nine  be sure to be alone     mr jones now received a visit from mrs miller who after some formal introduction began the following speech i am very sorry sir to wait upon you on such an occasion but i hope you will consider the ill consequence which it must be to the reputations of my poor girls if my house should once be talked of as a house of ill fame i hope you will not think me therefore guilty of impertinence if i beg you not to bring any more ladies in at th time of night the clock had struck two before one of them went away i do assure you madam said jones the lady who was here last night and who staid the latest for the other only brought me a letter is a woman of very great fashion and my near relation i dont know what fashion she is of answered mrs miller but i am sure  woman of virtue unless a very near relation indeed would visit a young gentleman at ten night and stay four hours in his room with him alone besides sir the behavior of her chairmen shows what she was for they did nothing but make jests all the evening in the entry and asked mr partridge in the hearing of my own maid if madam intended to stay with his master all night with a great deal of stuff not proper to be repeated i have really a great respect for you mr jones upon your own account nay i have a very high obligation to you for your generosity to my cousin indeed i did not know how very good you had been till lately little did i imagine to what dreadful courses the poor mans distress had driven him little did i think when you gave me the ten guineas that you had given them to a highwayman o heavens what goodness have you shown how have you preserved this family  the character which mr allworthy has formerly given me of you was i find strictly true  and indeed if i had no obligation to you my obligations to him are such that on his account i should show you the utmost respect in my power  nay believe me dear mr jones if my daughters and my own reputation were out of the case i should for your own sake be sorry that so pretty a young gentleman should converse with these women but if you are resolved to do it i must beg you to take another lodging for i do not myself like to have such things carried on under my roof but more especially upon the account of my girls who have little heaven knows besides their characters to recommend them jones started and changed color at the name of allworthy indeed mrs miller answered he a little warmly i do not take this at all kind i will never bring any slander on your house but i must insist on seeing what company i please in my own room and if that gives you any offense i shall as soon as i am able look for another lodging i am sorry we must part then sir said she but i am convinced mr allworthy himself would never come within my doors if he had the least suspicion of my keeping an ill house  very well madam said jones  i hope sir said she you are not angry for i would not for the world offend any of mr allworthys family i have not slept a wink all night about this matter  i am sorry i have disturbed your rest madam said jones but i beg you will send partridge up to me immediately which she promised to do and then with a very low courtesy retired  as soon as partridge arrived jones fell upon him in the most outrageous manner  how often said he am i to suffer for your folly or rather for my own in keeping you is that tongue of yours resolved upon my destruction  what have i done sir answered affrighted partridge who was it gave you authority to mention the story of the robbery or that the man you saw here was the person  i sir cries partridge now dont be guilty of a falsehood in denying it said jones  if i did mention such a matter answers partridge i am sure i thought no harm for i should not have opened my lips if it had not been to his own friends and relations who i imagined would have let it go no farther but i have a much heavier charge against you cries jones than this how durst you after all the precautions i give you mention the name of mr allworthy in this house partridge denied that he ever had with many oaths how else said jones should mrs miller be acquainted that there was any connection between him and me and it is but this moment she told me she respected me on his account  o lord sir said partridge i desire only to be heard out and to be sure never was any thing so unfortunate hear me but out and you will own how wrongfully you have accused me when mrs honor came down stairs last night she met me in the entry and asked me when my master had heard from mr allworthy and to be sure mrs miller heard the very words and the moment madam honor was gone she called me into the parlour to her mr partridge says she what mr allworthy is that the gentlewoman mentioned is it the great mr allworthy of somersetshire upon my word madam says i i know nothing of the matter  sure says she your master is not the mr jones i have heard mr allworthy talk of upon my word madam says i i know nothing of the matter  then says she turning to her daughter nancy says she as sure as ten pence this is the very young gentleman and he agrees exactly with the squires description the lord above knows who it was told her for i am the arrantest villain that ever walked upon two legs if ever it came out of my mouth  i promise you sir i can keep a secret when i am desired  nay sir so far was i from telling her any thing about mr allworthy that i told her the very direct contrary for though i did not contradict it at that moment yet as second thoughts they say are best so when i came to consider that some body must have informed her thinks i to myself i will put an end to the story and so i went back again into the parlour some time afterward and says i upon my word says i whoever says i told you that this gentleman was mr jones that is says i that this mr jones was that mr jones told you a confounded lie and i beg says i you will never mention any such matter says i for my master says i will think i must have told you so and i defy any body in the house ever to say i mentioned any such word to be certain sir it is a wonderful thing and i have been thinking with myself ever since how it was she came to know it not but i saw an old woman here the other day a begging at the door who looked as like her we saw in warwickshire that caused all that mischief to us to be sure it is never good to pass by an old woman without giving her something especially if she looks at you for all the world shall never persuade me but that they have a great power to do mischief and to be sure i shall never see at old woman again but i shall think to myself infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem  the simplicity of partridge set jones a laughing and put a final end to his anger which had indeed seldom any long duration in his mind and instead o commenting on his defense he told him he intende presently to leave those lodgings and ordered him t go and endeavor to get him others  chap iv which we hope will be very attentively perused i young people of both sexes partridge had no sooner left mr jones tha mr nightingale with whom he had now contracted a great intimacy came to him and after short salutation said so tom i hear you had company very late last night upon my soul you are a happy fellow who have not been in town above a fortnight and can keep chairs waiting at you door till two in the morning he then ran on wit much commonplace raillery of the same kind  jones at last interrupted him saying i suppos you have received all this information from m miller who has been up here a little while ago to give me warning the good woman is afraid it seems of the reputation of her daughters o she is wonderfully nice says nightingale upon that account if you remember she would not let nancy go with us to the masquerade nay upon my honor i think she is in the right of it says jones however i have taken her at her word and have sent partridge to look for another lodging if you will says nightingale we may i believe be again together for to tell you a secret which i desire you will not mention in the family i intend to quit the house today  what has mrs miller given you warning too my friend cries jones no answered the other but the rooms are not convenient enough  besides i am grown weary of this part of the town i want to be nearer the places of diversion so i am going to pallmall  and do you intend to make a secret of your going away said jones i promise you answered nightingale i dont intend to bilk my lodgings but i have a private reason for not taking a formal leave not so private answered jones i promise you i have seen it ever since the second day of my coming to the house  here will be some wet eyes on your departure  poor nancy i pity her faith  indeed jack you have played the fool with that girl  you have given her a longing which i am afraid nothing will ever cure her of  nightingale answered what the devil would you have me do would you have me marry her to cure her  no answered jones i would not have had you make love to her as you have often done in my presence i have been astonished at the blindness of her mother in never seeing i pugh see it cries nightingale what the devil should she see why see said jones that you have made her daughter distractedly in love with you the poor girl cannot conceal it a moment her eyes are never off from you and she always colors every time you come into the room indeed i pity her heartily for she seems to be one of the best natured and honestest of human creatures and so answered nightingale according to your doctrine one must not amuse ones self by any common gallantries with women for fear they should fall in love with us indeed jack said jones you wilfully misunderstand me i do not fancy women are so apt to fall in love but you have gone far beyond common gallantries  what do you suppose says nightingale that we have been a bed together no upon my honor answered jones very seriously i do not suppose so ill of you nay i will go farther i do not imagine you have laid a regular premeditated scheme for the destruction of the quiet of a poor little creature or have even foreseen the consequence for i am sure thou art a very goodnatured fellow and such a one can never be guilty of a cruelty of that kind but at the same time you have pleased your own vanity without considering that this poor girl was made a sacrifice to it and while you have had no design but of amusing an idle hour you have actually given her reason to flatter herself that you had the most serious designs in her favor prithee jack answer me honestly to what have tended all those elegant and luscious descriptions of happiness arising from violent and mutual fondness all those warm professions of tenderness and generous disinterested love did you imagine she would not apply them or speak ingenuously did not you intend she should upon my soul tom cries nightingale i did not think this was in thee thou will make an admirable parson  so i suppose you would not go to bed to nancy now if she would let you  no cries jones may i be d  nd if i would  tom tom answered nightingale last night remember last night    when every eye was closed and the pale moon and silent stars shone conscious of the theft lookee mr nightingale said jones i am no canting hypocrite nor do i pretend to the gift of chastity more than my neighbors i have been guilty with women i own it but am not conscious that i have ever injured any  nor would i to procure pleasure to myself be knowingly the cause of misery to any human being  well well said nightingale i believe you and i am convinced you acquit me of any such thing  i do from my heart answered jones of having debauched the girl but not from having gained her affections  if i have said nightingale i am sorry for it but time and absence will soon wear off such impressions it is a receipt i must take myself for to confess the truth to you  i never liked any girl half so much in my whole life but i must let you into the whole secret tom my father has provided a match for me with a woman i never saw and she is now coming to town in order for me to make my addresses to her  at these words jones burst into a loud fit of laughter when nightingale cried  nay prithee dont turn me into ridicule the devil take me if i am not half mad about this matter my poor nanny oh jones jones i wish i had  fortune in my own possession  i heartily wish you had cries jones for if th be the case i sincerely pity you both but surely you dont intend to go away without taking you leave of her  i would not answered nightingale undergo the pain of taking leave for ten thousand pound besides i am convinced instead of answering an good purpose it would only serve to inflame m poor nancy the more i beg therefore you would not mention a word of it to day and in the eveing or tomorrow morning i intend to deaprt  jones promised he would not and said upon reflection he thought as he had determined and w obliged to leave her he took the most prudent metho he then told nightingale he should be very glad  lodge in the same house with him and it was accordingly agreed between them that nightingale should procure him either the ground floor or the two p of stairs for the young gentleman himself was  occupy that which was between them  this nightingale of whom we shall be present obliged to say a little more was in the ordina transactions of life a man of strict honor an what is more rare among young gentlemen of t town one of strict honesty too yet in affairs  love he was somewhat looser in his morals not th he was even here as void of principle as gentlem sometimes are and oftener affect to be but it is certain he had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women and had in a certain mystery call making love practiced many deceits which if  had used in trade he would have been counted  greatest villain upon earth  but as the world i know not well for what reason agree to see this treachery in a better light  was so far from being ashamed of his iniquities of this kind that he gloried in them and would often boast of his skill in gaining of women and his triumphs over their hearts for which he had before this time received some rebukes from jones who always expressed great bitterness against any misbehaviour to the fair part of the species who if considered he said as they ought to be in the light of the dearest friends were to be cultivated honored and caressed with the utmost love and tenderness but if regarded as enemies were a conquest of which a man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it  chap v a short account of the history of mrs miller jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man that is to say the larger half a shoulder of mutton in the afternoon he received an invitation from mrs miller to drink tea for that good woman having learnt either by means of partridge or by some other means natural or super natural that he had a connection with mr allworthy could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an angry manner  jones accepted the invitation and no sooner was the teakettle removed and the girls sent out of the room than the widow without much preface began as follows well there are very surprising things happen in this world but certainly it is a wonderful business that i should have a relation of mr allworthy in my house and never know any thing of the matter alas sir you little imagine what a friend that best of gentlemen has been to me and mine yes sir i am not ashamed to own it it is owing to his goodness that i did not long since perish for want and leave my poor little wretches two destitute helpless friendless orphans to the care or rather to the cruelty of the world  you must know sir though i am now reduced to get my living by letting lodgings i was born and bred a gentlewoman my father was an officer of the army and died in a considerable rank but he lived up to his pay and as that expired with him his family at his death became beggars we were three sisters one of us had the good luck to dies soon afterward of the smallpox a lady was so kind to take the second out of charity as she said to wait upon her the mother of this lady had been a servant to my grandmother and having inherited a vast fortune from her father which he had got by pawnbroking was married to a gentleman of great estate and fashion she used my sister so barbarously often upraiding her with her birth and poverty calling her in derision a gentlewoman that i believe she at length broke the heart of the poor girl in short she likewise died within a twelvemonth after my father fortune thought proper to provide better for me and within a month from his decease i was married to a clergyman who had been my lover a long time before and who had been very i used by my father upon that account for though my poor father could not give any of us a shilling yet he bred us up as delicately considered us and would have had us consider ourselves as highly as if we had been the richest heiresses but my dear husband forgot all this usage and the moment we were become fatherless he immediately renewed his addresses to me so warmly that i who always liked and now more than ever esteemed him soon complied five years did i live in a state of perfect happiness with that best of men till at last  oh cruel cruel fortune that ever separated us that deprived me of the kindest of husbands and my poor girls of the tenderest parent  o my poor girls you never knew the blessing which ye lost  i am ashamed mr jones of this womanish weakness but i shall never mention him without tears  i ought rather madam said jones to be ashamed that i do not accompany you  well sir continued she i was now left a second time in a much worse condition than before besides the terrible affliction i was to encounter i had now two children to provide for and was if possible more pennyless than ever when that great that good that glorious man mr allworthy who had some little acquaintance with my husband accidentally heard of my distress and immediately writ this letter to me here sir  here it is i put it into my pocket to show it you this is the letter sir i must and will read it you  madam i i heartily condole with you on your late grievous loss which your own good sense and the excellent lessons you must have learnt from the worthiest of men will better enable you to bear than any advice which i am capable of giving nor have i any doubt that you whom i have heard to be the tenderest of mothers will suffer any immoderate indulgence of grief to prevent you from discharging your duty to those poor infants who now alone stand in need of your tenderness  however as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of much worldly consideration you will pardon my having ordered a person to wait on you and to pay you twenty guineas which i beg you will accept till i have the pleasure of seeing you and believe me to be madam etc   this letter sir i received within a fortnight after the irreparable loss i have mentioned and within a fortnight afterward mr allworthy  the blessed mr allworthy came to pay me a visit when he placed me in the house you now see me gave me a large sum of money to furnish it and settled an annuity of  0l a year upon me which i have constantly received ever since judge then mr jones in what regard i must hold a benefactor to whom i owe the preservation of my life and of those dear children for whose sake alone my life is valuable  do not therefore think me impertinent mr jones since i must esteem one for whom i know mr allworthy has so much value if i beg you not to converse with these wicked women you are a young gentleman and do not know half their artful wiles do not be angry with me sir for what i said upon account of my house you must be sensible i would be the ruin of my poor dear girls besides sir you cannot but be acquainted that mr allworthy himself would never forgive my conniving at such matters and particularly with you  upon my word madam said jones you need make no farther apology nor do i in the least take any thing ill you have said but give me leave as no one can have more value than myself for mr allworthy to deliver you from one mistake which perhaps would not be altogether for his honor i do assure you i am no relation of his  alas sir answered she i know you are not i know very well who you are for mr allworthy has told me all but i do assure you had you been twenty times his son he could not have express more regard for you than he has often expresse in my presence you need not be ashamed sir of what you are i promise you no good person will esteem you the less on that account no mr jones the words dishonorable birth are nonsense as my dear dear husband used to say unless the word dishonorable be applied to the parents for the children can derive no real dishonor from an act of which they are entirely innocent  here jones heaved a deep sigh and then said since i perceive madam you really do know me and mr allworthy has thought proper to mention my name to you and since you have been so explicit with me as to your own affairs i will acquaint you with some more circumstances concerning myself and these mrs miller having expressed great desire and curiosity to hear he began and related to her his whole history without once mentioning the name of sophia  there is a kind of sympathy in honest minds by means of which they give an easy credit to each other mrs miller believed all which jones told her to be true and expressed much pity and concern for him she was beginning to comment on the story but jones interrupted her for as the hour of assignation now drew nigh he began to stipulate for a second interview with the lady that evening which he promised should be the last at her house swearing at the same time that she was one of great distinction and that nothing but what was entirely innocent was to pass between them and i do firmly believe he intended to keep his word  mrs miller was at length prevailed on and jones departed to his chamber where he sat alone till twelve oclock but no lady bellaston appeared  as we have said that this lady had a great affection for jones and as it must have appeared that she really had so the reader may perhaps wonder at the first failure of her appointment as she apprehended him to be confined by sickness a season when friendship seems most to require such visits this behavior therefore in the lady may by some be condemned as unnatural but that is not our fault for our business is only to record truth  chap vi containing a scene which we doubt not will affect all our readers mr jones closed not his eyes during all the former part of the night not owing to any uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed by lady bellaston nor was sophia herself though most of his waking hours were justly to be charged to her account the present cause of dispelling his slumber in fact poor jones was one of the bestnatured fellows alive and had all that weakness which is called compassion and which distinguishes this imperfect character from that noble firmness of mind which rolls a man as it were within himself and like a polished bowl enables him to run through the work without being once stopped by the calamities which happen to others he could not help therefore compassionating the situation of poor nancy whose lord for mr nightingale seemed to him so apparent th he was astonished at the blindness of her mother who had more than once the preceding evening remarked to him the great change in the temper o her daughter who from being she said one o the liveliest merriest girls in the world was o a sudden become all gloom and melancholy  sleep however at length got the better of all resistance and now as if he had really been a deity as the ancients imagined and an offended one too he seemed to enjoy his dearbought conquest  to speak simply and without any metaphor mr jones slept till eleven the next morning and would perhaps have continued in the same quiet situation much longer had not a violent uproar awakened him  partridge was now summoned who being asked what was the matter answered that there was a dreadful hurricane below stairs that miss nancy was in fits and that the other sister and the mother were both crying and lamenting over her jones expressed much concern at this news which partridge endeavored to relieve by saying with a smile he fancied the young lady was in no danger of death for that susan which was the name of the maid had given him to understand it was nothing more than a common affair in short said he miss nancy has had a mind to be as wise as her mother that is all she was a little hungry it seems and so sat down to dinner before grace was said and so there is a child coming for the foundling hospital  prithee leave thy stupid jesting cries jones is the misery of these poor wretches a subject of mirth go immediately to mrs miller and tell her i beg leave  stay you will make some blunder i will go myself for she desired me to breakfast with her he then rose and dressed himself as fast as he could and while he was dressing partridge notwithstanding many severe rebukes could not avoid throwing forth certain pieces of brutality commonly called jests on this occasion jones was no sooner dressed than he walked down stairs and knocking at the door was presently admitted by the maid into the outward parlour which was as empty of company as it was of any apparatus for eating mrs miller was in the inner room with her daughter whence the maid presently brought a message to mr jones that her mistress hoped he would excuse the disappointment but an accident had happened which made it impossible for her to have the pleasure of his company at breakfast that day and begged his pardon for not sending him up notice sooner jones desired she would give herself no trouble about any thing so triffling as his disappointment that he was heartily sorry for the occasion and that if he could be of any service to her she might command him he had scarce spoke these words when mrs miller who heard them all suddenly threw open the door and coming out to him in a flood of tears said o mr jones you are certainly one of the best young men alive i give you a thousand thanks for your kind offer of your service but alas sir it is out of your power to preserve my poor girl  o my child my child she is undone she is ruined for ever i hope madam said jones no villain  o mr jones said she tha villain who yesterday left my lodgings has betrayed my poor girl has destroyed her  know you are a man of honor you have good  a noble heart mr jones the actions to which i have been myself a witness could proceed from no other i will tell you all nay indeed it is impossible after what has happened to keep it a secret that nightingale that barbarous villain has undone my daughter she is  she is  oh mr jones my girl is with child by him and in that condition he has deserted he here here sir is his cruel letter read it mr jones and tell me if such another monster lives the letter was as follows  dear nancy as i found it impossible to mention to you what am afraid will be no less shocking to you than it to me i have taken this method to inform you that my father insists upon my immediately paying my addresses to a young lady of fortune whom he has provided for my  i need not write the detested word your own good understanding will make you sensible how entirely i am obliged to an obedience by which i shall be for ever excluded from your dear arms the fondness of your mother may encourage you to trust her with the unhappy consequence of our love which may be easily kept a secret from the world and for which i will take care to provide as i will for you i wish you may feel less on this account than i have suffered but summon all your fortitude to your assistance and forgive and forget the man whom nothing but the prospect of certain ruin could have forced to write this letter i bid you forget me i mean only as a lover but the best of friends you shall ever find in  your faithful though unhappy j n   when jones had read this letter they both stood ent during a minute looking at each other at last began thus i cannot express madam how much i am shocked at what i have read yet let me beg you in one particular to take the writers advice consider the reputation of your daughter  it is gone it is lost mr jones cried she as well as her innocence she received the letter n a roomfull of company and immediately swooning away upon opening it the contents were known to every one present but the loss of her reputation bad as it is is not the worst i shall ose my child she has attempted twice to destroy herself already and though she has been hitherto prevented vows she will not outlive it nor could i myself outlive any accident of that nature  what then will become of my little betsy a helpless infant orphan and the poor little wret will i believe break her heart at the miseries wi which she sees her sister and myself distracted wh she is ignorant of the cause  o it is the most sensible and the bestnatured little thing the barbarous cruel  has destroyed us all o my poo children is this the reward of all my cares this the fruit of all my prospects have i so cheerfully undergone all the labors and duties of mother have i been so tender of their infancy so careful of their education have i been to so many years denying myself even the convniencies of life to provide some little sustena for them to lose one or both in such a manner indeed madam said jones with tears in b eyes i pity you from my soul  o mr jones answered she even you though i kno the goodness of your heart can have no idea what i feel the best the kindest the most dtiful of children o my poor nancy the darli of my soul the delight of my eyes the pride my heart too much indeed my pride for these foolish ambitious hopes arising from  beauty i owe her ruin alas i saw with pleasure the liking which this young man had for h i thought it an honorable affection and flatter my foolish vanity with the thoughts of seeing  married to one so much her superior and a thousand times in my presence nay often in you he has endeavored to sooth and encourage the hopes by the most generous expressions of disinrested love which he has always directed to  poor girl and which i as well as she believed be real could i have believed that these were only snares laid to betray the innocence of my chi and for the ruin of us all  at these words ittle betsy came running into the room crying dear mamma for heavens sake come to my sister for she is in another fit and my cousin cannot hold her mrs miller immediately obeyed the summons but first ordered betsy to stay with mr jones and begged him to entertain her a few minutes saying in the most pathetic voice good heaven let me preserve one of my children at least  jones in compliance with this request did all he could to comfort the little girl though he was in reality himself very highly affected with mrs millers story he told her her sister would be very well again soon that by taking on in that manner she would not only make her sister worse but make her mother ill too indeed sir says she i would not do any thing to hurt them for the world i would burst my heart rather than they should see me cry  but my poor sister cannot see me cry  i am afraid she will never be able to see me cry any more indeed i cannot part with her indeed i cannot  and then poor mamma too what will become of her  she says she will die too and leave me but i am resolved i will not be left behind and are you not afraid to die my little betsy said jones yes answered she i was always afraid to die because i must have left my mamma and my sister but i am not afraid of going any where with those i love  jones was so pleased with this answer that he gerly kissed the child and soon after mrs miller urned saying she thanked heaven nancy was ow come to herself and now betsy says she you may go in for your sister is better and longs to see you she then turned to jones and began renew her apologies for having disappointed him his breakfast  i hope madam said jones i shall have a more exquisite repast than any you could have provided for me this i assure you will be the case if i can do any service to this little family of love bu whatever success may attend my endeavors i am resolved to attempt it i am very much deceived in mr nightingale if notwithstanding what hat happened he has not much goodness of heart a the bottom as well as a very violent affection for your daughter if this be the case i think the picture which i shall lay before him will affect him endeavor madam to comfort yourself an miss nancy as well as you can i will go instantly in quest of mr nightingale and i hope to brin you good news  mrs miller fell upon her knees and invoked a the blessings of heaven upon mr jones to which she aftewards added the most passionate expressions o gratitude he then departed to find mr nightingale and the good woman returned to comfort he daughter who was somewhat cheared at what he mother told her and both joined in resounding the praises of mr jones  chap vii the interview between mr jones and mr nightingale the good or evil we confer on others ve often i believe recoils on ourselves for men of a benign disposition enjoy their own acts beneficence equally with those to whom they a done so there are scarce any natures so entirely dibolical as to be capable of doing injuries with paying themselves some pangs for the ruin wh they bring on their fellow creatures  mr nightingale at least was not such a pers on the contrary jones found him in his new loings sitting melancholy by the fire and silently menting the unhappy situation in which he had placed poor nancy he no sooner saw his friend appear than he rose hastily to meet him and after much congratulation said nothing could have been more opportune than this kind visit for i was never more in the spleen in my life  i am sorry answered jones that i bring news very unlikely to relieve you nay what i am convinced must of all other shock you the most however it is necessary you should know it without further preface then i come to you mr nightingale from a worthy family which you have involved in misery and ruin mr nightingale changed color at these words but jones without regarding it proceeded in the liveliest manner to paint the tragical story with which the reader was acquainted in the last chapter  nightingale never once interrupted the narration though he discovered violent emotions at many parts of it but when it was concluded after fetching a eep sigh he said what you tell me my friend affects me in the tenderest manner sure there never was so cursed an accident as the poor girls betraying my letter her reputation might otherwise have been safe and the affair might have remained a profound secret and then the girl might have gone off never the worse for many such things happen in this town and if the husband should suspect a little when it is too late it will be his wiser conduct to conceal his suspicion both from his wife and the world  indeed my friend answered jones this could not have been the case with your poor nancy you have so entirely gained her affections that it is the loss of you and not of her reputation which afflicts her and will end in the destruction of her and her family nay for that matter i promise you cries nightingale she has my affections so absolutely that my wife whoever she is to be will have very little share in them and is it possible then said jones you can think of deserting her why what can i do answered the other ask miss nancy replied jones warmly in the condition to which you have reduced her i sincerely think she ought to determine what reparation you shall make her her interest alone and not yours ought to be your sole consideration but if you ask me what you shall do what can you do less cries jones than to fulfill the expectations of her family and her own nay and i sincerely tell you they were mine too ever since i first saw you together you will pardon me if i presume on the friendship you have favored me with moved as i am with compassion for those poor creatures but your own heart will best suggest to you whether you have never intended by your conduct to persuade the mother as well as the daughter into an opinion that you designed honorably and if so though there may have been no direct promise of marriage in the case i will leave to your own good understanding how far you are bound to proceed  nay i must not only confess what you have hinted said nightingale but i am afraid even that very promise you mention i have given and can you after owning that said jones hesitate a moment consider my friend answered the other i know you are a man of honor and would advise no one to act contrary to its rules if there were no other objection can i after this publication of her disgrace think of such an alliance with honor undoubtedly replied jones and the very best and truest honor which is goodness requires it of you as you mention a scruple of this kind you will give me leave to examine it can you with honor be guilty of having under false pretenses deceived a young woman and her family and of having by these means treacherously robbed her of her innocence can you with honor be the knowing the wilful nay i must add the artful contriver of the ruin of a human being can you with honor destroy the fame the peace nay probably both the life and soul too of this creature can honor bear the thought that this creature is a tender helpless defenseless young woman a young woman who loves who doats on you who dies for you who has placed the utmost confidence in your promises and to that confidence has sacrificed every thing which is dear to her can honor support such contemplations as these a moment  common sense indeed said nightingale warrants all you say but yet you well know the opinion of the world is so much the contrary that was i to marry a whore though my own i should be ashamed of ever showing my face again  fie upon it mr nightingale said jones do not call her by so ungenerous a name when you promised to marry her she became your wife and she has sinned more against prudence than virtue and what is this world which you would be ashamed to face but the vile the foolish and the profligate forgive me if i say such a shame must proceed from false modesty which always attends false honor as its shadow  but i am well assured there is not a man of real sense and goodness in the world who would not honor and applaud the action but admit no other would would not your own heart my friend applaud it and do not the warm rapturous sensations which we feel from the consciousness of an honest noble generous benevolent action convey more delight to the mind than the undeserved praise of millions set the alternative fairly before your eyes on the one side see this poor unhappy tender believing girl in the arms of her wretched mother breathing her last hear her breaking heart in agonies sighing out your name and lamenting rather than accusing the cruelty which weighs her down to destruction paint to your imagination the circumstances of her fond despairing parent driven to madness or perhaps to death by the loss of her lovely daughter view the poor helpless orphaninfant and when your mind has dwelt a moment only on such ideas consider yourself as the cause of all the ruin of this poor little worthy defenseless family on the other side consider yourself as relieving them from their temporary sufferings think with what joy with what transports that lovely creature will fly to your arms see her blood returning to her pale cheeks her fire to her languid eyes and raptures to her tortured breast consider the exultations of her mother the happiness of all think of this little family made by one act of yours completely happy think of this alternative and sure i am mistaken in my friend if it requires any long deliberation whether he will sink these wretches down for ever or by one generous noble resolution raise them all from the brink of misery and despair to the highest pitch of human happiness add to this but one consideration more the consideration that it is your duty so to do  that the misery from which you will relieve these poor people is the misery which you yourself have wilfully brought upon them  o my dear friend cries nightingale i wanted not your eloquence to rouse me i pity poor nancy from my soul and would willingly give any thing in my power that no familiarities had ever passed between us nay believe me i had many struggles with my passion before i could prevail with myself to write that cruel letter which has caused all the misery in that unhappy family if i had no inclinations to consult but my own i would marry her tomorrow morning i would by heaven but you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on my father to consent to such a match besides he has provided another for me and tomorrow by his express command i am to wait on the lady  i have not the honor to know your father said jones but suppose he could be persuaded would you yourself consent to the only means of preserving these poor people as eagerly as i would pursue my happiness answered nightingale for i never shall find it in any other woman  o my dear friend could you imagine what i have felt within these twelve hours for my poor girl i am convinced she would not engross all your pity passion leads me only to her and if i had any foolish scruples of honor you have fully satisfied them could my father be induced to comply with my desires nothing would be wanting to complete my own happiness or that of my nancy  then i am resolved to undertake it said jones you must not be angry with me in whatever light it may be necessary to set this affair which you may depend on it could not otherwise be long hid from him for things of this nature make a quick progress when once they get abroad as this unhappily has already besides should any fatal accident follow as upon my soul i am afraid will unless immediately prevented the public would ring of your name in a manner which if your father has common humanity must offend him if you will therefore tell me where i may find the old gentleman i will not loose a moment in the business which while i pursue you cannot do a more genereous action than by paying a visit to the poor girl you will find i have not exaggerated in the account i have given of the wretchedness of the family  nightingale immediately consented to the proposal and now having acquainted jones with his fathers lodging and the coffeehouse where he would most probably find him he hesitated a moment and then said my dear tom you are going to undertake an impossibility if you knew my father you would never think of obtaining his consent  stay there is one way  suppose you told him i was already married it might be easier to reconcile him to the fact after it was done and upon my honor i am so affected with what you have said and i love my nancy so passionately i almost wish it was done whatever might be the consequence  jones greatly approved the hint and promised to pursue it they then separated nightingale to visit his nancy and jones in quest of the old gentleman  chap viii what passed between jones and old mr nightingale with the arrival of a person not yet mentioned in this history notwithstanding the sentiment of the roman satyrist which denies the divinity of fortune and the opinion of seneca to the same purpose cicero who was i believe a wiser man than either of them expressly holds the contrary and certain it is there are some incidents in life so very strange and unaccountable that it seems to require more than human skill and foresight in producing them  of this kind was what now happened to jones who found mr nightingale the elder in so critical a minute that fortune if she was really worthy all the worship she received at rome could not have contrived such another in short the old gentleman and the father of the young lady whom he intended for his son had been hard at it for many hours and the atter was just now gone and had left the former delighted with the thoughts that he had succeeded in a long contention which had been between the two fathers of the future bride and bridegroom in which both endeavored to overreach the other and as not rarely happens in such cases both had retreated fully satisfied of having obtained the victory  this gentleman whom mr jones now visited was what they call a man of the world that is to say a man who directs his conduct in this world as one who being fully persuaded there is no other as resolved to make the most of this in his early years he had been bred to trade but having acquired a very good fortune he had lately declined his business or to speak more properly had changed it from dealing in goods to dealing only in money of which he had always a plentiful fund at command and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful advantage sometimes of the necessities of private men and sometimes those of the public he had indeed conversed so entirely with money that it may be almost doubted whether he imagined there was any other thing really existing in the world this at least may be certainly averred that he firmly believed nothing else to have any real value  the reader will i fancy allow that fortune could not have culled out a more improper person for mr jones to attack with any probability of success nor could the whimsical lady have directed this attack at a more unseasonable time  as money then was always uppermost in this gentlemans thoughts so the moment he saw a stranger within his doors it immediately occurred to his imagination that such stranger was either come to bring him money or to fetch it from him and according as one or other of these thoughts prevailed he conceived a favorable or unfavourable idea of the person who approached him  unluckily for jones the latter of these was the ascendant at present for as a young gentleman had visited him the day before with a bill from his son for a play debt he apprehended at the first sight of jones that he was come on such another errand jones therefore had no sooner told him that he was come on his sons account than the old gentleman being confirmed in his suspicion burst forth into an exclamation that he would lose his labor is it then possible sir answered jones that you can guess my business if i do guess it replied the other i repeat again to you you will lose your labor what i suppose you are one of those sparks who lead my son into all those scenes of riot and debauchery which will be his destruction but i shall pay no more of his bills i promise you i expect he will quit all such company for the future if i had imagined otherwise i should not have provided a wife for him for i would be instrumental in the ruin of no body how sir said jones and was this lady of your providing pray sir answered the old gentleman how comes it to be any concern of yours  nay dear sir replied jones be not offended that i interest myself in what regards your sons happiness for whom i have so great an honor and value it was upon that very account i came to wait upon you i cannot express the satisfaction you have given me by what you say for i do assure you your son is a person for whom i have the highest honor  nay sir it is not easy to express the esteem i have for you who could be so generous so good so kind so indulgent to provide such a match for your son a woman who i dare swear will make him one of the happiest men upon earth  there is scarce any thing which so happily introduces men to our good liking as having conceived some alarm at their first appearance when once those apprehensions begin to vanish we soon forget the fears which they occasion and look on ourselves as indebted for our present ease to those very persons who at first raised our fears  thus it happened to nightingale who no sooner found that jones had no demand on him as he suspected than he began to be pleased with his presence pray good sir said he be pleased to sit down i do not remember to have ever had the pleasure of seeing you before but if you are a friend of my son and have any thing to say concerning this young lady i shall be glad to hear you as to her making him happy it will be his own fault if she does not i have discharged my duty in taking care of the main article she will bring him a fortune capable of making any reasonable prudent sober man happy undoubtedly cries jones for she is in herself a fortune so beautiful so genteel so sweettempered and so well educated she is indeed a most accomplished young lady sings admirably well and has a most delicate hand at the harpsichord i did not know any of these matters answered the old gentleman for i never saw the the lady but i do not like her the worse for what you tell me and i am the better pleased with her father for not laying any stress on these qualifications in our bargain i shall always think it a proof of his understanding a silly fellow would have brought in these articles as an addition to her fortune but to give him his due he never mentioned any such matter though to be sure they are no disparagements to a woman i do assure you sir cries jones she has them all in the most eminent degree for my part i own i was afraid you might have been a little backward a little less inclined to the match for your son told me you had never seen the lady therefore i came sir in that case to entreat you to conjure you as you value the happiness of your son not to beaverse to his match with a woman who has not only all the good qualities i have mentioned but many more  if that was your business sir said the old gentleman we are both obliged to you and you may be perfectly easy for i give you my word i was very well satisfied with her fortune sir answered jones i honor you every moment more and more to be so easily satisfied so very moderate on that account is a proof of the soundness of your understanding as well as the nobleness of your mind  not so very moderate young gentleman not so very moderate answered the father  still more and more noble replied jones and give me leave to add sensible for sure it is little less than madness to consider money as the sole foundation of happiness such a woman as this with her little her nothing of a fortune  i find cries the old gentleman you have a pretty just opinion of money my friend or else you are better acquainted with the person of the lady than with her circumstances why pray what fortune do you imagine this lady to have  what fortune cries jones why too contemptible a one to be named for your son well well well said the other perhaps he might have done better  that i deny said jones for she is one of the best of women ay ay but in point of fortune i mean  answered the other  and yet as to that now how much do you imagine your friend is to have  how much cries jones how much  why at the utmost perhaps  00 l do you mean to banter me young gentleman said the father a little angry  no upon my soul answered jones i am in earnest nay i believe i have gone to the utmost farthing if i do the lady an injury i ask her pardon indeed you do cries the father i am certain she has fifty times that sum and she shall produce fifty to that before i consent that she shall marry my son nay said jones it is too late to talk of consent now  if she has not fifty farthings your son is married  my son married answered the old gentleman with surprise nay said jones i thought you was unacquainted with it  my son married to miss harris answered he again  to miss harris said jones no sir to miss nancy miller the daughter of mrs miller at whose house he lodged a young lady who though her mother is reduced to let lodgings  are you bantering or are you in earnest cries the father with a most solemn voice indeed sir answered jones i scorn the character of a banterer i came to you in most serious earnest imagining as i find true that your son had never dared acquaint you with a match so much inferior to him in point of fortune though the reputation of the lady will suffer it no longer to remain a secret  while the father stood like one struck suddenly mb at this news a gentleman came into the oom and saluted him by the name of brother  but though these two were in consanguinity so arly related they were in their dispositions almost e opposites to each other the brother who now arrived had likewise been bred to trade in which he no sooner saw himself worth  000 l than he purchase a small estate with the greatest part of it and retired into the country where he married the daughter o an unbeneficed clergyman a young lady who though she had neither beauty nor fortune had recommended herself to his choice entirely by her good humor of which she possessed a very immoderate share  with this woman he had during twentyfive years lived a life more resembling the model which certain poets ascribe to the golden age than any o those patterns which are furnished by the present times by her he had four children but none o them arrived at maturity except only one daughter whom in vulgar language he and his wife had spoiled that is had educated with the utmost tenderness and fondness which she returned to such a degree that she had actually refused a very extraordinary match with a gentleman a little turned of forty because she could not bring herself to part with her parents  the young lady whom mr nightingale had intended for his son was a near neighbor of his brother and an acquaintance of his niece and in reality it was upon the account of this projected match that he was now come to town not indeed to forward but to dissuade his brother from a purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his nephew for  foresaw no other event from a union with miss harris notwithstanding the largeness of her fortune  neither her person nor mind seemed to him to promi any kind of matrimonial felicity for she was very tall very thin very ugly very affected very silly and very illnatured  his brother therefore no sooner mentioned the marriage of his nephew with miss miller than he expressed the utmost satisfaction and when the father had very bitterly reviled his son and pronounced sentence of beggary upon him the uncle began in the following manner  if you was a little cooler brother i would ask you whether you love your son for his sake or for your own you would answer i suppose and so i suppose you think for his sake and doubtless it is his happiness which you intended in the marriage you proposed for him  now brother to prescribe rules of happiness to others has always appeared to me very absurd and to insist on doing this very tyrannical it is a vulgar error i know but it is nevertheless an error and if this be absurd in other things it is mostly so in the affair of marriage the happiness of which depends entirely on the affection which subsists between the parties  i have therefore always thought it unreasonable in parents to desire to choose for their children on this occasion since to force affection is an impossible attempt nay so much does love abhor force that i know not whether through an unfortunate but incureable perverseness in our natures it may not be even impatient of persuasion  it is however true that though a parent will not i think wisely prescribe he ought to be consulted on this occasion and in strictness perhaps should at least have a negative voice my nephew therefore i own in marrying without asking your advice has been guilty of a fault but honestly speaking brother have you not a little promoted this fault have not your frequent declarations on this subject given him a moral certainty of your refusal where there was any deficiency in point of fortune nay does not your present anger arise solely from that deficiency and if he has failed in his duty here did not you as much exceed that authority when you absolutely bargained with him for a woman without his knowledge whom you yourself never saw and whom if you had seen and known as well as i it must have been madness in you to have ever thought of bringing her into your family  still i own my nephew in a fault but surely it is not an unpardonable fault he has acted indeed without your consent in a matter in which he ought to have asked it but it is in a matter in which his interest is principally concerned you yourself must and will acknowledge that you consulted his interest only and if he unfortunately differed from you and has been mistaken in his notion of happiness will you brother if you love your son carry him still wider from the point will you increase the ill consequences of his simple choice will you endeavor to make an event certain misery to him which may accidentally prove so in a word brother because he has put it out of your power to make his circumstances as affluent as you would will you distress them as much as you can  by the force of the true catholic faith st anthony won upon the fishes orpheus and amphi went a little farther and by the charms of music enchanted things merely inanimate wonderful both  but neither history nor fable have ever yet ventured to record an instance of any one who by force o argument and reason had triumphed over habitu avarice  mr nightingale the father instead of attempting to answer his brother contented himself with only observing that they had always differed in their sentiments concerning the education of their children i wish said he brother you would have consined your care to your own daughter and never have troubled yourself with my son who has i believe as little profited by your precepts as by your example for young nightingale was his uncles odson and had lived more with him than with his ather so that the uncle had often declared he loved is nephew almost equally with his own child  jones fell into raptures with this good gentleman and when after much persuasion they found the faer grew still more and more irritated instead of apeased jones conducted the uncle to his nephew at e house of mrs miller  chap ix containing strange matters at his return to his lodgings jones found the situation of affairs greatly altered from what ey had been in at his departure the mother the wo daughters and young mr nightingale were now t down to supper together when the uncle was at s own desire introduced without any ceremony to the company to all of whom he was well known  he had several times visited his nephew at that ouse  the old gentleman immediately walked up to miss nancy saluted and wished her joy as he did afterward the mother and the other sister and lastly  paid the proper compliments to his nephew with e same good humor and curtesy as if his nephew d married his equal or superior in fortune with all e previous requisites first performed  miss nancy and her supposed husband both turned e and looked rather foolish than otherwise upon e occasion but mrs miller took the first oppornity of withdrawing and having sent for jones into e dining room she threw herself at his feet and in a most passionate flood of tears called him her good angel the preserver of her poor little family with many other respectful and endearing appellations and made him every acknowledgment which the highest benefit can extract from the most grateful hearts  after the first gust of her passion was a little over which she declared if she had not vented would have burst her she proceeded to inform mr jones that all matters were settled between mr nightingale and her daughter and that they were to be married the next morning at which mr jones having expressed much pleasure the poor woman fell again into a fit of joy and thanksgiving which he at lengt with difficulty silenced and prevailed on her t return with him back to the company whom the found in the same good humor in which they ha left them  this little society now past two or three very agreeable hours together in which the uncle wh was a very great lover of his bottle had so wplyd his nephew that this latter though not dru began to be somewhat flustered and now mr nightingale taking the old gentleman with him up st into the apartment he had lately occupied unbsomed himself as follows  as you have been always the best and kindest uncles to me and as you have shown such unrallelled goodness in forgiving this match which be sure may be thought a little improvident i sho never forgive myself if i attempted to deceive y in any thing he then confessed the truth a opened the whole affair  how jack said the old gentleman and  you really then not married to this young woman no upon my honor answered nightingale have told you the simple truth my dear b cries the uncle kissing him i am heartily glad to hear it i never was better pleased in my life if you had been married i should have assisted you as much as was in my power to have made the best of a bad matter but there is a great difference between considering a thing which is already done and irrecoverable and that which is yet to do let your reason have fair play jack and you will see this match in so foolish and preposterous a light that there will be no need of any dissuasive arguguments how sir replies young nightingale is there this difference between having already done an act and being in honor engaged to do it pugh said the uncle honor is a creature of the worlds making and the world has the power of a creator over it and may govern and direct it as they please now you well know how trivial these breaches of contract are thought even the grossest make but the wonder and conversation of a day is there a man who will be afterward more backward in giving you his sister or daughter or is there any sister or daughter who would be more backward to receive you honor is not concerned in these engagements pardon me dear sir cries nightingale i can never think so and not only honor but conscience and humanity are concerned i am well satisfied that was i now to disappoint the young creature her death would be the consequence and i should look on myself as her murderer nay as her murderer by the cruelest of all methods by breaking her heart break her heart indeed no no jack cries the uncle the hearts of women are not so soon broke they are tough boy they are tough but sir answered nightingale my own affections are engaged and i never could be happy with any other woman how often have i heard you say that children should be always suffered to choose for themselves and that you would let my cousin harriet do so why ay replied the old gentleman so i would have them but then i would have them choose wisely  indeed jack you must and shall leave this girl  indeed uncle cries the other i must and will have her you will young gentleman said the uncle i did not expect such a word from you i should not wonder if you had used such language to your father who had always treated you like a dog and kept you at the distance which a tyrant preserves over his subjects but i who have lived with you upon an equal footing might surely expect better usage but i know how to account for it all it is all owing to your preposterous education in which i have had too little share there is my daughter now whom i have brought up as my friend never does any thing without my advice nor ever refuses to take it when i give it her you have never yet given her advice in an affair of this kind said nightingale for i am greatly mistaken in my cousin if she would be very ready to obey even your most positive command in abandoning her inclinations dont abuse my girl answered the old gentleman with some emotion dont abuse my harriet i have brought her up to have no inclinations contrary to my own by suffering her to do whatever she pleases i have enured her to a habit of being pleased to do whatever i like pardon me sir said nightingale i have not the least design to reflect on my cousin for whom i have the greatest esteem and indeed i am convinced you will never put he to so severe a trial or lay such hard command on her as you would do on me  but dear sir le us return to the company for they will begin to be uneasy at our long absence i must beg on favor of my dear uncle which is that he would not say any thing to shock the poor girl or her mother o you need not fear me answered he i understand myself too well to affront women so i will readily grant you that favor and in return i must expect another of you there are but few of your commands sir said nightingale which i shall not very cheerfully obey nay sir i ask nothing said the uncle but the honor of your company home to my lodging that i may reason the case a little more fully with you for i would if possible have the satisfaction of preserving my family notwithstanding the headstrong folly of my brother who in his own opinion is the wisest man in the world  nightingale who well knew his uncle to be as adstrong as his father submitted to attend him ome and then they both returned back into the om where the old gentleman promised to carry himself with the same decorum which he had before aintained  chap x a short chapter which concludes the book the long absence of the uncle and the nephew occasioned some disquiet in the minds of whom they had left behind them and the more during the preceding dialogue the uncle had re than once elevated his voice so as to be heard wn stairs which though they could not distinsh what he said had caused some evil foreboding nancy and her mother and indeed even in jones self  when the good company therefore again assembled e was a visible alteration in all their faces and good humor which at their last meeting universally shone forth in every countenance was now changed into a much less agreeable aspect it was a change indeed common enough to the weather in this climate from sunshine to clouds from june to december  this alteration was not however greatly remarked by any present for as every one was now endeavoring to conceal their own thoughts and to act a part they became all too busily engaged in the scene to be spectators of it thus neither the uncle nor nephew saw any symptoms of suspicion in the mother or daughter nor did the mother or daughter remark the overacted complaisance of the old man nor the counterfeit satisfaction which grinned in the features of the young one  something like this i believe frequently happens where the whole attention of two friends being engaged in the part which each is to act in order to impose on the other neither sees nor suspects the a practiced against himself and thus the thrust of bo to borrow no improper metaphor on the occasion alike takes place  from the same reason it is no unusual thing f both parties to be overreached in a bargain thoug the one must be always the greater loser as was  who sold a blind horse and received a bad note i payment  our company in about half an hour broke up and the uncle carried off his nephew but not before the latter had assured miss nancy in a whisper that he would attend her early in the morning an fulfill all his engagements  jones who was the least concerned in this sce saw the most he did indeed suspect the very fact for besides observing the great alteration in the behavior of the uncle the distance he assumed and  overstrained civility to miss nancy the carrying  bridegroom from his bride at that time of night was so extraordinary a proceeding that it could be only accounted for by imagining that young nightingale had revealed the whole truth which the aparent openness of his temper and his being flustered with liquor made too probable  while he was reasoning with himself whether he could acquaint these poor people with his suspicion he maid of the house informed him that a gentlewoman desired to speak with him  he went mmediately out and taking the candle from the maid ushered his visitant up stairs who in the person of mrs honor acquainted him with such dreadul news concerning his sophia that he immediately ost all consideration for every other person and his whole stock of compassion was entirely swallowed p in reflections on his own misery and on that of is unfortunate angel  what this dreadful matter was the reader will be formed after we have first related the many preceding steps which produced it and those will be the subject of the following book  the history of a foundling book xv in which the history advances about two days chap i too short to need a preface there are a set of religious or rather moral writers who teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness and vice to misery in this world a very wholesome and comfortable doctrine and to which we have but one objection namely that it is not true  indeed if by virtue these writers mean the exercise of those cardinal virtues which like good housewives stay at home and mind only the business of their own family i shall very readily conced the point for so surely do all these contribute an lead to happiness that i would almost wish in violation of all the ancient and modern sages to ca them rather by the name of wisdom than by that o virtue for with regard to this life no system i onceive was ever wiser than that of the ancient picureans who held this wisdom to constitute the hief good nor foolisher than that of their opposites those modern epicures who place all feity in the abundant gratification of every sensual ppetite  but if by virtue is meant as i almost think it ought certain relative quality which is always busying self without doors and seems as much interested pursuing the good of others as its own i cannot easily agree that this is the surest way to human appiness because i am afraid we must then include overty and contempt with all the mischiefs which ckbiting envy and ingratitude can bring on mand in our idea of happiness nay sometimes perps we shall be obliged to wait upon the said happiss to a goal since many by the above virtue have ought themselves thither  i have not now leisure to enter upon so large a eld of speculation as here seems opening upon e my design was to wipe off a doctrine that lay my way since while mr jones was acting the ost virtuous part imaginable in laboring to preserve fellow creatures from destruction the devil or e other evil spirit one perhaps clothed in human sh was hard at work to make him completely serable in the ruin of his sophia  this therefore would seem an exception to the ve rule if indeed it was a rule but as we have our voyage through life seen so many other extions to it we choose to dispute the doctrine on ich it is founded which we dont apprehend to be ristian which we are convinced is not true and ich is indeed destructive of one of the noblest arents that reason alone can furnish for the belief immortality  but as the readers curiosity if he has any mu be now awake and hungry we shall provide to feed it as fast as we can  chap ii in which is opened a very black design against sophia i remember a wise old gentleman who used to say when children are doing nothing they are doing mischief i will not enlarge this quaint saying to the most beautiful part of the creation in general but so far i may be allowed that when the effects of female jealousy do not appear openly i their proper colors of rage and fury we may suspect that mischievous passion to be at work privately and attempting to undermine what it does not attack aboveground  this was exemplified in the conduct of the lady bellaston who under all the smiles which she wor in her countenance concealed much indignation against sophia and as she plainly saw that this young lady stood between her and the full indulgence o her desires she resolved to get rid of her by some means or other nor was it long before a very favorable opportunity of accomplishing this presented itself to her  the reader may be pleased to remember that when sophia was thrown into that consternation at the play house by the wit and humor of a set of young gentlemen who call themselves the town we informed him that she had put herself under the protection of a young nobleman who had very safely conducted her to her chair  this nobleman who frequently visited lady bellaston had more than once seen sophia there sin her arrival in town and had conceived a very great liking to her which liking as beauty never look more amiable than in distress sophia had in the fright so increased that he might now without any great impropriety be said to be actually in love with her  it may easily be believed that he would not suffer so handsome an occasion of improving his acquaintance with the beloved object as now offered itself to elapse when goodbreeding alone might have prompted him to pay her a visit  the next morning therefore after this accident he waited on sophia with the usual compliments and hopes that she had received no harm from her last nights adventure  as love like fire when once thoroughly kindled s soon blown into a flame sophia in a very short time completed her conquest time now flew away unperceived and the noble lord had been two hours in company with the lady before it entered unto his head that he had made too long a visit though his circumstance alone would have alarmed sophia who was somewhat more a mistress of computation at present she had indeed much more pregnant evidence from the eyes of her lover of what ast within his bosom nay though he did not make any open declaration of his passion yet many of is expressions were rather too warm and too tender o have been imputed to complaisance even in the age when such complaisance was in fashion the very reverse of which is well known to be the reignng mode at present  lady bellaston had been apprised of his lordships visit at his first arrival and the length of it very well satisfied her that things went as she wished and is indeed she had suspected the second time she saw this young couple together this business she rightly i think concluded that she should by no means forward by mixing in the company while they were together she therefore ordered her servants that when my lord was going they should tell him she desired to speak with him and employed the intermediate time in meditating how best to accomplish a scheme which she made no doubt but his lord hip would very readily embrace the execution of  lord fellamar for that was the title of this young nobleman was no sooner introduced to her ladyship than she attacked him in the following strain bless me my lord are you here yet i thought my servants had made a mistake and let you got away and i wanted to see you about an affair of some importance  indeed lady bellaston said he i dont wonder you are astonished at the length of my visit for i have staid above two hours and did not think i had staid above half a one  what am i to conclude from thence my lord said she the company must be very agreeable which can make time slide away so very deceitfully  upon my honor said he the most agreeable i ever saw pray tell me lady bellaston who is this blazing star which you have produced among us all of a sudden  what blazing star my lord said she affecting a surprise  i mean said he the lady i saw here the other day whom i had last night in my arms at the playhouse and to whom i have been making that unreasonable visit  o my cousin western said she why that blazing star my lord is the daughter of a country booby squire and has been in own about a fortnight for the first time  upon my soul said he i should swear she had been bred in a court for besides her beauty i never saw any thing so genteel so sensible so polite  o brave cries the lady my cousin has you i find  upon my honor answered he i wish she had for i am in love with her to distraction  nay my lord said she it is not wishing yourself very ill neither for she is a very great fortune i assure you she is an only child and her fathers estate is a good  000l a year then i can assure you madam answered the lord i think her the best match in england indeed my lord replied she if you like her i heartily wish you had her if you think so kindly of me madam said he as she is a relation of yours will you do me the honor to propose it to her father and are you really then in earnest cries the lady with an affected gravity i hope madam answered he you have a better opinion of me than to imagine i would jest with your ladyship in an affair of this kind indeed then said the lady i will most readily propose your lordship to her father and i can i believe assure you of his joyful acceptance of the proposal but there is a bar which i am almost ashamed to mention and yet it is one you will never be able to conquer you have a rival my lord and a rival who though i blush to name him neither you nor all the world will ever be able to conquer upon my word lady bellaston cries he you have struck a damp to my heart which has almost deprived me of being fie my lord said she i should rather hope i had struck fire into you a lover and talk of damps in your heart i rather imagined you would have asked your rivils name that you might have immediately entered the lists with him i promise you madam answered he there are very few things i would not undertake for your charming cousin but pray who is this happy man  why he is said she what i am sorry to say most happy men with us are one of the lowest fellows in the world he is a beggar a bastard a foundling a fellow in meaner circumstances than one of your lordships footmen and is it possible cried he that a young creature with such perfections should think of bestowing herself so unworthily alas my lord answered she consider the country  the bane of all young women is the country there they learn a set of romantic notions of love and i know not what folly which this town and good company can scarce eradicate in a whole winter indeed madam replied my lord your cousin is of too immense a value to be thrown away such ruin as this must be prevented alas cries she my lord how can it be prevented the family have already done all in their power but the girl is i think intoxicated and nothing less than ruin will content her and to deal more openly with you i expect every day to hear she is run away with him what you tell me lady bellaston answered his lordship affects me most tenderly and only raises my compassion instead of lessening my adoration of your cousin some means must be found to preserve so inestimable a jewel has your ladyship endeavored to reason with her here the lady affected a laugh and cried my dear lord sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young woman out of her inclinations these inestimable jewels are as deaf as the jewels they wear time my lord time is the only medicine to cure their folly but this is a medicine which i am certain she will not take nay i live in hourly horrors on her account in short nothing but violent methods will do what is to be done cries my lord what methods are to be taken  is there any method upon earth  oh lady bellaston there is nothing which i would not undertake for such a reward  i really know not answered the lady after a pause and then pausing again she cried out  upon my soul i am at my wits end on this girls account  if she can be preserved something must be done immediately and as i say nothing but violent methods will do  if your lordship has really this attachment to my cousin and to do her justice except in this silly inclination of which she will soon see her folly she is every way deserving i think there may be one way indeed it is a very disagreeable one and what i am almost afraid to think of  it requires great spirit i promise you i am not conscions madam said he of any defect there nor am i i hope suspected of any such it must be an egregious defect indeed which could make me backward on this occasion nay my lord answered she i am far from doubting you i am much more inclined to doubt my own courage for i must run a monstrous risque in short i must place such a confidence in your honor as a wise woman will scarce ever place in a man on any consideration in this point likewise my lord very well satisfied her for his reputation was extremely clear and common fame did him no more than justice in speaking well of him well then said she my lord  i  i vow i cannot bear the apprehension of it  no it shall not be  at least every other method must be tried can you get rid of your engagements and dine here today your lordship will have an opportunity of seeing a little more of miss western  i promise you we have no time to lose here will be nobody but lady betty and miss eagle and colonel hampsted and tom edwards they will all go soon  and i shall be at home to nobody then your lordship may be a little more explicit nay i will contrive some method to convince you of her attachment to this fellow my lord made proper compliments accepted the invitation and then they parted to dress it being now past three in the morning or to reckon by the old style in the afternoon  chap iii a further explanation of the foregoing design though the reader may have long since concluded lady bellaston to be a member and no inconsiderable one of the great world she was in reality a very considerable member of the little world by which appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honorable society which not long since flourished in this kingdom  among other good principles upon which this society was founded was one very remarkable for as it was a rule of an honorable club of heroes who assembled at the close of the late war that all the members should every day fight once at least so twas in this that every member should within the twenty four hours tell at least one merry fib which was to be propagated by all the brethren and sisterhood  many idle stories were told about this society which from a certain quality may be perhaps not unjustly supposed to have come from the society themselves as that the devil was the president and that he sat in person in an elbow chair at the upper end of the table but upon very strict enquiry i find there is not the least truth in any of those tales and that the assembly consisted in reality of a set of very good sort of people and the fibs which they propagated were of a harmless kind and tended only to produce mirth and good humor  edwards was likewise a member of this comical society to him therefore lady bellaston applied as a proper instrument for her purpose and furnished him with a fib which he was to vent whenever the lady gave him her cue and this was not to be till the evening when all the company but lord fellamar and himself were gone and while they were engaged in a rubbers at whist  to this time then which was between seven and eight in the evening we will convey our reader when lady bellaston lord fellamar miss western and tom being engaged at whist and in the last game of their rubbers tom received his cue from lady bellaston which was i protest tom you are grown intolerable lately you used to tell us all the news of the town and now you know no more of the world than if you lived out of it  mr edwards then began as follows the fault is not mine madam it lies in the dullness of the age that does nothing worth talking of  o la though now i think on it there has a terrible accident befallen poor col wilcox  poor ned  you know him my lord every body knows him faith i am very much concerned for him  what is it pray says lady bellaston  why he has killed a man this morning in a duel that is all  his lordship who was not in the secret asked gravely whom he had killed to which edwards answered a young fellow we none of us know a somersetshire lad just come to town one jones his name is a near relation of one mr allworthy of whom your lordship i believe has heard i saw the lad lie dead in a coffeehouse  upon my soul he is one of the finest corpses i ever saw in my life  sophia who just began to deal as tom had mentioned that a man was killed stopped her hand and listened with attention for all stories of that kind affected her but no sooner had he arrived at the latter part of the story than she began to deal again and having dealt three cards to one and seven to another and ten to a third at last dropped the rest from her hand and fell back in her chair  the company behaved as usually on these occasions the usual disturbance ensued the usual assistance was summoned and sophia at last as it is usual returned again to life and was soon after at her earnest desire led to her own apartment where at my lords request lady bellaston acquainted her with the truth attempted to carry it off as a jest of her own and comforted her with repeated assurances that neither his lordship nor tom though she had taught him the story were in the true secret of the affair  there was no farther evidence necessary to convince lord fellamar how justly the case had been represented to him by lady bellaston and now at her return into the room a scheme was laid between those two noble persons which though it appeared in no very heinous light to his lordship as he faithfully promised and faithfully resolved too to make the lady all the subsequent amends in his power by marriage yet many of our readers we doubt not will see with just detestation  the next evening at seven was appointed for the fatal purpose when lady bellaston undertook that sophia should be alone and his lordship should be introduced to her the whole family were to be regulated for the purpose most of the servants dispatched out of the house and for mrs honor who to prevent any suspicion was to be left with her mistress till his lordships arrival lady bellaston herself was to engage her in an apartment as distant as possible from the scene of the intended mischief and out of the hearing of sophia  matters being thus agreed on his lordship took his leave and her ladyship retired to rest highly pleased with a project of which she had no reason to doubt the success and which promised so effectually to remove sophia from being any future obstruction to her amor with jones by a means of which she should never appear to be guilty even if the fact appeared to the world but this she made no doubt of preventing by huddling up a marriage to which she thought the ravished sophia would easily be brought to consent and at which all the rest of her family would rejoice  but affairs were not in so quiet a situation in the bosom of the other conspirator his mind was tossed in all the distracting anxiety so nobly described by shakespeare  between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection  though the violence of his passion had made him eagerly embrace the first hint of this design especially as it came from a relation of the lady yet when that friend to reflection a pillow had placed the action itself in all its natural black colors before his eyes with all the consequences which must and those which might probably attend it his resolution began to abate or rather indeed to go over to the other side and after a long conflict which lasted a whole night between honor and appetite the former at length prevailed and he determined to wait on lady bellaston and to relinquish the design  lady bellaston was in bed though very late in the morning and sophia sitting by her bedside when the servant acquainted her that lord fellamar was below in the parlour upon which her ladyship desired him to stay and that she would see him presently but the servant was no sooner departed than poor sophia began to entreat her cousin not to encourage the visits of that odious lord so she called him though a little unjustly upon her account i see his design said she for he made downright love to me yesterday morning but as i am resolved never to admit it i beg your ladyship not to leave us alone together any more and to order the servants that if he enquires for me i may be always denied to him  la child says lady bellaston you country girls have nothing but sweethearts in your head you fancy every man who is civil to you is making love he is one of the most gallant young fellows about town and i am convinced means no more than a little gallantry make love to you indeed i wish with all my heart he would and you must be an arrant mad woman to refuse him  but as i shall certainly be that mad woman cries sophia i hope his visits shall not be intruded on me  o child said lady bellaston you need not be so fearful if you resolve to run away with that jones i know no person who can hinder you  upon my honor madam cries sophia your ladyship injures me i will never run away with any man nor will i ever marry contrary to my fathers inclinations  well miss western said the lady if you are not in a humor to see company this morning you may retire to your own apartment for i am not frightened at his lordship and must send for him up into my dressing room  sophia thanked her ladyship and withdrew and presently afterward fellamar was admitted up stairs  chap iv by which it will appear how dangerous an advocate a lady is when she applies her eloquence to an ill purpose when lady bellaston heard the young lords scruples she treated them with the same disdain with which one of those sages of the law called newgate solicitors treats the qualms of conscience in a young witness my dear lord said she you certainly want a cordial i must send to lady edgely for one of her best drams fie upon it have more resolution are you frightened by the word rape or are you apprehensive  well if the story of helen was modern i should think it unnatural i mean the behavior of paris not the fondness of the lady for all women love a man of spirit there is another story of the sabine ladies  and that too i thank heaven is very ancient your lordship perhaps will admire my reading but i think mr hook tells us they made tolerable good wives afterward i fancy few of my married acquaintance were ravished by their husbands nay dear lady bellaston cried he dont ridicule me in this manner why my good lord answered she do you think any woman in england would not laugh at you in her heart whatever prudery she might wear in her countenance  you force me to use a strange kind of language and to betray my sex most abominably but i am contented with knowing my intentions are good and that i am endeavoring to serve my cousin for i think you will make her a husband notwithstanding this or upon my soul i would not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an empty title she should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a man of spirit for that his enemies allow this poor young fellow to be  let those who have had the satisfaction of hearing reflections of this kind from a wife or a mistrss declare whether they are at all sweetened by coming from a female tongue certain it is they sunk deeper into his lordship than any thing which demosthenes or cicero could have said on the occasion  lady bellaston perceiving she had fired the young lords pride began now like a true orator to rouse other passions to its assistance my lord said she in a graver voice you will be pleased to remember you mentioned this matter to me first for i would not appear to you in the light of one who is endeavoring to put off my cousin upon you fourscore thousand pounds do not stand in need of an advocate to recommend them nor does miss western said he require any recommendation from her fortune for in my opinion no woman ever had half her charms yes yes my lord replied the lady looking in the glass there have been women with more than half her charms i assure you not that i need lessen her on that account she is a most delicious girl that is certain and within these few hours she will be in the arms of one who surely does not deserve her though i will give him his due i believe he is truly a man of spirit  i hope so madam said my lord though i must own he does not deserve her for unless heaven or your ladyship disappoint me she shall within that time be in mine  well spoken my lord answered the lady i promise you no disappointment shall happen from my side and within this week i am convinced i shall call your lordship my cousin in public  the remainder of this scene consisted entirely of raptures excuses and compliments very pleasant to have heard from the parties but rather dull when related at second hand here therefore we shall put an end to this dialogue and hasten to the fatal hour when every thing was prepared for the destruction of poor sophia  but this being the most tragical matter in our whole history we shall treat it in a chapter by itself  chap v containing some matters which may affect and others which may surprise the reader the clock had now struck seven and poor sophia alone and melancholy sat reading a tragedy it was the fatal marriage and she was now come to that part where the poor distressed isabella disposes of her weddingring  here the book dropped from her hand and a shower of tears ran down into her bosom in this situation she had continued a minute when the door opened and in came lord fellamar sophia started from her chair at his entrance and his lordship advancing forwards and making a low bow said i am afraid miss western i break in upon you abruptly indeed my lord says she i must own myself a little surprised at this unexpected visit if this visit be unexpected madam answered lord fellamar my eyes must have been very faithless interpreters of my heart when last i had the honor of seeing you for surely you could not otherwise have hoped to detain my heart in your possession without receiving a visit from its owner sophia confused as she was answered this bombast and very properly i think with a look of inconceivable disdain my lord then made another and a longer speech of the same sort upon which sophia trembling said am i really to conceive your lordship to be out of your senses sure my lord there is no other excuse for such behaviour  i am indeed madam in the situation you suppose cries his lordship and sure you will pardon the effects of a frenzy which you yourself have occasioned for love has so totally deprived me of reason that i am scarce accountable for any of my actions upon my word my lord said sophia i neither understand your words nor your behavior  suffer me then madam cries he at your feet to explain both by laying open my soul to you and declaring that i dote on you to the highest degree of distraction o most adorable most divine creature what language can express the sentiments of my heart i do assure you my lord said sophia i shall not stay to hear any more of this do not cries he think of leaving me thus cruelly could you know half the torments which i feel that tender bosom must pity what those eyes have caused then fetching a deep sigh and laying hold of her hand he ran on for some minutes in a strain which would be a little more pleasing to the reader than it was to the lady and at last concluded with a declaration that if he was master of the world he would lay it at her feet sophia then forcibly pulling away her hand from his answered with much spirit i promise you sir your world and its master i should spurn from me with equal contempt she then offered to go and lord fellamar again laying hold of her hand said pardon me my beloved angel freedoms which nothing but despair could have tempted me take  believe me could i have had any hope that my title and fortune neither of them inconsiderable unless when compared with your worth would have been accepted i had in the humblest manner presented them to your acceptance  but i cannot lose you  by heaven i will sooner part with my soul  you are you must you shall be only mine my lord said she i entreat you to desist from a vain pursuit for upon my honor i will never hear you on this subject let go my hand my lord for i am resolved to go from you this moment nor will i ever see you more then madam cries his lordship i must make the best use of this moment for i cannot nor will live without you  what do you mean my lord said sophia i will raise the family i have no fear madam answered he but of losing you and that i am resolved to prevent the only way which despair points to me  he then caught her in his arms upon which she screamed so loud that she must have alarmed some one to her assistance had not lady bellaston taken care to remove all ears but a more lucky circumstance happened for poor sophia another noise now broke forth which almost drowned her cries for now the whole house rung with where is she d  n me i will unkennel her this instant show me her chamber i say where is my daughter i know she is in the house and i will see her if she is above ground show me where she is  at which last words the door flew open and in came squire western with his parson and a set of myrmidons at his heels  how miserable must have been the condition of poor sophia when the enraged voice of her father was welcome to her ears welcome indeed it was and did he luckily come for it was the only accident upon earth which could have preserved the peace of er mind from being for ever destroyed  sophia notwithstanding her fright presently knew er fathers voice and his lordship notwithstanding his passion knew the voice of reason which peremptorily assured him it was not now a time for the perpetration of his villainy hearing therefore the voice approach and hearing likewise whose it was for as the squire more than once roared forth the word daughter so sophia in the midst of her struggling cried out upon her father he thought proper to relinquish his prey having only disordered her handkerchief and with his rude lips committed violence on her lovely neck  if the readers imagination does not assist me i shall never be able to describe the situation of these two persons when western came into the room sophia tottered into a chair where she sat disordered pale breathless bursting with indignation at lord fellamar affrighted and yet more rejoiced at the arrival of her father  his lordship sat down near her with the bag of his wig hanging over one of his shoulders the rest of his dress being somewhat disordered and rather a greater proportion of linen than is usual appearing at his bosom as to the rest he was amazed affrighted vexed and ashamed  as to squire western he happened at this time to be overtaken by an enemy which very frequently pursues and seldom fails to overtake most of the country gentlemen in this kingdom he was literally speaking drunk which circumstance together with his natural impetuosity could produce no other effect than his running immediately up to hi daughter upon whom he fell foul with his tongue in the most inveterate manner nay he had probably committed violence with his hands had not the parson interposed saying for heavens sake si animadvert that you are in the house of a great lady let me beg you to mitigate your wrath it should minister a fullness of satisfaction that yo have found your daughter for as to revenge it belongs not unto us i discern great contrition in the countenance of the young lady i stand assured if you will forgive her she will repent her of all her past offenses and return unto her duty the strength of the parsons arms had at first en of more service than the strength of his rheric however his last words wrought some effect and the squire answered ill forgee her if she wull ha un if wot ha un sophy i will forgee thee all why do unt speak shat ha un d  n me shat ha un why do unt answer was ever such a stubborn tuoad  let me entreat you sir to be a little more moderate said the parson you frighten the young lady so that you deprive her of all power of utterance  power of mine a  anwered the squire you take her part then you do a pretty parson truly to side with an undutiful child yes yes i will gee you a living with a pox i will gee un to the devil sooner  i humbly crave your pardon said the parson i assure your worship i meant no such matter  my lady bellaston now entered the room and me up to the squire who no sooner saw her than solving to follow the instructions of his sister he de her a very civil bow in the rural manner and d her some of his best compliments he then mediately proceeded to his complaints and said there my lady cousin there stands the most undutiful child in the world she hankers after a beggarly rascal and will not marry one of the greatest matches in all england that we have provided for her  indeed cousin western answered the lady i am persuaded you wrong my cousin i am sure she has a better understanding i am convinced she will not refuse what she must be sensible is so much to her advantage  this was a wilful mistake in lady bellaston for she well knew whom mr western meant though perhaps she thought he would

cousin said the lady it is the fashion nowadays to dispen with time and long courtships  pugh said the squire what signifies tim will not they have time enough to court afterward people may court very well after they have be abed together  as lord fellamar was very well assured that  was meant by lady bellaston so never having hea nor suspected a word of blifil he made no doubt his being meant by the father coming up therefo to the squire he said though i have not the hono sir of being personally known to you yet as find i have the happiness to have my proposals accepted let me intercede sir in behalf of the young lady that she may not be more solicited at this time  you intercede sir said the squire why who the devil are you  sir i am lord fellamar answered he and am he happy man whom i

well sir said my lord i shall make  disturbance before the ladies i am very well tisfied your humble servant sir lady bellaston your most obedient  his lordship was no sooner gone than lady beln coming up to mr western said bless me r what have you done you know not whom ou have affronted he is a nobleman of the first nk and fortune and yesterday made proposals  your daughter and such as i am sure you must cept with the highest pleasure  answer for yourself lady cousin said the squire  will have nothing to do with any of your lords y daughter shall have an honest country genman i have pitched upon one for her  and e shall have un  i am sorry for the trouble she hath given your ladyship with all my heart lady bellaston made a civil speech upon the word trouble to which the squire answered why that is kind  and i would do as much for your ladyship to be sure relations should do for one another so i wish your ladyship a good night  come madam you must go along with me by fair means or i will have you carried down to the coach   sophia said she would attend him without force but begged to go in a chair for she said she should not be able to ride any other way  prithee cries the squire wout unt persuade m can not ride in a coach would that is a pretty thing surely no no i will never let thee ou of my sight any more till art married that i promise thee sophia told him she saw he was resolve to break her heart o break thy heart and b d  nd quoth he if a good husband will break i i dont value a brass varden not a halfpenny o any undutiful b  upon earth he then took violently hold of her hand upon which the parso once more interfered begging him to use gentle methods at that the squire thundered out a curse an bid the parson hold his tongue saying atnt i pulpit now when art a got up there i never mi what do say but i will not be priestridde nor taught how to behave myself by thee i wi your ladyship a good night come along sophy be a good girl and all shall be well shat  un d  n me shat ha un  mrs honor appeared below stairs and with low curtesy to the squire offered to attend her mitress but he pushed her away saying hold mdam hold you come no more near my house and will you take my maid away from me sa sophia yes indeed madam will i cries t squire you need not fear being without a se vant i will get you another maid and a better maid than this who i would lay five pound to a crown is no more a maid than my grannum no no sophy she shall contrive no more escapes i promise you he then packed up his daughter and the parson into the hackney coach after which he ounted himself and ordered it to drive to his lodgngs in the way thither he suffered sophia to be uiet and entertained himself with reading a lecture o the parson on good manners and a proper behaiour to his betters  it is possible he might not so easily have carried ff his daughter from lady bellaston had that good lady desired to have detained her but in reality she was not a little pleased with the confinement into which sophia was going and as her project with lord fellamar had failed of success she was well ontented that other violent methods were now gog to be used in favor of another man  chap vi y what means the squire came to discover his daughter though the reader in many histories is obliged to digest much more unaccountable aparances than this of mr western without any sasfaction at all yet as we dearly love to oblige him henever it is in our power we shall now proceed  show by what method the squire discovered where s daughter was  in the third chapter then of the preceding book e gave a hint for it is not our custom to unfold at y time more than is necessary for the occasion at mrs fitzpatrick who was very desirous of renciling herself to her uncle and aunt western ought she had a probable opportunity by the service  preserving sophia from committing the same crime which had drawn on herself the anger of her family after much deliberation therefore she resolved to inform her aunt western where her cousin was and accordingly she writ the following letter which we shall give the reader at length for more reasons than one  honored madam the occasion of my writing this will perhaps make a letter of mine agreeable to my dear aunt for the sake of one of her neices though i have little reason to hope it will be so on the account of another  without more apology as i was coming to throw my unhappy self at your feet i met by the strangest accident in the world my cousin sophy whose history you are better acquainted with than myself though alas i know infinitely too much enough indeed to satisfy me that unless she is immediately prevented she is in danger of running into the same fatal mischief which by foolishly and ignorantly refusing your most wise and prudent advice i have unfortunately brought on myself  i short i have seen the man nay i was most part of yesterday in his company and a charming young fellow i promise you he is by what accident he came acquainted with me is too tedious to tell you now but i have this morning changed my lodging to avoid him lest he should by my means discover my cousin for he does not yet know where she is and it is advisable he should not till my uncle has secured her  no time therefore is to be lost and i need only inform you that she is now with lady bellaston whom i have seen and who has i find a design to conceal her from her family you know madam she is a strange woman but nothing could misbecome me more than to presume to give any hint to one of your great understanding and great knowledge of the world besides barely informing you of the matter of fact  i hope madam the care which i have shown on this occasion for the good of my family will recommend me again to the favor of a lady who has always exerted so much zeal for the honor and true interest of us all and that it may be a means of restoring me to your friendship which has made so great a part of my former and is so necessary to my future happiness i am  with the utmost respect honored madam your most dutiful obliged neice and most obedient humble servant harriet fitzpatrick   mrs western was now at her brothers house where she had resided ever since the flight of sophia  order to administer comfort to the poor squire in is affliction of this comfort which she doled out  him in daily portions we have formerly given a pecimen  she was now standing with her back to the fire ad with a pinch of snuff in her hand was dealing orth this daily allowance of comfort to the squire while he smoaked his afternoon pipe when she received the above letter which she had no sooner ad than she delivered it to him saying there sir there is an account of your lost sheep fortune has again restored her to you and if you will be governed by my advice it is possible you may preserve her yet  the squire had no sooner read the letter than he aped from his chair threw his pipe into the fire d gave a loud huzza for joy he then summoned  servants called for his boots and ordered the evalier and several other horses to be saddled and at parson supple should be immediately sent for  having done this he turned to his sister caught her in his arms and gave her a close embrace saying zounds you dont seem pleased one would imagine you was sorry i have found the girl  brother answered she the deepest politicians who see to the bottom discover often a very different aspect of affairs from what swims on the surface it is true indeed things do look rather less desperate than they did formerly in holland when lewis the fourteenth was at the gates of amsterdam but there is a delicacy required in this matter which you will pardon me brother if  suspect you want there is a decorum to he used with a woman of figure such as lady bellaston brother which requires a knowledge of the world superior i am afraid to yours  sister cries the squire i know you have no opinion of my parts but i will show you on this occasion who is fool knowledge quotha i have not been in the country so long without having some knowledge of warrants and the law of the land i know i may take my own wherever can find it show me my own daughter and if dont know how to come at her i will suffer you to call me fool as long as i live there be justices o peace in london as well as in other places  i protest cries she you make me tremble forth event of this matter which if you will proceed b my advice you may bring to so good an issue do you really imagine brother that the house o a woman of figure is to be attacked by warran and brutal justices of the peace i will inform yo how to proceed as soon as you arrive in tow and have got yourself into a decent dress for indeed brother you have none at present sit to appear in you must send your compliments to lad bellaston and desire leave to wait on her wh you are admitted to her presence as you certainly will be and have told her your story and have made proper use of my name for i think you only just know one another by sight though you are relations i am confident she will withdraw her protection from my niece who has certainly imposed upon her this is the only method  justices of the peace indeed do you imagine any such event can arrive to a woman of figure in a civilized nation  d  n their figures cries the squire a pretty civilized nation truly where women are above the law and what must i stand sending a parcel of compliments to a confounded whore that keeps away a daughter from her own natural father i tell you sister i am not so ignorant as you think me  i know you would have women above the law but it is all a lie i heard his lordship say at size that no one is above the law but this of yours is hannover law i suppose  mr western said she i think you daily improve in ignorance  i protest you are grown an errant bear  no more a bear than yourself sister western said the squire  pox you may talk of your civility an you will i am sure you never show any to me i am no bear no nor no dog neither though i know somebody that is something that begins with a b  but pox i will show you i have a got more good manners than some folks  mr western answered the lady you may say what you please je vous mesprise de tout mon coeur i shall not therefore be angry  besides as my cousin with that odious irish name justly says i have that regard for the honor and true interest of my family and that concern for my niece who is a part of it that i have resolved to go to town myself upon this occasion for indeed indeed brother you are not a fit minister to be employed at a polite court  greenland  greenland should always be the scene of the tramontane negotiation  i thank heaven cries the squire i dont understand you now you are got to your hannoverian linguo however i will show you i scorn to be behindhand in civility with you and as you are not angry for what i have said so i am not angry for what you have said indeed i have always thought it a folly for relations to quarrel and if they do now and then give a hasty word why people should give and take for my part i never bear malice and i take it very kind of you to go up to london for i never was there but twice in my life and then i did not stay above a fortnight at a time and to be sure i cannot be expected to know much of the streets and the folks in that time i never denied that you knownd all these matters better than i for me to dispute that would be all as one as for you to dispute the management of a pack of dogs or the finding a hare sitting with me  which promise you says she i never will  well and promise you returned he that i never will dispute the the other  here then a league was struck to borrow a phras from the lady between the contending parties an now the parson arriving and the horses being ready the squire departed having promised his sister to follow her advice and she prepared to follow him the next day  but having communicated these matters to the parson on the road they both agreed that the prescribe formalities might very well be dispensed with an the squire having changed his mind proceeded in the manner we have already seen  chap vii in which various misfortunes befall poor jones affairs were in the aforesaid situation when mrs honor arrrived at mrs millers and called jones out from the company as we have before seen with whom when she found herself alone she began as follows  o my dear sir how shall i get spirits to tell you you are undone sir and my poor ladys undone and i am undone hath any thing happened to sophia cries jones staring like a madman all that is bad cries honor o i shall never get such another lady o that i should ever live to see this day at these words jones turned pale as ashes rembled and stammered but honor went on o mr jones i have lost my lady for ever how what for heavens sake tell me  o my dear sophia  you may well call her so said honor she was the dearest lady to me  i shall never have such another place  d  n your place ries jones where is what what is become of my sophia ay to be sure cries she servants may be d  nd it signifies nothing what becomes of them though they are turned away and ruined ever so much to be sure they are not flesh and blood like other people no to be sure it signifies nothing what becomes of them  if you have any pity any compassion cries jones i beg you will instantly tell me what has happened to sophia to be sure i have more pity for you than you have for me answered honor i dont d  n you because you have lost the sweetest lady in the world to be sure you are worthy to be pitied and i am worthy to be pitied too for to be sure if ever there was a good mistress  what has happened cries jones in almost a raving fit  what  what said honor why the worst that could have happened both for you and for me  her father is come to town and has carried her away from us both here jones fell on his knees in thanksgiving that it was no worse  no worse repeated honor what could be worse for either of us he carried her off swearing she should marry mr blifil that is for your comfort and for poor me i am turned out of doors indeed mrs honor answered jones you frightened me out of my wits i imagined some most dreadfuled sudden accident had happened to sophia something compared to which even the seeing her married to blifil would be a trifle but while there is life there are hopes my dear honor women in this land of liberty cannot be married by actual brutal force to be sure sir said she thats true there may be some hopes for you but alackaday what hopes are there for poor me and to be sure sir you must be sensible i suffer all this upon your account all the quarrel the squire has to me is for taking your part as i have done against mr blifil indeed mrs honor answered he i am sensible of my obligations to you and will leave nothing in my power undone to make you amends alas sir said she what can make a servant amends for the loss of one place but the getting another altogether as good  do not despair mrs honor said jones i hope to reinstate you again in the same alackaday sir said she how can i flatter myself with such hopes when i know it is a thing impossible for the squire is so set against me and yet if you should ever have my lady as to be sure i now hopes heartily you will for you are a generous good natured gentleman and i am sure you loves her and to be sure she loves you as dearly as her own soul it is a matter in vain to deny it because as why every body that is in the least acquainted with my lady must see it for poor dear lady she cannot dissemble and if two people who loves one another ant happy why who should be so happiness dont always depend upon what people has besides my lady has enough for both to be sure therefore as one may say it would be all the pity in the world to keep two such loviers asunder nay i am convinced for my part you will meet together at last for if it is to be there is no preventing it if a marriage is made in heaven all the justices of peace upon earth cannot break it off to be sure i wishes that parson supple had but a little more spirit to tell the squire of his wickedness in endeavoring to force his daughter contrary to her liking but then his whole dependence is on the squire and so the poor gentleman though he is a very religious good sort of man and talks of the badness of such doings behind the squires back yet he dares not say his soul is his own to his face to be sure i never saw him make so bold as just now i was afeard the squire would have struck him  i would not have your honor be melancholy sir nor despair things may go better as long as you are sure of my lady and that i am certain you may be for she never will be brought to consent to marry any other man indeed i am terribly afeard the squire will do her a mischief in his passion for he is a prodigious passionate gentleman and i am afeard too the poor lady will be brought to break her heart for she is as tenderhearted as a chicken it is pity methinks she had not a little of my courage if i was in love with a young man and my father offered to lock me up i would tear his eyes out but i would come at him but then there is a great fortune in the case which it is in her fathers power either to give her or not that to be sure may make some difference  whether jones gave strict attention to all the foregoing harangue or whether it was for want of any vacancy in the discourse i cannot determine but he never once attempted to answer nor did she once stop till partridge came running into the room and informed him that the great lady was upon the stairs  nothing could equal the dilemma to which jones was now reduced honor knew nothing of any acquaintance that subsisted between him and lady bellaston and she was almost the last person in the world to whom he would have communicated it in this hurry and distress he took as is common enough the worst course and instead of exposing her to the lady which would have been of little consequence he chose to expose the lady to her he therefore resolved to hide honor whom he had but just time to convey behind the bed and to draw the curtains  the hurry in which jones had been all day engaged on account of his poor landlady and her family the terrors occasioned by mrs honor and the confusion into which he was thrown by the sudden arrival of lady bellaston had altogether driven former thoughts out of his head so that it never once occurred to his memory to act the part of a sick man which indeed neither the gayety of his dress nor the freshness of his countenance would have at all supported  he received her ladyship therefore rather agreeably to her desires than to her expectations with all the good humor he could muster in his countenance and without any real or affected appearance of the least disorder  lady bellaston no sooner entered the room than she squatted herself down on the bed so my dear jones said she you find nothing can detain me long from you perhaps i ought to be angry with you that i have neither seen nor heard from you all day for i perceive your distemper would have suffered you to come abroad nay i suppose you have not sat in your chamber all day dressed up like a fine lady to see company after a lyingin but however dont think i intend to scold you for i never will give you an excuse for the cold behavior of a husband by putting on the ill humor of a wife  nay lady bellaston said jones i am sure your ladyship will not upbraid me with neglect of duty when i only waited for orders who my dear creature has reason to complain who missed an appointment last night and left an unhappy man to expect and wish and sigh and languish  do not mention it my dear mr jones cries she if you knew the occasion you would pity me in short it is impossible to conceive what women of condition are obliged to suffer from the impertinence of fools in order to keep up the farce of the world i am glad however all your languishing and wishing have done you no harm for you never looked better in your life upon my faith jones you might at this instant sit for the picture of adonis  there are certain words of provocation which en of honor hold can only properly be answered y a blow among lovers possibly there may be ome expressions which can only be answered by a kiss the compliment which lady bellaston now made jones seems to be of this kind especially as t was attended with a look in which the lady coneyed more soft ideas than it was possible to express with her tongue  jones was certainly at this instant in one of the most disagreeable and distressed situations imaginable or to carry on the comparison we made use of before though the provocation was given by the lady ones could not receive satisfaction nor so much as ffer to ask it in the presence of a third person seconds in this kind of duels not being according to the law of arms as this objection did not occur to lady bellaston who was ignorant of any other woman being there but herself she waited some time in great astonishment for an answer from jones who conscious of the ridiculous figure he made stood at a distance and not daring to give the proper answer gave none at all nothing can be imagined more comic nor yet more tragical than this scene would have been if it had lasted much longer the lady had already changed color two or three times had got up from the bed and sat down again while jones was wishing the ground to sink under him or the house to fall on his head when an odd accident freed him from an embarassment out of which neither the eloquence of cicero nor the politics of a machiavel could have delivered him without utter disgrace  this was no other than the arrival of young nightingale dead drunk or rather in that state of drunkenness which deprives men of the use of their reason without depriving them of the use of their limbs  mrs miller and her daughters were in bed and partridge was smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire so that he arrived at mr joness chamber door without any interruption this he burst open and was entering without any ceremony when jones started from his seat and ran to oppose him which he did so effectually that nightingale never came far enough within the door to see who was sitting on the bed  nightingale had in reality mistaken joness apartment for that in which himself had lodged he therefore strongly insisted on coming in often swearing that he would not be kept from his own bed jones however prevailed over him and delivered him in to the hands of partridge whom the noise on the stairs soon summoned to his masters assistance  and now jones was unwillingly obliged to return to his own apartment where at the very instant of his entrance he heard lady bellaston venting an exclamation though not a very loud one and at the same time saw her flinging herself into a chair in a vast agitation which in a lady of a tender constitution would have been an hysteric fit  in reality the lady frightened with the struggle between the two men of which she did not know what would be the issue as she heard nightingale swear many oaths he would come to his own bed attempted to retire to her known place of hiding which to her great confusion she found already occupied by another  is this usage to be borne mr jones cries the lady   basest of men  what wretch is this to whom you have exposed me wretch cries honor bursting in a violent rage from her place of concealment  marry come up  wretch forsooth  as poor a wretch as i am i am honest that is more than some folks who are richer can say jones instead of applying himself directly to take off the edge of mrs honors resentment as a more experienced gallant would have done fell to cursing his stars and lamenting himself as the most unfortunate man in the world and presently after addresing himself to lady bellaston he fell to some very absurd protestations of innocence by this time the lady having recovered the use of her reason which he had as ready as any woman in the world especially on such occasions calmly replied sir you need make no apologies i see now who the person is i did not at first know mrs honor but now i do i can suspect nothing wrong between her and you and i am sure she is a woman of too good sense to put any wrong constructions upon my visits to you i have been always her friend and it may be in my power to be much more so hereafter  mrs honor was altogether as placable as she was passionate hearing therefore lady bellaston assume the soft tone she likewise softened here is  im sure madam said she i have been always ready to acknowledge your ladyships friendships to me sure i never had so good a friend as your ladyship  and to be sure now i see it is your ladyship that i spoke to i could almost bite my tongue off for very mad  i constructions upon your ladyship  to be sure it does not become a servant as i am to think about such a great lady  i mean i was a servant for indeed i am no bodys servant now the more miserable wretch is me  i have lost the best mistress  here honor thought fit to produce a shower of tears   dont cry child says the good lady ways perhaps my be found to make you amends come to me tomorrow morning she then took up her fan which lay on the ground and without even looking at jones walked very majestically out of the room there being a kind of dignity in the impudence of women of quality which their inferiors vainly aspire to attain to in circumstances of this nature  jones followed her down stairs often offering her his hand which she absolutely refused him and go into her chair without taking any notice of him as he stood bowing before her  at his return up stairs a long dialogue past between him and mrs honor while she was adjusting herself after the discomposure she had undergone the subject of this was his infidelity to her young lady on which she enlarged with great bitterness but jones at last found means to reconcile her and not only so but to obtain a promise of most inviolable secrecy and that she would the next morning endeavor to find out sophia and bring him a further account of the proceedings of the squire  thus ended this unfortunate adventure to the satisfaction only of mrs honor for a secret as some of my readers will perhaps acknowledge from experience is often a very valuable possession and that not only to those who faithfully keep it but sometimes to such as whisper it about till it comes to he ears of every one except the ignorant person who pays for the supposed concealing of what is publicly known  chap viii short and sweet notwithstanding all the obligations she had received from jones mrs miller could ot forbear in the morning some gentle remonstrances for the hurricain which had happened the preceding night in his chamber these were however so genle and so friendly professing and indeed truly to im at nothing more than the real good of mr jones himself that he far from being offended thankfully eceived the admonition of the good woman exressed much concern for what had past excused it s well as he could and promised never more to bring he same disturbances into the house  but though mrs miller did not refrain from a hort expostulation in private at their first meeting et the occasion of his being summoned down stairs that morning was of a much more agreeable kind eing indeed to perform the office of a father to miss nancy and to give her in wedlock to mr nightingale who was now ready dressed and full as sober s many of my readers will think a man ought to e who receives a wife in so imprudent a maner  and here perhaps it may be proper to account for the escape which this young gentleman had made from his uncle and for his appearance in the condition in which we have seen him the night before  now when the uncle had arrived at his lodgings with his nephew partly to indulge his own inclinations for he dearly loved his bottle and partly to disqualify his nephew from the immediate execution of his purpose he ordered wine to be set on the table with which he so briskly plied the young gentleman that this latter who though not much used to drinking did not detest it so as to be guilty of disobedience or of want of complaisance by refusing was soon completely finished  just as the uncle had obtained this victory and was preparing a bed for his nephew a messenger arrived with a piece of news which so entirely disconcerted and shocked him that he in a moment lost all consideration for his nephew and his whole mind became entirely taken up with his own concerns  this sudden and afflicting news was no less than that his daughter had taken the opportunity of almost the first moment of his absence and had gone off with a neighboring young clergyman against whom though her father could have had but one objection namely that he was worth nothing yet she had never thought proper to communicate her amoun even to that father and so artfully she managed that it had never been once suspected by any till now that it was consummated  old mr nightingale no sooner received this account than in the utmost confusion he ordered a postchaise to be instantly got ready and having recommended his nephew to the care of a servant he directly left the house scarce knowing what he did nor whither he went  the uncle being thus departed when the servant came to attend the nephew to bed had waked him for that purpose and had at last made him sensible that his uncle was gone he instead of accepting the kind offices tendered him insisted on a chair being called with this the servant who had received no strict orders to the contrary readily complied and thus being conducted back to the house of mrs miller he had staggered up to mr joness chamber as has been before recounted  this bar of the uncle being now removed though young nightingale knew not as yet in what manner and all parties being quickly ready the mother mr jones mr nightingale and his love stepped into a hackneycoach which conveyed him to doctors commons where miss nancy was in vulgar language soon made an honest woman and the poor mother became in the purest sense of the word one of the happiest of all human beings  and now mr jones having seen his good offices to that poor woman and her family brought to a happy conclusion began to apply himself to his own concerns but here lest many of my readers should censure his folly for thus troubling himself with the affairs of others and lest some few should think he acted more disinterestedly than indeed he did we think proper to assure our reader that he was so far from being unconcerned in this matter that he had ndeed a very considerable interest in bringing it to that final consummation  to explain this seeming paradox at once he was one who could truly say with him in terence homo sum nihil humani a me alienum puto he was never an ndifferent spectator of the misery or happiness of any one and he felt either the one or the other in greater proportion as he himself contributed to either he could not therefore be the instrument of raising a whole family from the lowest state of wretchedness to the highest pitch of joy without conveying great felicity to himself more perhaps than worldly men often purchase to themselves by undergoing the most severe labor and often by wading through the deepest iniquity  those readers who are of the same complexion with him will perhaps think this short chapter contains abundance of matter while others may probably wish short as it is that it had been totally spared as impertinent to the main design which i suppose they conclude is to bring mr jones to the gallows or if possible to a more deplorable catastrophe  chap ix containing love letters of several sorts mr jones at his return home found the fellowing letters lying on his table which he luckily opened in the order they were sent  letter i surely i am under some strange infatuation i cannot keep my resolutions a moment however strongly made or justly founded last night i resolved never to see you more this morning i am willing to hear if you can as you say clear up this affair and yet i know that to be impossible i have said every thing to myself which you can invent  perhaps not perhaps your invention is stronger come to me therefore the moment you receive this if you can forge an excuse i almost promise you to believe it betrayed to  i will think no more  come to me directly  this is the third letter i have writ the two former are burnt  i am almost inclined to burn thi too  i wish i preserve my senses  come to me presently   letter ii if you ever expect to be forgiven or even suffered within my doors come to me this instant   letter iii i now find you was not at home when my notes came to your lodgings the moment you receive this let me see you  i shall not stir out nor shall any body be let in but yourself sure nothing can detain you long   jones had just read over these three billets when mr nightingale came into the room well tom said he any news from lady bellaston after last nights adventure for it was now no secret to any one in that house who the lady was the lady bellaston answered jones very gravely  nay dear tom cries nightingale dont be so reserved to your friends though i was too drunk to see her last night i saw her at the masquerade do you think i am ignorant who the queen of the fairies is and did you really then know the lady at the masquerade said jones yes upon my soul did i said nightingale and have given you twenty hints of it since though you seemed always so tender on that point that i would not speak plainly i fancy my friend by your extreme nicety in this matter you are not so well acquainted with the character of the lady as with her person dont be angry tom but upon my honor you are not the first young fellow she has debauched her reputation is in no danger believe me  though jones had no reason to imagine the lady o have been of the vestal kind when his amor began yet as he was thoroughly ignorant of the town and had very little acquaintance in it he had yet no knowledge of that character which is vulgarly called a demirep that is to say a woman that intrigues with every man she likes under the name and appearance of virtue and who though some overnice ladies will not be seen with her is visited as they term it by the whole town in short whom every body knows to be what no body calls her  when he found therefore that nightingale was perfectly acquainted with his intrigue and began to suspect that so scrupulous a delicacy as he had hitherto observed was not quite necessary on the occasion he gave a latitude to his friends tongue and desired him to speak plainly what he knew on had ever heard of the lady  nightingale who in many other instances wa rather too effeminate in his disposition had a pretty strong inclination to tittle tattle he had no sooner therefore received a full liberty of speaking from jones than he entered upon a long narrative concerning the lady which as it contained many particulars highly to her dishonor we have to great a tenderness for all women of condition to repeat we would cautiously avoid giving an opportunity to the future commentators on our works of making any malicious application and of forcing us to be against our will the author of scandal which never entered into our head  jones having very attentively heard all that nightingale had to say fetched a deep sigh which the other observing cried heyday why thou a not in love i hope had i imagined my storie would have affected you i promise you should never have heard them o my dear friend crie jones i am so entangled with this woman that know not how to extricate myself in love indeed no my friend but i am under obliga tions to her and very great ones since you know so much i will be very explicit with you it is owing perhaps solely to her that i have not before this wanted a bit of bread how can i possibly desert such a woman and yet i must desert her or be guilty of the blackest treachery to one who deserves infinitely better of me than she can a woman my nightingale for whom i have a passion which few can have an idea of i am half distracted with doubts how to act and is this other pray an honorable mistress cries nightingale honourable answered jones no breath ever yet durst sully her reputation the sweetest air is not purer the limpid stream not clearer than her honor she is all over both in mind and body consummate perfection she is the most beautiful creature in the universe and yet she is mistress of such noble elevated qualities that though she is never from my thoughts i scarce ever think of her beauty but when i see it and can you my good friend cries nightingale with such an engagement as this upon your hands hesitate a moment about quitting such a   hold said jones no more abuse of her i detest the thoughts of ingratitude pooh answered the other you are not the first upon whom she has conferred obligations of this kind she is remarkably liberal where she likes though let me tell you her favors are so prudently bestowed that they should rather raise a mans vanity than his gratitude in short nightingale proceeded so far on this head and told his friend so many stories of the lady which he swore to the truth of that he entirely removed all esteem for her from the breast of jones and his gratitude was lessened in proportion indeed he began to look on all the favors he had received rather as wages than benefits which not only depreciated her but himself too in his own conceit and put him quite out of humor with both from this disgust his mind by a natural transition turned toward sophia her virtue her purity her love to him her sufferings on his account filled all his thoughts and made his commerce with lady bellaston appear still more odious the result of all was that though his turning himself out of her service in which light he now saw his affair with her would be the loss of his bread yet he determined to quit her if he could but find a handsome pretense which having communicated to his friend nightingale considered a little and then said i have it my boy i have found out a sure method propose marriage to her and i would venture hanging upon the success marriage cries jones ay propose marriage answered nightingale and she will declare off in a moment i knew a young fellow whom she kept formerly who made the offer to her in earnest and was presently turned off for his pains  jones declared he could not venture the experiment perhaps said he she may be less shocked at this proposal from one man than from another and if she should take me at my word where am i then caught in my own trap and undone for ever no answered nightingale not if i can give you an expedient by which you may at any time get out of the trap  what expedient can that be replied jones this answered nightingale the young fellow i mentioned who is one of the most intimate acquaintances i have in the world is so angry with her for some ill offices she has since done him that i am sure he would without any difficulty give you a sight of her letters upon which you may decently break with her and declare off before the knot is tied if she should really be willing to tie it which i am convinced she will not  after some hesitation jones upon the strength of this assurance consented but as he swore he wanted the confidence to propose the matter to her face he wrote the following letter which nightingale dictated  madam i am extremely concerned that by an unfortunate engagement abroad i should have missed receiving the honor of your ladyships commands the moment they came and the delay which i must now suffer of vindicating myself to your ladyship greatly adds to this misfortune o lady bellaston what a terror have i been in for fear your reputation should be exposed by these perverse accidents there is one only way to secure it i need not name what that is only permit me to say that as your honor is as dear to me as my own so my sole ambition is to have the glory of laying my liberty at your feet and believe me when i assure you i can never be made completely happy without you generously bestow on me a legal right of calling you mine for ever i am  madam with most profound respect your ladyships most obliged obedient humble servant thomas jones   to this she presently returned the following answer  sir when i read over your serious epistle i could from its coldness and formality have sworn that you had already the legal right you mention nay that we had for many years composed that monstrous animal a husband and a wife do you really then imagine me a fool or do you fancy yourself capable of so entirely persuading me out of my senses that i should deliver my whole fortune into your power in order to enable you to support your pleasures at my expense are these the proofs of love which i expected is this the return for  but i scorn to upbraid you and am in great admiration of your profound respect  p s i am prevented from revising  perhaps i have said more than i meant  come to me at eight this evening   jones by the advice of his privy council replied  madam it is impossible to express how much i am shocked at the suspicion you entertain of me can lady bellaston have conferred favors on a man whom she could believe capable of so base a design or can she treat the most solemn tie of love with contempt can you imagine madam that if the violence of my passion in an unguarded moment overcame the tenderness which i have for your honor i would think of indulging myself in the continuance of an intercourse which could not possibly escape long the notice of the world and which when discovered must prove so fatal to your reputation if such be your opinion of me i must pray for a sudden opportunity of returning those pecuniary obligations which i have been so unfortunate to receive at your hands and for those of a more tender kind i shall ever remain etc and so concluded in the very words with which he had concluded the former letter   the lady answered as follows  i see you are a villain and i despise you from my soul if you come here i shall not be at home   though jones was well satisfied with his deliverance from a thraldom which those who have ever experienced it will i apprehend allow to be none of the lightest he was not however perfectly easy in his mind there was in this scheme too much of fallacy to satisfy one who utterly detested every species of falsehood or dishonesty nor would he indeed have submitted to put it in practice had he not been involved in a distressful situation where he was obliged to be guilty of some dishonor either to the one lady or the other and surely the reader will allow that every good principle as well as love pleaded strongly in favor of sophia  nightingale highly exulted in the success of his stratagem upon which he received many thanks and much applause from his friend he answered dear tom we have conferred very different obligations on each other to me you owe the regaining your liberty to you i owe the loss of mine but if you are as happy in the one instance as i am in the other i promise you we are the two happiest fellows in england  the two gentlemen were now summoned down to dinner where mrs miller who performed herself the office of cook had exerted her best talents to celebrate the wedding of her daughter this joyful circumstance she ascribed principally to the friendly behavior of jones her whole soul was fired with gratitude toward him and all her looks words and actions were so busied in expressing it that her daughter and even her new soninlaw were very little the objects of her consideration  dinner was just ended when mrs miller received a letter but as we had letters enough in this chapter we shall communicate the contents in our next  chap x consisting partly of facts and partly of observations upon them the letter then which arrived at the end of the preceding chapter was from mr allworthy and the purport of it was his intention to come immediately to town with his nephew blifil and a desire to be accommodated with his usual lodgings which were the first floor for himself and the second for his nephew  the cheerfulness which had before displayed itself in the countenance of the poor woman was a little clouded on this occasion this news did indeed a good deal disconcert her to requite so disinterested a match with her daughter by presently turning her new soninlaw out of doors appeared to her very unjustifiable on the one hand and on the other she could scarce bear the thoughts of making any excuse to mr allworthy after all the obligations received from him for depriving him of lodgings which were indeed strictly his due for that gentleman in conferring all his numberless benefits on others acted by a rule diametrically opposite to what is practiced by most generous people he contrived on all occasions to hide his beneficence not only from the world but even from the object of it he constantly used the words lend and pay instead of give and by every other method he could invent always lessened the favors he conferred with his tongue while he was heaping them with both his hands when he settled the annuity of  0l a year therefore on mrs miller he told her it was in consideration of always having her firstfloor when he was in town which he scarce ever intended to be but that she might let it at any other time for that he would always send her a months warning he was now however hurried to town so suddenly that he had no opportunity of giving such notice and this hurry probably prevented him when he wrote for his lodgings adding if they were then empty for he would most certainly have been well satisfied to have relinquished them on a less sufficient excuse than what mrs miller could now have made  but there are a sort of persons who as prior excellently well remarks direct their conduct by something  beyond the fixed and settled rules of vice and virtue in the schools beyond the letter of the law to these it is so far from being sufficient that their defense would acquit them at the oldbailey that they are not even contented though conscience the severest of all judges should discharge them nothing short of the fair and honorable will satisfy the delicacy of their minds and if any of their actions fall short of this mark they mope and pine are as uneasy and restless as a murderer who is afraid of a ghost or of the hangman  mrs miller was one of these she could not conceal her uneasiness at this letter with the contents of which she had no sooner acquainted the company and given some hints of her distress than jones her good angel presently relieved her anxiety as for myself madam said he my lodging is at your service at a moments warning and mr nightingale i am sure as he cannot yet prepare a house fit to receive his lady will consent to return to his new lodging whither mrs nightingale will certainly consent to go with which proposal both husband and wife instantly agreed  the reader will easily believe that the cheeks of mrs miller began again to glow with additional gratitude to jones but perhaps it may be more difficult to persuade him that mr jones having in his last speech called her daughter mrs nightingale it being the first time that agreeable sound had ever reached her ears gave the fond mother more satisfaction and warmed her heart more toward jones than his having dissipated her present anxiety  the next day was then appointed for the removal of the newmarried couple and of mr jones who was likewise to be provided for in the same house with his friend and now the serenity of the company was again restored and they past the day in the utmost cheerfulness all except jones who though he outwardly accompanied the rest in their mirth felt many a bitter pang on the account of his sophia which were not a little heightened by the news of mr blifils coming to town for he clearly saw the intention of his journey and what greatly aggravated his concern was that mrs honor who had promised to enquire after sophia and to make her report to him early the next evening had disappointed him  in the situation that he and his mistress were a this time there were scarce any grounds for him to hope that he should hear any good news yet he was as impatient to see mrs honor as if he had expected she would bring him a letter with an assignation in it from sophia and bore the disappointment a ill whether this impatience arose from that natural weakness of the human mind which makes it desirous to know the worst and renders uncertainty the most intolerable of pains or whether he still flattered himself with some secret hopes we will not determine but that it might be the last whoever ha loved cannot but know for of all the powers exercised by this passion over our minds one of the mo wonderful is that of supporting hope in the midst o despair difficulties improbabilities nay impossibilities are quite overlooked by it so that to any man extremely in love may be applied what addison says of caesar  the alps and pyrenaeans sink before him yet it is equally true that the same passion will sometimes make mountans of molehills and produce despair in the midst of hope but these cold fits last not ong in good constitutions which temper jones was ow in we leave the reader to guess having no exact information about it but this is certain that he had spent two hours in expectation when being unable any longer to conceal his uneasiness he retired to his room where his anxiety had almost made him frantic when the following letter was brought him from mrs honor with which we shall present the reader verbatim and literatim  sir i should sartenly haf kaled on you a cordin too mi prommiss haddunt itt bin that hur lashipp prevent me for too be sur sir you nose very well that evere persun must luk furst at ome and sarrenly such anuther offar mite not ave ever happened so as i should ave bin justly to blam had i not excepted of it when her laship

little further design than to secure within her own house the repository of a secret which she chose should make no farther progress than it had made already but mostly she desired to keep it from the ears of sophia for though that young lady was almost the only one who would never have repeated it again her ladyship could not persuade herself of this since as she now hated poor sophia with most implacable hatred she conceived a reciprocal hatred to herself to be lodged in the tender breast of our heroine where no such passion had ever yet found an entrance  while jones was terrifying himself with the apprehension of a thousand dreadful machinations and deep political designs which he imagined to be at the bottom of the promotion of honor fortune who hitherto seems to have been an utter enemy to his match with sophia tried a new method to put a final end to it by throwing a temptation in his way which in his present desperate situation it seemed unlikely he should be able to resist  chap xi containing curious but not unprecedented matter there was a lady one mrs hunt who had often seen jones at the house where he lodged being intimately acquainted with the women there and indeed a very great friend to mrs miller her age was about thirty for she owned six and twenty her face and person very good only inclining a little too much to be fat she had been married young by her relations to an old turkey merchant who having got a great fortune had left off trade with him she lived without reproach but not without pain in a state of great self denial for about twelve years and her virtue was rewarded by his dying and leaving her very rich the first year of her widowhood was just at an end and she had past it in a good deal of retirement seeing only a few particular friends and dividing her time between her devotions and novels of which she was always extremely fond very good health a very warm constitution and a great deal of religion made it absolutely necessary for her to marry again and she resolved to please herself in her second husband as she had done her friends in the first from her the following billet was brought to jones  sir from the first day i saw you i doubt my eyes have told you too plainly that you were not indifferent to me but neither my tongue nor my hand should ever have avowed it had not the ladies of the family where you are lodged given me such a character of you and told me such proofs of your virtue and goodness as convince me you are not only the most agreeable but the most worthy of men i have also the satisfaction to hear from them that neither my person understanding or character are disagreeable to you i have a fortune sufficient to make us both happy but which cannot make me so without you in thus disposing of myself i know i shall incur the censure of the world but if i did not love you more than i fear the world i should not be worthy of you one only difficulty stops me i am informed you are engaged in a commerce of gallantry with a woman of fashon if you think it worth while to sacrifice that to the passion of me i am yours if not forget my weakness and let this remain an eternal secret between you and  arabella hunt   at the reading of this jones was put into a violent flutter his fortune was then at a very low ebb the source being stopped from which hitherto he had been supplied of all he had received from lady bellaston not above five guineas remained and that very morning he had been dunned by a tradesman for twice that sum his honorable mistress was in the hands of her father and he had scarce any hopes ever to get her out of them again to be subsisted at her expense from that little fortune she had independent of her father went much against the delicacy both of his pride and his love this ladys fortune would have been exceeding convenient to him and he could have no objection to her in any respect on the contrary he liked her as well as he did any woman except sophia but to abandon sophia and marry another that was impossible he could no think of it upon any account yet why should h not since it was plain she could not be his would it not be kinder to her than to continue her longer engaged in a hopeless passion for him ought he not to do so in friendship to her this notion prevailed some moments and he had almost determined to be false to her from a high point of honor but that refinement was not able to stand very long against the voice of nature which cried in his heart that such friendship was treason to love at last he called for pen ink and paper and writ as follows to mrs hunt  madam it would be but a poor return to the favor you have done me to sacrifice any gallantry to the possession of you and i would certainly do it though i were not disengaged as at present i am from any affair of that kind but i should not be the honest man you think me if i did not tell you that my affections are engaged to another who is a woman of virtue and one that i never can leave though it is probable i shall never possess her god forbid that in return of your kindness to me i should do you such an injury as to give you my hand when i cannot give my heart no i had much rather starve than be guilty of that even though my mistress were married to another i would not marry you unless my heart had entirely effaced all impressions of her be assured that your secret was not more safe in your own breast than in that of  your most obliged and grateful humble servant tom jones   when our hero had finished and sent this letter he went to his scrutore took out miss westerns muff kissed it several times and then strutted some turns about his room with more satisfaction of mind than ever any irishman felt in carrying off a fortune of fifty thousand pounds  chap xii a discovery made by partridge while jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity partridge came capering into the room as was his custom when he brought or fancied he brought any good tidings he had been dispatched that morning by his master with orders to endeavor by the servants of lady bellaston or by any other means to discover whither sophia had been conveyed and he now returned and with a joyful countenance told our hero that he had found the lost bird i have seen sir says he black george the gamekeeper who is one of the servants whom the squire has brought with him to town i knew him presently though i have not seen him these several years but you know sir he is a very remarkable man or to use a purer phrase he has a most remarkable beard the largest and blackest i ever saw it was some time however before black george could recollect me  well but what is your good news cries jones what do you know of my sophia  you shall know presently sir answered partridge i am coming to it as fast as i can  you are so impatient sir you would come to the infinitive mood before you can get to the imperative as i was saying sir it was some time before he recollected my face  confound your face cries jones what of my sophia  nay sir answered partridge i know nothing more of madam sophia than what i am going to tell you and i should have told you all before this if you had not interrupted me but if you look so angry at me you will frighten all of out it of my head or to use a purer phrase out of my memory i never saw you look so angry since the day we left upton which i shall remember if i was to live a thousand years well pray go on in your own way said jones you are resolved to make me mad i find not for the world answered partridge i have suffered enough for that already which as i said i shall bear in my remembrance the longest day i have to live  well but black george cries jones  well sir as i was saying it was a long time before he could recollect me for indeed i am very much altered since i saw him non sum qualis eram i have had troubles in the world and nothing alters a man so much as grief i have heard it will change the color of a mans hair in a night however at last know me he did that is sure enough for we were both of an age and were at the same charity school george was a great dunce but no matter for that all men do not thrive in the world according to their learning i am sure i have reason to say so but it will be all one a thousand years hence well sir  where was i  o  well we no sooner knew each other than after many hearty shakes by the hand we agreed to go to an alehouse and take a pot and by good luck the beer was some of the best i have met with since i have been in town  now sir i am coming to the point for no sooner did i name you and told him that you and i came to town together and had lived together ever since than he called for another pot and swore he would drink to your health and indeed he drank your health so heartily that i was overjoyed to see there was so much gratitude left in the world and after we had emptied that pot i said i would be my pot too and so we drank another to your health and then i made haste home to tell you the news  what news cries jones you have not mentioned a word of my sophia  bless me i had like to have forgot that indeed we mentioned a great deal about young madam western and george told me all that mr blifil is coming to town in order to be married to her he had best make haste then says i or some body will have her before he comes and indeed says i mr seagrim it is a thousand pities some body should not have her for he certainly loves her above all the women in the world i would have both you and she know that it is not for her fortune he follows her for i can assure you as to matter of that there is another lady of much greater quality and fortune than she can pretend to who is so fond of somebody that she comes after him day and night here jones fell into a passion with partridge for having as he said betrayed him but the poor fellow answered he had mentioned no name besides sir said he i can assure you george is sincerely your friend and wished mr bilfil at the devil more than once nay he said he would do any thing in his power upon earth to serve you and so i am convinced he will  betray you indeed why i question whether you have a better friend than george upon earth except myself or one that would go farther to serve you  well says jones a little pacified you say this fellow who i believe indeed is enough inclined to be my friend lives in the same house with sophia  in the same house answered partridge why sir he is one of the servants of the family and very well dressed i promise you he is if it was not for his black beard you would hardly know him  one service then at least he may do me says jones sure he can certainly convey a letter to my sophia  you have hit the nail ad unguem cries partridge how came i not to think of it i will engage he will do it upon the very first mentioning  well then said jones do you leave me at present and i will write a letter which you shall deliver to him tomorrow morning for i suppose you know where to find him  o yes sir answered partridge i shall certainly find him again there is no fear of that the liquor is too good for him to stay away long i make no doubt but he will be there every day he stays in town  so you dont know the street then where my sophia is lodged cries jones  indeed sir i do says partridge  what is the name of the street cries jones  the name sir why here sir just by answered partridge not above a street or two off i dont indeed know the very name for as he never told me if i had asked you know it might have put some suspicion into his head no no sir let me alone for that i am too cunning for that i promise you  thou art most wonderfully cunning indeed replied jones however i will write to my charmer since i believe you will be cunning enough to find him tomorrow at the alehouse  and now having dismissed the sagacious partridge mr jones sat himself down to write in which employment we shall leave him for a time and here e put an end to the fifteenth book  the history of a foundling book xvi containing the space of five days chap i of prologues i have heard of a dramatic writer who used to say he would rather write a play than a prologue in like manner i think i can with less pains write one of the books of this history than the prefatory chapter to each of them  to say the truth i believe many a hearty curse has been devoted on the head of that author who first instituted the method of prefixing to his play that portion of matter which is called the prologue and which at first was part of the piece itself but of latter years has had usually so little connection with the drama before which it stands that the prologue to one play might as well serve for any other those indeed of more modern date seem to be written n the same three topics viz an abuse of the taste f the town a condemnation of all cotemporary authors and an elogium on the performance just about to be represented the sentiments in all these re very little varied nor is it possible they should and indeed i have often wondered at the great invenon of authors who have been capable of finding ch various phrases to express the same thing  in like manner i apprehend some future hisorian if any one shall do me the honor of imitatg my manner will after much scratching his pate estow some good wishes on my memory for havg first established these several initial chapters most f which like modern prologues may as proper be prefixed to any other book in this history as  that which they introduce or indeed to any other istory as to this  but however authors may suffer by either of these ventions the reader will find suffieient emolument  the one as the spectator has long found in the er  first it is well known that the prologue serves e critic for an opportunity to try his faculty of issing and to tune his catcall to the best advange by which means i have known those musil instruments so well prepared that they have been le to play in full concert at the first rising of the rtain  the same advantages may be drawn from these hapters in which the critic will be always sure of eeting with something that may serve as a whetne to his noble spirit so that he may fall with a ore hungry appetite for censure on the history elf and here his sagacity must make it needless observe how artfully these chapters are calculated that excellent purpose for in these we have always taken care to intersperse somewhat of the sou or acid kind in order to sharpen and stimulate the said spirit of criticism  again the indolent reader as well as spectator finds great advantage from both these for as they are not obliged either to see the one or read the others and both the play and the book are thus protracted by the former they have a quarter of a hour longer to sit at dinner and by the latter the have the advantage of beginning to read at the fourt or fifth page instead of the first a matter by n means of trivial consequence to persons who rea books with no other view than to say they have rea them a more general motive to read than is commonly imagined and from which not only la books and good books but the pages of home and virgil of swift and cervantes have been often turned over  many other are the emoluments which arise from both these but they are for the most part so obviou that we shall not at present stay to enumerate them especially since it occurs to us that the principal me of both the prologue and preface is that they  short  chap ii a whimsical adventure which befell the squire wi the distressed situation of sophia we must now convey the reader to mr western lodgings which were in piccadilly where was placed by the recommendation of the landlo at the hercules pillars at hideparkcorner for that inn which was the first he saw on his arrival town he placed his horses and in those lodings which were the first he heard of he deposit himself  here when sophia alighted from the hackneycoach which brought her from the house of lady bellaston she desired to return to the apartment provided for her to which her father very readily agreed and whither he attended her himself a short dialogue neither very material nor pleasant to relate minutely then passed between them in which he ressed her vehemently to give her consent to the marriage with blifil who as he acquainted her was o be in town in a few days but instead of comlying she gave a more peremptory and resolute reusal than she had ever done before this so inensed her father that after many bitter vows that e would force her to have him whether she would or o he departed from her with many hard words and curses locked the door and put the key into his pocket  while sophia was left with no other company than what attended the closest state prisoner namely fire and candle the squire sat down to regale himself ver a bottle of wine with his parson and the landord of the hercules pillars who as the squire said would make an excellent third man and could nform them of the news of the town and how affairs went for to be sure says he he knows a reat deal since the horses of a many of the quality and at his house  in this agreeable society mr western past that ening and great part of the succeeding day durg which period nothing happened of sufficient conequence to find a place in this history all this me sophia past by herself for her father swore she should never come out of her chamber alive unless e first consented to marry blifil nor did he ever ffer the door to be unlocked unless to convey her od on which occasions he always attended himself  the second morning after his arrival while he and the parson were at breakfast together on a toast and tankard he was informed that a gentleman was below to wait on him  a gentleman quoth the squire who the devil can he be do doctor go down and see who it is mr blifil can hardly be come to town yet  go down do and know what his business is  the doctor returned with an account that it was a very well dressed man and by the ribbon in his hat he took him for an officer of the army that he said he had some particular business which he could deliver to none but mr western himself  an officer cries the squire what can any such fellow have to do with me if he wants an order for baggagewaggons i am no justice o peace here nor can i grant a warrant  leun come up then if he must speak to me  a very genteel man now entered the room who having made his compliments to the squire and desired the favor of being alone with him delivered himself as follows  sir i come to wait upon you by the comman of my lord fellamar but with a very differen message from what i suppose you expect after wha past the other night  my lord who cries the squire i never hear the name of un  his lordship said the gentleman is willin to impute every thing to the effect of liquor an the most trifling acknowledgment of that kin will set every thing right for as he has the mo violent attachment to your daughter you sir an the last person upon earth from whom he would resent an affront and happy is it for you both tha he has given such public demonstrations of h courage as to be able to put up an affair of th kind without danger of any imputation on his honor all he desires therefore is that you will before me make some acknowledgment the slightest in the world will be sufficient and he intends this afternoon to pay his respects to you in order to obtain your leave of visiting the young lady on the footing of a lover  i dont understand much of what you say sir said the squire but i suppose by what you talk about my daughter that this is the lord which my lady cousin bellaston mentioned to me and said something about his courting my daughter if so be that how that be the case  you may give my service to his lordship and tell un the girl is disposed of already  perhaps sir said the gentleman you are not sufficiently apprized of the greatness of this offer i believe such a person title and fortune would be no where refused  lookee sir answered the squire to be very plain my daughter is bespoke already but if she was not i would not marry her to a lord upon any account i hate all lords they are a parcel of courtiers and hannoverians and i will have nothing to do with them    well sir said the gentleman if that is your resolution the message i am to deliver to you is that my lord desires the favor of your company this morning in hidepark  you may tell my lord answered the squire that i am busy and cannot come i have enough to look after at home and cannot stir abroad on any account  i am sure sir quoth the other you are too much a gentleman to send such a message you will not i am convinced have it said of you that after having affronted a noble peer you refuse him satisfaction his lordship would have been willing from his great regard to the young lady to have made up matters in another way but unless he is to look on you as a father his honor will not suffer his putting up such an indignity as you must be sensible you offered him  i offered him cries the squire it is a d  md lie i never offered him any thing  upon these words the gentleman returned a very short verbal rebuke and this he accompanied at the same time with some manual remonstrances which no sooner reached the ears of mr western than that worthy squire began to caper very briskly about the room bellowing at the same time with all his might as if desirous to summon a greater number of spectators to behold his agility  the parson who had left great part of the tankard unfinished was not retired far he immediately attended therefore on the squires vociferation crying bless me sir what is the matter  matter quoth the squire heres a highwayman i believe who wants to rob and murder me  for he has fallen upon me with that stick there in his hand when i wish i may be d  nd if i gid un the least provocation  how sir said the captain did you not tell me i lyd  no as hope to be saved answered the squire  i believe i might say it was a lie that i had offered any affront to my lord  bu i never said the word you lie  i understand my self better and you might have understood yourself better than to fall upon a naked man if i had had a stick in my hand you would not have dared strike me i would have knocked they lantho jaws about thy ears come down into ya this minute and i will take a bout with thee at single stick for a broken head that i will or i wi go into naked room and box thee for a belly full at unt half a man at unt i am sure  the captain with some indignation replied i see sir you are below my notice and i shall inform his lordship you are below his  i am sorry i dirtied my fingers with you  at which  he withdrew the parson interposing to prevent e squire from stopping him in which he easily evailed as the other though he made some efforts  the purpose did not seem very violently bent on uccess however when the captain was departed e squire sent many curses and some menaces after m but as these did not set out from his lips till  officer was at the bottom of the stairs and ew louder and louder as he was more and more reote they did not reach his ears or at least did not ard his departure  poor sophia however who in her prison heard  her fathers outcries from first to last began now t to thunder with her foot and afterward to scream oudly as the old gentleman himself had done before ough in a much sweeter voice these screams n silenced the squire and turned all his consideion toward his daughter whom he loved so tenly that the least apprehension of any harm haping to her threw him presently into agonies for cept in that single instance in which the whole fue happiness of her life was concerned she was ereign mistress of his inclinations  having ended his rage against the captain with earing he would take the law of him the squire  mounted up stairs to sophia whom as soon as  had unlocked and opened the door he found all e and breathless the moment however that she  her father she collected all her spirits and catch him hold by the hand she cried passionately o my dear sir i am almost frightened to death i ope to heaven no harm has happened to you   no no cries the squire no great harm the rascal has not hurt me much but rat me i i dont ha the laa oun pray dear sir says she tell me what is the matter who is it that has insulted you i dont know the name oun answered western some officer fellow i

sophy you do not know how i love you indeed you dont or you never could have run away and left your poor father who has no other joy no other comfort upon earth but his little sophy at these words the tears stood in his eyes and sophia with the tears streaming from hers answered indeed my dear papa i know you have loved me tenderly and heaven is my witness how sincerely i have returned your affection nor could any thing but an apprehension of being forced into the arms of this man have driven me to run from a father whom i love so passionately that i would with pleasure sacrifice my life to his happiness nay i have endeavored to reason myself into doing more and had almost worked up a resolution to endure the most miserable of all lives to comply with your inclinations it was that resolution alone to which i could not force my mind nor can i ever here the squire began to look wild and the foam appeared at his lips which sophia observing begged to be heard out and then proceeded if my fathers life his health or any real happiness of his was at stake here stands your resolved daughter may heaven blast me if there is a misery i would not suffer to preserve you  no that most detested most loathsome of all lots would i embrace i would give my hand to blifil for your sake  i tell thee it will preserve me answers the father it will gee me health happiness life every thing  upon my soul i shall die if do refuse me i shall break my hear i shall upon my soul  is it possible says she you can have such a desire to make me miserable i tell thee noa answered he loudly my whole desire is to make thee happy me d  n me if there is a thing upon earth i would not do to see thee happy  and will not my dear papa allow me to have the lea knowledge of what will make me so if it be tru that happiness consists in opinion what must b my condition when i think myself the most miserable of all the wretches upon eearth better think yourself so said he than know it b being married to

whole life to you service let me be again your poor sophy and my whole business and pleasure be as it has been to please and divert you lookey sophy answered the squire i am not to be choused in this manner your aunt western would then have reason to think me the fool she does no no sophy i have you to know i have a got more wisdom and know more of the world than to take the word of a woman in a matter where a man is concerned how sir have i deserved this want o confidence said she have i ever broke a single promise to you or have i ever been found guilty of a falsehood from my cradle lookee sophy cries he that is neither here nor there i am determined upon this match and have him you shall d  n me if shat unt d  n me if shat unt though do hang thyself the next morning at repeating which words he clinched his fist knit his brows bit his lips and thundered so loud that the poor afflicted terrified sophia sunk trembling into her chair and had not a flood of tears come immediately to her relief perhaps worse had followed  western beheld the deplorable condition of his daughter with no more contrition or remorse than the turnkey of newgate feels at viewing the agonies of a tender wife when taking her last farewell of her condemned husband or rather he looked down on her with the same emotions which arise in an honest fair tradesman who sees his debtor dragged to prison for  0l which though a just debt the wretch is wickedly unable to pay or to hit the case still more nearly he felt the same compunction with a bawd when some poor innocent whom she has ensnared into her hands falls into fits at the first proposal of what is called seeing company indeed this resemblance would be exact was it not that the bawd has an interest in what she does and the father though perhaps he may blindly think otherwise can in reality have none in urging his daughter to almost an equal prostitution  in this condition he left his poor sophia and departed with a very vulgar observation on the effect of tears he locked the room and returned to the parson who said every thing he durst in behalf of the young lady which though perhaps it was not quite so much as his duty required yet was it sufficient to throw the squire into a violent rage and into many indecent reflections on the whole body of the clergy which we have too great an honor for that sacred function to commit to paper  chap iii what happened to sophia during her confinement the landlady of the house where the squire lodged had begun very early to entertain a strange opinion of her guests however as she was informed that the squire was a man of a vast fortune and as she had taken care to exact a very extraordinary price for her rooms she did not think proper to give any offense for though she was not without some concern for the confinement of poor sophia of whose great sweetness of temper and affability the maid of the house had made so favorable a report which was confirmed by all the squires servants yet she had much more concern for her own interest than to provoke one whom as she said she perceived to be a very hastish kind of a gentleman  though sophia eat but little yet she was regularly served with her meals indeed i believe if she had liked any one rarity that the squire however angry would have spared neither pains nor cost to have procured it for her since however strange it may appear to some of my readers he really doated on his daughter and to give her any kind of pleasure was the highest satisfaction of his life  the dinner hour being arrived black george carried her up a pullet the squire himself for he had sworn not to part with the key attending the door as george deposited the dish some compliments passed between him and sophia for he had not seen her since she left the country and she treated every servant with more respect than some persons show to those who are in a very slight degree their inferiors sophia would have had him take the pullet back saying she could not eat but george begged her to try and particularly recommended her to the eggs of which he said it was full  all this time the squire was waiting at the door but george was a great favorite with his master as his employment was in concerns of the highest nature namely about the game and was accustomed to take many liberties he had officiously carried up the dinner being as he said very desirous to see his young lady he made therefore no scruple of keeping his master standing above ten minutes while civilities were passing between him and sophia for which he received only a goodhumoured rebuke at the door when he returned  the eggs of pullets partridges pheasants etc were as george well knew the most favorite dainties of sophia it was therefore no wonder that he who was a very goodnatured fellow should take care to supply her with this kind of delicacy at a time when all the servants in the house were afraid she would be starved for she had scarce swallowed a single morsel in the last forty hours  though vexation has not the same effect on all persons as it usually has on a widow whose appetite it often renders sharper than it can be rendered by the air on bansted downs or salisbury plain yet the sublimest grief notwithstanding what some people may say to the contrary will eat at last and sophia herself after some little consideration began to dissect the fowl which she found to be as full of eggs as george had reported it  but if she was pleased with these it contained something which would have delighted the royal society much more for if a fowl with three legs be so invaluable a curiosity when perhaps time has produced a thousand such at what price shall we esteem a bird which so totally contradicts all the laws of animal economy as to contain a letter in its belly ovid tells us of a flower into which hyacinthus was metamorphosed that bears letters on its leaves which virgil recommended as a miracle to the royal society of his day but no age nor nation has ever recorded a bird with a letter in its maw  but though a miracle of this kind might have engaged all the academies des sciences in europe and perhaps in a fruitless enquiry yet the reader by barely recollecting the last dialogue which passed between messieurs jones and partridge will be very easily satisfied from whence this letter came and how it found its passage into the fowl  sophia notwithstanding her long fast and notwithstanding her favorite dish was there before her no sooner saw the letter than she immediately snatched it up tore it open and read as follows  madam was i was not sensible to whom i have the honor of writing i should endeavor however difficult to paint the horros of my mind at the account brought me by mrs honor but as tenderness alone can have any true idea of the pangs which tenderness is capable of feeling so can this most amiable quality which my sophia possesses in the most eminent degree sufficiently inform her what her jones must have suffered on this melancholy occasion  is there a circumstance in the world which can highten my agonies when i hear of any misfortune which has befallen you surely there is one only and with that i am accursed it is my sophia the dreadful consideration that i am myself the wretched cause perhaps i here do myself too much honor but none will envy mean honor which costs me so extremely dear pardon me this presumption and pardon me the greater still if i ask you whether my advice my assistance my presence my absence my death o my tortures can bring you any relief can the most perfect admiration the most watchful observance the most ardent love the most melting tenderness the most resigned submission to your will make you amends for what you are to sacrifice to my happiness if they can fly my lovely angel to those arms which are ever open to received and protect you and to which whether you bring yourself alone or the riches of the world with you is in my opinion an alternative not worth regarding if on the contrary wisdom shall predominate and on the most mature reflection inform you that the sacrifice is too great and i there be no way left to reconcile you to your father and restore the peace of your dear mind bu by abandoning me i conjure you drive me for eve from your thoughts exert your resolution and let no compassion for my sufferings bear the least weight in that tender bosom believe me madam i so sincerely love you better than myself that my great and principal end is your happiness my first wish why would not fortune indulge me in it was and pardon me if i say still is to see you every moment the happiest of women my second wish is to hear you are so but no misery on earth can equal mine while i think you owe an uneasy moment to him who is  madam in every sense and to every purpose your devoted thomas jones   what sophia said or did or thought upon this letter how often she read it or whether more than once shall all be left to our readers imagination the answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter but not at present for this reason among others that she did not now write any and that for several good causes one of which was this she had no paper pen nor ink  in the evening while sophia was meditating on the letter she had received or something else a violent noise from below disturbed her meditation this noise was no other than a round bout at altercation between two persons one of the combatants by his voice she immediately distinguished to be her father but she did not so soon discover the shriller pipes to belong to the organ of her aunt western who was just arrived in town and having by means of one of her servants who stopped at the hercules pillars learnt where her brother lodged she drove directly to his lodgings  we shall therefore take our leave at present of sophia and with our usual goodbreeding attend her ladyship  chap iv in which sophia is delivered from her confinement the squire and the parson for the landlord was now otherwise engaged were smoking their pipes together when the arrival of the lady was first signified the squire no sooner heard her name than he immediately ran down to usher her up stairs for he was a great observer of such ceremonials especially to his sister of whom he stood more in awe than of any other human creature though he never would own this nor did he perhaps know it himself  mrs western on her arrival in the dining room having flung herself into a chair begun thus to harangue well surely no one ever had such an intolerable journey i think the roads since so many turnpike acts are grown worse than ever la brother how could you get into this odious place no person of condition i dare swear ever set foot here before in every sense and to every purpose your devoted i dont know cries the squire i think they do well enough it was landlord recommended them i thought as he knew most of the quality he could best show me where to get among um well and where is my niece says the lady have you been to wait upon lady bellaston yet ay ay cries the squire your neice is safe enough she is up stairs in chamber how answered the lady is my neice in this house and does she not know of my being here no nobody can well get to her says the squire for she is under lock and key i have her safe i vetched her from my lady cousin the first night i came to town and i have taken care of her ever since she is as secure as a fox in a bag i promise you good heaven returned mrs western what do i hear i thought what a fine piece of work would be the consequence of my consent to your coming to town yourself nay it was indeed your own headstrong will nor can i charge myself with having ever consented to it did not you promise me brother that you would take none of these headstrong measures was it not by those headstrong measures that you forced my neice to run away from you in the country have you mind to oblige her to take such another step z  ds and the devil cries the squire dashing his pipe on the ground did ever mortal hear the like when i expected you would have commended me for all i have done to be fallen upon in this manner how brother said the lady have i ever given you the least reason to imagine i should commend you for locking up your daughter have i not often told you that women in a free country are not to be treated with such arbitrary power we are as free as the men and i heartily wish i could not say we deserve that freedom better if you expect i should stay a moment longer in this wretched house or that i should ever own you again as my relation or that i should ever trouble myself again with the affairs of your family i insist upon it that my neice be set at liberty this instant this she spoke with so commanding an air standing with her back to the fire with one hand behind her and a pinch of snuff in the other that i question whether thalestris at the head of her amazons ever made a more tremendous figure it is no wonder therefore that the poor squire was not proof against the awe which she inspired there he cried throwing down the key there it is do whatever you please i intended only to have kept her up till blifil came to town which cannot be long and now if any harm happens in the mean time remember who is to be blamed for it  i will answer it with my life cried mrs western but i shall not intermeddle at all unless upon one condition and that is that you will commit the whole entirely to my care without taking any one measure yourself unless i shall eventually appoint you to act if you ratify these preliminaries brother i yet will endeavor to preserve the honor of your family if not i shall continue in a neutral state  i pray you good sir said the parson permit yourself this once to be admonished by her ladyship peradventure by communing with young madam sophia she will effect more than you have been able to perpetrate by more rigorous measures  what do thee open upon me cries the squire if thee do begin to babble i shall whip thee in presently  fie brother answered the lady is this language to a clergyman mr supple is a man o sense and gives you the best advice and the whole world i believe will concur in his opinion but i must tell you i expect an immediate answer to my catagorical proposals either cede your daughter to my disposal or take her wholly to your own surprising discretion and then i here before mr supple evacuate the garrison and renounce you and your family for ever  i pray you let me be a mediator cries the parson let me supplicate you  why there lies the key on the table cries the squire she may take un up if she pleases who hinders her  no brother answered the lady i insist on the formality of its being delivered me with a full ratification of all the concessions stipulated  why then i will deliver it to you  ther it is cries the squire i am sure sister yo cannot accuse me of ever denying to trust my daughter to you she has a lived wi you a whole yea and muore to a time without my ever zeeing her  and it would have been happy for her answered the lady if she had always lived with me nothing of this kind would have happened under my eye  ay certainly cries he i only am to blame  why you are to blame brother answered she i have been obliged to tell you so and shall always be obliged to tell you so however i hope you will now amend and gather so much experience from past errors as not to defeat my wisest machinations by your blunders indeed brother you are not qualified for these negotiations all your whole scheme of politics is wrong i once more therefore insist that you do not intermeddle remember only what is past    z  ds and bl  d sister cries the squire what would you have me say you are enough to provoke the devil  there now said she just according to the old custom i see brother there is no talking to you i will appeal to mr supple who is a man of sense if i said any thing which could put any human creature into a passion but you are so wrongheaded every way  let me beg you madam said the parson not to irritate his worship  irritate him said the lady  sure you are as great a fool as himself well brother since you have promised not to interfere i will once more undertake the management of my neice lord have mercy upon all affairs which are under the directions of men the head of one woman is worth a thousand of you and now having summoned servant to show her to sophia she departed bearing the key with her she was no sooner gone than the squire having first shut the door ejaculated twenty bitches and as many hearty curses against her not sparing himself for having ever thought of her estate but added now one has been a slave so long it would be pity to lose it at last for want of holding out a little longer the bitch cannot live for ever and i know i am down for it upon the will  the parson greatly commended this resolution and now the squire having ordered in another bottle which was his usual method when any thing either pleased or vexed him did by drinking plentifully of this medicinal julap so totally wash away his choler that his temper was become perfectly placid and serene when mrs western returned with sophia into the room the young lady had on her hat and capuchin and the aunt acquainted mr western that she intended to take her neice with her to her own lodgings for indeed brother says she these rooms are not fit to receive a christian soul in  very well madam quoth western whatever you please the girl can never be in better hands than yours and the parson here can do me the justice to say that i have said fifty times behind your back that you was one of the most sensible women in the world  to this cries the parson i am ready to bear testimony  nay brother says mrs western i have always i am sure given you as favorable a character you must own you have a little too much hastiness in your temper but when you will allow yourself time to reflect i never knew a man more reasonable  why then sister if you think so said the squire heres your good health with all my heart i am a little passionate sometimes but i scorn to bear any malice sophy do you be a good girl and do every thing your aunt orders you  i have not the least doubt of her answered mrs western she has had already an example before her eyes in the behavior of that wretch her cousin harriet who ruined herself by neglecting my advice  o brother what think you you was hardly gone out of hearing when you set out for london when who should arrive but that impudent fellow with the odious irish name  that fitzpatrick he broke in abruptly upon me without notice or i would not have seen him he ran on a long unintelligible story about his wife to which he forced me to give him a hearing but i made him very little answer and delivered him the letter from his wife which i bid him answer himself i suppose the wretch will endeavor to find us out but i beg you will not see her for i am determined i will not  i zee her answered the squire you need not fear me i will ge no encouragement to such undutiful wenches it is well for the fellow her husband i was not at huome od rabbit it he should have taken a dance thru the horsepond i promise un you zee sophy what undutifulness brings volks to do you have an example in your own family brother cries the aunt you need not shock my niece by such odious repetitions why will you not leave every thing entirely to me well well i wull i wull said the squire and now mrs western luckily for sophia put an end to the conversation by ordering chairs to be called i say luckily for had it continued much longer fresh matter of dissension would most probably have arisen between the brother and sister between whom education and sex made the only difference for both were equally violent and equally positive they had both a vast affection for sophia and both a sovereign contempt for each other  chap v in which jones receives a letter from sophia an goes to a play with mrs miller and partridge the arrival of black george in town and the good offices which that grateful fellow ha promised to do for his old benefactor greatly comforted jones in the midst of all the anxiety and unesiness which he had suffered on the account of sophia from whom by the means of the said george received the following answer to his letter whi sophia to whom the use of pen ink and pape was restored with her liberty wrote the very evening when she departed from her confinement  sir as i do not doubt your sincerity in what y write you will be pleased to hear that some of  afflictions are at an end by the arrival of  aunt western with whom i am at present a with whom i enjoy all the liberty i can desir one promise my aunt has insisted on my makin which is that i will not see or converse with a person without her knowledge and consent the promise i have most solemnly given and shall m inviolably keep and though she has not expre forbidden me writing yet that must be an omiss from forgetfulness or this perhaps is includ in the word conversing however as i can but consider this as a breach of her generous confidence in my honor you cannot expect tha shall after this continue to write myself or receive letters without her knowledge a pmise is with me a very sacred thing and to be etended to every thing understood from it as w as to what is expressed by it and this considetion may perhaps on reflection afford you so comfort but why should i mention a comf to you of this kind for though there is one thing in which i can never comply with the best of fathers yet am i firmly resolved never to act in defiance of him or to take any step of consequence without his consent a firm persuasion of this must teach you to divert your thoughts from what fortune has perhaps made impossible this your own interest persuades you this may reconcile you i hope to mr allworthy and if it will you have my injunctions to pursue it accidents have laid some obligations on me your good intentions probably more fortune may perhaps be sometimes kinder to us both than at present believe this that i shall always think of you as i think you deserve and am  sir your obliged humble servantsophia western i charge you write to me no more  at present at least and accept this which is now of no service to me which i know you must want and think you owe the trifle only to that fortune by which you found it meaning perhaps the bankbill for  00 l      a child who has just learnt his letters would have spelt this letter out in less time than jones took in reading it the sensations it occasioned were a mixture of joy and grief somewhat like what divide the mind of a good man when he peruses the will of his deceased friend in which a large legacy which his distresses make the more welcome is bequeathed to him upon the whole however he was more pleased than displeased and indeed the reader may probably wonder that he was displeased at all but the reader is not quite so much in love as was poor jones and love is a disease which though it may in some instances resemble a consumption which it sometimes causes in others proceeds in direct opposition to it and particularly in this that i never flatters itself or sees any one symptom in a favorable light  one thing gave him complete satisfaction which was that his mistress had regained her liberty and was now with a lady where she might at least assure herself of a decent treatment another comfortable circumstance was the reference which she made to her promise of never marrying any other man for however disinterested he might imagine his passion and notwithstanding all the generous overture made in his letter i very much question whether he could have heard a more afflicting piece of news tha that sophia was married to another though the matc had been never so great and never so likely to end in making her completely happy that refined degre of platonic affection which is absolutely detached from the flesh and is indeed entirely and purely spiritual is a gift confined to the female part of the creation many of whom i have heard declare and doubtless with great truth that they would wit the utmost readiness resign a lover to a rival when such resignation was proved to be necessary for the temporal interest of such lover hence therefore i conclude that this affection is in nature though i cannot pretend to say i have ever seen an instan of it  mr jones having spent three hours in reading an kissing the aforesaid letter and being at last in state of good spirits from the last mentioned considerations he agreed to carry an appointment which he had before made into execution this was to attend mrs miller and her youngest daughter into the gallery at the playhouse and to admit mr partridge as one of the company for as jones had really tha taste for humor which many affect he expected to enjoy much entertainment in the criticisms of partridge from whom he expected the simple dictates of nature unimproved indeed but likewise unadulterated by art  in the first row then of the first gallery did mr jones mrs miller her youngest daughter and partridge take their place partridge immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in when the first music was played he said it was a wonder how so many fiddlers could play at one time without putting one another out while the fellow was lighting the upper candles he cried out to mrs miller look look madam the very picture of the man in the end of the common prayer book before the gunpowdertreason service nor could he help observing with a sigh when all the candles were lighted that here were candles enough burnt in one night to keep an honest poor family for a whole twelvemonth  as soon as the play which was hamlet prince of denmark began partridge was all attention nor did he break silence till the entrance of the ghost upon which he asked jones what man that was in the strange dress something said he like what i have seen in a picture sure it is not armor is it jones answered that is the ghost to which partridge replied with a smile perswade me to that sir if you can though i cannot say i ever actually saw a ghost in my life yet i am certain i should know one if i saw him better than that comes to no no sir ghosts dont appear in such dresses as that neither in this mistake which caused much laughter in the neighborhood of partridge he was suffered to continue till the scene between the ghost and hamlet when partridge gave that credit to mr garrick which he had denied to jones and fell into so violent a trembling that his knees knocked against each other jones asked him what was the matter and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the stage o la sir said he i perceive now it is what you told me i am not afraid of any thing for i know it is but a play and if it was really a ghost it could do one no harm at such a distance and in so much company and yet if i was frightened i am not the only person why who cries jones dost thou take to be such a coward here besides thyself nay you may call me coward if you will but if that little man there upon the stage is not frightened i never saw any man frightened in my life ay ay go along with you ay to be sure who is fool then will you lud have mercy upon such foolhardiness  whatever happens it is good enough for you  follow you i would follow the devil as soon nay perhaps it is the devil  for they say he can put on what likeness he pleases  oh here he is again  no farther no you have gone far enough already farther than i would have gone for all the kings dominons jones offered to speak but partrisge cried hush hush dear sir dont you hear him and during the whole speech of the ghost he sat with his eyes fixed partly on the ghost and partly on hamlet and with his mouth open the same passions which succeeded each other in hamlet succeeding likewise in him  when the scene was over jones said why partridge you exceed my expectations you enjoy the play more than i conceived possible nay sir answered partridge if you are not afraid of the devil i cannot help it but to be sure it is natural to be surprised at such things though i know there is nothing in them not that it was the ghost that surprised me neither for i should have known that to have been only a man in a strange dress but when i saw the little man so frightened himself it was that which took hold of me and do thou imagine then partridge cries jones that he was really frightned nay sir said partridge did not you yourself observe afterward when he found out it was his own fathers spirit and how he was murdered in the garden how his fear forsook him by degrees and he was struck dumb with sorrow as it were just as i should have been had it been my own case  but hush o la what noise is that there he is again  well to be certain though i know there is nothing at all in it i am glad i am not down yonder where those men are then turning his eyes again upon hamlet ay you may draw your sword what signifies a sword against the power of the devil  during the second act partridge made very few remarks he greatly admired the fineness of the resses nor could he help observing upon the kings ountenance well said he how people may be deceived by faces nulla fides fronti is i find a true saying who would think by looking in the kings face that he had ever committed a murer he then enquired after the ghost but jones ho intended he should be surprised gave him no ther satisfaction than that he might possibly see him again soon and in a flash of fire  partridge sat in fearful expectation of this and ow when the ghost made his next appearance partridge cried out there sir now what say you now is he frightened now or no as much frightened as you think me and to be sure no body can help some fears i would not be in so bad a condition as what is his name squire hamlet is there for all the world bless me what is become of the spirit as i am a living soul i thought i saw him sink into the earth indeed you saw right answered jones well well cries partridge i know it is only a play and besides if there was any thing in all this madam miller would not laugh so for as to you sir you would not be afraid i believe if the devil was here i person  there there  ay no wonde you are in such a passion shake the vile wicke wretch to pieces if she was my own mother i should serve her so to be sure all duty to mother is forfeited by such wicked doings  ay go about your business i hate the sight  you  our critic was now pretty silent till the play which hamlet introduces before the king this he did n at first understand till jones explained it to him but he no sooner entered into the spirit of it than  began to bless himself that he had never committe murder then turning to mrs miller he asked he if she did not imagine the king looked as if he w touched though he is said he a good acto and does all he can to hide it well i would n have so much to answer for as that wicked m there has to sit upon a much higher chair than  sits upon  no wonder he run away for yo sake i will never trust an innocent face again  the gravedigging scene next engaged the attention of partridge who expressed much surpri at the number of skulls thrown upon the stag to which jones answered that it was one of the most famous burialplaces about town n wonder then cries partridge that the place haunted but i never saw in my life a worse grav digger i had a sexton when i was clerk the should have dug three graves while he is diggi one the fellow handles a spade as if it was the first time he had ever had one in his hand a ay you may sing you had rather sing than wo i believe  upon hamlets taking up the sku he cried out well it is strange to see how fearl some men are i never could bring myself to tou any thing belonging to a dead man on any account  he seemed frightened enough too at the ghost i thought nemo omnibus horis sapit  little more worth remembering occurred during the ay at the end of which jones asked him which of the players he had liked best to this he anwered with some appearance of indignation at the uestion the king without doubt indeed mr partridge says mrs miller you are not of the same opinion with the town for they all agreed that hamlet is acted by the best player who was ever on the stage he the best player es partridge with a contemptuous sneer why i could act as well as he myself i am sure if i had seen a ghost i should have looked in the very same manner and done just as he did and then to be sure in that scene as you call it between him and his mother where you told me he acted so fine why lord help me any man that is any good man that had such a mother would have done exactly the same i know you are only joking with me but indeed madam though i was never at a play in london yet i have seen acting before in the country and the king for my money he speak all his words distinctly half as loud again as the other  any body may see he is an actor  while mrs miller was thus engaged in conversation with partridge a lady came up to mr jones whom he immediately knew to be mrs fitzpatrick e said she had seen him from the other part of the allery and had taken that opportunity of speaking him as she had something to say which might be great service to himself she then acquainted  with her lodgings and made him an appointent the next day in the morning which upon ecollection she presently changed to the afternoon which time jones promised to attend her  thus ended the adventure at the playhou where partridge had afforded great mirth not o to jones and mrs miller but to all who sat with hearing who were more attentive to what he sa than to any thing that passed on the stage  he durst not go to bed all that night for fear the ghost and for many nights after sweat two three hours before he went to sleep with the sa apprehensions and waked several times in g horrors crying out lord have mercy upon  there it is  chap vi in which the history is obliged to look back it is almost impossible for the best parent to obse an exact impartiality to his children even thou no superior merit should biass his affection but s a parent can hardly be blamed when that superior determines his preference  as i regard all the personages of this history the light of my children so i must confess the sa inclination of partiality to sophia and for tha hope the reader will allow me the same excu from the superiority of her character  this extraordinary tenderness which i have my heroine never suffers me to quit her any lo time without the utmost reluctance i could no therefore return impatiently to enquire what h happened to this lovely creature since her depart from her fathers but that i am obliged first to p a short visit to mr blifil  mr western in the first confusion into which mind was cast upon the sudden news he received his daughter and in his first hurry to go after h had not once thought of sending any account of  discovery to blifil he had not gone far however before he recollected himself and according stopped at the very first inn he came to and dispatched way a messenger to acquaint blifil with his having ound sophia and with his firm resolution to marry er to him immediately if he would come up after im to town  as the love which blifil had for sophia was of that iolent kind which nothing but the loss of her forune or some such accident could lessen his inination to the match was not at all altered by her aving run away though he was obliged to lay this o his own account he very readily therefore emraced this offer indeed he now proposed the grafication of a very strong passion besides avarice by marrying this young lady and this was hatred for e concluded that matrimony afforded an equal opportunity of satisfying either hatred or love and his opinion is very probably verified by much expeience to say the truth if we are to judge by e ordinary behavior of married persons to each ther we shall perhaps be apt to conclude that the generality seek the indulgence of the former passion only in their union of every thing but of hearts  there was one difficulty however in his way and this arose from mr allworthy that good man when he found by the departure of sophia for neither that nor the cause of it could be concealed from him the great aversion which she had for his nephew began to be seriously concerned that he had been deceived into carrying matters so far he by o means concurred with the opinions of those parents who think it as immaterial to consult the inclinations of their children in the affair of marriage as to solicit the good pleasure of their servants when they intend to take a journey and who are y law or decency at least withheld often from sing absolute force on the contrary as he esteemed the institution to be of the most sacred kind  thought every preparatory caution necessary to preserve it holy and inviolate and very wisely concluded that the surest way to effect this was by laying the foundation in previous affections  blifil indeed soon cured his uncle of all anger o the score of deceit by many vows and protestations that he had been deceived himself with which the many declarations of western very well tallied bu now to persuade allworthy to consent to the renewing his addresses was a matter of such apparent difficulty that the very appearance was sufficient to have deterred a less enterprizing genius but this young gentleman so well knew his own talents that nothing within the province of cunning seemed to him hard to be achieved  here then he represented the violence of his own affection and the hopes of subduing aversion i the lady by perseverance he begged that in an affair on which depended all his future repose h might at least be at liberty to try all fair means for success heaven forbid he said that he should ever think of prevailing by any other than the mo gentle methods besides sir said he if they fai you may then which will be surely time enough deny your consent he urged the great and eage desire which mr western had for the match an lastly he made great use of the name of jones to whom he imputed all that had happened and from whom he said to preserve so valuable a young lady was even on act of charity  all these arguments were well seconded by thwackum who dwelt a little stronger on the authority o parents than mr blifil himself had done he ascribed the measures which mr blifil was desirous to take to christian motives and though says he the good young gentleman has mentioned charity last i am almost convinced it is his first and principal consideration  square possibly had he been present would have ng to the same tune though in a different key d would have discovered much more moral fitness  the proceeding but he was now gone to bath for e recovery of his health  allworthy though not without reluctance at last ielded to the desires of his nephew he said he ould accompany him to london where he might e at liberty to use every honest endeavor to gain e lady but i declare said he i will never give my consent to any absolute force being put on her inclinations nor shall you ever have her unless she can be brought freely to compliance  thus did the affection of allworthy for his nephew betray the superior understanding to be trimphed over by the inferior and thus is the pruence of the best of heads often defeated by the tenderness of the best of hearts  blifil having obtained this unhoped for acquiescence n his uncle rested not till he carried his purpose unto execution and as no immediate business reuired mr allworthys presence in the country and ittle preparation is necessary to men for a journey hey set out the very next day and arrived in town that evening when mr jones as we have seen was iverting himself with partridge at the play  the morning after his arrival mr blifil waited on mr western by whom he was most kindly and graciously received and from whom he had every possible assurance perhaps more than was possible that he should very shortly be as happy as sophia could make him nor would the squire suffer the young gentleman to return to his uncle till he had almost against his will carried him to his sister  chap vii in which mr western pays a visit to his sister i company with mr blifil mrs western was reading a lecture on prudence and matrimonial politics to her niece when her brother and blifil broke in with less ceremony than the laws of visiting require sophia no sooner saw blifil than she turned pale and almost lost the use of all her faculties but her aun on the contrary waxed red and having all her faculties at command began to exert her tongue on the squire  brother said she i am astonished at you behavior will you never learn any regard to decorum will you still look upon every apartment as your own or as belonging to one of your country tenants do you think yourself at liberty  invade the privacies of women of condition without the least decency or notice  why what the a pox is the matter now quoth the squire one would think i had caught you at  none of your brutality sir i beseech you answered she  you have surprised my poor niece so that she can hardly i see support herself  go my dear retire and endeavor to recruit you spirits for i see you have occasion at which words sophia who never received a more welcom command hastily withdrew  to be sure sister cries the squire you a mad when i have brought mr blifil here to co her to force her away  sure brother says she you are worse tha mad when you know in what situation affairs ar to  i am sure i ask mr blifil pardon but h knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a reception for my own part i am sure i sha always be very glad to see mr blifil but his own good sense would not have suffered him to proceed so abruptly had you not compelled him to it  blifil bowed and stammered and looked like a fool t western without giving him time to form a speech r the purpose answered well well i am to blame if you will i always am certainly but come let the girl be fetched back again or let mr blifil go to her  he is come on purpose and there is no time to be lost  brother cries mrs western mr blifil i am confident understands himself better than to think of seeing my niece any more this morning after what has happened women are of a nice contexture and our spirits when disordered are not to be recomposed in a moment had you suffered mr blifil to have sent his compliments to my niece and to have desired the favor of waiting on her in the afternoon i should possibly have prevailed on her to have seen him but now i despair of bringing about any such matter  i am very sorry madam cried blifil that mr westerns extraordinary kindness to me which i can never enough acknowledge should have occasioned   inded sir said she interrupting im you need make no apologies we all know my brother so well  i dont care what any body knows of me answered the squire  but when must he come to see her for consider i tell you he is come up on purpose and so is allworthy brother said e whatever message mr blifil thinks proper to send to my niece shall be delivered to her and i suppose she will want no instructions to make a proper answer i am convinced she will not refuse to see mr blifil at a proper time  the devil she will not answered the squire  odsbud  dont we know  i say nothing but some volk are wiser than all the world  if i might have had my will she had not run away before and now i expect to hear every moment she is guone again for as great a fool as some volk think me i know very well she hates  no matter brother replied mrs western i will not hear my niece abused it is a reflection on my family she is an honor to it and she will be an honor to it i promise you i will pawn my whole reputation in the world on her conduct  i shall be glad to see you brother in the afternoon for i have somewhat of importance to mention to you  at present mr blifil as well as you must excuse me for i am in haste to dress  well but said the squire do appoint a time  indeed said she i can appoint no time  i tell you i will see you in the afternoon  what the devil would you have me do cries the squire turning to blifil i can no muore turn her than a beagle can turn an old hare perhaps she will be in a better humor in the afternoon  i am condemned i see sir to misfortune answered blifil but i shall always own my obligations to you  he then took a ceremonious leave of mrs western who was altogether as ceremonious on her part and them they departed the squire muttering to himself with an oath that blifil should see his daughter in the afternoon  if mr western was little pleased with this interview blifil was less as to the former he imputed the whole behavior of his sister to her humor only and to her dissatisfaction at the omission of ceremony in the visit but blifil saw a little deeper into things he suspected somewhat of more consequence from two or three words which dropped from the lady and to say the truth he suspected right as will appear when i have unfolded the several matters which will be continued in the following chapter  chap viii schemes of lady bellaston for the ruin of jones love had taken too deep a root in the mind of lord fellamar to be plucked up by the rude hands of mr western in the heat of resentment he had indeed given a commission to captain egglane which the captain had far exceeded in the execution or had it been executed at all had his lordship been ble to find the captain after he had seen lady bellaston which was in the afternoon of the day after he had received the affront but so industrious was the captain in the discharge of his duty that aving after long enquiry found out the squires lodgngs very late in the evening he sat up all night at  tavern that he might not miss the squire in the morning and by that means missed the revocation which my lord had sent to his lodgings  in the afternoon then next after the intended rape f sophia his lordship as we have said made a isit to lady bellaston who laid open so much of the haracter of the squire that his lordship plainly  the absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any ffence at his words especially as he had those honorable designs on his daughter he then unbomed the violence of his passion to lady bellaston  readily undertook the cause and encouraged n with certain assurance of a most favorable reption from all the elders of the family and from  father himself when he should be sober and ould be made acquainted with the nature of the of made to his daughter the only danger she said  in the fellow she had formerly mentioned who ough a beggar and a vagabond had by some means other she knew not what procured himself tolerable clothes and past for a gentleman now says she as i have for the sake of my cousin mad it my business to enquire after this fellow i have luckily found out his lodging with which she then acquainted his lordship i am thinking m lord added she for this fellow is too mea for your personal resentment whether it would not be posible for your lordship to contrive some method of having him pressed and sent on board ship neither law nor conscience forbid the project for the fellow i promise you howev well dressed is but a vagabond and as proper as an fellow in the streets to be pressed into the service and as for the conscientious part surely the preservation of a young lady from such ruin is a mmeritorious act nay with regard to the fello himself unless he could succeed which heaven forbid with my cousin it may probably be the mea of preserving him from the gallows and perha may make his fortune in an honest way  lord fellamar very heartily thanked her ladyshi for the part which she was pleased to take in the affair upon the success of which his whole futu happiness entirely depended he said he saw at present no objection to the pressing scheme and wou consider of putting it in execution he then m earnestly recommended to her ladyship to do h the honor of immediately mentioning his propo to the family to whom he said he offered a ca blanch and would settle his fortune in almost a manner they should require and after uttering any ecstasies and raptures concerning sophia he to his leave and departed but not before he had receiv the strongest charge to beware of jones and to  no time in securing his person where he should longer be in a capacity of making any attempts the ruin of the young lady  the moment mrs western was arrived at her lodgings a card was dispatched with her compliments to lady bellaston who no sooner received it han with the impatience of a lover she flew to her cousin rejoiced at this fair opportunity which beond her hopes offered itself for she was much better pleased with the prospect of making the proposals  a woman of sense and who knew the world an to a gentleman whom she honored with the appellation of hottentot though indeed from him he apprehended no danger of a refusal  the two ladies being met after very short preous ceremonials fell to business which was ineed almost as soon concluded as begun for mrs western no sooner heard the name of lord fellamar han her cheeks glowed with pleasure but when she was acquainted with the eagerness of his passion he earnestness of his proposals and the generosity of his offer she declared her full satisfaction in the most explicit terms  in the progress of their conversation their discourse turned to jones and both cousins very patheically lamented the unfortunate attachment which both agreed sophia had to that young fellow and mrs western entirely attributed it to the folly of her brothers management she concluded however at ast with declaring her confidence in the good understanding of her niece who though she would not give up her affection in favor of blifil will i doubt not says she soon be prevailed upon to sacrifice  simple inclination to the addresses of a fine gentleman who brings her both a title and a large estate for indeed added she i must do sophy the justice to confess this blifil is but a hideous kind of fellow as you know bellaston all country gentlemen are and has nothing but his fortune to recommend him   nay said lady bellaston i dont then so much wonder at my cousin for i promise you this jones is a very agreeable fellow and has one virtue which the men say is a great recommendation to us what do you think bell  i shall certainly make you laugh nay i can hardly tell you myself for laughing  will you believe that the fellow has had the assurance to make love to me but i you be inclined to disbelieve it here is evidence enough his own handwriting i assure you she then delivered her cousin the letter with the proposals of marriage which if the reader has a desire to see he will find already on record in the xvth book of this history  upon my word i am astonished said mrs western this is indeed a masterpiece of assurance with your leave i may possibly make some use of this letter you have my full liberty cris lady bellaston to apply it to what purpose you please however i would not have it shown to any but miss western nor to her unless you find occasion well and how did you use the fellow returned mrs western not as a husband said the lady i am not married i promise you my dear you know bell i have tried the comforts once already and once i think enough for any reasonable woman  this letter lady bellaston thought would certainly turn the balance against jones in the mind of sophia and she was emboldened to give it up partly by her hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the way and partly by having secured the evidence of honor who upon sounding her she saw sufficient reason to imagine was prepared to testify whatever she pleased  but perhaps the reader may wonder why lady bellaston who in her heart hated sophia should be so desirous of promoting a match which was so much to the interest of the young lady now i would desire such readers to look carefully into human nature page almost the last and there he will find in scarce legible characters that women notwithstanding the preposterous behavior of mothers aunts etc in matrimonial matters do in reality think it so great a misfortune to have their inclinations in love thwarted that they imagine they ought never to carry enmity higher than upon these disappointments again he will find it written much about the same place that a woman who has once been pleased with the possession of a man will go above half way to the devil to prevent any other woman from enjoying the same  if he will not be contented with these reasons i freely confess i see no other motive to the actions of that lady unless we will conceive she was bribed by lord fellamar which for my own part i see no cause to suspect  now this was the affair which mrs western was preparing to introduce to sophia by some prefatory discourse on the folly of love and on the wisdom of legal prostitution for hire when her brother and blifil broke abruptly upon her and hence arose all that coldness in her behavior to blifil which though the squire as was usual with him imputed to a wrong cause infused into blifil himself he being a much more cunning man a suspicion of the real truth  chap ix in which jones pays a visit to mrs fitzpatrick the reader may now perhaps be pleased to return with us to mr jones who at the appointed hour attended on mrs fitzpatrick but before we relate the conversation which now past it may be proper according to our method to return a little back and to account for so great an alteration of behavior in this lady that from changing her lodging principally to avoid mr jones she had now industriously as has been seen sought this interview  and here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding day when hearing from lady bellaston that mr western was arrived in town she went to pay her duty to him at his lodgings a piccadilly when she was received with many scurvy compellations too coarse to be repeated and was even threatened to be kicked out of doors from hence an old servant of her aunt western with whom she was well acquainted conducted her to the lodgings of that lady who treated her not more kindly but more politely or to say the truth with rudeness in another way in short she returned from both plainly convinced not only that her scheme o reconciliation had proved abortive but that she must for ever give over all thoughts of bringing it about by any means whatever from this moment desire of revenge only filled her mind and in thi temper meeting jones at the play an opportunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this purpose  the reader must remember that he was acquainted by mrs fitzpatrick in the account she gave o her own story with the fondness mrs western had formerly shown for mr fitzpatrick at bath from the disappointment of which mrs fitzpatrick derived the great bitterness her aunt had expressed toward her she had therefore no doubt but that the good lady would as easily listen to the addresses o mr jones as she had before done to the other for the superiority of charms was clearly on the side of mr jones and the advance which her aunt had since made in age she concluded how justly i will not say was an argument rather in favor of her project than against it  therefore when jones attended after a previous declaration of her desire of serving him arising as she said from a firm assurance how much she should by so doing oblige sophia and after some excuses for her former disappointment and after acquainting mr jones in whose custody his mistress was of which she thought him ignorant she very explicitly mentioned her scheme to him and advised him to make sham addresses to the older lady in order to procure an easy access to the younger informing him at the same time of the success which mr fitzpatrick had formerly owed to the very same stratagem  mr jones expressed great gratitude to the lady for the kind intentions toward him which she had expressed and indeed testified by this proposal but besides intimating some diffidence of success from the ladys knowledge of his love to her neice which had not been her case in regard to mr fitzpatrick he said he was afraid miss western would never agree to an imposition of this kind as well from her utter detestation of all fallacy as from her avowed duty to her aunt  mrs fitzpatrick was a little nettled at this and indeed if it may not be called a lapse of the tongue it was a small deviation from politeness in jones and into which he would scarce have fallen had not the delight he felt in praising sophia hurried him out of all reflection for this commendation of one cousin was more than a tacit rebuke on the other  indeed sir answered the lady with some warmth i cannot think there is any thing easier than to cheat an old woman with a profession of love when her complexion is amorous and though she is my aunt i must say there never was a more liquorish one than her ladyship cannot you pretend that the despair of possessing her neice from her being promised to blifil has made you turn your thoughts toward her as to my cousin sophia i cannot imagine her to be such a simpleton as to have the least scruple on such an account or to conceive any harm in punishing one of these haggs for the many mischiefs they bring upon families by their tragi comic passions for which i think it is pity they were not punishable by law i had no such scruple myself and yet i hope my cousin sophia will not think it an affront when i say she cannot detest every real species of falsehood more than her cousin fitzpatrick to my aunt indeed i pretend no duty nor does she deserve any however sir i have given you my advice and if you decline pursuing it i shall have the less opinion of your understanding that is all  jones now clearly saw the error he had committed and exerted his utmost power to rectify it but he only faultered and fluttered into nonsense and contradiction to say the truth it is often safer to abide by the consequences of the first blunder than to endeavor to rectify it for by such endeavors we generally plunge deeper instead of extricating ourselves and few persons will on such occasions have the good nature which mrs fitzpatrick displayed to jones by saying with a smile you need attempt no more excuses for i can easily forgive a real lover whatever is the effect of fondness for his mistress  she then renewed her proposal and very fervently recommended it omitting no argument which her invention could suggest on the subject for she was so violently incensed against her aunt that scarce any thing was capable of affording her equal pleasure with exposing her and like a true woman she would see no difficulties in the execution of a favouite scheme  jones however persisted in declining the undertaking which had not indeed the least probability of success he easily perceived the motives which inuced mrs fitzpatrick to be so eager in pressing her advice he said he would not deny the tender and assionate regard he had for sophia but was so contious of the inequality of their situations that he ould never flatter himself so far as to hope that so ivine a young lady would condescend to think on ne so unworthy nay he protested he could scarce ring himself to wish she should he concluded with  profession of generous sentiments which we have ot at present leisure to insert  there are some fine women for i dare not here peak in too general terms with whom self is so redominant that they never detach it from any subject and as vanity is with them a ruling principle hey are apt to lay hold of whatever praise they meet with and though the property of others convey  to their own use in the company of these laies it is impossible to say any thing handsome of another woman which they will not apply to themselves nay they often improve the praise they seize s for instance if her beauty her wit her gentiliy her good humor deserve so much commendaion what do i deserve who possess those qualities  so much more eminent a degree  to these ladies a man often recommends himself while he is commending another woman and while he is expressing ardour and generous sentiments for his mistress they are considering what a harming lover this man would make to them who an feel all this tenderness for an inferior degree of merit of this strange as it may seem i have seen many instances besides mrs fitzpatrick to whom all this really happened and who now began to feel a somewhat for mr jones the symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor sophia had formerly done  to say the truth perfect beauty in both sexes is a more irresistible object than it is generally thought for notwithstanding some of us are contented with more homely lots and learn by rot as children to repeat what gives them no idea to despise outside and to value more solid charms yet i have always observed at the approach of consummate beauty that these more solid charms only shine with that kind of luster which the stars have after the rising of the sun  when jones had finished his exclamations many of which would have become the mouth of oroondates himself mrs fitzpatrick heaved a deep sigh and taking her eyes off from jones on whom they had been some time fixed and dropping them on the ground she cried indeed mr jones i pity you but it is the curse of such tenderness to be thrown away on those who are insensible of it i know my cousin better than you mr jones and i must say any woman who makes no return to such a passion and such a person is unworthy of both  sure madam said jones you cannot mean  mean cries mrs fitzpatrick i know not what  mean there is something i think in true tenderness bewitching few women ever meet with it in men and fewer still know how to value it when they do i never heard such truly noble sentiments and cannot tell how it is but you force one to believe you sure she must be the most contemptible o women who can overlook such merit  the manner and look with which all this wa spoke infused a suspicion into jones which we don care to convey in direct words to the reader instead of making any answer he said i am afraid madam i have made too tiresome a visit and offered to take his leave  not at all sir answered mrs fitzpatrick  indeed i pity you mr jones indeed i do but if you are going consider of the scheme i have mentioned i am convinced you will approve of it and let me see you again as soon as you can  tomorrow morning if you will or at least some time tomorrow i shall be at home all day  jones then after many expressions of thanks very respectfully retired nor could mrs fitzpatrick forbear making a present of a look at parting by which if he had understood nothing he must have had no understanding in the language of the eyes in reality it confirmed his resolution of returning to her no more for faulty as he has appeared in this history his whole thoughts were now so confined to his sophia that i believe no woman upon earth could have now drawn him into an act of inconstancy  fortune however who was not his friend resolved as he intended to give her no second opportunity to make the best of this and accordingly produced the tragical incident which we are now in sorrowful notes to record  chap x the consequence of the preceding visit mr fitzpatrick having received the letter beforementioned from mrs western and being by that means acquainted with the place to which his wife was retired returned directly to bath and thence the day afterward set forward to london  the reader has been already often informed of the jealous temper of this gentleman he may likewise be pleased to remember the suspicion which he had at upton conceived of jones upon his finding him in the room with mrs waters and though sufficient reasons had afterward appeared entirely to clear that suspicion yet now reading so handsome a character of mr jones from his wife caused him to reflect that she likewise was in the inn at the same time and jumbled together such a confusion o circumstances in a head which was naturally none o the clearest that the whole produced that greeney monster mentioned by shakespeare in his tragedy o othello  and now as he was enquiring in the street after his wife and had just received directions to the door unfortunately mr jones was issuing from it  fitzpatrick did not yet recollect the face of jones however seeing a young welldressed fellow comin from his wife he made directly up to him and asked him what he had been doing in that house fo i am sure said he you must have been in it as saw you come out of it  jones answered very modestly that he had been visiting a lady there to which fitzpatrick replied what business have you with the lady upon which jones who now perfectly remembre the voice features and indeed coat of the gentleman cried out  ha my good friend give m your hand i hope there is no ill blood remaining between us upon a small mistake which happene so long ago  upon my soul sir said fitzpatrick i done know your name nor your face indeed si said jones neither have i the pleasure of knowing your name but your face i very well remember to have seen before at upton where a foolish quarrel happened between us which if it is not mad up yet we will now makeup over a bottle  at upton cried the other  ha upon my soul i believe your name is jones indeed answered he it is  o upon my soul cries fitzpatrick you are the very man i wanted to meet  upon my soul i will drink a bottle with you presently but first i will give you a great knock over the pate there is for you you rascal upon my soul if you do not give me satisfaction for that blow i will give you another and then drawing his word puts himself in a posture of defense which as the only science he understood  jones was a little staggered by the blow which came me what unexpectedly but presently recovering himself he also drew and though he understood nothing f fencing pressed on so boldly upon fitzpatrick that he at down his guard and sheathed one half of his word in the body of the said gentleman who had  sooner received it than he stepped backwards dropped e point of his sword and leaning upon it cried i have satisfaction enough i am a dead man  i hope not cries jones but whatever be the consequence you must be sensible you have drawn it upon yourself at this instant a number of fellows rushed in and seized jones who told them he should make no resistance and begged some of them at least would take care of the wounded gentleman  ay cries one of the fellows the wounded gentleman will be taken care enough of for i suppose he has not many hours to live as for you sir you have a month at least good yet d  n me jack said another he has prevented his voyage hes bound to another port now and many other  jests was our poor jones made the subject of by ese fellows who were indeed the gang employed lord fellamar and had dogged him into the house mrs fitzpatrick waiting for him at the corner of e street when this unfortunate accident happened  the officer who commanded this gang very wisely concluded that his business was now to deliver his prisoner into the hands of the civil magistrate h ordered him therefore to be carried to a public house where having sent for a constable he delivered him to his custody  the constable seeing mr jones very well dres and hearing that the accident had happened in a due treated his prisoner with great civility and at hi request dispatched a messenger to enquire after the wounded gentleman who was now at a tavern under the surgeons hands the report brought bac was that the wound was certainly mortal and the were no hopes of life upon which the constabl informed jones that he must go before a justice he answered wherever you please i am indifferen as to what happens to me for though i am convince i am not guilty of murder in the eye of the law yet the weight of blood i find intolerable upon m mind  jones was now conducted before the justice when the surgeon who dressed mr fitzpatrick appeared an deposed that he believed the wound to be mortal upon which the prisoner was committed to the gat house it was very late at night so that jones would not send for partridge till the next morning and as he never shut his eyes till seven so it was ne twelve before the poor fellow who was great frightened at not hearing from his master so long received a message which almost deprived him of  being when he heard it  he went to the gate house with trembling kne and a beating heart and was no sooner arrived in t presence of jones than he lamented the misfortune that had befallen him with many tears looking the while frequently about him in great terror f as the news now arrived that mr fitzpatrick w dead the poor fellow apprehended every minute that s ghost would enter the room at last he delivered him a letter which he had like to have forgot d which came from sophia by the hands of black eorge  jones presently dispatched every one out of the oom and having eagerly broke open the letter ad as follows  you owe the hearing from me again to an accident which i own surprises me my aunt has just now shown me a letter from you to lady bellaston which contains a proposal of marriage i am convinced it is your own hand and what more surprises me is that it is dated at the very time when you would have me imagine you was under such concern on my account  i leave you to comment on this fact all i desire is that your name may never more be mentioned to  s w   of the present situation of mr joness mind and the pangs with which he was now tormented e cannot give the reader a better idea than by sayg his misery was such that even thwackum would most have pitied him but bad as it is we shall at esent leave him in it as his good genius if he really d any seems to have done and here we put an d to the sixteenth book of our history  the history of a foundling book xvii containing three days chap i containing a portion of introductory writing when a comic writer has made his principal characters as happy as he can or when a tragic writer has brought them to the highest pitch of human misery they both conclud their business to be done and that their work i come to a period  had we been of the tragic complexion the reade must allow we were now very nearly arrived at this period since it would be difficult for the devil or any of his representatives on earth to have contrived much greater torments for poor jones than those to which we left him in the last chapter and as for sophia goodnatured woman would hardly wish more unasiness to a rival than what she must at present be pposed to feel what then remains to complete e tragedy but a murder or two and a few moral entences  but to bring our favorites out of their present nguish and distress and to land them at last on the ore of happiness seems a much harder task a ask indeed so hard that we do not undertake to exeute it in regard to sophia it is more than probae that we shall somewhere or other provide a good usband for her in the end either blifil or my lord or somebody else but as to poor jones such e the calamities in which he is at present involved wing to his imprudence by which if a man does t become a felon to the world he is at least a h de se so destitute is he now of friends and so ersecuted by enemies that we almost despair of inging him to any good and if our reader deghts in seeing executions i think he ought not to e any time in taking a first row at tyburn  this i faithfully promise that notwithstanding any ffection which we may be supposed to have for this ogue whom we have unfortunately made our hee we will lend him none of that supernatural assisnce with which we are entrusted upon condition  we use it only on very important occasions  he does not therefore find some natural means of  extricating himself from all his distresses we ill do no violence to the truth and dignity of hisy for his sake for we had rather relate that he as hanged at tyburn which may very probably be e case than forfeit our integrity or shock the faith of our reader  in this the ancients had a great advantage over  moderns their mythology which was at that  more firmly believed by the vulgar than any eligion is at present gave them always an opportunity of delivering a favorite hero their deitie were always ready at the writers elbow to execut any of his purposes and the more extraordinary the invention was the greater was the surprise and deligh of the credulous reader those writers could with greater ease have conveyed a friend from one country to another nay from one world to another and have brought him back again than a poor circumscribe modern can deliver him from a goal  the arabians and persians had an equal advantage in writing their tales from the genii and faries which the believe in as an article of their faith upon the authority of koran itself to natural means alone we are confined let us try therefore what by these means may be done for poor jones though to confess the truth something whispers m in the ear that he does not yet know the worst of hi fortune and that a more shocking piece of new than any he has yet heard remains for him in the un opened leaves of fate  chap ii the generous and grateful behavior of mrs miller mr allworthy and mrs miller were just sat dow to breakfast when blifil who had gone o very early that morning returned to make one of the company  he had not been long seated before he began  follows good lord my dear uncle what do yo think has happened i vow i am afraid of telling you for fear of shocking you with the remembrance of ever having shown any kindness to suc a villain what is the matter child said the uncle i fear i have shown kindness in my li to the unworthy more than once but chari does not adopt the vices of its objects o si returned blifil it is not without the secret direct on of providence that you mentioned the word adoption your adopted son sir that jones that wretch whom you nourished in your bosom has proved one of the greatest villains upon earth by all that is sacred it is false cries mrs miller mr jones is no villain he is one of the worthiest creatures breathing and if any other person had called him villain i would have thrown all this boiling water in his face mr allworthy ooked very much amazed at this behavior but e did not give him leave to speak before turnng to him she cried i hope you will not be angry with me i would not offend you sir for the world but indeed i could not bear to hear him called so i must own madam said allworthy very gravely i am a little surprised to hear you so warmly defend a fellow you do not know o i do know him mr allworthy said she indeed i do i should be the most ungrateful of all wretches if i denied it o he has preserved me and my little family we have all reason to bless him and turn the hearts of his malicious enemies i know i find i see he has such you surprise me madam still more said allworthy sure you must mean some other it is impossible you should have any such obligations to the man my nephew mentions too surely answered he i have obligations to him of the greatest and tenderest kind he has been the preserver of me and mine  believe me sir he has been abused grossly abused to you i know he has or you whom i know to be all goodness and honor would not after the many kind and tender things i have heard you say of this poor helpless child have so disdainfully called him fellow indeed my best of friends he deserves a kinder appellation from you had you heard the good the kind the grateful things which i have heard him utter of you he never mentions your name but with a sort of adoration in this very room i have seen him on his knees imploring all the blessings of heaven upon your head i do not love that child there better than he loves you  i see sir said blifil with one of those grinning sneers with which the devil marks his bes beloved mrs miller really does know him  suppose you will find she is not the only one of you acquaintance to whom he has exposed you a for my character i perceive by some hints she has thrown out he has been very free with it but i forgive him and the lord forgive you sir says mrs miller we have all sins enough to stand in need of his forgiveness  upon my word mrs miller said allworthy i do not take this behavior of yours to my nephew kindly and i do assure you as any reflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest of men they would only serve if that were possible to heighten my resentment against him for i must tell you mrs miller the young man who now stands before you has ever been the warmest advocate for the ungratefu wretch whose cause you espouse this i think when you hear it from my own mouth will make you wonder at so much baseness and ingratitude  you are deceived sir answered mrs miller if they were the last words which were to issue from my lips i would say you were deceived and i once more repeat it the lord forgive those who have deceived you i do not pretend to say the young man is without faults but they are the faults of wildness and of youth faults which he may nay which i am certain he will relinquish and if he should not they are vastly overbalance by one of the most humane tender honest hearts that ever man was blessed with  indeed mrs miller said allworthy had this been related of you i should not have believed it indeed sir answered she you will believe every thing i have said i am sure you will and when you have heard the story which i shall tell you for i will tell you all you will be so far from being offended that you will own i know your justice so well that i must have been the most despicable and most ungrateful of wretches if i had acted any other part than i have  well madam said allworthy i shall be very glad to hear any good excuse for a behavior which i must confess i think wants an excuse and now madam will you be pleased to let my nephew proceed in his story without interruption he would not have introduced a matter of slight consequence with such a preface perhaps even this story will cure you of your mistake  mrs miller gave tokens of submission and then mr blifil began thus i am sure sir if you dont think proper to resent the ill usage of mrs miller i shall easily forgive what affects me only i think your goodness has not deserved this indignity at her hands well child said allworthy but what is this new instance what has he done of late what cries blifil notwithstanding all mrs miller has said i am very sorry to relate and what you should never have heard from me had it not been a matter impossible to conceal from the whole world in short he has killed a man i will not say murdered  for perhaps it may not be so construed in law and i hope the best for his sake   allworthy looked shocked and blessed himself and then turning to mrs miller he cried well madam what say you now  why i say sir answered she that i never was more concerned at any thing in my life but if the fact be true i am convinced the man wh ever he is was in fault heaven knows there ar many villains in this town who make it their business to provoke young gentlemen nothing but the greatest provocation could have tempte him for of all the geetlemen i ever had in my house i never saw one so gentle or so sweettempered he was beloved by every one in the house and every one who came near it  while she was thus running on a violent knocking at the door interrupted the conversation and prevented her from proceeding any further or from receiving any answer for as she concluded this wa a visiter to mr allworthy she hastily retired taking with her her little girl whose eyes were all ove blubbered at the melancholy news she heard of jones who used to call her his little wife and not only gave her many playthings but spent whole hours in playing with her himself  some readers may perhaps be pleased with these minute circumstances in relating of which we follow the example of plutarch one of the best of ou brother historians and others to whom they may appear trivial will we hope at least pardon them as we are never prolix on such occasions  chap iii the arrival of mr western with some matters concerning the paternal authority mrs miller had not long left the room when mr western entered but not before a small wrangling bout had passed between him and his chairmen for the fellows who had taken up their burden at the hercules pillars had conceived no hopes of having any future good customer in the squire and they were moreover farther encouraged by his generosity for he had given them of his own accord sixpence more than their fare they therefore very boldly demanded another shilling which so provoked the squire that he not only bestowed many heary curses on them at the door but retained his anger after he came into the room swearing that all the londoners were like the court and thought of nothing but plundering country gentlemen d  n me says he if i will not walk in the rain rather than get into one of their handbarrows again they have jolted me more in a mile than brown bess would in a long fox chase  when his wrath on this occasion was a little appeased he resumed the same passionate tone on another there says he there is fine business forwards now the hounds have changed at last and when we imagined we had a fox to deal with odratit it turns out to be a badger at last  pray my good neighbor said allworthy drop your metaphors and speak a little plainer why then says the squire to tell you plainly we have been all this time afraid of a son of a whore of a bastard of somebodys i dont know who is not i  and now here is a confounded son of a whore of a lord who may be a bastard too for ought i know or care for he shall never have a daughter of mine by my consent they have beggared the nation but they shall never beggar me my land shall never be sent over to hannover  you surprise me much my good friend said allworthy why zounds i am surprised myself answered the squire i went to zee sister western last night according to her own appointment and there i was a had into a whole roomfull of women  there was my lady cousin bellaston and my lady betty and my lady catharine and my lady i dont know who d  n me if ever yo catch me among such a kennel of hooppettico b  s d  n me i would rather be run by m own dogs as one acton was that the story book says was turned into a hare and his own dogs killed un and eat un odrabbetit no morta was ever run in such a manner if i dodged on way one had me if i offered to clap back another snapd me o certainly one of the great matches in england says one cousin here he attempted to mimic them a very advantageous offer indeed cries another cousin for you mu know they be all my cousins thof i never zee half oum before surely says that fat a   b  my lady bellaston cousin you must be ou of your wits to think of refusing such an offer  now i begin to understand says allworthy some person has made proposals to miss western which the ladies of the family approve but is not t your liking  my liking said western how the devil should it i tell you it is a lord and those are alway volks whom you know i always resolved to have nothing to do with did unt i refuse a matter vorty years purchase now for a bit of land which one oum had a mind to put into a park only because i would have no dealing with lords and do think i would marry my daughter zu besides bent i engaged to you and did i ever go off an bargain when i had promised  as to that point neighbor said allworthy entirely release you from any engagement n contract can be binding between parties who have not a full power to make it at that time nor eve afterward acquire the power of fulfilling it  slud then answered western i tell you i have power and i will fulfill it come along with m directly to doctors commons i will get a license and i will go to sister and take away the wench by force and she shall ha un or i will lock her up and keep her upon bread and water as long as she lives  mr western said allworthy shall i beg you will hear my full sentiments on this matter hear thee ay to be sure i will answered he why then sir cries allworthy i can truly say without a compliment either to you or to the young lady that when this match was proposed i embraced it very readily and heartily from my regard to you both an alliance between two families so nearly neighbors and between whom there had always existed so mutual an intercourse and good harmony i thought a most desirable event and with regard to the young lady not only the concurrent opinion of all who knew her but my own observation assured me that she would be an inestimable treasure to a good husband i shall say nothing of her personal qualifications which certainly are admirable her goodnature her charitable disposition her modesty are too well known to need any panegyric but she has one quality which existed in a high degree in that best of women who is now one of the first angels which as it is not of a glaring kind more commonly escapes observation so little indeed is it remarked that i want a word to express it i must use negatives on this occasion i never heard any thing of pertness or what is called a repartee out of her mouth no pretense to wit much less to that kind of wisdom which is the result only of great learning and experience the affectation of which in a woman is as absurd as any of the affectations of an ape no dictatorial sentiments no judicial opinions no profound criticisms whenever i have seen her in the company of men she has been all attention with the modesty of a learner not the forwardness of a teacher you pardon me for it but i once to try her only desired her opinion on a point which was controverted between mr thwackum and square to which she answered with much sweetness you will pardon me good mr allworthy i am sure yo cannot in earnest think me capable of deciding any point in which two such gentlemen disagree thwackum and square who both alike though themselves sure of a favorable decision seconded my request she answered with the same good humor i must absolutely be excused for i will affront neither so much as to give my judgment on his side indeed she always showed the highest deference to the understanding of men a quality absolutely essential to the making a good wife i shall only add that as she is most apparently void of all affectation this deference must be certainly real  here blifil sighed bitterly upon which western whose eyes were full of tears at the praise of sophia blubbered out dont be chickenhearted for shat ha her d  n me shat ha her if she was twenty times as good  remember your promise sir cried allworthy i was not to be interrupted well shat unt answered the squire i will not speak another word  now my good friend continued allworthy i have dwelt so long on the merit of this young lady partly as i really am in love with her character and partly that fortune for the match in that light is really advantageous on my nephews side might not be imagined to be my principal view in having so eagerly embraced the proposal indeed i heartily wished to receive so great a jewel into my family but though i may wish for many good things i would not therefore steal them o be guilty of any violence or injustice to possess myself of them now to force a woman into a marriage contrary to her consent or approbation is an act of such injustice and oppression that i wish the laws of our country could restrain it but a good conscience is never lawless in the worst regulated state and will provide those laws for itself which the neglect of legislators has forgotten to supply this is surely a case of that kind for is it not cruel nay impious to force a woman into that state against her will for her behavior in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most dreadful court of judicature and to answer at the peril of her soul to discharge the matrimonial duties in an adequate manner is no easy task and shall we lay this burden upon a woman while we at the same time deprive her of all that assistance which may enable her to undergo it shall we tear her very heart from her while we enjoin her duties to which a whole heart is scarce equal i must speak very plainly here i think parents who act in this manner are accessaries to all the guilt which their children afterward incur and of course must before a just judge expect to partake of their punishment but if they could avoid this good heaven is there a soul who can bear the thought of having contributed to the damnation of his child  for these reasons my best neighbor as i see the inclinations of this young lady are most unhappily averse to my nephew i must decline any further thoughts of the honor you intended him though i assure you i shall always retain the most grateful sense of it  well sir said western the froth bursting forth from his lips the moment they were uncorked you cannot say but i have heard you out and now i expect you will hear me and if i dont answer every word ot why then i will consent to gee the matter up first then i desire you to answer me one question did not i beget her did not i beget her answer me that they say indeed it is a wise father that knows his own child but i am sure i have the best title to her for i bred her up but i believe you will allow me to be her father and if i be am not i to govern my own child i ask you that am i not to govern my own child and if i am to govern her in other matters surely i am to govern her in this which concerns her most and what am i desiring all this while am i desiring her to do any thing for me to give me anything  zu much on the other side that i am only desiring her to take half my estate now and the other half when i die well and what is it all vor why is unt it to make her happy it is enough to make one mad to hear volks talk if i was going to marry myself then she would ha reason to cry and to blubber but on the contrary have not i offered to bind down my land in zuch a manner that i could not marry if i would seeing as narro woman upon earth would ha me what the devil in hell can i do more i contribute to her damnation  zounds i would zee all the world d  d bevore her little vinger should be hurt indeed mr allworthy you must excuse me but i am surprised to hear you talk in zuch a manner and i must say take it how you will that i thought you had more sense  allworthy resented this reflection only with a smile nor could he if he would have endeavored it have conveyed into that smile any mixture of malice or contempt his smiles at folly were indeed such as we may suppose the angels bestow on the absurdities of mankind  blifil now desired to be permitted to speak a few words as to using any violence on the young lady i am sure i shall never consent to it my conscience will not permit me to use violence on any one much less on a lady for whom however cruel she is to me i shall always preserve the purest and sincerest affection but yet i have read that women are seldom proof against perseverance why may i not hope then by such perseverance at last to gain those inclinations in which for the future i shall perhaps have no rival for as for this lord mr western is so kind to prefer me to him and sure sir you will not deny but that a parent has at least a negative voice in these matters nay i have heard this very young lady herself say so more than once and declare that she thought children inexcusable who married in direct opposition to the will of their parents besides though the other ladies of the family seem to favor the pretensions of my lord i do not find the lady herself is inclined to give him any countenance alas i am too sensible that wickedest of men remains uppermost in her heart  ay ay so he does cries western  but surely says blifil when she hears of this murder which he has committed if the law should spare his life    whats that cries western murder has he committed a murder and is there any hopes of seeing him hanged  tol de roll tol lol de roll here he fell a singing and capering about the room  child says allworthy this unhappy passion of yours distresses me beyond measure i heartily pity you and would do every fair thing to promote your success  i desire no more cries blifil i am convinced my dear uncle has a better opinion of me than to think that i myself would accept of more  lookee says allworthy you have my leave to write to visit if she will permit it  but i insist on no thoughts of violence i will have no confinement nothing of that kind attempted  well well cries the squire nothing of that shall be attempted we will try a little longer what fair means will effect and if this fellow be but hanged out of the  tol lol de roll i never heard better news in my life i warrant every thing goes to my mind  do prithee dear allworthy come and dine with me at the hercules pillars i have bespoke a shoulder of mutton roasted and a sparerib of pork and a fowl and eggsauce there will be nobody but ourselves unless we have a mind to have the landlord for i have sent parson supple down to basingstoke after my tobacco box which i left at an inn there and i would not lose it for the world for it is an old acquaintance of above twenty years standing i can tell you landlord is a vast comical bitch you will like un hugely  mr allworthy at last agreed to this invitation and soon after the squire went off singing and capering at the hopes of seeing the speedy tragical end of poor jones  when he was gone mr allworthy resumed the aforesaid subject with much gravity he told his nephew he wished with all his heart he would endeavor to conquer a passion in which i cannot says he flatter you with the hopes of succeeding it is certainly a vulgar error that aversion in a woman may be conquered by perseverance indifference may perhaps sometimes yield to it but the usual triumphs gained by perseverance in a lover are over caprice prudence affectation and often an exorbitant degree of levity which excites women not overwarm in their constitutions to indulge their vanity by prolonging the time of courtship even when they are well enough pleased with the object and resolve if they ever resolve at all to make him a very pitiful amends in the end but a fixed dislike as i am afraid this is will rather gather strength than be conquered by time besides my dear i have another apprehension which you must excuse i am afraid this passion which you have for this fine young creature has her beautiful person too much for its object and is unworthy of the name of that love which is the only foundation of matrimonial felicity to admire to like and to long for the possession of a beautiful woman without any regard to her sentiments toward us is i am afraid too natural but love i believe is the child of love only at least i am pretty confident that to love the creature who we are assured hates us is not in human nature examine your heart therefore thoroughly my good boy and if upon examination you have but the least suspicion of this kind i am sure your own virtue and religion will impel you to drive so vicious a passion from your heart and your good sense will soon enable you to do it without pain  the reader may pretty well guess blifils answer but if he should be at a loss we are not at present at leisure to satisfy him as our history now hastens on to matters of higher importance and we cannot longer bear to be absent from sophia  chap iv an extraordinary scene between sophia and her aunt the lowing heifer and the bleating ewe in herds and flocks may ramble safe and unregarded through the pastures these are indeed hereafter doomed to be the prey of man yet many years are they suffered to enjoy their liberty undisturbed but if a plump do be discovered to have escaped from the forest and to repose herself in some field or grove the whole parish is presently alarmed every man is ready to set his dogs after her and if she is preserved from the rest by the good squire it is only that he may secure her for his own eating  i have considered a very fine young woman of fortune and fashion when first found strayed from the pale of her nursery to be in pretty much the same situation with this do the town is immediately in an uproar she is hunted from park to play from court to assembly from assembly to her own chamber and rarely escapes a single season from the jaws of some devourer or other for if her friends protect her from some it is only to deliver her over to one of their own choosing often more disagreeable to her than any of the rest while whole herds on flocks of other women securely and scarce regarded traverse the park the play the opera and the assembly and though for the most part at least they are at last devoured yet for a long time do they wanton in liberty without disturbance or control  of all these paragons none ever tasted more of this persecution than poor sophia her ill stars were not contented with all that she had suffered on account of blifil they now raised her another pursuer who seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done for though her aunt was less violent she was no less assiduous in teazing her than her father had been before  the servants were no sooner departed after dinner than mrs western who had opened the matter to sophia informed her that she expected his lordship that very afternoon and intended to take the first opportunity of leaving her alone with him if you do madam answered sophia with some spirit i shall take the first opportunity of leaving him by himself  how madam cries the aunt is this the return you make me for my kindness in relieving you from your confinement at your fathers you know madam said sophia the cause of that confinement was a refusal to comply with my father in accepting a man i detested and will my dear aunt who has relieved me from that distress involve me in another equally bad and do you think then madam answered mrs western that there is no difference between my lord fellamar and mr blifil very little in my opinion cries sophia and if i must be condemned to one i would certainly have the merit of sacrificing myself to my fathers pleasure then my pleasure i find said the aunt hath very little weight with you but that consideration shall not move me i act from nobler motives the view of aggrandizing my family of ennobling yourself is what i proceed upon have you no sense of ambition are there no charms in the thoughts of having a coronet on your coach none upon my honor said sophia a pincushion upon my coach would please me just as well never mention honor cries the aunt it becomes not the mouth of such a wretch i am sorry neice you force me to use these words but i cannot bear your grovelling temper you have none of the blood of the westerns in you but however mean and base your own ideas are you shall bring no imputation on mine i will never suffer the world to say of me that i encouraged you in refusing one of the best matches in england a match which besides its advantage in fotrune would do honor to almost any family and has indeed in title the advantage of ours surely says sophia i am born deficient and have not the senses with which other people are blessed there must be certainly some sense which can relish the delights of sound and show which i have not for surely mankind would not labor so much nor sacrifice so much for obtaining nor would they be so elate and proud with possessing what appeared to them as it does to me the most insignificant of all trifles  no no miss cries the aunt you are born with as many senses as other people but i assure you you are not born with a sufficient understanding to make a fool of me or to expose my conduct to the world so i declare this to you upon my word and you know i believe how fixed my resolutions are unless you agree to see his lordship this afternoon i will with my own hands deliver you tomorrow morning to my brother and will never henceforth interfere with you no see your face again sophia stood a few moments silent after this speech which was uttered in a most angry and peremptory tone and then bursting into tears she cried do with me madam whatever you please i am the most miserable undone wretch upon earth and if my dear aunt forsakes me where shall i look for a protector  my dear neice cries she you will have a very good protector in his lordship a protector whom nothing but a hankering after that vile fellow jones can make you decline indeed madam said sophia you wrong me how can you imagine after what you have shown me if i had ever any such thoughts that i should not banish them forever if it will satisfy you i will receive the sacrament upon it never to see his face again  but child dear child said the aunt be reasonable  can you invent a single objection  i have already i think told you a sufficient objection answered sophia  what cries the aunt i remember none sure madam said sophia i told you he had used me in the rudest and vilest manner indeed child answered she i never heard you or did not understand you  but what do you mean by this rude and vile manner indeed madam says sophia i am almost ashamed to tell you he caught me in his arms and pulled me down on the settee and thrust his hand into my bosom and kissed it with such violence that i have the mark upon my left breast at this moment  indeed said mrs western yes indeed madam answered sophia my father luckily came in at that instant or heaven knows what rudeness he intended to have proceeded to i am astonished and confounded cries the aunt no woman of the name of western has been ever treated so since we were a family i would have torn the eyes of a prince out if he had attempted such freedoms with me it is impossible sure sophia you must invent this to raise my indignation against him i hope madam said sophia you have too good an opinion of me to imagine me capable of telling an untruth upon my soul it is true i should have stabbed him to the heart had i been present returned the aunt yet surely he could have no dishonorable design it is impossible he durst not besides his proposals show he had not for they are not only honorable but generous i dont know the age allows too great freedoms a distant salute is all i would have allowed before the ceremony i have had lovers formerly not so long ago neither several lovers though i never would consent to marriage and i never encouraged the least freedom it is a foolish custom and what i never would agree to no man kissed more of me than my cheek it is as much as one can bring ones self to give lips up to a husband and indeed could i ever have been persuaded to marry i believe i should not have been brought to endure so much you will pardon me dear madam said sophia if i make one observation you own you had many lovers and the world knows it even if you should deny i you refused them all and i am convinced one coronet at least among them you say true dea sophy answered she i had once the offer of  title why then said sophia will you no suffer me to refuse this once it is true child said she i have refused the offer of a title bu it was not so good an offer that is not so very very good an offer  yes madam said sophia but you have had very great proposal from men of vast fortunes it was not the first nor the second nor the third advantageous match that offered itself i own it was not said she well madam continued sophia and why may not i expect to have a second perhaps better than this you are now but a young women and i am convinced would not promise to yield to the first lover of fortune nay or of title too i am  very young woman and sure i need not despair well my dear sophy cries the aunr what would you have me say why i beg that i may not be left alone this evening grant me that and i will submit if you think after what is past i ought to see him in your company well i will grant it cries the aunt sophy you know i love you and can deny you nothing you know the easiness of my nature i have not always been so easy i have been formerly thought cruel by the men i mean i was called the cruel parthenissa i have broke many a window that has had verses to the cruel parthenissa in it sophy i was never so handsome as you and yet i had something of you formerly i am a little altered kingdoms and states as tully cicero says in his epistles undergo alterations and so must the human form thus run she on for near half an hour upon herself and her conquests and cruelty till the arrival of my lord who after a most tedious visit uring which mrs western never once offered to leave he room retired not much more satisfied with the aunt than with the neice for sophia had brought er aunt into so excellent a temper that she conented to almost every thing the neice said and greed that a little distant behavior might not be mproper to so forward a lover  thus sophia by a little well directed flattery for which surely none will blame her obtained a little ease for herself and at least put off the evil day and now we have seen our heroine in a better situation than she has been for a long time before we will look a little after mr jones whom we left in he most deplorable situation that can well be imagined  chap v mrs miller and mr nightingale visit jones in the prison when mr allworthy and his nephew went to meet mr western mrs miller set fowards o her soninlaws lodgings in order to acquaint im with the accident which had befallen his friend jones but he had known it long before from parridge for jones when he left mrs miller had been furnished with a room in the same house with mr nightingale the good woman found her daughter under great affliction on account of mr jones whom having comforted as well as she could she set forwards to the gatehouse where he was and where mr nightingale was arrived before her  the firmness and constancy of a true friend is circumstance so extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress that the distress itself if it be only temporary and admits of relief is more than compensated by bringing this comfort with it nor are instances of this kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate observers have reported to say the truth want of compassion is not to be numbered among our general faults the black ingredien which fouls our disposition is envy hence our eye is seldom i am afraid turned upward to those who are manifestly greater better wiser or happie than ourselves without some degree of malignity while we commonly look down on the mean and miserable with sufficient benevolence and pity in fact i have remarked that most of the defects which have discovered themselves within my observation have arisen from envy only a hellish vice and yet one from which i have known very few absolutely exempt but enough of a subject which if pursued would lead me too far  whether it was that fortune was apprehensive lest jones should sink under the weight of his adversity and that she might thus lose the opportunity of tormenting him or whether she really abated somewhat of her severity toward him she seemed a little to relax her persecution by sending him the company of two such faithful friends and what is perhaps more rare a faithful servant for partridge though he had many imperfections wanted not fidelity and though fear would not suffer him to be hanged for his master yet the world i believe could not have bribed him to desert his cause  while jones was expressing great satsfaction in the presence of his friends partridge brought an account that mr fitzpatrick was still alive though the surgeon declared that he had very little hopes upon which jones fetching a deep sigh nightingale said to him my dear tom why should you afflict yourself so upon an accident which whatever be the consequence can be attended with no danger to you and in which your conscience cannot accuse you of having been in the least to blame if the fellow should die what have you done more than taken away the life of a ruffian in your own defense so will the coroners inquest find it and then you will be easily admitted to bail and though you must undergo the form of a trial yet it is a trial which many men would stand for you for a shilling come come mr jones says mrs miller cheer yourself up i knew you could not be the aggressor and so i told mr allworthy and so he shall acknowledge too before i have done with him  jones gravely answered that whatever might be his fate he should always lament the having shed the blood of one of his fellow creatures as one the highest misfortunes which could have befallen him but i have another misfortune of the tenderest kind  o mrs miller i have lost what i held most dear upon earth that must be a mistress said mrs miller but come come i know more than you imagine for indeed parridge had blabbed all and i have heard more than you know matters go better i promise you than you think and i would not give blifil sixpence for all the chance which he has of the lady  indeed my dear friend indeed answered jones you are an entire stranger to the cause of my grief if you was acquainted with the story you would allow my case admitted of no comfort i apprehend no danger from blifil i have undone myself dont despair replied mrs milr you know what a woman can do and if any thing be in my power i promise you i will do it to serve you it is my duty my son my dear mr nightingale who is so kind to tell me he has obligations to you on the same account knows it is my duty shall i go to the lady myself i will say any thing to her you would have me say  thou best of women cries jones taking her by the hand talk not of obligations to me  but as you have been so kind to mention it there is a favor which perhaps may be in your power i see you are acquainted with the lady how you came by your information i know not who sits indeed very near my heart if you could contrive to deliver this giving her a paper from his pocket i shall for ever acknowledge your goodness  give it me said mrs miller if i see it not in her own possession before i sleep may my next sleep be my last comfort yourself my good young man be wise enough to take warning from past follies and i warrant all shall be well and i shall yet see you happy with the most charming young lady in the world for so i hear from every one she is  believe me madam said he i do not speak the common cant of one in my unhappy situation before this dreadful accident happened p had resolved to quit a life of which i was become sensible of the wickedness as well as folly i do assure you notwithstanding the disturbances i have unfortunately occasioned in your house for which i heartily ask your pardon i am not an abandoned profligate though i have been hurried into vices i do not approve a vicious character not will i ever from this moment deserve it  mrs miller expressed great satisfaction in these declarations in the sincerity of which she averred she had an entire faith and now the remainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good woman and mr nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of mr jones in which they so well succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and satisfied than they found him to which happy alteration nothing so much contributed as the kind undertaking of mrs miller to deliver his letter to sophia which he despaired of finding any means to accomplish for when black george produced the last from sophia he informed partridge that she had strictly charged him on pain of having it communicated to her father not to bring her any answer he was moreover not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate to mr allworthy himself in this good woman who was in reality one of the worthiest creatures in the world  after about an hours visit from the lady for nightingale had been with him much longer they both took their leave promising to return to him soon during which mrs miller said she hoped to bring him some good news from his mistress and mr nightingale promised to enquire into the state of mr fitzpatricks wound and likewise to find out some of the persons who were present at the rencounter  the former of these went directly in quest of sophia whither we likewise shall now attend her  chap vi in which mrs miller pays a visit to sophia access to the young lady was by no means difficult for as she lived now on a perfect friendly footing with her aunt she was at full liberty o receive what visitants she pleased  sophia was dressing when she was acquainted that here was a gentlewoman below to wait on her as she was neither afraid nor ashamed to see any f her own sex mrs miller was immediately admitted  curtsies and the usual ceremonials between women who are strangers to each other being past sophia d i have not the pleasure to know you madam no madam answered mrs miller and i must beg pardon for intruding upon you but when you know what has induced me to give you this trouble i hope  pray what is your business madam said sophia with a little emotion madam we are not alone replied mrs miller in a low voice go out betty said sophia  when betty was departed mrs miller said i was desired madam by a very unhappy young gentleman to deliver you this letter sophia changed color when she saw the direction well knowing the hand and after some hesitation said  i could not conceive madam from your appearance that your business had been of such a nature  whomever you brought this letter from i shall not open it i should be sorry to entertain an unjust suspicion of any one but you are an utter stranger to me  if you will have patience madam answered mrs miller i will acquaint you who i am and how i came by that letter i have no curiosity madam to know any thing cries sophia but i must insist on your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you  mrs miller then fell upon her knees and in the most passionate terms implored her compassion  to which sophia answered sure madam it is surprising you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of this person i would not think madam  no madam says mrs miller you shall not think any thing but the truth i will tell you all and you will not wonder that i am interested he is the best natured creature tha ever was born  she then began and related the story of mr henderson  after this she cried this madam this is his goodness but i have much more tender obligations to him he has preserved my child  here after shedding some tears she related every thing concerning that fact suppressing only those circumstances which would have most reflected on her daughter and concluded with saying now madam you shall judge whether i can ever do enough for so kind so good so generous a young man and sure he is the best and worthiest of all human beings  the alteration in the countenance of sophia had hitherto been chiefly to her disadvantage and had inclined her complexion to too great paleness but she now waxed redder if possible than vermilion and cried i know not what to say certainly what arises from gratitude cannot be blamed  but what service can my reading his letter do your friend since i am resolved never   mrs miller fell again to her entreaties and begged to be forgiven but she could not she said carry it back well madam says sophia i cannot help it if you will force it upon me  certainly you may leave it whether i will or no what sophia meant or whether she meant any thing i will not presume to determine but mrs miller actually understood this as a hint and presently laying the letter down on the table took her leave having first begged permission to wait again on sophia which request had neither assent nor denial  the letter lay upon the table no longer than till mrs miller was out of sight for then sophia opened and read it  this letter did very little service to his cause for it consisted of little more than confessions of his own unworthiness and bitter lamentations of despair together with the most solemn protestations of his unalterable fideilty to sophia of which he said he hoped to convince her if he had ever more the honor of being admitted to her presence and that he could account for the letter to lady bellaston in such a manner that though it would not entitle him to her forgiveness he hoped at least to obtain it from her mercy and concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his thoughts than to marry lady bellaston  though sophia read the letter twice over with great attention his meaning still remained a riddle to her nor could her invention suggest to her any means to excuse jones she certainly remained very angry with him though indeed lady bellaston took up so much of her resentment that her gentle mind had but little left to bestow on any other person  that lady was most unluckily to dine this very day with her aunt western and in the afternoon they were all three by appointment to go together to the opera and thence to lady thomas hatchets drum sophia would have gladly been excused from all but she would not disoblige her aunt and as to the arts of counterfeiting illness she was so entirely a stranger to them that it never once entered into her head when she was dressed therefore down she went resolved to encounter all the horrors of the day and a most disagreeable one it proved for lady bellaston took every opportunity very civilly and slily to insult her to all which her dejection of spirits disabled her from making any return and indeed to confess the truth she was at the very best but an different mistress of repartee  another misfortune which befell sophia was the company of lord fellamar whom she met at the opera and who attended her to the drum and though both places were too public to admit of any particularities and she was farther relieved by the music at the one place and by the cards at the other she could not however enjoy herself in his company for there is something of delicacy in women which will not suffer them to be even easy in the presence of a man whom they know to have pretensions to them which they are disinclined to favor  having in this chapter twice mentioned a drum a word which our posterity it is hoped will not understand in the sense it is here applied we shall notwithstanding our present haste stop a moment to describe the entertainment here meant and the rather as we can in a moment describe it  a drum then is an assembly of well dressed persons of both sexes most of whom play at cards and the rest do nothing at all while the mistress of the house performs the part of a landlady at an inn and like the landlady of an inn prides herself in the number of her guests though she does not always like her get any thing by it  no wonder then as so much spirits must be required to support any vivacity in these scenes of dullness that we hear persons of fashion eternally complaining of the want of them a complaint confined entirely to upper life how insupportable must we imagine this round of impertinence to have been to sophia at this time how difficult must she have found it to force the appearance of gaiety into her looks when her mind dictated nothing but the tenderest sorrow and when every thought was charged with tormenting ideas  night however at last restored her to her pillow where we will leave her to soothe her melancholy atleast though incapable we are afraid of rest and shall pursue our history which something whispers us is now arrived at the eve of some great event  chap vii a pathetic scene between mr allworthy and mrs miller mrs miller had a long discourse with mr allworthy at his return from his dinner in which she accquainted him with joness having unfortunately lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their separation and with the distresses to which that loss had subjected him of all which she had received a full account from the faithful retailer partridge she then explained the obligations she had to jones not that she was entirely explicit with regard to her daughter for though she had the utmost confidence in mr allworthy and though there could be no hopes of keeping an affair secret which was unhappily known to more than half a dozen yet she could not prevail with herself to mention those circumstances which reflected most on the chastity of poor nancy but smothered that part of her evidence as cautiously as if she had been before a judge and the girl was now on her trial for the murder of a bastard  allworthy said there were few characters so absolutely vicious as not to have the least mixture of good in them however says he i cannot deny but that you had some obligations to the fellow bad as he is and i shall therefore excuse what has past already but must insist you never mention his name to me more for i promise you it was upon the fullest and plainest evidence that i resolved to take the measures i have taken well sir says she i make not the least doubt but time will show all matters in their true and natural colors and that you will be convinced this poor young man deserves better of you than some other folks that shall be nameless  madam cries allworthy a little ruffled i will not hear any reflections on my nephew and if you ever say a word more of that kind i will depart from your house that instant he is the worthiest and best of men and i once more repeat it to you he has carried his friendship to this man to a blameable length by too long concealing facts of the blackest die the ingratitude of the wretch to this good young man is what i most resent for madam i have the greatest reason to imagine he had laid a plot to supplant my nephew in my favor and to have disinherited him  i am sure sir answered mrs miller a little frightened for though mr allworthy had the utmost sweetness and benevolence in his smiles he had great terror in his frowns i shall never speak against any gentlemen you are pleased to think well of i am sure sir such behavior would very little become me especially when the gentleman is your nearest relation but sir you must not be angry with me you must not indeed for my good wishes to this poor wretch sure i may call him so now though once you would have been angry with me if i had spoke of him with the least disrespect how often have i heard you call him your son how often have you prattled to me of him with all the fondness of a parent nay sir i cannot forget the many tender expressions the many good things you have told me of his beauty and his parts and his virtues of his goodnature and generosity  i am sure sir i cannot forget them for i find them all true i have experienced them in my own cause they have preserved my family you must pardon my tears sir indeed you must when i consider the cruel reverse of fortune which this poor youth to whom i am so much obliged has suffered when i consider the loss of your favor which i know he valued more than his life i must i must lament him if you had a dagger in your hand ready to plunge into my heart i must lament the misery of one whom you have loved and i shall ever love  allworthy was pretty much moved with this speech but it seemed not to be with anger for after a short silence taking mrs miller by the hand he said very affectionately to her come madam let us consider a little about your daughter i cannot blame you for rejoicing in a match which promises to be advantageous to her but you know this advantage in a great measure depends on the fathers reconciliation i know mr nightingale very well and have formerly had concerns with him i will make him a visit and endeavor to serve you in this matter i believe he is a worldly man but as this is an only son and the thing is now irretrievable perhaps he may in time be brought to reason i promise you i will do all i can for you  many were the acknowledgments which the poor woman made to allworthy for this kind and generous offer nor could she refrain from taking this occasion again to express her gratitude toward jones to whom said she i owe the opportunity of giving you sir this present trouble allworthy gently stopped her but he was too good a man to be really offended with the effects of so noble a principle as now actuated mrs miller and indeed had not this new affair inflamed his former anger against jones it is possible he might have been a little softened toward him by the report of an action which malice itself could not have derived from an evil motive  mr allworthy and mrs miller had been above an hour together when their conversation was put an end to by the arrival of blifil and another person which other person was no less than mr dowling the attorney who was now become a great favorite with mr blifil and whom mr allworthy at the desire of his nephew had made his steward and had likewise recommended him to mr western from whom the attorney received a promise of being promoted to the same office upon the first vacancy and in the mean time was employed in transacting some affairs which the squire then had in london in relation to a mortgage  this was the principal affair which then brought mr dowling to town therefore he took the same opportunity to charge himself with some money for mr allworthy and to make a report to him of some other business in all which as it was of much too dull a nature to find any place in this history we will leave the uncle nephew and their lawyer concerned and resort to other matters  chap viii containing various matters before we return to mr jones we will take one more view of sophia  though that young lady had brought her aunt into great good humor by those soothing methods which we have before related she had not brought her in the least to abate of her zeal for the match with lord fellamar this zeal was now inflamed by lady bellaston who had told her the preceding evening that she was well satisfied from the conduct of sophia and from her carriage to his lordship that all delays would be dangerous and that the only way to succeed was to press the match forward with such rapidity that the young lady should have no time to reflect and be obliged to consent while she searce knew what she did in which manner she said one half of the marriages among people of condition were brought about a fact very probably true and to which i suppose is owing the mutual tenderness which afterward exists among so many happy couples  a hint of the same kind was given by the same lady to lord fellamar and both these so readily embraced the advice that the very next day was at his lordships request appointed by mrs western for a private interview between the young parties this was communicated to sophia by her aunt and asisted upon in such high terms that after having urged every thing she possibly could invent against it without the least effect she at last agreed to give the highest instance of complaisance which any young lady can give and consented to see his lordship  as conversations of this kind afford no great entertainment we shall be excused from reeiting the whole that past atthis interview in which after his lordship had made many declarations of the most pure and ardent passions to the silent blushing sophia she at last collected all the spirits she could raise and with a trembling low voice said my lord you must be yourself conscious whether your former behavior to me has been consistent with the professions you now make is there answered he no way by which i can atone for madness what i did i am afraid must have too plainly convinced you that the violence of love had deprived me of my senses  indeed my lord said she it is in your power to give me a proof of an affection which i much rather wish to encourage and to which i should think myself more beholden name it madam said my lord very warmly  my lord says she looking down upon her fan i know you must be sensible how uneasy this pretended passion of yours has made me  can you be so cruel to call it pretended says he yes my lord answered sophia all professions of love to those whom we persecute are most insulting pretenses this pursuit of yours is to me a most cruel persecution nay it is taking a most ungenerous advantage of my unhappy situation most lovely most adoreable charmer do not accuse me cries he of taking an ungenerous advantage while i have no thoughts but what are directed to your honor and interest and while i have no view no hope no ambition but to throw myself honor fortune every thing at your feet  my lord says she it is that fortune and those honors which give you the advantage of which i complain these are the charms which have seduced my relations but to me they are things indifferent if your lordship will merit my gratitude there is but one way  pardon me divine creature said he there can be none all i can do for you is so much your due and will give me so much pleasure that there is no room for your gratitude  indeed my lord answered she you may obtain my gratitude my good opinion every kind thought and wish which it is in my power to bestow nay you may obtain them with ease for sure to a generous mind it must be easy to grant my request let me beseech you then to cease a pursuit in which you can never have any success for your own sake as well as mine i entreat this favor for sure you are too noble to have any pleasure in tormenting an unhappy creature what can your lordship propose but uneasiness to yourself by a perseverance which upon my honor upon my soul cannot shall not prevail with me whatever distresses you may drive me to here my lord fetched a deep sigh and then said  is it then madam that i am so unhappy to be the object of your dislike and scorn or will you pardon me if i suspect there is some other  here he hesitated and sophia answered with some spirit my lord i shall not be accountable to you for the reasons of my conduct i am obliged to your lordship for the generous offer you have made i own it is beyond either my deserts or expectations yet i hope my lord you will not insist on my reasons when i declare i cannot accept it lord fellamar returned much to this which we do not perfectly understand and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either to sense or grammar but he concluded his ranting speech with saying that if she has preengaged herself to any gentleman however unhappy it would make him he should think himself bound in honor to desist perhaps my lord laid too much emphasis on the word gentleman for we cannot else well account for the indignation with which he inspired sophia who in her answer seemed greatly to resent some affront he had given her  while she was speaking with her voice more raised than usual mrs western came into the room the fire glaring in her cheeks and the flames bursting from her eyes i am ashamed says she my lord of the reception which you have met with i assure your lordship we are all sensible of the honor done us and i must tell you miss western the family expect a different behavior from you here my lord interfered on behalf of the young lady but to no purpose the aunt proceeded till sophia pulled out her handkerchief threw herself into a chair and burst into a violent fit of tears  the remainder of the conversation between mrs western and his lordship till the latter withdrew consisted of bitter lamentations on his side and on hers of the strongest assurances that her neice should and would consent to all he wished indeed my lord says she the girl has had a foolish education neither adapted to her fortune nor her family her father i am sorry to say it is to blame for every thing the girl has silly country notions of bashfulness nothing else my lord upon my honor i am convinced she has a good understanding at the bottom and will be brought to reason  this last speech was made in the absence of sophia for she had sometime before left the room with more appearance of passion than she had ever shown on any occasion and now his lordship after many expressions of thanks to mrs western many ardent professions of passion which nothing could conquer and many assurances of perseverance which mrs western highly encouraged took his leave for this time  before we relate what now passed between mrs western and sophia it may be proper to mention an unfortunate accident which had happened and which had occasioned the return of mrs western with so much fury as we have seen  the reader then must know that the maid who at present attended on sophia was recommended by lady bellaston with whom she had lived for some time in the capacity of a combbrush she was a very sensible girl and had received the strictest instructions to watch her young lady very carefully these instructions we are sorry to say were communicated to her by mrs honor into whose favor lady bellaston had now so ingratiated herself that the violent affection which the good waiting woman had formerly borne to sophia was entirely obliterated by that great attachment which she had to her new mistress  now when mrs miller was departed betty for that was the name of the girl returning to her young lady found her very attentively engaged in reading a long letter and the visible emotions which she betrayed on that occasion might have well accounted for some suspicions which the girl entertained but indeed they had yet a stronger foundation for she had overheard the whole scene which passed between sophia and mrs miller  mrs western was acquainted with all this matter by betty who after receiving many commendations and some rewards for her fidelity was ordered that if the woman who brought the letter came again she should introduce her to mrs western herself  unluckily mrs miller returned at the very time when sophia was engaged with his lordship betty according to order sent her directly to the aunt who being mistress of so many circumstances relating to what had past the day before easily imposed upon the poor woman to believe that sophia had communicated the whole affair and so pumped everything out of her which she knew relating to the letter and relating to jones  this poor creature might indeed be called simplicity itself she was one of that order of mortals who are apt to believe every thing which is said to them to whom nature has neither indulged the offensive nor defensive weapons of deceit and who are consequently liable to be imposed upon by any one who will only be at the expense of a little falsehood for that purpose mrs western having drained mrs miller of all she knew which indeed was but little but which was sufficient to make the aunt suspect a great deal dismissed her with assurances that sophia would not see her that she would send no answer to the letter nor ever receive another  nor did she suffer her to depart without a handsome lecture on the merits of an office to which she could afford no better name than that of procuress   this discovery had greatly discomposed her temper when coming into the apartment next to tha in which the lovers were she overheard sophia very warmly protesting against his lordships addresses at which the rage already kindled burst forth and she rushed in upon her niece in a furious manner as we have already described together with what past a that time till his lordships departure  no sooner was lord fellamar gone than mrs western returned to sophia whom she upbraided i the most bitter terms for the ill use she had made of the confidence reposed in her and for her treachery in conversing with a man with whom she had offered but the day before to bind herself in the most solemn oath never more to have any conversation sophia protested she had maintained no such conversation how miss western said the aunt will you deny your receiving a letter from him yesterday a letter madam answered sophia somewhat surprised it is not very well bred miss replies the aunt to repeat my words i say a letter and i insist upon your showing it me immediately i scorn a lie madam said sophia i did receive a letter but it was without my desire and indeed i may say against my consent indeed indeed miss cries the aunt you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at all but where is the letter for i will see it  to this peremptory demand sophia paused some time before she returned an answer and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not the letter in her pocket which was indeed true upon which her aunt losing all manner of patience asked her neice this short question whether she would resolve to marry lord fellamar or no to which she received the strongest negative mrs western then replied with an oath or something very like one that she would early the next morning deliver her back into her fathers hands  sophia then began to reason with her aunt in the following manner why madam must i of necessity be forced to marry at all consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own case and how much kinder your parents were in leaving you to your liberty what have i done to forfeit this liberty i will never marry contrary to my fathers consent nor without asking yours  and when i ask the consent of either improperly it will be then time enough to force some other marriage upon me can i bear to hear this cries mrs western from a girl who has now a letter from a murderer in her pocket i have no such letter i promise you answered sophia and if he be a murderer he will soon be in no condition to give you any further disturbance  how miss western said the aunt have you the assurance to speak of him in this manner to own your affection for such a villain to my face sure madam said sophia you put a very strange construction on my words indeed miss western cries the lady i shall not bear this usage you have learnt of your father this manner of treating me he has taught you to give me the lie he has totally ruined you by his false system of education and please heaven he shall have the comfort of its fruits for once more i declare to you that tomorrow morning i will carry you back i will withdraw all my forces from the field and remain henceforth like the wise king of prussia in a state of perfect neutrality you are both too wise to be regulated by my measures so prepare yourself for tomorrow morning you shall evacuate this house  sophia remonstrated all she could but her aunt was deaf to all she said in this resolution therefore we must at present leave her as there seems to be no hopes of bringing her to change it  chap ix what happened to mr jones in the prison mr jones past above twentyfour melancholy hours by himself unless when relieved by the company of partridge before mr nightingale returned not that this worthy young man had deserted or forgot his friend for indeed he had been much the greatest part of the time employed in his service  he had heard upon enquiry that the only persons who had seen the beginning of the unfortunate rencounter were a crew belonging to a man of war which then lay at deptford to deptford therefore he went in search of this crew where he was informed that the men he sought after were all gone ashore he then traced them from place to place till at last he found two of them drinking together with a third person at a hedgetavern near aldersgate  nightingale desired to speak with jones by himself for partridge was in the room when he came in as soon as they were alone nightingale taking jones by the hand cried come my brave friend be not too much dejected at what i am going to tell you i am sorry i am the messenger of bad news i guess already what that news is cries jones the poor gentleman then is dead  i hope not answered nightingale he was alive this morning though i will not flatter you i fear from the accounts i could get that his wound is mortal but if the affair be exactly as you told it your own remorse would be all you would have reason to apprehend let what would happen but forgive me my dear tom if i entreat you to make the worst of your story to your friends if you disguise any thing to us you will only be an an enemy to yourself  what reason my dear jack have i ever given you said jones to stab me with so cruel a suspicion have patience cries nightingale and i will tell you all after the most diligent enquiry i could make i at last met with two of the fellows who were present at this unhappy accident and i am sorry to say they do not relate the story so much in your favor as you yourself have told it why what do they say cries jones indeed what i am sorry to repeat as i am afraid o the consequence of it to you they say that they were at too great a distance to overhear any word that passed between you but they both agree tha the first blow was given by you then upon my soul answered jones they injure me he no only struck me first but struck me without the leas provocation what should induce those villains to accuse me falsely nay that i cannot guess said nightingale and if you yourself and i who am so heartily your friend cannot conceive a reason why they should beli you what reason will an in different court of justice be able to assign why they should not believe them i repeated the question to them several times and so did another gentleman who was present who i believe is a seafarin man and who really acted a very friendly part b you for he begged them often to consider tha there was the life of a man in the case and aske them over and over if they were certain to which they both answered that they were and would abid by their evidence upon oath for heavens sake my dear friend recollect yourself for if this should appear to be the fact it will be your business to think in time of making the best of your interest  would not shock you but you know i believe the severity of the law whatever verbal provocations may have been given you alas my friend cries jones what interest has such a wretch as i besides do you think i would even wish to liv with the reputation of a murderer if i had an friends as alas i have none could i have the confidence to solicit them to speak in the behalf o a man condemned for the blackest crime in human nature believe me i have no such hope but have some reliance on a throne still greatly superior which will i am certain afford me all the pro tection i merit he then concluded with many lemn and vehement protestations of the truth of what he had at first asserted  the faith of nightingale was now again staggered and began to incline to credit his friend when mrs miller appeared and made a sorrowful report of the uccess of her embassy which when jones had heard e cried out most heroically well my friend i am now indifferent as to what shall happen at least with regard to my life and if it be the will of heaven that i shall make an atonement with that for the blood i have spilt i hope the divine goodness will one day suffer my honor to be cleared and that the words of a dying man at least will be believed so far as to justify his character  a very mournful scene now past between the priner and his friends at which as few readers would ave been pleased to be present so few i believe will esire to hear it particularly related we will therere pass on to the entrance of the turnkey who acuainted jones that there was a lady without who esired to speak with him when he was at leisure  jones declared his surprise at this message he said he knew no lady in the world whom he could possibly expect to see there however as he saw o reason to decline seeing any person mrs miller and mr nightingale presently took their leave and he gave orders to have the lady admitted  if jones was surprised at the news of a visit from lady how greatly was he astonished when he discovered this lady to be no other than mrs waters  this astonishment then we shall leave him awhile  order to cure the surprise of the reader who will kewise probably not a little wonder at the arrival f this lady  who this mr waters was the reader pretty well ows what she was he must be perfectly satisfied he will therefore be pleased to remember that thi lady departed from upton in the same coach with mr fitzpatrick and the other irish gentleman an in their company traveled to the bath  now there was a certain office in the gift of m fitzpatrick at that time vacant namely that of wife for the lady who had lately filled that offic had resigned or at least deserted her duty mr fitzpatrick therefore having thoroughly examined mrs waters on the road found her extremely fit for thi place which on their arrival at bath he presentl conferred upon her and she without any scruple accepted as husband and wife this gentleman and lady continued together all the time they stayed a bath and as husband and wife they arrived together in town  whether mr fitzpatrick was so wise a man a not to part with one good thing till he had secure another which he had at present only a prospect of regaining or whether mrs waters had so well discharged her office that he intended still to retain he as principal and to make his wife as is often the case only her deputy i will not say but certain is he never mentioned his wife to her never communicated to her the letter given him by mrs western nor ever once hinted his purpose of repossessing h wife much less did he ever mention the name o jones for though he intended to fight with him wherever he met him he did not imitate those prudent persons who think a wife a mother a siste or sometimes a whole family the safest seconds o these occasions the first account therefore which she had of all this was delivered to her from his lip after he was brought hime from the tavern where h wound had been dressed  as mr fitzpatrick however had not the cleare way of telling a story at any time and was now perhaps a little more confused than usual it was some time before she discovered that the gentleman who ad given him this wound was the very same person from whom her heart had received a wound which though not of a mortal kind was yet so deep that it ad left a considerable scar behind it but no sooner was she acquainted that mr jones himself was the man who had been committed to the gatehouse for his supposed murder than she took the first opportunity of committing mr fitzpatrick to the care of is nurse and hastened away to visit the conqueror  she now entered the room with an air of gayety which received an immediate check from the melancholy aspect of poor jones who started and blessed himself when he saw her upon which she said nay i do not wonder at your surprise i believe you did not expect to see me for few gentlemen are troubled here with visits from any lady unless a wife you see the power you have over me mr jones indeed i little thought when we parted at upton that our next meeting would have been in such a place indeed madam says jones i must look upon this visit as kind few will follow the miserable especially to such dismal habitations i protest mr jones says she i can hardly persuade myself you are the same agreeable fellow i saw at upton why your face is more miserable than any dungeon in the universe what can be the matter with you i thought madam said jones as you knew of my being here you knew the unhappy reason pugh says she you have pinked a man in a duel that is all jones expressed some indignation at this levity and spoke with the utmost contrition for what had happened to which she answered well then sir if you take it so much to heart i will relieve you the gentleman is not dead and i am pretty confident is in no danger of dying the surgeon indeed who first dressed him was a young fellow and seeme desirous of representing his case to be as bad as possible that he might have the more honor from curing him but the kings surgeon has seen him since and says unless from a fever of which ther are at present no symptoms he apprehends not the least danger of life jones showed great satisfaction in his countenance at this report upon which she affirmed the truth of it adding by the mo extraordinary accident in the world i lodge at the same house and have seen the gentleman and promise you he does you justice and says what ever be the consequence that he was entirely the aggressor and that you was not in the least t blame  jones expressed the utmost satisfaction at the account which mrs waters brought him he the informed her of many things which she well knew before as who mr fitzpatrick was the occasion o his resentment etc he likewise told her sever facts of which she was ignorant as the adventure  the muff and other particulars concealing only the name of sophia he then lamented the follies an vices of which he had been guilty every one of which he said had been attended with such ill consequence that he should be unpardonoble if he did not take waning and quit those vicious courses for the future h lastly concluded with assuring her of his resolution  sin no more lest a worse thing should happen to him  mrs waters with great pleasantry ridiculed all thi as the effects of low spirits and confinement she repeated some witticisms about the devil when  was sick and told him she doubted not but shortl to see him at liberty and as lively a fellow as eve and then says she i dont question but your conscience will be safely delivered of all these qual that it is now so sick in breeding  many more things of this kind she uttered some of which it would do her no great honor in the opinion of some readers to remember nor are we quite certain but that the answers made by jones would be treated with ridicule by others we shall therefore suppress the rest of this conversation and only observe that it ended at last with perfect innocence and much more to the satisfaction of jones than of the lady for the former was greatly transported with the news she had brought him but the atter was not altogether so pleased with the penitential behavior of a man whom she had at first interview conceived a very different opinion of from what she ow entertained of him  thus the melancholy occasioned by the report of mr nightingale was pretty well effaced but the deection into which mrs miller had thrown him still continued the account she gave so well tallied with the words of sophia herself in her letter that he made not the least doubt but that she had disclosed his letter to her aunt and had taken a fixed resolution to abandon him the torments this thought gave im were to be equalled only by a piece of news which fortune yet had in store for him and which we shall communicate in the second chapter of the ensuing book  the history of a foundling book xviii containing about six days chap i a farewell to the reader we are now reader arrived at the last stage of our long journey as we have therefore traveled together through so many pages let us behave to one another like fellow traveller in a stagecoach who have passed several day in the company of each other and who notwithstanding any bickerings or litttle animositie which may have occurred on the road generally make all up at last and mount for the last time in to their vehicle with cheerfulness and good humor since after this one stage it may possibly happen to us as it commonly happens to them never to meet more  as i have here taken up this simile give me leave to carry it a little farther i intend then in this last book to imitate the good company i have mentioned in their last journey now it is well known that all jokes and raillery are at this time laid aside whatever characters any of the passengers have for the lest sake personated on the road are now thrown off and the conversation is usually plain and serious  in the same manner if i have now and then in the course of this work indulged any pleasantry for y entertainment i shall here lay it down the variety of matter indeed which i shall be obliged to am into this book will afford no room for any of those ludicrous observations which i have elsewhere made and which may sometimes perhaps have prevented thee from taking a nap when it was beginning to steal upon thee in this last book thou will find thing or at most very little of that nature all will be plain narrative only and indeed when thou st perused the many great events which this book will produce thou will think the number of pages contained in it scarce sufficient to tell the story  and now my friend i take this opportunity as i shall have no other of heartily wishing thee well if i have been an entertaining companion to thee i promise thee it is what i have desired if in any thing i have offended it was really without any inention some things perhaps here said may have t thee or thy friends but i do most solemnly declare they were not pointed at them i question not ut thou have been told among other stories of me that thou wast to travel with a very scurrilous fellow but whoever told thee so did me an injury no plan detests and despises scurrility more than myself or has any man more reason for none has ever been treated with more and what is a very seven fate i have had some of the abusive writings of those very men fathered upon me who in other of their works have abused me themselves with the utmost virulence  all these works however i am well convinced will be dead long before this page shall offer itself to thy perusal for however short the period may be o my own performances they will most probably out live their own infirm author and the weakly productions of his abusive cotemporaries  chap ii containing a very tragical incident while jones was employed in these unpleasant meditations with which we left him tormenting himself partridge came stumbling into the room with his face paler than ashes his eyes fixe in his head his hair standing an end and ever limb trembling in short he looked as he would have done had he seen a spectre or had he indeed been a spectre himself  jones who was little subject to fear could not avoid being somewhat shocked at this sudden appearance he did indeed himself change color and h voice a little faultered while he asked him what w the matter  i hope sir said partridge you will not  angry with me indeed i did not listen but i w obliged to stay in the outward room i am sure wish i had been a hundred miles off rather tha have heard what i have heard why what is the matter said jones the matter sir o god heaven answered partridge was that wom who is just gone out the woman who was wi you at upton she was partridge cries jones and did you really sir go to bed with that w man said he trembling  i am afraid what past between us is no secret said jones  nay but pray sir for heavens sake sir answer me cries partridge you know i did cries jones  why then the lord have mercy upon your soul and forgive you cries partridge but as sure as i stand here alive you have been abed with your own mother  upon these words jones became in a moment a greater picture of horror than partridge himself he was indeed for some time struck dumb with amazement and both stood staring wildly at each other at last his words found way and in an interrupted voice he said  how how what is this you tell me nay sir cries partridge i have not breath enough left to tell you now  but what i have said is most certainly true  that woman who now went out is your own mother how unlucky was it for you sir that i did not happen to see her at that time to have prevented it sure the devil himself must have contrived to bring about this wickedness  sure cries jones fortune will never have done with me till she has driven me to distraction but why do i blame fortune i am myself the cause of all my misery all the dreadful mischiefs which have befallen me are the consequences only of my own folly and vice what thou have told me partridge has almost deprived me of my senses and was mrs waters then  but why do i ask for thou must certainly know her  if thou have any affection for me nay if thou have any pity let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable woman back again to me o good heavens incest  with a mother to what am i reserved he then sell into the most violent and frantic agonies of grief and despair in which partridge declared he would not leave him but at last having vented the first torrent of passion he came a little to himself and then having acquainted partridge that he would find this wretched woman in the same house where the wounded gentleman was lodged he dispatched him in ques of her  if the reader will please to refresh his memory by turning to the scene at upton in the ninth book he will be apt to admire the many strange accident which unfortunately prevented any interview between partridge and mrs waters when she spent a whol day there with mr jones instances of this kin we may frequently observe in life where the greatest events are produced by a nice train of little circumstances and more than one example of this may be discovered by the accurate eye in this our history  after a fruitless search of two or three hours partridge returned back to his master without having seen mrs waters jones who was in a stat of desperation at his delay was almost raving man when he brought him this account he was no long however in this condition before he receive the following letter  sir since i left you i have seen a gentleman from whom i have learned something concerning yo which greatly surprises and affects me but as i have not at present leisure to communicate a matter  such high importance you must suspend your curiosity till our next meeting which shall be the first moment i am able to see you o mr jones litt did i think when i past that happy day at upton the reflection upon which is like to embitter all m future life who it was to whom i owed such perfect happiness believe me to be ever sincere your unfortunate  j waters p s i would have you comfort yourself as much as possible for mr fitzpatrick is in no manner of danger so that whatever other grievous crimes you may have to repent of the guilt of blood is not among the number     jones having received the letter let it drop for he was unable to hold it and indeed had scarce the use of any one of his faculties partridge took it up and having received consent by silence read it likewise nor had it upon him a less sensible effect the pencil and not the pen should describe the horrors which appeared in both their countenances while they both remained speechless the turnkey entered the room and without taking any notice of what sufficiently discovered itself in the faces of them both acquainted jones that a man without desired to speak with him this person was presently introduced and was no other than black george  as sights of horror were not so usual to george as they were to the turnkey he instantly saw the great disorder which appeared in the face of jones this he imputed to the accident that happened which was reported in the very worst light in mr westerns family he concluded therefore that the gentleman was dead and that mr jones was in a fair way of coming to a shameful end a thought which gave him much uneasiness for george was of a compassionate disposition and notwithstanding a small breach of friendship which he had been overtempted to commit was in the main not insensible of the obligations he had formerly received from mr jones  the poor fellow therefore scarce refrained from a tear at the present sight he told jones he was heartily sorry for his misfortunes and begged him to consider if he could be of any manner of service perhaps sir said he you may want a little matter of money upon this occasion if you do sir what little i have is heartily at your service  jones shook him very heartily by the hand and gave him many thanks for the kind offer he had made but answered he had not the least wan of that kind upon which george began to press his services more eagerly than before jones again thanked him with assurances that he wanted nothing which was in the power of any man living to give come come my good master answered george do not take the matter so much to heart things may end better than you imagine to be sure you ant the first gentleman who has killed a man and yet come off you are wide of the matter george said partridge the gentleman is not dead nor like to die dont disturb my master at present for he is troubled about a matter in which it is not in your power to do him any good you dont know what i may be able to do mr partridge answered george if his concern is about my young lady i have some news to tell my master  what do you say mr george cried jones has any thing lately happened in which my sophia is concerned my sophia how dares such a wretch as i mention her so profanely  i hope she will be yours yet answered george  why yes sir i have something to tell you about her madam western has just brought madam sophia home and there has been a terrible to do i could not possibly learn the very right of it but my master he has been in a vast big passion and so was madam western and i heard her say as she went out of doors into her chair that she would never set her foot in masters house again i dont know what is the matter not i but every thing was very quiet when i came out but robin who waited at supper said he had never seen the squire for a long while in such good humor with young madam that he kissed her several times and swore she should be her own mistress and he never would think of confining her any more i thought this news would please you and so i slipped out though it was so late to inform you of it mr jones assured george that it did greatly please him for though he should never more presume to lift his eyes toward that incomparable creature nothing could so much relieve his misery as the satisfaction he should always have in hearing of her welfare  the rest of the conversation which passed at the visit is not important enough to be here related the reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off and be pleased to hear how this great good will of the squire toward his daughter was brought about  mrs western on her first arrival at her brothers lodging began to set forth the great honors and advantages which would accrue to the family by the match with lord fellamar which her neice had absolutely refused in which refusal when the squire took the part of his daughter she fell immediately into the most violent passion and so irritated and provoked the squire that neither his patience nor his prudence could bear any longer upon which there ensued between them both so warm a bout at altercation that perhaps the regions of billingsgate never equalled it in the heat of this scolding mrs western departed and had consequently no leisure to acquaint the brother with the letter which sophia received which might have possibly produced ill effects but to say the truth i believe it never once occurred to her memory at this time  when mrs western was gone sophia who had been hitherto silent as well indeed from necessity as inclination began to return the compliment which her father had made her in taking her part against her aunt by taking his likewise against the lady this was the first time of her so doing and it was in the highest degree acceptable to the squire again he remembered that mr allworthy had insisted on an entire relinquishment of all violent means and indeed as he made no doubt but that jones would be hanged he did not in the least question succeeding with his daughter by fair means he now therefore once more gave a loose to his natural fondness for her which had such an effect on the dutiful grateful tender and affectionate heart of sophia that had her honor given to jones and something else perhaps in which he was concerned been removed i much doubt whether she would not have sacrificed herself to a man she did not like to have obliged her father she promised him she would make it the whole business of her life to oblige him and would never marry any man against his consent which brought the old man so near to his highest happiness that he was resolved to take the other step and went to bed completely drunk  chap iii allworthy visits old nightingale with a strange discovery that he made on that occasion the morning after these things had happened mr allworthy went according to his promise to visit old nightingale with whom his authority was so great that after having sat with him three hours he at last prevailed with him to consent to see his son  here an accident happened of a very extraordinary kind one indeed of those strange chances whence very good and grave men have concluded that providence often interposes in the discovery of the most secret villainy in order to caution men from quitting the paths of honesty however warily they tread in those of vice  mr allworthy at his entrance into mr nightingales saw black george he took no notice of him nor did black george imagine he had perceived him however when their conversation on the principal point was over allworthy asked nightingale whether he knew one george seagrim and upon what business he came to his house yes answered nightingale i know him very well and a most extraordinary fellow he is who in these days has been able to hoard up  00l from renting a very small estate of  0l a year and is this the story he has told you cries allworthy nay it is true i promise you said nightingale for i have the money now in my hands in five bank bills which i am to lay out either in a mortgage or in some purchase in the north of england the bank bills were no sooner produced at allworthys desire than he blessed himself at the strangeness of the discovery he presently told nightingale that these bank bills were formerly his and then acquainted him with the whole affair as there are no men who complain more of the frauds of business than highwaymen gamesters and other thieves of that kind so there are none who so bitterly exclaim against the frauds of gamesters etc as usurers brokers and other thieves of this kind whether it be that the one way of cheating is a discountenance or reflection upon the other or that money which is the common mistress of all cheats makes them regard each other in the light of rivals but nightingale no sooner heard the story than he exclaimed against the fellow in terms much severer than the justice and honesty of allworthy had bestowed on him  allworthy desired nightingale to retain both the money and the secret till he should hear farther from him and if he should in the mean time see the fellow that he would not take the least notice to him of the discovery which he had made he then returned to his lodgings where he found mrs miller in a very dejected condition on account of the information she had received from her soninlaw mr allworthy with great cheerfulness told her that he had much good news to communicate and with little further preface acquainted her that he had brought mr nightingale to consent to see his son and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect reconciliation between them though he found the father more sowered by another accident of the same kind which had happened in his family he then mentioned the running away of the uncles daughter which he had been told by the old gentleman and which mrs miller and her soninlaw did not yet know  the reader may suppose mrs miller received this account with great thankfulness and no less pleasure but so uncommon was her friendship to jones that i am not certain whether the uneasiness she suffered for his sake did not overbalance her satisfaction at hearing a piece of news tending so much to the happiness of her own family nor whether even this very news as it reminded her of the obligations she had to jones did not hurt as well as please her when her grateful heart said to her while my own family is happy how miserable is the poor creature to whose generosity we owe the beginning of all this happiness  allworthy having left her a little while to chew the cud if i may use that expression on these first tidings told her he had still something more to impart which he believed would give her pleasure i think said he i have discovered a pretty considerable treasure belonging to the young gentleman your friend but perhaps indeed his present situation may be such that it will be of no service to him the latter part of the speech gave mrs miller to understand who was meant and she answered with a sigh i hope not sir i hope so too cries allworthy with all my heart but my nephew told me this morning he had heard a very bad account of the affair  good heaven sir said she  well i must not speak and yet it is certainly very hard to be obliged to hold ones tongue when one hears  madam said allworthy you may say whatever you please you know me too well to think i have a prejudice against any one and as for that young man i assure you i should be heartily pleased to find he could acquit himself of every thing and particularly of this sad affair you can testify the affection i have formerly borne him the world i know censured me for loving him so much i did not withdraw that affection from him without thinking i had the justest cause believe me mrs miller i should be glad to find i have been mistaken mrs miller was going eagerly to reply when a servant acquainted her that a gentleman without desired to speak with her immediately allworthy then enquired for his nephew and was told that he had been for some time in his room with the gentleman who used to come to him and whom mr allworthy guessing rightly to be mr dowling he desired presently to speak with him  when dowling attended allworthy put the case of the banknotes to him without mentioning any name and asked in what manner such a person might be punished to which dowling answered he thought he might be indicted on the black act but said as it was a matter of some nicety it would be proper to go to council he said he was to attend council presently upon an affair of mr westerns and if mr allworthy pleased he would lay the case before them this was agreed to and then mrs miller opening the door cried i ask pardon i did not know you had company but allworthy desired her to come in saying he had finished his business upon which mr dowling withdrew and mrs miller introduced mr nightingale the younger to return thanks for the great kindness done him by allworthy but she had scarce patience to let the young gentleman finish his speech before she interrupted him saying o sir mr nightingale brings great news about poor mr jones he has been to see the wounded gentleman who is out of all danger of death and what is more declares he fell upon poor mr jones himself and beat him i am sure sir you would not have mr jones be a coward if i was a man myself i am sure if any man was to strike me i should draw my sword do pray my dear tell mr allworthy tell him all yourself nightingale then confirmed what mrs miller had said and concluded with many handsome things of jones who was he said one of the bestnatured fellows in the world and not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome here nightingale was going to cease when mrs miller again begged him to related all the many dutiful expressions he had heard him make use of toward mr allworthy to say the utmost good of mr allworthy cries nightingale is doing no more than strict justice and can have no merits in it but indeed i must say no man can be more sensible of the obligations he has to so good a man than is poor jones indeed sir i am convinced the weight of your displeasure is the heaviest burden he lies under he has often lamented it to me and has as often protested in the most solemn manner he had never been intentionally guilty of any offense toward you nay he has sworn he would rather die a thousand deaths than he would have his conscience upbraid him with one disrespectful ungrateful or undutiful thought toward you but i ask pardon sir i am afraid i presume to intermeddle too far in so tender a point you have spoke no more than what a christian ought cries mrs miller indeed mr nightingale answered allworthy i applaud your generous friendship and i wish he may merit it of you i confess i am glad to hear the report you bring from this unfortunate gentleman and if that matter should turn out to be as you represent it and indeed i doubt nothing of what you say i may perhaps in time be brought to think better than lately i have of this young man for this good gentle woman here nay all who know me can witness that i loved him as dearly as if he had been my own son indeed i have considered him as a child sent by fortune to my care i still remember the innocent the helpless situation in which i found him i feel the tender pressure of his little hands at this moment  he was my darling indeed he was at which words he ceased and the tears stood in his eyes  as the answer which mrs miller made may lead us into fresh matters we will here stop to account for the visible alteration in mr allworthys mind and the abatement of his anger to jones revolutions of this kind it is true do frequently occur in histories and dramatic writers for no other reason than because the history or play draws to a conclusion and are justified by authority of authors yet though we insist upon as much authority as any author whatever we shall use this power very sparingly and never but when we are driven to it by necessity which we do not at present foresee will happen in this work  this alteration then in the mind of mr allworthy was occasioned by a letter he had just received from mr square and which we shall give the reader in the beginning of the next chapter  chap iv containing two letters in very different styles my worthy friend i informed you in my last that i was forbidden the use of the waters as they were found by experience rather to increase than lessen the symptoms of my distemper i must now acquaint you with a piece of news which i believe will afflict my friends more than it has afflicted me dr harrington and dr brewster have informed me that there is no hopes of my recovery  i have somewhere read that the great use of philosophy is to learn to die i will not therefore so far disgrace mine as to show any surprise at receiving a lesson which i must be thought to have so long studied yet to say the truth one page of the gospel teaches this lesson better than all the volumes of ancient or modern philosophers the assurance it gives us of another life is a much stronger support to a good mind than all the consolations that are drawn from the necessity of nature the emptiness or satiety of our enjoyments here or any other topic of those declamations which are sometimes capable of arming our minds with a stubborn patience in bearing the thoughts of death but never of raising them to a real contempt of it and much less of making us think it a real good i would not here be understood to throw the horrid censure of atheism or even the absolute denial of immortality on all who are called philosophers many of that sect as well ancient as modern have from the light of reason discovered some hopes of a future state but in reality that light was so faint and glimmering and the hopes were so uncertain and precarious that it may be justly doubted on which side their belief turned plato himself conludes his phaedon with declaring that his best arguments amount only to raise a probability and cicero himself seems rather to profess an inclination to believe than any actual belief in the doctrines of immortality as to myself to be very sincere with you i never was much in earnest in this faith till i was in earnest a christian  you will perhaps wonder at the latter expression but i assure you it has not been till very lately that i could with truth call myself so the pride of philosophy had intoxicated my reason and the sublimest of all wisdom appeared to me as it did to the greeks of old to be foolishness god has however been so gracious to show me my error in time and to bring me into the way of truth before i sunk into utter darkness for ever  i find myself beginning to grow very weak i shall therefore hasten to the main purpose of this letter  when i reflect on the actions of my past life i know of nothing which sits heavier upon my conscience than the injustice i have been guilty of to that poor wretch your adopted son i have not indeed only connived at the villainy of others but been myself active in injustice toward him believe me my dear friend when i tell you on the word of a dying man he has been basely injured as to the principal fact upon the misrepresentation of which you discarded him i solemnly assure you he is innocent when you lay upon your supposed deathbed he was the only person in the house who testified any real concern and what happened afterward arose from the wildness of his joy on your recovery and i am sorry to say it from the baseness of another person but it is my desire to justify the innocent and to accuse none believe me my friend this young man has the noblest generosity of heart the most perfect capacity for friendship the highest integrity and indeed every virtue which can ennoble a man he has some faults but among them is not to be numbered the least want of duty or gratitude toward you on the contrary i am satisfied when you dismissed him from your house his heart bled for you more than for himself  worldly motives were the wicked and base reasons of my concealing this from you so long to reveal it now i can have no inducement but the desire of serving the cause of truth of doing right to the innocent and of making all the amends in my power for a past offense i hope this declaration therefore will have the effect desired and will restore this deserving young man to your favor the hearing of which while i am yet alive will afford the utmost consolation to  sir your most obliged obedient humble servant thomas square   the reader will after this scarce wonder at the revolution so visibly appearing in mr allworthy notwithstanding he received from thwackum by the same post another letter of a very different kind which we shall here add as it may possibly be the last time we shall have occasion to mention the name of that gentleman  sir i am not at all surprised at hearing from your worthy nephew a fresh instance of the villainy of mr square the atheists young pupil i shall not wonder at any murders he may commit and i heartily pray that your own blood may not seal up his final commitment to the place of wailing and gnashing of teeth  though you cannot want sufficient calls to repentance for the many unwarrantable weaknesses exemplified in your behavior to this wretch so much to the prejudice of your own lawful family and of your character i say though these may sufficiently be supposed to prick and goad your conscience at this season i should yet be wanting to my duty if i spared to give you some admonition in order to bring you to a due sense of your errors i therefore pray you seriously to consider the judgment which is likely to overtake this wicked villain and let it serve at least as a warning to you that you may not for the future despise the advice of one who is indefatigable in his prayers for your welfare  had not my hand been withheld from due correction i had scourged much of this diabolical spirit out of a boy of whom from his infancy i discovered the devil had taken such entire possession but reflections of this kind now come too late  i am sorry you have given away the living of westerton so hastily i should have applied on that occasion earlier had i thought you would not have acquainted me previous to the disposition  your objection to pluralities is being righteous overmuch if there were any crime in the practice so many godly men would not agree to it if the vicar of aldergrove should die as we hear he is in a declining way i hope you will think of me since i am certain you must be convinced of my most sincere attachment to your highest welfare a welfare to which all worldly considerations are as trifling as the small tithes mentioned in scripture are when compared to the weighty matters of the law  i am sir your faithful humble servant roger thwackum   this was the first time that thwackum eve wrote in this authoritative style to allworthy and of this he had afterward sufficient reason to repent as in the case of those who mistake the highest degree of goodness for the lowest degree o weakness allworthy had indeed never liked thi man he knew him to be proud and illnatured he also knew that his divinity itself was tincture with his temper and such as in many respects h himself did by no means approve but he was at the same time an excellent scholar and most indefatigable in teaching the two lads add to this the strict severity of his life and manners an unimpeached honesty and a most devout attachment to religion so that upon the whole though allworthy did not esteem nor love the man yet he could never bring himself to part with a tutor to the boys wh was both by learning and industry extremely we qualified for his office and he hoped that as they were bred up in his own house and under his own eye he should be able to correct whatever was wrong in thwackums instructions  chap v in which the history is continued mr allworthy in his last speech had recollecte some tender ideas concerning jones which had brought tears into the good mans eyes thi mrs miller observing said yes yes sir your goodness to this poor young man is known notwithstanding all your care to conceal it but there is not a single syllable of truth in what those villains said mr nightingale has now discovered the whole matter it seems these fellows were employed by a lord who is a rival of poor mr jones to have pressed him on board a ship  i assure them i dont know who they will press next mr nightingale here has seen the officer himself who is a very pretty gentleman and has told him all and is very sorry for what he undertook which he would never have done had he known mr jones to have been a gentleman but he was told that he was a common strolling vagabond  allworthy stared at all this and declared he was a stranger to every word she said yes sir answered she i believe you are  it is a very different story i believe from what those fellows told the lawyer  what lawyer madam what is it you mean said allworthy nay nay said she this is so like you to deny your own goodness but mr nightingale here saw him saw whom madam answered he why your lawyer sir said she that you so kindly sent to enquire into the affair i am still in the dark upon my honor said allworthy why then do you tell him my dear sir cries she indeed sir said nightingale i did see that very lawyer who went from you when i came into the room at an alehouse in aldersgate in company with two of the fellows who were employed by lord fellamar to press mr jones and who were by that means present at the unhappy rencounter between him and mr fitzpatrick i own sir said mrs miller when i saw this gentleman come into the room to you i told mr nightingale that i apprehended you had sent him thither to enquire into the affair allworthy showed marks of astonishment in his countenance at this news and was indeed for two or three minutes struck dumb by it at last addressing himself to mr nightingale he said i must confess myself sir more surprised at what you tell me than i have ever been before at any thing in my whole life are you certain this was the gentleman i am most certain answered nightingale at aldersgate cries allworthy and was you in company with this lawyer and the two fellows  i was sir said the other very near half an hour  well sir said allworthy and in what manner did the lawyer behave did you hear all that past between him and the fellows no sir answered nightingale they had been together before i came  in my presence the lawyer said little but after i had several times examined the fellows who persisted in a story directly contrary to what i had heard from mr jones and what i find by mr fitzpatrick was a rank falsehood the lawyer then desired the fellows to say nothing but what was the truth and seemed to speak so much in favor of mr jones that when i saw the same person with you i concluded your goodness had prompted you to send him thither  and did you not send him thither says mrs miller   indeed i did not answered allworthy nor did i know he had gone on such an errand till this moment  i see it all said mrs miller upon my soul i see it all no wonder they have been closetted so close lately son nightingale let me beg you run for these fellows immediately  find them out if they are above ground i will go myself  dear madam said allworthy be patient and do me the favor to send a servant up stairs to call mr dowling hither if he be in the house or if not mr blifil mrs miller went out muttering something to herself and presently returned with an answer that mr dowling was gone but that the the other as she called him was coming  allworthy was of a cooler disposition than the good woman whose spirits were all up in arms in the cause of her friend he was not however without some suspicions which were near akin to hers when blifil came into the room he asked him with a very serious countenance and with a less friendly look than he had ever before given him whether he knew any thing of mr dowlings having seen any of the persons who were present at the duel between jones and another gentleman  there is nothing so dangerous as a question which comes by surprise on a man whose business it is to conceal truth or defend falsehood for which reason those worthy personages whose noble office it is to save the lives of their fellow creatures at the old bailey take the utmost care by frequent previous examination to divine every question which may be asked their clients on the day of trial that they may be supplied with proper and ready answers which the most fertile invention cannot supply in an instant besides the sudden and violent impulse on the blood occasioned by these surprises occasions frequently such an alteration in the countenance that the man is obliged to give evidence against himself and such indeed were the alterations which the countenance of blifil underwent from this sudden question that we can scarce blame the eagerness of mrs miller who immediately cried out guilty upon my honor guilty upon my soul  mr allworthy sharply rebuked her for this impetuosity and then turning to blifil who seemed sinking into the earth he said why do you hesitate sir at giving me an answer you certainly must have employed him for he would not of his own accord i believe have undertaken such an errand and especially without acquainting me  blifil then answered i own sir i have been guilty of an offense yet may i hope your pardon  my pardon said allworthy very angrily  nay sir answered blifil i knew you would be offended yet surely my dear uncle will forgive the effects of the most amiable of human weaknesses compassion for those who do not deserve it i own is a crime and yet it is a crime from which you yourself are not entirely free i know i have been guilty of it in more than one instance to this very person and i will own i did send mr dowling not on a vain and fruitless enquiry but to discover the witnesses and to endeavor to soften their evidence this sir is the truth which though i intended to conceal from you i will not deny  i confess said nightingale this is the light in which it appeared to me from the gentlemans behavior  now madam said allworthy i believe you will once in your life own you have entertained a wrong suspicion and are not so angry with my nephew as you was  mrs miller was silent for though she could not so hastily be pleased with blifil whom she looked upon to have been the ruin of jones yet in this particular instance he had imposed upon her as well as the rest so entirely had the devil stood his friend and indeed i look upon the vulgar observation that the devil often deserts his friends and leaves them in the lurch to be a great abuse on that gentlemans character perhaps he may sometimes desert those who are only his cup acquaintance or who at most are but half his but he generally stands by those who are thoroughly his servants and helps them off in all extremities till their bargain expires  as a conquered rebellion strengthens a government or as health is more perfectly established by recovery from some diseases so anger when removed often gives new life to affection this was the case of mr allworthy for blifil having wiped off the greater suspicion the lesser which had been raised by squares letter sunk of course and was forgotten and thwackum with whom he was greatly offended bore alone all the reflections which square had cast on the enemies of jones  as for that young man the resentment of mr allworthy began more and more to abate toward him he told blifil he did not only forgive the extraordinary efforts of his goodnature but would give him the pleasure of following his example then turning to mrs miller with a smile which would have become an angel he cried what say you madam shall we take a hackneycoach and all of us together pay a visit to your friend i promise you it is not the first visit i have made in a prison  every reader i believe will be able to answer for the worthy woman but they must have a great deal of goodnature and be well acquainted with friendship who can feel what she felt on this occasion few i hope are capable of feeling what now past in the mind of blifil but those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to raise any objection to this visit fortune however or the gentleman lately mentioned above stood his friend and prevented his undergoing so great a shock for at the very instant when the coach was sent for partridge arrived and having called mrs miller from the company acquainted her with the dreadful accident lately come to light and hearing mr allworthys intention begged her to find some means of stopping him for says he the matter must at all hazards be kept a secret from him and if he should now go he will find mr jones and his mother who arrived just as i left him lamenting over one another the horrid crime they have ignorantly committed  the poor woman who was almost deprived of her senses at this dreadful news was never less capable of invention than at present however as women are much readier at this than men she bethought herself of an excuse and returning to allworthy said i am sure sir you will be surprised at hearing any objection from me to the kind proposal you just now made and yet i am afraid of the consequence of it if carried immediately into execution you must imagine sir that all the calamities which have lately befallen this poor young fellow must have thrown him into the lowest dejection of spirits and now sir should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent fit of joy as i know your presence will occasion it may i am afraid produce some fatal mischief especially as his servant who is without tells me he is very far from being well  is his servant without cries allworthy pray call him hither i will ask him some questions concerning his master  partridge was at first afraid to appear before mr allworthy but was at length persuaded after mrs miller who had often heard his whole story from his own mouth had promised to introduce him  allworthy recollected partridge the moment he came into the room though many years had passed since he had seen him mrs miller therefore might have spared here a formal oration in which indeed she was somewhat prolix for the reader i believe may have observed already that the good woman among other things had a tongue always ready for he service of her friends  and are you said allworthy to partridge the servant of mr jones i cannot say sir answered he that i am regularly a servant but i live with him ant please your honor at present non sum qualis eram as your honor very well knows  mr allworthy then asked him many questions concerning jones as to his health and other matters to all which partridge answered without having the least regard to what was but considered only what he would have things appear for a strict adherence to truth was not among the articles of this honest fellows morality or his religion  during this dialogue mr nightingale took his eave and presently after mrs miller lest the room then allworthy likewise dispatched blifil for he imained that partridge when alone with him would be ore explicit than before company they were no oner left in private together than allworthy began  in the following chapter  chap vi in which the history is farther continued sure friend said the good man you are the strangest of all human beings not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately persisting in a falsehood but to persist in it thus to the last and to pass thus upon the world for the servant of your own son what interest can you have in all this what can be your motive  i see sir said partridge falling down upon s knees that your honor is prepossessed against me and resolved not to believe any thing i say and therefore what signifies my protestations but yet there is one above who knows that i am not the father of this young man  how said allworthy will you yet deny what you was formerly convicted of upon such unanswerable such manifest evidence nay what a confirmation is your being now found with this very man of all which twenty years ago appeared against you i thought you had left the country nay i thought you had been long since dead  in what manner did you know any thing of this young man where did you meet with him unless you had kept some correspondence together do not deny this for i promise you it will greatly raise your son in my opinion to find that he has such a sense of filial duty as privately to support his father for so many years  if your honor will have patience to hear me said partridge i will tell you all  being bid go on he proceeded thus when your honor conceived that displeasure against me it ended in my ruin soon after for i lost my little school and the minister thinking i suppose it would be agreeable to your honor turned me out from the office of clerk so that i had nothing to trust to but the barbers shop which in a country place like that is a poor livelihood and when my wife died for till that time i received a pension of    l a year from an unknown hand which indeed i believe was your honors own for no body that ever i heard of does these things besides but as i was saying when she died this pension forsook me so that now as i owed two or three small debts which began to be troublesome to me particulary one this is a fact which i knew happen to a poor clergyman in dorsetshire by the villainy of an attorney who not contented with the exorbitant costs to which the poor man was put by a single action brought afterward another action on the judgment as it is called a method frequently used to oppress the poor and bring money into the pockets of attorneys to the great scandal of the law of the nation of christianity and even of human nature itself which an attorney brought up by lawcharges from   s to near  0l and as i found all my usual means of living had forsook me i packed up my little all as well as i could and went off  the first place i came to was salisbury where i got into the service of a gentleman belonging to the law and one of the best gentlemen that ever i knew for he was not only good to me but i know a thousand good and charitable acts which he did while i staid with him and i have known him often refuse business because it was paultry and oppressive  you need not be so particular said allworthy i know this gentleman and a very worthy man he is and an honor to his profession  well sir continued partridge from hence i removed to lymmington where i was above three years in the service of another lawyer who was likewise a very good sort of a man and to be sure one of the merriest gentlemen in england well sir at the end of the three years i set up a little school and was likely to do well again had it not been for a most unlucky accident here i kept a pig and one day as ill fortune would have it this pig broke out and did a trespass i think they call it in a garden belonging to one of my neighbors who was a proud revengeful man and employed a lawyer one  one  i cannot think of his name but he sent for a writ against me and had me to size when i came there lord have mercy upon me  to hear what the counselor said there was one that told my lord a parcel of the confoundedst lies about me he said that i used to drive my hogs into other folks gardens and a great deal more and at last he said he hoped i had at last brought my hogs to a fair market to be sure one would have thought that instead of being owner only of one poor little pig i had been the greatest hogmerchant in england well  pray said allworthy do not be so particular i have heard nothing of your son yet o it was a great many years answered partridge before i saw my son as you are pleased to call him  i went over to ireland after this and taught school at cork for that one suit ruined me again and i lay seven years in winchester goal  well said allworthy pass that over till your return to england  then sir said he it was about half a year ago that i landed at bristol where i stayed some time and not finding it do there and hearing of a place between that and gloucester where the barber was just dead i went thither and there i had been about two months when mr jones came thither he then gave allworthy a very particular account of their first meeting and of every thing as well as he could remember which had happened from that day to this frequently interlarding his story with panegyricks on jones and not forgetting to insinuate the great love and respect which he had for allworthy he concluded with saying now sir i have told your honor the whole truth and then repeated a most solemn protestation that he was no more the father of jones then of the pope of rome and imprecated the most birt cses on his head if he did not speak truth  what am i to think of this mater cries allworthy for what purpose should you so strongly  it would be rather your interest to own  nay sir answered partridge for he could hold no longer if your honor will not believe me you are like soon to have satisfaction enough i wish you had mistaken the mother of this young man as well as you have his father  and now being asked what he meant with all the symptoms of horror both in his voice and countenance he told allworthy the whole story which he had a little before expressed such desire to mrs miller to conceal from him  allworthy was almost as much shocked at this discovery as partridge himself had been while he related it good heavens says he in what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men how much beyond our designs are the effects of wickedness sometimes carrried he had scarce uttered these words when mrs waters came hastily and abruptly into the room partridge no sooner saw her than he cried here sir here is the very woman herself this is the unfortunate mother of mr jones i am sure she will acquit me before your honor  pray madam    mrs waters without paying any regard to what partridge said and almost without taking any notice of him advanced to mr allworthy i believe sir it is so long since i had the honor of seeing you that you do not recollect me  indeed answered allworthy you are so very much altered on many accounts that had not this man already acquainted me who you are i should not have immediately called you to my remembrance have you madam any particular business which brings you to me  allworthy spoke this with great reserve for the reader may easily believe he was not well pleased with the conduct of this lady neither with what he had formerly heard nor with what partridge had now delivered  mrs waters answered  indeed sir i have very particular business with you and it is such as i can only impart to yourself  i must desire therefore the favor of a word with you alone for i assure you what i have to tell you is of the utmost importance  partridge was then ordered to withdraw but before he went he begged the lady to satisfy mr allworthy that he was perfectly innocent to which she answered  you need be under no apprehension sir i shall satisfy mr allworthy very perfectly of that matter  then partridge withdrew and that past between mr allworthy and mrs waters which is written in the next chapter  chap vii continuation of the history mrs waters remaining a few moments silent mr allworthy could not refrain from saying i am sorry madam to perceive by what i have since heard that you have made so very ill a use  mr allworthy says she interrupting him i know i have faults but ingratitude to you is not one of them i never can nor shall forget your goodness which i own i have very little deserved but be pleased to wave all upbraiding me at present as i have so important an affair to communicate to you concerning this young man to whom you have given my maiden name of jones have i then said allworthy ignorantly punished an innocent man in the person of him who has just left us was he not the father of the child  indeed he was not said mrs waters you may be pleased to remember sir i formerly told you you should one day know and i acknowledge myself to have been guilty of a cruel neglect in not having discovered it to you before  indeed i little knew how necessary it was  well madam said allworthy be pleased to proceed you must remember sir said she a young fellow whose name was summer very well cries allworthy he was the son of a clergyman of great learning and virtue for whom i had the highest friendship so it appeared sir answered she for i believe you bred the young man up and maintained him at the university where i think he had finished his studies when he came to reside at your house a finer man i must say the sun never shone upon for besides the handsomest person i ever saw he was so genteel and had so much wit and good breeding poor gentleman said allworthy he was indeed untimely snatched away and little did i think he had any sins of this kind to answer for for i plainly perceive you are going to tell me he was the father of your child indeed sir answered she he was not how said allworthy to what then tends all this preface to a story sir said she which i am concerned it falls to my lot to unfold to you  o sir prepare to hear something which will surprise you will grieve you speak said allworthy i am conscious of no crime and cannot be afraid to hear  sir said she that mr summer the son of your friend educated at your expense who after living a year in the house as if he had been your own son died there of the small pox was tenderly lamented by you and buried as if he had been your own that summer sir was the father of this child  how said allworthy you contradict yourself  that i do not answered she he was indeed the father of this child but not by me take care madam said allworthy do not to shun the imputation of any crime be guilty of falsehood remember there is one from whom you can conceal nothing and before whose tribunal falsehood will only aggravate your guilt indeed sir says she i am not his mother nor would i now think myself so for the world i know your reason said allworthy and shall rejoice as much as you to find it otherwise yet you must remember you yourself confessed it before me  so far what i confessed said she was true that these hands coveyed the infant to your bed conveyed it thither at the command of its mother at her commands i afterward owned it and thought myself by her generosity nobly rewarded both for my secrecy and my shame who could this woman be said allworthy  indeed i tremble to name her answered mrs waters by all this preparation i am to guess that she was a relation of mine cried he indeed she was a near one at which words allworthy started and she continued  you had a sister sir  a sister repeated he looking aghast  as there is truth in heaven cries she your sister was the mother of that child you found between your sheets can it be possible cries he good heavens have patience sir said mrs waters and i will unfold to you the whole story just after your departure for london miss bridget came one day to the house of my mother she was pleased to say she had heard an extraordinary character of me for my learning and superior understanding to all the young women there so she was pleased to say she then bid me come to her to the great house where when i attended she employed me to read to her she expressed great satisfaction in my reading showed great kindness to me and made me many presents at last she began to catechize me on the subject of secrecy to which i gave her such satisfactory answers that at last having locked the door of her room she took me into her closet and then locking that door likewise she said she should convince me of the vast reliance she had on my integrity by communicating a secret in which her honor and consequently her life was concerned she then stopped and after a silence of a minute during which she often wiped her eyes she enquired of me if i thought my mother might safely be confided in i answered i would stake my life on her fidelity she then imparted to me the great secret which labored in her breast and which i believe was delivered with more pains than she afterward suffered in childbirth it was then contrived that my mother and myself only should attend at the time and that mrs wilkins should be sent out of the way as she accordingly was to the very furthest part of dorsetshire to enquire the character of a servant for the lady had turned away her own maid near three months before during all which time i officiated about her person upon trial as she said though as she afterward declared i was not sufficiently handy for the place this and many other such things which she used to say of me were all thrown out to prevent any suspicion which wilkins might hereafter have when i was to own the child for she thought it could never be believed she would venture to hurt a young woman with whom she had entrusted such a secret you may be assured sir i was well paid for all these affronts which together with being informed of the occasion of them very well contented me indeed the lady had a greater suspicion of mrs wilkins than of any other person not that she had the least aversion to the gentlewoman but she thought her incapable of keeping a secret especially from you sir for i have often heard miss bridget say that if mrs wilkins had committed a murder she believed she would acquaint you with it at last the expected day came and mrs wilkins who had been kept a week in readiness and put off from time to time upon some pretense or other that she might not return too soon was dispatched then the child was born in the presence only of myself and my mother and was by my mother conveyed to her own house where it was privately kept by her till the evening of your return when i by the command of miss bridget conveyed it into the bed where you found it and all suspicions were afterward laid asleep by the artful conduct of your sister in pretending ill will to the boy and that any regard she showed him was out of mere complaisance to you mrs waters then made many protestations of the truth of this story and concluded by saying thus sir you have at last discovered your nephew for so i am sure you will hereafter think him and i question not but he will be both an honor and a comfort to you under that appellation i need not madam said allworthy express my astonishment at what you have told me and yet surely you would not and could not have put together so many circumstances to evidence an untruth i confess i recollect some passages relating to that summer which formerly gave me a conceit that my sister had some liking to him i mentioned it to her for i had such a regard to the young man as well on his own account as on his fathers that i should have willingly consented to a match between them but she expressed the highest disdain of my unkind suspicion as she called it so that i never more spoke on the subject good heaven well the lord disposes all things  yet sure it was a most unjustifiable conduct in my sister to carry this secret with her out of the world i promise you sir said mrs waters always professed a contrary intention and frequently told me she intended one day to communicate it to you she said indeed she was highly rejoiced that her plot had succeeded so well and that you had of your own accord taken such a fancy to the child that it was yet unnecessary to make any express declaration oh sir had that lady lived to have seen this poor young man turned like a vagabond from your house nay sir could she have lived to hear that you had yourself employed a lawyer to prosecute him for a murder of which he was not guilty  forgive me mr allworthy i must say it was unkind  indeed you have been abused he never deserved it of you indeed madam said alworthy i have been abused by the person whoever he was that told you so nay sir said she i would not be mistaken i did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong the gentleman who came to me proposed no such matter he only said taking me for mr fitzpatricks wife that if mr jones had murdered my husband i should be assisted with any money i wanted to carry on the prosecution by a very worthy gentleman who he said was well apprized what a villain i had to deal with it was by this man i found out who mr jones was and this man whose name is dowling mr jones tells me is your steward i discovered his name by a very odd accident for he himself refused to tell it me but partridge who met him at my lodgings the second time he came knew him formerly at salisbury  and did this mr dowling says allworthy with great astonishment in his countenance tell you that i would assist in the prosecution  no sir answered she i will not charge him wrongfully he said i should be assisted but he mentioned no name  yet you must pardon me sir if from circumstances i thought it could be no other  indeed madam says allworthy from circumstances i am too well convinced it was another  good heaven by what wonderful means is the blackest and deepest villainy sometimes discovered  shall i beg you madam to stay till the person you have mentioned comes for i expect him every minute nay he may be perhaps already in the house allworthy then stepped to the door in order to call a servant when in came not mr dowling but the gentleman who will be seen in the next chapter  chap viii further continuation the gentleman who now arrived was no other than mr western he no sooner saw allworthy than without considering in the least the presence of mrs waters he began to vociferate in the following manner fine doings at my house a rare kettle of fish i have discovered at last who the devil would be plagued with a daughter whats the matter neighbor said allworthy matter enough answered western when i thought she was a just coming to nay when she had in a manner promised me to do as i would ha her and when i was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have a sent for the lawyer and finished all what do you think i have found out that the little b  has bin playing tricks with me all the while and carrying on a correspondence with that bastard of yours sister western whom i have a quarrelled with upon her account sent me word ot and i ordered her pockets to be searched when she was asleep and here i have got un signed with the son of a whores own name i have not had patience to read half ot for it is longer than one of parson supples sermons but i find plainly it is all about love and indeed what should it be else i have packed her up in chamber again and tomorrow morning down she goes into the country unless she confents to be married directly and there she shall live in a garret upon bread and water all her days and the sooner such a b  breaks her heart the better though d  n her that i believe is too tough she will live long enough to plague me mr western answered allworthy you know i have always protested against force and you yourself consented that none should be used ay cries he that was only upon condition that she would consent without what the devil and doctor faustus shall not i do what i will with my own daughter especially when i desire nothing but her own good well neighbor answered allworthy if you will give me leave i will undertake once to argue with the young lady will you said western why that is kind now and neighbourly and mayhap you will do more than i have been able to do with her for i promise you she has a very good opinion of you well sir said allworthy if you will go home and release the young lady from her captivity i will wait upon her within this half hour  but suppose said western she should run away with un in the mean time for lawyer dowling tells me there is no hopes of hanging the fellow at last for that the man is alive and like to do well and that he thinks jones will be out of prison again presently  how said allworthy what did you employ him then to enquire or to do any thing in that matter not i answered western he mentioned it to me just now of his own accord  just now cries allworthy why where did you see him then i want much to see mr dowling   why you may see un an you will presently at my lodgings for there is to be a meeting of lawyers there this morning about a mortgage  icod i shall lose two or dree thousand pounds i believe by that honest gentleman mr nightingale  well sir said allworthy i will be with you within the half hour and do for once cries the squire take a fools advice never think of dealing with her by gentle methods take my word for it those will never do i have tried um long enough she must be frightened into it there is no other way tell her i am her father and of the horrid sin of disobedience and of the dreadful punishment of it in the other world and then tell her about being locked up all her life in a garret in this and be kept only upon bread and water i will do all i can said allworthy for i promise you there is nothing i wish more than an alliance with this amiable creature nay the girl is well enough for matter of that cries the squire a man may go farther and meet with worse meat that i may declare of her thof she be my own daughter and if she will but be obedient to me there is noorow a father within a hundred miles of the place that loves a daughter better than i do but i see you are busy with the lady here so i will go huome and expect you and so your humble servant  as soon as mr western was gone mrs waters said i see sir the squire has not the least remembrance of my face i believe mr allworthy you would not have known me neither i am very considerably altered since that day when you so kindly gave me that advice which i had been happy had i followed  indeed madam cries allworthy it gave me great concern when i first heard the contrary indeed sir says she i was ruined by a very deep scheme of villainy which if you knew though i pretend not to think it would justify me in your opinion it would atleast mitigate my offense and induce you to pity me you are not now at leisure to hear my whole story but this i assure you i was betrayed by the most solemn promise of marriage nay in the eye of heaven i was married to him for after much reading on the subject i am convinced that particular ceremonies are only requisite to give a legal sanction to marriage and have only a worldly use in giving a woman the privileges of a wife but that she who lives constant to one man after a solemn private affiance whatever the world may call her has little to charge on her own conscience i am sorry madam said allworthy you made so ill an use of your learning indeed it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more or had remained in a state of ignorance and yet madam i am afraid you have more than this sin to answer for during his life answered she which was above a dozen years i most solemnly assure you i had not and consider sir on my behalf what is in the power of a woman stripped of her reputation and left destitute whether the goodnatured world will suffer such a stray sheep to return to the road of virtue even if she was never so desirous i protest then i would have chose it had it been in my power but necessity drove me into the arms of capt waters with whom though still unmarried i lived as a wife for many years and went by his name i parted with this gentleman at worcester on his march against the rebels and it was then i accidentally met with mr jones who rescued me from the hands of a villain indeed he is the worthiest of men no young gentleman of his age is i believe freer from vice and few have the twentieth part of his virtues nay whatever vices he has had i am firmly persuaded he has now taken a resolution to abandon them i hope he has cries allworthy and i hope he will preserve that resolution i must say i have still the same hopes with regard to yourself the world i do agree are apt to be too unmerciful on these occasions yet time and perseverance will get the better of this their disinclination as i may call it to pity for though they are not like heaven ready to receive a penitent sinner yet a continued repentance will at length obtain mercy even with the world this you may be assured of mrs waters that whenever i find you are sincere in such good intentions you shall want no assistance in my power to make them effectual  mrs waters fell now upon her knees before him and in a flood of tears made him many most passionate acknowledgments of his goodness which as she truly said savoured more of the divine than human nature  allworthy raised her up and spoke in the most tender manner making use of every expression which his invention could suggest to comfort her when he was interrupted by the arrival of mr dowling who upon his first entrance seeing mrs waters started and appeared in some confusion from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could and then said he was in the utmost haste to attend council at mr westerns lodgings but however thought it his duty to call and acquaint him with the opinion of council upon the case which he had before told him which was that the conversion of the moneys in that case could not be questioned in a criminal cause but that an action of trover might be brought and if it appeared to the jury to be the moneys of plaintiff that plaintiff would recover a verdict for the value  allworthy without making any answer to this bolted the door and then advancing with a stern look to dowling he said whatever be your haste sir i must first receive an answer to some questions do you know this young lady  that lady sir answered dowling with great hesitation allworthy then with the most solemn voice said look you mr dowling as you value my favor or your continuance a moment longer in my service do not hesitate nor prevaricate but answer faithfully and truly to every question i ask  do you know this lady  yes sir said dowling i have seen the lady where sir at her own lodgings  upon what business did you go thither sir and who sent you i went sir to enquire sir about mr jones and who sent you to enquire about him who sir why sir mr blifil sent me and what did you say to the lady concerning that matter nay sir it is impossible to recollect every word will you please madam to assist the gentlemans memory he told me sir said mrs waters that if mr jones had murdered my husband i should be assisted by any money i wanted to carry on the prosecution by a very worthy gentleman who was well apprized what a villain i had to deal with these i can safely swear were the very words he spoke  were these the words sir said allworthy i cannot charge my memory exactly cries dowling but i believe i did speak to that purpose  and did mr blifil order you to say so i am sure sir i should not have gone on my own accord nor have willingly exceeded my authority in matters of this kind if i said so i must have so understood mr blifils instructions look you mr dowling said allworthy i promise you before this lady that whatever you have done in this affair by mr blifils order i will forgive provided you now tell me strictly the truth for i believe what you say that you would not have acted of your own accord and without authority in this matter  mr blifil then likewise sent you to examine the two fellows at aldersgate  he did sir  well and what instructions did he then give you recollect as well as you can and tell me as near as possible the very words he used  why sir mr blifil sent me to find out the persons who were eyewitnesses of this fight he said he feared they might be tampered with by mr jones or some of his friends he said blood required blood and that not only all who concealed a murderer but those who omitted any thing in their power to bring him to justice were sharers in his guilt he said he found you was very desirous of having the villain brought to justice though it was not proper you should appear in it  did he so says allworthy  yes sir cries dowling i should not i am sure have proceeded such lengths for the sake of any other person living but your worship  what lengths sir said allworthy  nay sir cries dowling i would not have your worship think i would on any account be guilty of subordination of perjury but there are two ways of delivering evidence i told them therefore that if any offers should be made them on the other side they should refuse them and that they might be assured they should lose nothing by being honest men and telling the truth i said we were told that mr jones had assaulted the gentleman first and that if that was the truth they should declare it and i did give them some hints that they should be no losers  i think you went lengths indeed cries allworthy  nay sir answered dowling i am sure i did not desire them to tell an untruth  nor should i have said what i did unless it had been to oblige you you would not have thought i believe says allworthy to have obliged me had you known that this mr jones was my own nephew   i am sure sir answered he it did not become me to take any notice of what i thought you desired to conceal   how cries allworthy and did you know it then  nay sir answered dowling if your worship bids me speak the truth i am sure i shall do it  indeed sir i did know it for they were almost the last words which madam blifil ever spoke which she mentioned to me as i stood alone by her bedside when she delivered me the letter i brought your worship from her  what letter cries allworthy   the letter sir answered dowling which i brought from salisbury and which i delivered into the hands of mr blifil   o heavens cries allworthy well and what were the words what did my sister say to you  she took me by the hand answered he and as she delivered me the letter said i scarce know what i have written tell my brother mr jones is his nephew  he is my son  bless him says she and then fell backward as if dying away i presently called in the people and she never spoke more to me and died within a few minutes afterward  allworthy stood a minute silent lifting up his eyes and then turning to dowling said  how came you sir not to deliver me this message your worship answered he must remember that you was at that time ill in bed and being in a violent hurry as indeed i always am i delivered the letter and message to mr blifil who told me he would carry them both to you which he has since told me he did and that your worship partly out of friendship to mr jones and partly out of regard to your sister would never have it mentioned and did intend to conceal it from the world and therefore sir if you had not mentioned it to me first i am certain i should never have thought it belonged to me to say any thing of the matter either to your worship or any other person  we have remarked somewhere already that it is possible for a man to convey a lie in the words of truth this was the case at present for blifil had in fact told dowling what he now related but had not imposed upon him nor indeed had imagined that he was able so to do in reality the promises which blifil had made to dowling were the motives which had induced him to secrecy and as he very plainly saw he should not be able to keep them he thought proper now to make this confession which the promises of forgiveness joined to the threats the voice the looks of allworthy and the discoveries he had made before extorted from him who was besides taken unawares and had no time to consider of evasions  allworthy appeared well satisfied with this relation and having enjoined strict silence as to what had past on dowling conducted that gentleman himself to the door least he should see blifil who was returned to his chamber where he exulted in the thoughts of his last deceit on his uncle and little suspected what had since passed below stairs  as allworthy was returning to his room he met mrs miller in the entry who with a face all pale and full of terror said to him o sir i find this wicked woman has been with you and you know all yet do not on this account abandon the poor young man consider sir he was ignorant it was his own mother and the discovery itself will most probably break his heart without your unkindness madam says allworthy i am under such an astonishment at what i have heard that i am really unable to satisfy you but come with me into my room indeed mrs miller i have made surprising discoveries and you shall soon know them  the poor woman followed him trembling and now allworthy going up to mrs waters took her by the hand and then turning to mrs miller said what reward shall i bestow upon this poor gentlewoman for the services she has done me  o mrs miller you have a thousand times heard me call the young man to whom you are so faithful a friend my son little did i then think he was indeed related to me at all  your friend madam is my nephew he is the brother of that wicked viper which i so long nourished in my bosom  she will herself tell you the whole story and how the youth came to pass for her son indeed mrs miller i am convinced that he has been wronged and that i have been abused abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a villain he is in truth the worst of villains  the joy which mrs miller now felt bereft her of the power of speech and might perhaps have deprived her of her senses if not of life had not a friendly shower of tears come seasonably to her relief at length recovering so far from her transport as to be able to speak she cried and is my dear mr jones then your nephew sir and not the son of this lady and are your eyes opened to him at last and shall i live to see him as happy as he deserves he certainly is my nephew says allworthy and i hope all the rest  and is this the dear good woman the person cries she to whom all this discovery is owing  she is indeed says allworthy  why then cried mrs miller upon her knees may heaven shower down its choicest blessings upon her head and for this one good action forgive her all her sins be they never so many  mrs waters then informed them that she believed jones would very shortly be released for that the surgeon was gone in company with a nobleman to the justice who committed him in order to certify that mr fitzpatrick was out of all manner of danger and to procure the prisoner his liberty  allworthy said he should be glad to find his nephew there at his return home but that he was then obliged to go on some business of consequence he than called to a servant to fetch him a chair and presently left the two ladies together  mr blifil hearing the chair ordered came down stairs to attend upon his uncle for he never was deficient in such acts of duty he asked his uncle if he was going out which is a civil way of asking a man where he is going to which the other making no answer he again desired to know when he would be pleased to return  allworthy made no answer to this neither till he was just getting into his chair and then turning about he said  harkee sir do you find out before my return the letter which your mother sent me on her deathbed allworthy then departed and left blifil in a situation to be envied only by a man who is just going to be hanged  chap ix a further continuation allworthy took an opportunity whilst he was in the chair of reading the letter from jones to sophia which western delivered him and there were some expressions in it concerning himself which drew tears from his eyes at length he arrived at mr westerns and was introduced to sophia  when the first ceremonies were past and the gentleman and lady had taken their chairs a silence of some minutes ensued during which the latter who had been prepared for the visit by her father sat playing with her fan and had every mark of confusion both in her countenance and behavior at length allworthy who was himself a little disconcerted began thus i am afraid miss western my family has been the occasion of giving you some uneasiness to which i fear i have innocently become more instrumental than i intended be assured madam had i at first known how disagreeable the proposals had been i should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted i hope therefore you will not think the design of this visit is to trouble you with any further solicitations of that kind but entirely to relieve you from them  sir said sophia with a little modest hesitation this behavior is most kind and generous and such as i could expect only from mr allworthy but as you have been so kind to mention this matter you will pardon me for saying it has indeed given me great uneasiness and has been the occasion of my suffering much cruel treatment from a father who was till that unhappy affair the tenderest and fondest of all parents i am convinced sir you are too good and generous to resent my refusal of your nephew our own inclinations are not in our power and whatever may be his merit i cannot force them in his favor i assure you most amiable young lady said allworthy i am capable of no such resentment had the person been my own son and had i entertained the highest esteem for him for you say truly madam we cannot force our own inclinations much less can they be directed by another oh sir answered sophia every word you speak proves you to deserve that good that great that benevolent character the whole world allows you i assure you sir nothing less than the certain prospect of future misery could have made me resist the commands of my father i sincerely believe you madam replied allworthy and i heartily congratulate you on your prudent foresight since by so justifiable a resistance you have avoided misery indeed you speak now mr allworthy cries she with a delicacy which few men are capable of feeling but surely in my opinion to lead our lives with one to whom we are indifferent must be a state of wretchedness  perhaps that wretchedness would be even increased by a sense of the merits of an object to whom we cannot give our affections if i had married mr blifil   pardon my interrupting you madam answered allworthy but i cannot bear the supposition  believe me miss western i rejoice from my heart i rejoice in your escape  i have discovered the wretch for whom you have suffered all this cruel violence from your father to be a villain how sir cries sophia  you must believe this surprises me  it has surprised me madam answered allworthy and so it will the world  but i have acquainted you with the real truth nothing but truth says sophia can i am convinced come from the lips of mr allworthy  yet sir such sudden such unexpected news  discovered you say  may villainy be ever so  you will soon enough hear the story cries allworthy  at present let us not mention so detested a name  i have another matter of a very serious nature to propose  o miss western i know your vast worth nor can i so easily part with the ambition of being allied to it  i have a near relation madam a young man whose character is i am convinced the very opposite to that of this wretch and whose fortune i will make equal to what his was to have been  could i madam hope you would admit a visit from him sophia after a minutes silence answered i will deal with the utmost sincerity with mr allworthy his character and the obligation i have just received from him demand it i have determined at present to listen to no such proposals from any person my only desire is to be restored to the affection of my father and to be again the mistress of his family this sir i hope to owe to your good offices let me beseech you let me conjure you by all the goodness which i and all who know you have experienced do not the very moment when you have released me from one persecution do not engage me in another as miserable and as fruitless indeed miss western replied allworthy i am capable of no such conduct and if this be your resolution he must submit to the disappointment whatever torments he may suffer under it i must smile now mr allworthy answered sophia when you mention the torments of a man whom i do not know and who can consequently have so little acquaintance with me pardon me dear young lady cries allworthy i begin now to be afraid he has had too much acquaintance for the repose of his future days since if ever man was capable of a sincere violent and noble passion such i am convinced is my unhappy nephews for miss western a nephew of yours mr allworthy answered sophia it is surely strange i never heard of him before indeed madam cries allworthy it is only the circumstance of his being my nephew to which you are a stranger and which till this day was a secret to me  mr jones who has long loved you he he is my nephew  mr jones your nephew sir cries sophia can it be possible  he is indeed madam answered allworthy he is my own sisters son  as such i shall always own him nor am i ashamed of owning him i am much more ashamed of my past behavior to him but i was as ignorant of his merit as of his birth indeed miss western i have used him cruelly  indeed i have  here the good man wiped his eyes and after a short pause proceeded  i never shall be able to reward him for his sufferings without your assistance  believe me most amiable young lady i must have a great esteem of that offering which i make to your worth i know he has been guilty of faults but there is great goodness of heart at the bottom believe me madam there is  here he stopped seeming to expect an answer which he presently received from sophia after she had a little recovered herself from the hurry of spirits into which so strange and sudden information had thrown her i sincerely wish you joy sir of a discovery in which you seem to have such satisfaction i doubt not but you will have all the comfort you can promise yourself from it the young gentleman has certainly a thousand good qualities which makes it impossible he should not behave well to such an uncle  i hope madam said allworthy he has those good qualities which must make him a good husband  he must i am sure be of all men the most abandoned if a lady of your merit should condescend  you must pardon me mr allworthy answered sophia i cannot listen to a proposal of this kind mr jones i am convinced has much merit but i shall never receive mr jones as one who is to be my husband  upon my honor i never will  pardon me madam cries allworthy if i am a little surprised after what i have heard from mr western  i hope the unhappy young man has done nothing to forfeit your good opinion if he had ever the honor to enjoy it  perhaps he may have been misrepresented to you as he was to me the same villainy may have injured him every where  he is no murderer i assure you as he has been called  mr allworthy answered sophia i have told you my resolution i wonder not at what my father has told you but whatever his apprehensions or fears have been if i know my heart i have given no occasion for them since it has always been a fixed principle with me never to have married without his consent this is i think the duty of a child to a parent and this i hope nothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from i do not indeed conceive that the authority of any parent can oblige us to marry in direct opposition to our inclinations to avoid a force of this kind which i had reason to suspect i left my fathers house and sought protection elsewhere this is the truth of my story and if the world or my father carry my intentions any farther my own conscience will acquit me i hear you miss western cries allworthy with admiration i admire the justness of your sentiments but surely there is more in this i am cautious of offending you young lady but am i to look on all which i have hitherto heard or seen as a dream only and have you suffered so much cruelty from your father on the account of a man to whom you have been always absolutely indifferent i beg mr allworthy answered sophia you will not insist on my reasons  yes i have suffered indeed i will not mr allworthy conceal  i will be very sincere with you  i own i had a great opinion of mr jones  i believe  i know i have suffered for my opinion  i have been treated cruelly by my aunt as well as by my father but that is now past  i beg i may not be farther pressed for whatever has been my resolution is now fixed your nephew sir has many virtues  he has great virtues mr allworthy i question not but he will do you honor in the world and make you happy  i wish i could make him so madam replied allworthy but that i am convinced is only in your power it is that conviction which has made me so earnest a solicitor in his favor you are deceived indeed sir you are deceived said sophia  i hope not by him  it is sufficient to have deceived me mr allworthy i must insist on being pressed no farther upon this subject  i should be sorry  nay i will not injure him in your favor i wish mr jones very well i sincerely wish him well and i peat again to you whatever demerit he may have to me i am certain he has many good qualities i do not disown my former thoughts but nothing can ever recall them at present there is not a man on earth whom i would more resolutely reject than mr jones nor would the addresses of mr blifil himself be less agreeable to me  western had been long impatient for the event of this conference and was just now arrived at the door to listen when having heard the last sentiments of his daughters heart he lost all temper and bursting open the door in a rage cried out  it is a lie it is a d  nd lie it is all owing to that d  nd rascal juones and if she could get at un she would ha un any hour of the day here allworthy interposed and addressing himself to the squire with some anger in his look he said mr western you have not kept your word with me you promised to abstain from all violence  why so i did cries western as long as it was possible but to hear a wench telling such confounded lies  zounds does she think if she can make vools of other volk she can make one of me  no no i know her better than thee do i am sorry to tell you sir answered allworthy it does not appear by your behavior to this young lady that you know her at all i ask pardon for what i say but i think our intimacy your own desires and the occasion justify me she is your daughter mr western and i think she does honor to your name if i was capable of envy i should sooner envy you on this account than any other man whatever  odrabbitit cries the squire i wish she was thine with all my heart  would soon be glad to be rid of the trouble of her  indeed my good friend answered allworthy you yourself are the cause of all the trouble you complain of place that confidence in the young lady which she so well deserves and i am certain you will be the happiest father on earth  i confidence in her cries the squire sblood what confidence can i place in her when she will not do as i would ha her let her gi but her consent to marry as i would ha her and i will place as much confidence in her as would ha me  you have no right neighbor answered allworthy to insist on any such consent a negative voice your daughter allows you and god and nature have thought proper to allow you no more a negative voice cries the squire  ay ay i will show you what a negative voice i ha  go along go into your chamber go you stubborn  indeed mr western said allworthy  indeed you use her cruelly  i cannot bear to see this  you shall you must behave to her in a kinder manner she deserves the best of treatment yes yes said the squire i know what she deserves now she is gone i will show you what she deserves  see here sir here is a letter from my cousin my lady bellaston in which she is so kind to gi me to understand that the fellow is got out of prison again and here she advises me to take all the care i can of the wench odzookers neighbor allworthy you dont know what it is to govern a daughter  the squire ended his speech with some compliments to his own sagacity and then allworthy after a formal preface acquainted him with the whole discovery which he had made concerning jones with his anger to blifil and with every particular which has been disclosed to the reader in the preceding chapters  men overviolent in their dispositions are for the most part as changeable in them no sooner then was western informed of mr allworthys intention to make jones his heir than he joined heartily with the uncle in every commendation of the nephew and became as eager for her marriage with jones as he had before been to couple her to blifil  here mr allworthy was again forced to interpose and to relate what had passed between him and sophia at which he testified great surprise  the squire was silent a moment and looked wild with astonishment at this account  at last he cried out why what can be the meaning of this neighbor allworthy vond o un she was that i will be sworn to  odzookers i have hit ot as sure as a gun i have hit o the very right ot it is all long o zister the girl has got a hankering after this son of a whore of a lord i vound em together at my cousin my lady bellastons he has turned the head of her that is certain  but d  n me if he shall ha her  i will ha no lords nor courtiers in my vamily  allworthy now made a long speech in which he repeated his resolution to avoid all violent measures and very earnestly recommended gentle methods to mr western as those by which he might be assured of succeeding best with his daughter he then took his leave and returned back to mrs miller but was forced to comply with the earnest entreaties of the squire in promising to bring mr jones to visit him that afternoon that he might as he said make all matters up with the young gentleman at mr allworthys departure western promised to follow his advice in his behavior to sophia saying i dont know how it is but d  n me allworthy if you dont make me always do just as you please and yet i have as good an esteate as you and am in the commission of the peace as well as yourself  chap x wherein the history begins to draw toward a conclusion when allworthy returned to his lodgings he heard mr jones was just arrived before him he hurried therefore instantly into an empty chamber whither he ordered mr jones to be brought to him alone  it is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving scene than the meeting between the uncle and nephew for mrs waters as the reader may well suppose had at her last visit discovered to him the secret of his birth the first agonies of joy which were felt on both sides are indeed beyond my power to describe i shall not therefore attempt it after allworthy had raised jones from his feet where he had prostrated himself and received him into his arms o my child he cried how have i been to blame how have i injured you what amends can i ever make you for those unkind those unjust suspicions which i have entertained and for all the sufferings they have occasioned to you am i not made amends cries jones would not my sufferings if they had been ten times greater have been now richly repaid o my dear uncle this goodness this tenderness overpowers unmans destroys me i cannot bear the transports which slow so fast upon me to be again restored to your presence to your favor to be once more thus kindly received by my great my noble my generous benefactor  indeed child cries allworthy i have used you cruelly  he then explained to him all the treachery of blifil and again repeated expressions of the utmost concern for having been induced by that treachery to use him so ill o talk not so answered jones indeed sir you have used me nobly the wisest man might be deceived as you were and under such a deception the best must have acted just as you did your goodness displayed itself in the midst of your anger just as it then seemed i owe every thing to that goodness of which i have been most unworthy do not put me on selfaccusation by carrying your generous sentiments too far alas sir i have not been punished more than i have deserved and it shall be the whole business of my furture life to deserve that happiness you now bestow on me for believe me my dear uncle my punishment has not been thrown away upon me though i have been a great i am not a hardened sinner i thank heaven i have had time to reflect on my past life where though i cannot charge myself with any gross villainy yet i can discern follies and vices too sufficient to repent and to be ashamed of follies which have been attended with dreadful consequences to myself and have brought me to the brink of destruction i am rejoiced my dear child answered allworthy to hear you talk thus sensibly for as i am convinced hypocrisy good heaven how have i been imposed on by it in others was never among your faults so i can readily believe all you say you now see tom to what dangers imprudence alone may subject virtue for virtue i am now convinced you love in a great degree prudence is indeed the duty which we owe to ourselves and if we will be so much our own enemies as to neglect it we are not to wonder if the world is deficient in discharging their duty to us for when a man lays the foundation of his own ruin others will i am afraid be too apt to build upon it you say however you have seen your errors and will reform them i firmly believe you my dear child and therefore from this moment you shall never more be reminded of them by me remember them only yourself so far as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them but still remember for your comfort that there is this great difference between those faults which candor may construe into imprudence and those which can be deduced from villainy only the former perhaps are even more liable to subject a man to ruin but if he reform his character will at length be totally retrieved the world though not immediately will in time be reconciled to him and he may reflect not without some mixture of pleasure on the dangers he has escaped but villainy my boy when once discovered is irretrievable the stains which this leaves behind no time will wash away the censure of mankind will pursue the wretch their scorn will abash him in public and if shame drives him into retirement he will go to it with all those terrors with which a weary child who is afraid of hobgoblins retreats from company to go to bed alone here his murdered conscience will haunt him repose like a false friend will fly from him wherever he turns his eyes horror presents itself if he looks backward unavailable repentance treads on his heels if forward incurable despair stares him in the face till like a condemned prisoner confined in a dungeon he detests his present condition and yet dreads the consequence of that hour which is to relieve him from it comfort yourself i say my child that this is not your case and rejoice with thankfulness to him who has suffered you to see your errors before they have brought on you that destruction to which a persistance in even those errors must have led you you have deserted them and the prospect now before you is such that happiness seems in your own power  at these words jones fetched a deep sigh upon which when allworthy remonstrated he said sir i will conceal nothing from you i fear there is one consequence of my vices i shall never be able to retrieve o my dear uncle i have lost a treasure  you need say no more answered allworthy i will be explicit with you i know what you lament i have seen the young lady and have discoursed with her concerning you this i must insist on as an earnest of your sincerity in all you have said and of the stedfastness of your resolution that you obey me in one instance to abide entirely by the determination of the young lady whether it shall be in your favor or no she has already suffered enough from solicitations which i hate to think of she shall owe no further constraint to my family i know her father will be as ready to torment her now on your account as he has formerly been on another but i am determined she shall suffer no more confinement no more violence no more uneasy hours  o my dear uncle answered jones lay i beseech you some command on me in which i shall have some merit in obedience believe me sir the only instance in which i could disobey you would be to give an uneasy moment to my sophia no sir if i am so miserable to have incurred her displeasure beyond all hope of forgiveness that alone with the dreadful reflection of causing her misery will be sufficient to overpower me to call sophia mine is the greatest and now the only additional blessing which heaven can bestow but it is a blessing which i must owe to her alone i will not flatter you child cries allworthy i fear your case is desperate i never saw stronger marks of an unalterable resolution in any person than appeared in her vehement declarations against receiving your addresses for which perhaps you can account better than myself  oh sir i can account too well answered jones i have sinned against her beyond all hope of pardon and guilty as i am my guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten times blacker than the real colors o my dear uncle i find my follies are irretrievable and all your goodness cannot save me from perdition  a servant now acquainted them that mr western was below stairs for his eagerness to see jones could not wait till the afternoon upon which jones whose eyes were full of tears begged his uncle to entertain western a few minutes till he a little recovered himself to which the good man consented and having ordered mr western to be shown into a parlour went down to him  mrs miller no sooner heard that jones was alone for she had not yet seen him since his release from prison than she came eagerly into the room and advancing toward jones wished him heartily joy of his newfound uncle and his happy reconciliation adding i wish i could give you joy on another account my dear child but any thing so inexorable i never saw jones with some appearance of surprise asked her what she meant why then says she i have been with your young lady and have explained all matters to her as they were told me by my son nightingale she can have no longer any doubt about the letter that i am certain for i told her my son nightingale was ready to take his oath if she pleased that it was all his own invention and the letter of his inditing i told her the very reason of sending the letter ought to recommend you to her the more as it was all upon her account and a plain proof that you was resolved to quit all your profligacy for the future that you had never been guilty of a single instance of infidelity to her since your seeing her in town i am afraid i went too far there but heaven forgive me i hope your future behavior will be my justification i am sure i have said all i can but all to no purpose she remains inflexible she says she had forgiven many faults on account of youth but expressed such detestation of the character of a libertine that she absolutely silenced me i often attempted to excuse you but the justness of her accusation flew in my face upon my honor she is a lovely woman and one of the sweetest and most sensible creatures i ever saw i could have almost kissed her for one expression she made use of it was a sentiment worthy of seneca or of a bishop i once fancied madam said she i had discovered great goodness of heart in mr jones and for that i own i had a sincere esteem but an entire profligacy of manners will corrupt the best heart in the world and all which a goodnatured libertine can expect is that we should mix some grains of pity with our contempt and abhorrence she is an angelic creature that is the truth on it  o mrs miller answered jones can i bear to think i have lost such an angel  lost no cries mrs miller i hope you have not lost her yet resolve to leave such vicious courses and you may yet have hopes nay if she should remain inexorable there is another young lady a sweet pretty young lady and a swinging fortune who is absolutely dying for love of you i heard of it this very morning and i told it to miss western nay i went a little beyond the truth again for i told her you had refused her but indeed i knew you would refuse her  and here i must give you a little comfort when i mentioned the young ladys name who is no other than the pretty widow hunt i thought she turned pale but when i said you had refused her i will be sworn her face was all over scarlet in an instant and these were her very words i will not deny but that i believe he has some affection for me  here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of western who could no longer be kept out of the room even by the authority of allworthy himself though this as we have often seen had a wonderful power over him  western immediately went up to jones crying out my old friend tom i am glad to see thee with all my heart all past must be forgotten i could not intend any affront to thee because as allworthy here knows nay do know it thyself i took thee for another person and where a body means no harm what signifies a hasty word or two one christian must forget and forgive another i hope sir said jones i shall never forget the many obligations i have had to you but as for any offense toward me i declare i am an utter stranger  at says western then give me thy fist at as hearty an honest cock as any in the kingdom come along with me i will carry thee to thy mistress this moment here allworthy interposed and the squire being unable to prevail either with the uncle or nephew was after some litigation obliged to consent to delay introducing jones to sophia till the afternoon at which time allworthy as well in compassion to jones as in compliance with the eager desires of western was prevailed upon to promise to attend at the teatable  the conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough and with which had it happened earlier in our history we would have entertained our reader but as we have now leisure only to attend to what is very material it shall suffice to say that matters being entirely adjusted as to the afternoonvisit mr western again returned home  chap xi this history draws nearer to a conclusion when mr western was departed jones began to inform mr allworthy and mrs miller that his liberty had been procured by two noble lords who together with two surgeons and a friend of mr nightingales had attended the magistrate by whom he had been committed and by whom on the surgeons oaths that the wounded person was out of all manner of danger from this wound he was discharged  one only of these lords he said he had ever seen before and that no more than once but the other had greatly surprised him by asking his pardon for an offense he had been guilty of toward him occasioned he said entirely by his ignorance who he was  now the reality of the case with which jones was not acquainted till afterward was this the lieutenant whom lord fellamar had employed according to the advice of lady bellaston to press jones as a vagabond into the sea service when he came to report the event which we have before seen to his lordship spoke very favorably of the behavior of mr jones on all accounts and strongly assured that lord that he must have mistaken the person for that jones was certainly a gentleman insomuch that his lordship who was strictly a man of honor and would by no means have been guilty of an action which the world in general would have condemned began to be much concerned for the advice which he had taken  within a day or two after this lord fellamar happened to dine with the irish peer who in a conversation upon the duel acquainted his company with the character of fitzpatrick to which indeed he did not do strict justice especially in what related to his lady he said she was the most innocent and most injured woman alive and that from compassion alone he had undertaken her cause he then declared an intention of going the next morning to fitzpatricks lodgings in order to prevail with him if possibly to consent to a separation from his wife who the peer said was in apprehensions for her life if she should ever return to be under the power of her husband lord fellamar agreed to go with him that he might satisfy himself more concerning jones and the circumstances of the duel for he was by no means easy concerning the part he had acted the moment his lordship gave a hint of his readiness to assist in the delivery of the lady it was eagerly embraced by the other nobleman who depended much on the authority of lord fellamar as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe fitzpatrick into a compliance and perhaps he was in the right for the poor irishman no sooner saw these noble peers had undertaken the cause of his wife than he submitted and articles of separation were soon drawn up and signed between the parties  fitzpatrick had been so well satisfied by mrs waters concerning the innocence of his wife with jones at upton or perhaps from some other reasons was now become so indifferent to that matter that he spoke highly in favor of jones to lord fellamar took all the blame upon himself and said the other had behaved very much like a gentleman and a man of honor and upon that lords further enquiry concerning mr jones fitzpatrick told him he was nephew to a gentleman of very great fashion and fortune which was the account he had just received from mrs waters after her interview with dowling  lord fellamar now thought it behoved him to do every thing in his power to make satisfaction to a gentleman whom he had so grossly injured and without any consideration of rivalship for he had now given over all thoughts of sophia determined to procure mr joness liberty being satisfied as well from fitzpatrick as his surgeon that the wound was not mortal he therefore prevailed with the irish peer to accompany him to the place where jones was confined to whom he behaved as we have already related  when allworthy returned to his lodgings he immediately carried jones into his room and then acquainted him with the whole matter as well what he had heard from mrs waters as what he had discovered from mr dowling  jones expressed great astonishment and no less concern at this account but without making any comment or observation upon it and now a message was brought from mr blifil desiring to know if his uncle was at leisure and he might wait upon him alworthy started and turned pale and then in a more passionate tone than i believe he had ever used before bid the servant tell blifil he knew him not consider dear sir  cries jones in a trembling voice  i have considered answered allworthy and you yourself shall carry my message to the villain  no one can carry him the sentence of his own ruin so properly as the man whose ruin he has so villainously contrived  pardon me dear sir said jones a moments reflection will i am sure convince you of the contrary what might be perhaps but justice from another tongue would from mine be insult and to whom  my own brother and your nephew  nor did he use me so barbarously  indeed that would have been more inexcuseable than any thing he has done fortune may tempt men of no very bad dispositions to injustice but insults proceed only from black and rancorous minds and have no temptations to excuse them  let me beseech you sir to do nothing by him in the present height of your anger consider my dear uncle i was not myself condemned unheard allworthy stood silent a moment and then embracing jones he said with tears gushing from his eyes o my child to what goodness have i been so long blind  mrs miller entering the room at that moment after a gentle rap which was not perceived and seeing jones in the arms of his uncle the poor woman in an agony of joy fell upon her knees and burst forth into the most extatic thanksgivings to heaven for what had happened  then running to jones she embraced him eagerly crying my dearest friend i wish you joy a thousand and a thousand times of this blessed day and next mr allworthy himself received the same congratulations to which he answered indeed indeed mrs miller i am beyond expression happy some few more raptures being passed on all sides mrs miller desired them both to walk down to dinner in the parlour where she said there were a very happy set of people assembled being indeed no other than mr nightingale and his bride and his cousin harris with her bridegroom  allworthy excused himself from dining with the company saying he had ordered some little thing for him and his nephew in his own apartment for that they had much private business to discourse of but would not resist promising the good woman that both he and jones would make part of her society at supper  mrs miller then asked what was to be done with blifil for indeed says she i cannot be easy while such a villain is in my house  allworthy answered he was as uneasy as herself on the same account o cries she if that be the case leave the matter to me i will soon show him the outside of my doors i warrant you here are two or three lusty fellows below stairs there will be no need of any violence cries allworthy if you will carry him a message from me he will i am convinced depart of his own accord will i said mrs miller i never did any thing in my life with a better will here jones interfered and said he had considered the matter better and would if mr allworthy pleased be himself the messenger i know says he already enough of your pleasure sir and i beg leave to acquaint him with it by my own words let me beseech you sir added he to reflect on the dreadful consequences of driving him to violent and sudden despair how unfit alas is this poor man to die in his present situation this suggestion had not the least effect on mrs miller she left the room crying you are too good mr jones infinitely too good to live in this world but it made a deeper impression on allworthy my good child said he i am equally astonished at the goodness of your heart and the quickness of your understanding heaven indeed forbid that this wretch should be deprived of any means or time for repentance that would be a shocking consideration indeed go to him therefore and use your own discretion yet do not flatter him with any hopes of my forgiveness for i shall never forgive villainy farther than my religion obliges me and that extends not either to our bounty or our conversation  jones went up to blifils room whom he found in a situation which moved his pity though it would have raised a less amiable passion in many beholders he had cast himself on his bed where he lay abandoning himself to despair and drowned in tears not in such tears as flow from contrition and wash away guilt from minds which have been seduced or surprised into it unawares against the bent of their natural dispositions as will sometimes happen from human frailty even to the good no these tears were such as the frighted thief sheds in his cart and are indeed the effects of that concern which the most savage natures are seldom deficient in feeling for themselves  it would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this scene in full length let it suffice to say that the behavior of jones was kind to excess he omitted nothing which his invention could supply to raise and comfort the drooping spirits of blifil before he communicated to him the resolution of his uncle that he must quit the house that evening he offered to furnish him with any money he wanted assured him of his hearty forgiveness of all he had done against him that he would endeavor to live with him hereafter as a brother and would leave nothing unattempted to effectuate a reconciliation with his uncle  blifil was at first sullen and silent balancing in his mind whether he should yet deny all but finding at last the evidence too strong against him he betook himself at last to confession he then asked pardon of his brother in the most vehement manner prostrated himself on the ground and kissed his feet in short he was now as remarkably mean as he had been before remarkably wicked  jones could not so far check his disdain but that it a little discovered itself in his countenance at this extreme servility he raised his brother the moment he could from the ground and advised him to bear his afflictions more like a man repeating at the same time his promises that he would do all in his power to lessen them for which blifil making many professions of his unworthiness poured forth a profusion of thanks and then he having declared he would immediately depart to another lodging jones returned to his uncle  among other matters allworthy now acquainted jones with the discovery which he made concerning the  00 l banknotes i have said he already consulted a lawyer who tells me to my great astonishment that there is no punishment for a fraud of this kind indeed when i consider the black ingratitude of this fellow toward you i think a highwayman compared to him is an innocent person  good heaven says jones is it possible  i am shocked beyond measure at this news i thought there was not an honester fellow in the world  the temptation of such a sum was too great for him to withstand for smaller matters have come safe to me through his hand indeed my dear uncle you must suffer me to call it weakness rather than ingratitude for i am convinced the poor fellow loves me and has done me some kindness which i can never forget nay i believe he has repented of this very act for it is not above a day or two ago when my affairs seemed in the most desperate situation that he visited me in my confinement and offered me any money i wanted consider sir what a temptation to a man who had tasted such bitter distress it must be to have a sum in his possession which must put him and his family beyond any future possibility of suffering the like  child cries allworthy you carry this forgiving temper too far such mistaken mercy is not only weakness but borders on injustice and is very pernicious to society as it encourages vice the dishonesty of this fellow i might perhaps have pardoned but never his ingratitude and give me leave to say when we suffer any temptation to atone for dishonesty itself we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be and so far i confess i have gone for i have often pitied the fate of a highwayman when i have been on the grand jury and have more than once applied to the judge on the behalf of such as have had any mitigating circumstances in their case but when dishonesty is attended with any blacker crime such as cruelty murder ingratitude or the like compassion and forgiveness then become faults i am convinced the fellow is a villain and he shall be punished at least as far as i can punish him  this was spoke with so stern a voice that jones did not think proper to make any reply besides the hour appointed by mr western now drew so near that he had barely time left do dress himself here therefore ended the present dialogue and jones retired to another room where partridge attended according to order with his clothes  partridge had scarce seen his master since the happy discovery the poor fellow was unable either to contain or express his transports he behaved like one frantic and made almost as many mistakes while he was dressing jones as i have seen made by harlequin in dressing himself on the stage  his memory however was not in the least deficient he recollected now many omens and presages of this happy event some of which he had remarked at the time but many more he now remembered nor did he omit the dreams he had dreamt the evening before his meeting with jones and concluded with saying i always told your honor something boded in my mind that you would one time or other have it in your power to make my fortune jones assured him that this boding should as certainly be verified with regard to him as all the other omens had been to himself which did not a little add to all the raptures which the poor fellow had already conceived on account of his master  chap xii approaching still nearer to the end jones being now completely dressed attended his uncle to mr westerns he was indeed one of the finest figures ever beheld and his person alone would have charmed the greater part of womankind but we hope it has already appeared in this history that nature when she formed him did not totally rely as she sometimes does on this merit only to recommend her work  sophia who angry as she was was likewise set forth to the best advantage for which i leave my female reader to account appeared so extremely beautiful that even allworthy when he saw her could not forbear whispering western that he believed she was the finest creature in the world to which western answered in a whisper overheard by all present so much the better for tom  for d  n me if he shall not ha the tousling her sophia was all over scarlet at these words while toms countenance was altogether as pale and he was almost ready to sink from his chair  the teatable was scarce removed before western lugged allworthy out of the room telling him he had business of consequence to impart and must speak to him that instant in private before he forgot it  the lovers were now alone and it will i question not appear strange to many readers that those who had so much to say to one another when danger and difficulty attended their conversation and who seemed so eager to rush into each others arms when so many bars lay in their way now that with safety they were at liberty to say or do whatever they pleased should both remain for some time silent and motionless insomuch that a stranger of moderate sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent but so it was however strange it may seem both sat with their eyes cast downwards on the ground and for some minutes continued in perfect silence  mr jones during this interval attempted once or twice to speak but was absolutely incapable muttering only or rather sighing out some broken words when sophia at length partly out of pity to him and partly to turn the discourse from the subject which she knew well enough he was endeavoring to open said   sure sir you are the most fortunate man in the world in this discovery  and can you realy madam think me so fortunate said jones sighing while i have incurred your displeasure  nay sir says she as to that you best know whether you have deserved it indeed madam answered he you yourself are as well apprized of all my demerits mrs miller has acquainted you with the whole truth o my sophia am i never to hope for forgiveness  i think mr jones said she i may almost depend upon your own justice and leave it to yourself to pass sentence on your own conduct  alas madam answered he it is mercy and not justice which i implore at your hands justice i know must condemn me  yet not for the letter i sent to lady bellaston of that i most solemnly declare you have had a true account he then insisted much on the security given him by nightingale of a fair pretense for breaking off if contrary to their expectations her ladyship should have accepted his offer but confessed that he had been guilty of a great indiscretion to put such a letter as that into her power which said he i have dearly paid for in the effect it has upon you i do not i cannot says she believe otherwise of that letter than you would have me my conduct i think shows you clearly i do not believe there is much in that and yet mr jones have i not enough to resent after what past at upton so soon to engage in a new amor with another woman while i fancied and you pretended your heart was bleeding for me  indeed you have acted strangely can i believe the passion you have professed to me to be sincere or if i can what happiness can i assure myself of with a man capable of so much inconstancy o my sophia cries he do not doubt the sincerity of the purest passion that ever inflamed a human breast think most adorable creature of my unhappy situation of my despair  could i my sophia have flattered myself with the most distant hopes of being ever permitted to throw myself at your feet in the manner i do now it would not have been in the power of any other woman to have inspired a thought which the severest chastity could have condemned inconstancy to you o sophia if you can have goodness enough to pardon what is past do not let any cruel future apprehensions shut your mercy against me  no repentance was ever more sincere o let it reconcile me to my heaven in this dear bosom sincere repentance mr jones answered she will obtain the pardon of a sinner but it is from one who is a perfect judge of that sincerity a human mind may be imposed on nor is there any infallible method to prevent it you must expect however that if i can be prevailed on by your repentance to pardon you i will at least insist on the strongest proof of its sincerity  o name any proof in my power answered jones eagerly time replied she time mr jones can alone convince me that you are a true penitent and have resolved to abandon these vicious courses which i should detest you if i imagined you capable of persevering in do not imagine it cries jones on my knees i entreat i implore your confidence a confidence which it shall be the business of my life to deserve let it then said she be the business of some part of your life to show me you deserve it i think i have been explicit enough in assuring you that when i see you merit my confidence you will obtain it after what is past sir can you expect i should take you upon your word  he replied dont believe me upon my word i have a better security a pledge for my constancy which it is impossible to see and to doubt what is that said sophia a little surprised i will show you my charming angel cried jones seizher hand and carrying her to the glass there behold it there in that lovely figure in that face that shape those eyes that mind which shines through those eyes can the man who shall be in possession of these be inconstant impossible my sophia they would six a dorimant a lord rochester you could not doubt it if you could see yourself with any eyes but your own sophia blushed and half smiled but forcing again her brow into a frown if i am to judge said she of the future by the past my image will no more remain in your heart when i am out of your sight than it will in this glass when i am out of the room by heaven by all that is sacred said jones it never was out of my heart the delicacy of your sex cannot conceive the grossness of ours nor how little one sort of amor has to do with the heart i will never marry a man replied sophia very gravely who shall not learn refinement enough to be as incapable as i am myself of making such a distinction i will learn it said jones i have learnt it already the first moment of hope that my sophia might be my wife taught it me at once and all the rest of her sex from that moment became as little the objects of desire to my sense as of passion to my heart well said sophia the proof of this must be from time your situation mr jones is now altered and i assure you i have great satisfaction in the alteration you will now want no opportunity of being near me and convincing me that your mind is altered too o my angel cries jones how shall i thank thy goodness and are you so good to own that you have a satisfaction in my prosperity  believe me believe me madam it is you alone have given me a relish to that prosperity since i owe to it the dear hope  o my sophia let it not be a distant one  i will be all obedience to your commands i will not dare to press any farther than you permit me yet let me entreat you to appoint a short trial o tell me when i may expect you will be convinced of what is most solemnly true when i have gone voluntarily thus far mr jones said she i expect not to be pressed nay i will not  o dont look unkindly thus my sophia cries he i do not i dare not press you  yet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the period o consider the impatience of love   a twelvemonth perhaps said she  o my sophia cries he you have named an eternity  perhaps it may be something sooner says she i will not be teazed if your passion for me be what i would have it i think you may now be easy  easy sophia call not such exulting happiness as mine by so cold a name  o transporting thought am i not assured that the blessed day will come when i shall call you mine when fears shall be no more when i shall have that dear that vast that exquisite extatic delight of making my sophia happy  indeed sir said she that day is in your own power  o my dear my divine angel cried he these words have made me mad with joy  but i must i will thank those dear lips which have so sweetly pronounced my bliss he then caught her in his arms and kissed her with an ardour he had never ventured before  at this instant western who had stood some time listening burst into the room and with his hunting voice and phrase cried out to her boy to her go to her  that is it little honeys o that is it well what is it all over has she appointed the day boy what shall it be tomorrow or next day it shall not be put off a minute longer than the next day i am resolved let me beseech you sir says jones dont let me be the occasion  beseech mine a  cries western i thought thou had been a lad of higher mettle than to give way to a parcel of maidenish tricks  i tell thee it is all flimflam zoodikers she would have the wedding tonight with all her heart would not sophy come confess and be an honest girl for once what art dumb why do not speak why should i confess sir says sophia since it seems you are so well acquainted with my thoughts  thats a good girl cries he and do consent then no indeed sir says sophia i have given no such consent  and wunt nut ha un then tomorrow nor next day says western  indeed sir says she i have no such intention but i can tell thee replied he why have nut only because thou do love to be disobedient and to plague and vex thy father  pray sir said jones interfering i tell thee thou at a puppy cries he when i forbid her then it was all nothing but sighing and whining and languishing and writing now i am vor thee she is against thee all the spirit of contrary that is all she is above being guided and governed by her father that is the whole truth on it it is only to disoblige and contradict me what would my papa have me do cries sophia what would i have thee do says he why gi un thy hand this moment  well sir said sophia i will obey you  there is my hand mr jones well and will you consent to ha un tomorrow morning says western  i will be obedient to you sir cries she  why then tomorrow morning be the day cries he  why then tomorrow morning shall be the day papa since you will have it so says sophia jones then fell upon his knees and kissed her hand in an agony of joy while western began to caper and dance about the room presently crying out  where the devil is allworthy he is without now atalking with that d  d lawyer dowling when he should be minding other matters he then sallied out in quest of him and very opportunely left the lovers to enjoy a few tender minutes alone  but he soon returned with allworthy saying if you will not believe me you may ask her yourself have nut gin thy consent sophy to be married tomorrow such are your commands sir cries sophia and i dare not be guilty of disobedience i hope madam cries allworthy my nephew will merit so much goondess and will be always as sensible as myself of the great honor you have done my family an alliance with so charming and so excellent a young lady would indeed be an honor to the greatest in england yes cries western but if i had suffered her to stand shill i shall i dilly dally you might not have had that honor yet awhile i was forced to use a little fatherly authority to bring her to i hope not sir cries allworthy i hope there is not the least constraint why there cries western you may bid her unsay all again if you will do repent heartily of thy promise do not sophy indeed papa cries she i do not repent nor do i believe i ever shall of any promise in favor of mr jones then nephew cries allworthy i felicitate you most heartily for i think you are the happiest of men and madam you will give me leave to congratulate you on this joyful occasion indeed i am convinced you have bestowed yourself on one who will be sensible of your great merit and who will at least use his best endeavors to deserve it his best endeavors cries western that he will i warrant un  harkee allworthy ill bet thee five pound to a crown we have a boy tomorrow nine months but prithee tell me what wut ha wut ha burgundy champaigne or what for please jupiter well make a night on it indeed sir said allworthy you must excuse me both my nephew and i were engaged before i suspected this near approach of his happiness engaged quoth the squire never tell me  i will not part with thee tonight upon any occasion shall sup here please the lord harry you must pardon me my dear neighbor answered allworthy i have given a solemn promise and that you know i never break why prithee who art engaged to cries the squire  allworthy then informed him as likewise of the company  odzookers answered the squire i will go with thee and so shall sophy for i will not part with thee tonight and it would be barbarous to part tom and the girl this offer was presently embraced by allworthy and sophia consented having first obtained a private promise from her father that he would not mention a syllable concerning her marriage  chap the last in which the history is concluded young nightingale had been that afternoon by appointment to wait on his father who received him much more kindly than he expected there likewise he met his uncle who was returned to town in quest of his new married daughter  this marriage was the luckiest incident which could have happened to the young gentleman for these brothers lived in a constant contention about the government of their children both heartily despising the method which each other took each of them therefore now endeavored as much as he could to palliate the offense which his own child had committed and to aggravate the match of the other this desire of triumphing over his brother added to the many arguments which allworthy had used so strongly operated on the old gentleman that he met his son with a smiling countenance and actually agreed to sup with him that evening at mrs millers  as for the other who really loved his daughter with the most immoderate affection there was little difficulty in inclining him to a reconciliation he was no sooner informed by his nephew where his daughter and her husband were than he declared he would instantly go to her and when he arrived there he scarce suffered her to fall upon her knees before he took her up and embraced her with a tenderness which affected all who saw him and in less than a quarter of an hour was as well reconciled to both her and her husband as if he had himself joined their hands  in this situation were affairs when mr allworthy and his company arrived to complete the happiness of mrs miller who no sooner saw sophia than she guessed every thing that had happened and so great was her friendship to jones that it added not a few transports to those she felt on the happiness of her own daughter  there have not i believe been many instances of a number of people met together where every one was so perfectly happy as in this company amongst whom the father of young nightingale enjoyed the least perfect content for notwithstanding his affection for his son notwithstanding the authority and the arguments of allworthy together with the other motive mentiond before he could not so entirely be satisfied with his sons choice and perhaps the presence of sophia herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his concern as a thought now and then suggested itself that his son might have had that lady or some such other not that any of the charms which adorned either the person or mind of sophia created the uneasiness it was the contents of her fathers coffers which set his heart a longing these were the charms which he could not bear to think his son had sacrificed to the daughter of mrs miller  the brides were both very pretty women but so totally were they eclipsed by the beauty of sophia that had they not been two of the besttempered girls in the world it would have raised some envy in their breasts for neither of their husbands could long keep his eyes from sophia who sat at the table like a queen receiving homage or rather like a superior being receiving adoration from all around her but it was an adoration which they gave not which she exacted for she was as much distinguished by her modesty and affability as by all her other perfections  the evening was spent in much true mirth all were happy but those the most who had been most unhappy before their former sufferings and fears gave such a relish to their felicity as even love and fortune in their fullest flow could not have given without the advantage of such a comparison yet as great joy especially after a sudden change and revolution of circumstances is apt to be silent and dwells rather in the heart than on the tongue jones and sophia appeared the least merry of the whole company which western observed with great impatience often crying out to them why do not talk boy why do look so grave have lost thy tongue girl drink another glass of wine shall drink another glass and the more to enliven her he would sometimes sing a merry song which bore some relation to matrimony and the loss of a maidenhead nay he would have proceeded so far on that topic as to have driven her out of the room if mr allworthy had not checked him sometimes by looks and once or twice by a fie mr western he began indeed once to debate the matter and assert his right to talk to his own daughter as he thought fit but as no body seconded him he was soon reduced to order  notwithstanding this little restraint he was so pleased with the cheerfulness and good humor of the company that he insisted on their meeting the next day at his lodgings they all did so and the lovely sophia who was now in private become a bride too officiated as the mistress of the ceremonies or in the polite phrase did the honors of the table she had that morning given her hand to jones in the chapel at doctorscommons where mr allworthy mr western and mrs miller were the only persons present  sophia had earnestly desired her father that no others of the company who were that day to dine with him should be acquainted with her marriage the same secrecy was enjoined to mrs miller and jones undertook for allworthy this some what reconciled the delicacy of sophia to the public entertainment which in compliance with her fathers will she was obliged to go to greatly against her own inclinations in confidence of this secrecy she went through the day pretty well till the squire who was now advanced into the second bottle could contain his joy no longer but filling out a bumper drank a health to the bride the health was immediately pledged by all present to the great confusion of poor blushing sophia and the great concern of jones upon her account to say truth there was not a person present made wiser by this discovery for mrs miller had whispered it to her daughter her daughter to her husband her husband to his sister and she to all the rest  sophia now took the first opportunity of withdraing with the ladies and the squire sat in to his cups in which he was by degrees deserted by all the company except the uncle of young nightingale who loved his bottle as well as western himself these two therefore sat stoutly to it during the whole evening and long after that happy hour which had surrendered the charming sophia to the eager arms of her enraptured jones  thus reader we have at length brought our history to a conclusion in which to our great pleasure though contrary perhaps to thy expectation mr jones appears to be the happiest of all human kind for what happiness this world affords equal to the possession of such a woman as sophia i sincerely own i have never yet discovered  as to the other persons who have made any considerable figure in this history as some may desire to know a little more concerning them we will proceed in as few words as possible to satisfy their curiosity  allworthy has never yet been prevailed upon to see blifil but he has yielded to the importunity of jones backed by sophia to settle  00 l a year upon him to which jones has privately added a third upon this income he lives in one of the northern counties about  00 miles distant from london and lays up  00 l a year out of it in order to purchase a seat in the next parliament from a neighboring borough which he has bargained for with an attorney there he is also lately turned methodist in hopes of marrying a very rich widow of that sect whose estate lies in that part of the kingdom  square died soon after he writ the before mentioned letter and as to thwackum he continues at his vicarage he has made many fruitless attempts to regain the confidence of allworthy or to ingratiate himself with jones both of whom he flatters to their faces and abuses behind their backs but in his stead mr allworthy has lately taken mr abraham adams into his house of whom sophia is grown immoderately fond and declares he shall have the tuition of her children  mrs fitzpatrick is separated from her husband and retains the little remains of her fortune she lives in reputation at the polite end of the town and is so good an oeconomist that she spends three times the income of her fortune without running in debt she maintains a perfect intimacy with the lady of the irish peer and in acts of friendship to her repays all the obligations she owes to her husband  mrs western was soon reconciled to her niece sophia and has spent two months together with her in the country lady bellaston made the latter a formal visit at her return to town where she behaved to jones as to a perfect stranger and with great civility wished him joy on his marriage  mr nightingale has purchased an estate for his son in the neighborhood of jones where the young gentleman his lady mrs miller and her little daughter reside and the most agreeable intercourse subsists between the two families  as to those of lower account mrs waters returned into the country had a pension of  0 l a year settled upon her by mr allworthy and is married to parson supple on whom at the instance of sophia western has bestowed a considerable living  black george hearing the discovery that had been made run away and was never since heard of and jones bestowed the money on his family but not in equal proportions for molly had much the greatest share  as for partridge jones has settled  0 l a year on him and he has again set up a school in which he meets with much better encouragement than formerly and there is now a treaty of marriage on foot between him and miss molly seagrim which through the mediation of sophia is likely to take effect  we now return to take leave of mr jones and sophia who within two days after their marriage attended mr western and mr allworthy into the country western has resigned his family seat and the greater part of his estate to his soninlaw and has retired to a lesser house of his in another part of the country which is better for hunting indeed he is often as a visitant with mr jones who as well as his daughter has an infinite delight in doing every thing in their power to please him and this desire of theirs is attended with such success that the old gentleman declares he was never happy in his life till now he has here a parlour and antichamber to himself where he gets drunk with whom he pleases and his daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it for jones has assured her that as next to pleasing her one of his highest satisfactions is to contribute to the happiness of the old man so the great duty which she expresses and performs to her father renders her almost equally dear to him with the love which she bestows on himself  sophia has already produced him two fine children a boy and a girl of whom the old gentleman is so fond that he spends much of his time in the nursery where he declares the tattling of his little granddaughter who is above a year and half old is sweeter music than the finest cry of dogs in england  allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to jones on the marriage and has omitted no instance of showing his affection to him and his lady who love him as a father whatever in the nature of jones had a tendency to vice has been corrected by continual conversation with this good man and by his union with the lovely and virtuous sophia he has also by reflection on his past follies acquired a discretion and prudence very uncommon in one of his lively parts  to conclude as there are not to be found a worthier man and woman than this fond couple so neither can any be imagined more happy they preserve the purest and tenderest affection for each other an affection daily increased and confirmed by mutual esteem nor is their conduct toward their relations and friends less amiable than toward one another and such is their condescension their indulgence and their beneficence to those below them that there is not a neighbor a tenant or a servant who does not most gratefully bless the day when mr jones was married to sophia  finis
