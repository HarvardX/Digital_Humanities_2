which all insects are subject a line can scarcely be drawn between the two species the most material distinction is the underside of c betulae being of the same color as the back but the underside of c populi is purple and smaller  the description which linnaeus has given of our species is longirostris corpore viridi aurato subtus concolore and degeer has described it in similar words it is evident that linnaeus had reason to suspect some difference of color between the two sexes but perhaps he never imagined the c purpureus berkenhout in his outlines of the natural history of great britain says c purpureus glossy purple snout very long petiver found this at epsom  which he had before described was also one sex or a variety of the same insect  geoffroy says rhinomacer totus viridi coeruleus and fabricius adds variat saepius color omnino coeruleo alter sexus thoracem antrorsum spinosum gerit how those different descriptions may be reconciled so as to be descriptive of the two sexes of c betulae will appear more clearly on farther observation  late in may this season being at darentwood dartford i met with one of the green kind and one of a dark blue color with a shade of green on the elytra i could not be deceived they were male and female as a farther corroboration i met with a second pair in a similar situation and on the day following a third the blue one of this last pair had not the shade of green as on the former but was of a rich glossy blue purple and i am greatly mistaken if it is not the c purpureus of linnaeus or the insect which is arranged in english cabinets for that species  i communicated the circumstance of meeting with those two insects which have always been considered as distinct kinds to a person who also was collecting insects in the wood on the same day and he informed me that he had just before discovered them in the same situation i have examined them very carefully but cannot discover any spines on the thorax of the green and gold kind though i have five of them but the three purple specimens are all spinous as described by authors i am of opinion that the bright colored specimens are all females and those which are purple i imagine are males  i mentioned the circumstance to an eminent entomologist and he at first suspected they might be mule insects generated between the c betulae and the c purpureus but that could not be the case as they were all in copulation when taken  we have been the more minute in this account as we consider the confounding of one species with another should ever be avoided with as much care as the separation of varieties into distinct species both tend to confuse or subvert that truth which should be the guide of every enquirer into nature  i have received a letter from my respectable friend t marsham esquire sec l s accompanied with a specimen of the green kind of c betulae that is spinous on the thorax together with one of the blue or purple kind which is spinous also he informs me that though his purple specimen has spines he is very certain he has had one without hence it appears to me that they admit of great variation indeed it would afford the most presumptive argument that there are males and females of both colors among the purple specimens which i took there was a considerable difference in their colors but of the five green specimens scarcely two exactly agreed one in particular partook so much of a vivid crimson that it might easily have been mistaken by a cursory collector for the curculio bachus   plate lxxv notonecta glauca common boatfly

clouded and frosted with black margin pale  we are happy to present our subscribers with the figure of a moth which is scarcely known among the english collectors and we may venture to assert on the best authority has not a place in any cabinet of insects in this metropolis except that of the author indeed the only person who appears to have been so fortunate as to meet with it except himself is mr lewin who formerly resided at dartford he considered it as such an invaluable rarity that had not a figure of it been discovered in roesel it would no doubt have been published in the transactions of the linnaean society it must however be observed that the insect roesel has figured is a foreign specimen  on the communication of mr jones of chelsea we presume that this insect was formerly known among the english collectors and received from them the appellation festoon moth but it must have been extremely rare even at that time as it does not appear in harriss list of english moths nor has a single specimen or its remains been found among the old collections which have been handed down to the entomologists of the present day  on the   th of august      i shook the caterpillar from one of the high branches of an oaktree in darent wood kent it remained motionless for some time when in the net and i concluded that it might have sustained an injury by its fall but i soon after discovered that it was naturally a sluggish inactive creature and had received no damage it remained several days in the caterpillar state but as it was almost ready to change into chrysalis i had only an opportunity of being convinced that oak was its proper food  this caterpillar is a most singular creature at one time it would flatten itself and be considerably extended in breadth or length at another time it would gather itself up like an hedgehog or become almost round and in a few minutes after it would be flat again and frequently the orange color on the back would be obliterated sometimes it so nearly resembled the caterpillars of several of the papilio tribe that i suspected it to be one of the hairstreak butterflies or rather the caterpillar of a new species on the   d of august it began to spin and in a short time after its case was completed  the case in which it passed to the pupa state was very firmly constructed and precluded an opportunity of observing the different symptoms of change which would otherwise have been visible this case which was exactly in the form of an egg was at first of a pale flesh color but in the course of a few days it had heightened to a very fine sanguineous and after to a scarlet or nearly vermilion color this color it retained for several months but as the time for the emancipation of the moth within approached the brightness of red somewhat abated though even after the fly came forth much of the original color remained  the manner in which it bursts open the case is rather singular it does not force an opening in an irregular form as most insects which spin a case but describes an exact circle within at one end after this it divides its case according to that circle only leaving a small portion to act as an hinge when it has extricated itself from the chrysalis it forces the top of the case back as shown in our figure and thereby a free passage is opened for its delivery  the inside of the case is perfectly smooth and appears as if polished by art it is of a pale blue color the chrysalis within is brown  the fly came forth on the   th of july        plate lxxvii fig i and fig ii phalaena

dark shades a broad irregular white mark and a tuft or button on the center of each head and thorax white clouded lower wings pale brown  this singular moth is very rarely met with it has been taken in coombewood surry and in kent but even in those places it is very uncommon  it is distinguished by the unusual form of the white markings on the upper wings and particularly by the tuft or button which is situated in an upright position near the center of each those tufts appear only slightly feathered on the upper parts to the naked eye but when one of them is examined with a microscope or even common magnifier it presents the appearance of a bundle of fibers enclosed within a thin membrane narrow at the base increasing in bulk near the middle and expanding at the summit into a number of shoots in the form of a crest several other tufts are dispersed near the extremities of the upper wings but they are not conspicuous to the naked eye  i have seen an insect which corresponds in every respect with this specimen except that it had a line of a dull ochre color along the posterior margins of the upper wings but i suspect it to be either a variety or perhaps only the difference of sex  linnaeus has not described this insect neither can we discover any description of it in the writings of fabricius and i have no doubt of its being a nondescript species  the singular crested tufts with the white markings on the upper wings furnish such an ample specific distinction that we have named it cristalana  found early in the month of august  fig i represents the natural size fig

insect also appears to be a nondescript species we have called it radiatella or rayed from the form of the dark stripes which rise from the base and spread in the form of rays to the apices of the upper wings it is very liable to change after death and particularly the buff color which appears very bright when the insect is fresh but is sometimes so altered in appearance when placed in the cabinet that an intermixture of that color can be scarcely distinguished between the rays of purple we mention this circumstance as very few small lepidopterous insects are subject to such alteration

  fig     the papilio antiopa is found in every part of europe in germany particularly it is very common it is as frequent in america as in europe and is esteemed as a rarity only in this country it is indeed sometimes found in abundance with us but as its appearance is neither annual nor periodical it is generally valued by english collectors  there have been several instances of this insect being found in different parts of the country in mild seasons as plenty as the peacock or admirable butterflies in the summer of      particularly they were as numerous in some places as the common garden white butterfly is usually near london  but as a proof that its appearance does not altogether depend on the temperature of the weather we need only adduce that not a single specimen has been taken this season although it has been one of the most favorable for all kinds of insects that can be recollected and many species of moths and butterflies which have not been seen for several years before have been taken at combewood darnwood and similar adjacent parts during summer in plenty  it is from the uncertainty of its appearance that we have such different and seemingly irreconcilable accounts of the abundance and scarcity of this butterfly it was certainly well known as a native of this country to former collectors yet it received only a few years since the new name grand surprise this name which was given by moses harris or by some of the company of aurelians of whose society he was a member was evidently intended as a significant expression of their admiration not of the beauty of the insect but of the singular circumstance of the species remaining so long in those very places where the most diligent researches of preceding collectors had been made in vain of their unwearied industry they were well persuaded and were therefore unable to account for the appearance of a numerous brood of large insects which must have remained concealed many years or been lately transported to those places  harris in his aurelian calls it the camberwell beauty though in his list of english butterflies hawkmoths and moths he uses the name grand surprise we mention this circumstance as it appears very inconsistent that the new name he adopts in one work and the old one he should have discarded in the other are equally and indiscriminately used in the several editions of both we still find it in the aurelian camberwell beauty in the other grand surprise from which it might be readily inferred that he meant two distinct insects were it not for the addition of the linnaean name pap antiopa  in the general description of this insect in the aurelian harris does not say that it was scarce at that time      which he certainly would if it had been so but berkenhout in his outlines of natural history      adds after its specific character that it is very rare in this kingdom to reconcile those accounts we can only observe that no insect is more uncertain as to the time of its appearance that though found in abundance in one season it may not be seen in the next or even for several successive years it will then appear in small or large quantities for one two or more seasons and again disappear for many years as before  the english specimens differ from those of other countries in the color of the light exterior border of the wings in the former that part is of a very pale yellow brown inclining to a dirty white in the latter it is of a deep yellow marked and spotted with brown fabricius notices this difference and says they are varieties  the

native of this island but it is now past a doubt as i have had the good fortune to find a caterpillar of this moth in marshy ground at barnscray near crayford in kent about the middle of august

sporting together which is not commonly observed of insects that are not either varieties or differ only in sex  they are rarely met with our specimens were taken in june at dartford  they have been
