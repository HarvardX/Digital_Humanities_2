constantine a tragedy  price one shilling and sixpence  constantine a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in covent garden  london printed for a millar over against catherinestreet in the strand mdccliv  to the right honorable the earl of chesterfield my lord i did not dare so coldly was this play received by the town to ask leave in the usual forms to dedicate it to your lordship its fate was early determined and in such a manner that i very little flatter myself it can be worthy of your lordships patronage or may presume to boast it was once honored with your approbation but as i may probably never have another opportunity certainly not in this kind of writing of publicly professing my respect my esteem i had almost said my affection for your lordship may i not be forgiven if i thus dedicate not the play but its author not his poetry but his understanding and his heart  with sentiments such as these i dare assure your lordship you shall not be insulted with the usual too civil language of dedications yet i confess i would gladly recover the name of dedications to its ancient dignity before they were prostituted most absurdly prostituted by the author of the pharsalia when he dedicated to a tyrant a poem in defense of liberty i confess i mean to praise for honest praise is not only one of the warmest incitements to virtue but its most honorable reward great minds will receive it with their natural greatness and only little spirits have an affectation of refusing it the task i own is not without difficulty but when the original is marked with strong and pleasing lines of life a meaner hand may preserve the likeness the integrity of his coloring if i may be allowed the expression is of more consequence than the glow and richness of it dedications would then be like pictures in miniature which the future historian might draw out into larger proportion grace and dignity  let me then have the honor of informing your lordships historian that although your youth perhaps was spent among pleasures not illsuited to that gayer season of life neque tu choreas sperne puer yet it was not lost among its too frequent dissipations ancient and modern languages with an accurate and critical knowledge of the english tongue its harmony copiousness and variety of expression are not to be acquired without much application nor could the greatest natural abilities not even your own my lord have appeared in the most important debates of the house of lords with such superior strength of reasoning with eloquence in the true character of eloquence at once pleasing and powerful had they not been improved by all advantages of education  to such abilities were entrusted the honor and interest of the nation in embassies abroad and the most important employments at home how happily for ireland was the possessor of them sent thither as lord lieutenant in that dangerous crisis the late rebellion one part of the nation the natural enemies of his majestys government were to be awed by power tempered with lenity the other were to be restrained in their zeal of loyalty which though sometimes shown perhaps with too much warmth has ever been their glory and their boast how happily the goodness of your lordships heart was mixed with the wisdom of your councils the gratitude of the whole people will for ever acknowledge long may you enjoy their wishes their prayers for your happiness long may you enjoy the consciousness of your own integrity that nobly refused a vote of credit and an offer of raising a body of forces which you wisely foresaw would be an useless expense to the kingdom what must be the firmness and generosity of that spirit which is not to be seduced by gold intimidated by danger or corrupted by views of enlarging its power  your lordship now seems determined and surely the gallant veteran deserves his dismission to retire from all public business permit my lord this honest dedication for well you know that flattery would not desire it to attend you to your retreat and with it be pleased to accept the sincerest respect of  my lord your lordships most obliged and most obedient servant philip francis  the prologue over a soft tale of well imagined woes the willing tear with feeble transport flows but when the muse in her own griefs appears the storied sorrows of a thousand years a nobler tribute than our tears we pay our passions hear her and our hearts obey such scenes tonight  oh for a muse of fire great shakespeare thine our author to inspire then fierce ambition guilt despair and rage and frantic jealousy should shake the stage tyrants and slaves her equal wrath should find her furies haunt them and revenge mankind but where is the modern spirit can sustain the weight of greece or draw the roman scene their heroes seem of some superior state great in their virtues in their vices great here wild ambition earth and heaven defies and there  oh glorious fate the patriot greatly dies yet if with modest hope our author aim at your applause  for your applause is fame let him tonight your wonted candor find oh be the critics eye a little blind and if to you ye fair he pours his heart to your distresses gives his tenderest art to beauty virtue and to you he sues as you inspired  oh patronize his muse epilogue spoken by miss bellamy well you expect  so says the taste in vogue  to these sad scenes a laughing epilogue but i am untaught in every comic grace wits bolder mirth or humours various face nor shall i dare with your loved mimic art take off the cit  the beau  the blood  the smart shall i the dear coquets sweet trifling try pish  as i live  be quiet  let me die  then melt a look  deliciously explaining the double  no good faith the single meaning as for our play  methinks this tragic plot might furnish precious hints for you know what  to leave an empress  though so wondrous chaste  with a young lover  two full hours at least  in our frail times this dangerous tete a tete  in the first act  had made the play complete and then the moral  ye whose happy lives are blessed with rare discretion  in your wives when trifles  light as air  shall turn your heads ah shun that naughty trick  of separate beds besides the midnight  reconciling billing ah think how near was constantine to killing but hush our bard  if should he hear us laughing wont he say your flippant mirth  good maam  may damn my play then for my sake  but i am in such a fright  well  i will give out the play  for monday night a new epilogue written by a person of distinction miss bellamys illness prevented her speaking it in all this scene of treason swords and death my fright has almost taken away my breath and yet our bard insists that i must say something for him and something for his play most of the fairones sure must be contented and must approve the part i have represented who think these characters no stain to life the duteous daughter and the tender wife who taste the highest blessings while they prove the husbands fondness and the parents love though i confess there are of our sweet sex who formed to please transform themselves to vex rebels to gentlest sway foes to restriction whose chiefest bliss is placed in contradiction who think obedience to the milder will of a kind parent smells of childhood still and that the father should not be obeyed  not half an hour  after the portions paid to such alone whose virtuous bosoms prove paternal fondness or connubial love our author freely offers up his cause and let those generous passions stand for laws by them he will be tried if they acquit he is safe if they condemn he must submit dramatis personae constantine mr barry maximian mr sparks aurelian mr smith albinus mr ridout marcellus mr stevens fulvia miss bellamy cornelia mrs barrington officers lictors guards etc  scene constantines palace in constantinople  advertisement it is almost ridiculous after the ill success of this play upon the stage to tell the reader i took part of the fable and the translation if i remember rightly of one only line from a french tragedy called maximian but all concealments of this kind are disingenuous  constantine act i scene i the emperor s palace aurelian and marcellus meeting aurelian speak have i leave to see her  marcellus yes my lord  aurelian but when how soon for did the hour marcellus ride on the tempests wing the speed of light its swiftness were too slow yet yet she comes not  marcellus what can these transports mean are these emotions to tell the empress that her lord returns with conquest to her arms did friendship send you its messenger of love did constantine   aurelian he sent me not  marcellus my lord  aurelian nor do i come a messenger of conquest joy or love  marcellus then my worst fears are true the impetuous passion flames forth again again maximians daughter   aurelian is she not all her sexs pride would aim at their various arts of charming  marcellus dear my lord though she were fairer than the ideal beauty that warms the lovers hopes or poets fancy yet shall the bright temptation best excuse for human frailty melt away all faith allegiance honor duty oh remember   aurelian what that she now is wedded to another another breathes my transports over her bosom sighs out my love and drinks with raptured ear the vows that once were mine if thou could charm the madmans ravings bid the heart be still when passion shakes us or with words of wisdom pour on the feverish sense the balm of health i then might listen to thee  marcellus is this aurelian the pride of rome the example of her youth but i confess this language well befits your commerce with maximian a spirit made of fire whose fierce ambition and whose fell revenge he knows no other passions vex his soul as adverse winds and meeting tides at sea roll the wild waves on heaps  aurelian revenge ambition whence can they rise what motives to inflame them does he not share with our great emperor all but the name of empire and its cares what would a fathers heart however ambitious more than to see the homage of the nations paid to his daughters virtues to her beauty  marcellus her greatness only brings to his remembrance his own was lost when our late emperor forced him to give her hand to constantine and happily for europe wrested from him the imperial power since when his rage beholds his son as the usurper of his throne then in his zeal for the old gods of rome he hates him as a christian should he tempt your youth to join with his despair your virtue i know the rich reward   aurelian look where she comes a rich reward indeed i pray you leave me and at some better leisure every secret of confidence and friendship shall be yours  exit marcellus aurelian and is it mine  ye powers why am i destined to throw disorder over that loveliest form to fill those eyes with weeping and that breast with anguish beyond thought  enter fulvia fulvia aurelian welcome say to my heart my constantine is well give me the storied war the battles rage though my soul tremble at it show my hero in all the bleeding pride of glorious danger how terribly adorned but ah my fears you do not feel my transports downcast eyes horror is in thy face  aurelian it is in my heart  fulvia where is my lord my emperor oh speak is he a conqueror comes he home in triumph  aurelian fame honor conquest bind their wreaths of glory around his sacred temples and he comes to enjoy his triumphs in his fulvias arms  fulvia why would you thus alarm me i am a woman in tenderness and love in all things else a roman spirit and maximians daughter still there is a fear  is it too big for utterance heaves at your heart such silence speaks all fears  aurelian could my despair could my distraction tell you what my heart feels this moment how it bleeds your pity would forgive me though i stain your fathers venerable name with blood though i accuse  no  honor faith and loyalty they only shall accuse him  fulvia stop not thus let not my fears grow impious in their wildness my father  there the alarming tale began maximian   aurelian too impatient to resume the imperial purple he so late resigned thinking the little fame my youth has gained my interest with the legions my command so near the person of my royal master might aid his purpose with unbounded hand threw out ambitions glories to my view with half the throne of universal empire   fulvia while constantine your emperor  while he lives where slept this fierce desire or power so long what wakes it now to madness  aurelian when the rage of battle ceased and victory no longer stood hovering over us with uncertain wing my lord maximian asked  almost demanded the government of these new german conquests for his once favorite freedman caius lucius  fulvia that gloomy fierceness that unpitying soldier but then my lord   aurelian perhaps with some impatience refused the warm request grief shame and anger the consciousness of greatness and the pride that saw the soldiers mourn for his disgrace the time the place each circumstance deep smote your fathers heart and waked ambitions fires though long but ill suppressed hence the proposal but when he saw my soul start back with horror and sicken at the pomp of bad ambition he showed me thee that allexcelling form love threw his colors over it oh forgive me to turn my faith to treason  fulvia hold my lord such insolence of language who am i  aurelian the empress of the world the sacred awe of grateful nations of imperial rome the pride the joy  you are the wife of constantine yet oh remember there was once a time when other loves approached you when maximian approved my passion authorized my vows and gave my wishes leave to gaze upon you  fulvia no more what proofs of this black deed my father source of my life  it is parricide to think it  aurelian the doubt becomes your piety behold this sword a fatal witness  fulvia it is not that my lords first gift his bridalmorning present i must not dare not think it or twas given you for some blessed purpose to protect my lord when oh too prodigal of life he thinks not that life is loves and mine  aurelian with this he armed my fearful hand with this he bad me strike how shall i say the heart your love delights in then loud he cried possess my daughters beauties and share the world with me i took it trembling lest he might find some slave so lost to honor as to obey his guiltiness  fulvia my lord if i have wronged your virtue by suspecting  yet nature claims her rights and awful bids me not trust too lightly to an accusation that brands a fathers everhonourd name with perfidy and treason o my constantine is this thy day of triumph this return for all thy toils to bless a thankless world how shall thy fulvia meet thee shall her heart with other pantings than with those of love receive its lord and tremble in his arms  aurelian oh stop these soft complainings even this hour death sits upon its wings and fierce revenge lashes its speed this moment must determine a fathers fate or   fulvia husbands how determine am i the dire reward the prize of blood horror on horror of my husbands blood ye powers who make this trial of my weakness  but oh what form of prayer  heaven must not hear me daughter or wife  in love or nature impious in either name a force that pulls my heart strings  aurelian each instant i expect him for he comes to regulate the honors of the day meet him with smiles with unsuspecting looks throw your caresses round him and awake with natures voice the affections she inspires  fulvia meet him with smiles thou cruel cold adviser no with these tears for what can stop their flowing or with the louder sorrows of distraction till nature hear my cries through all her works  aurelian oh yet with calmer temper sooth him melt him with prayers with tears and when you urge him strongest seem most to doubt to disbelieve to think twas but a start of passion of ambition that madness of the brave let your success insure the peace of nations of the world and give you down to fame a nobler story than yet your sex can boast  exit aurelian fulvia alone what fame what story to violate the eternal laws of nature her dearest first relations child and parent to be myself the accuser or behold my wedded lord  oh yet forbid it love  stabbed in my arms reproaching me in death a perjured faithless wife distraction guide me where the heart cannot choose and reason dares not  enter a messenger messenger madam my lord maximian exit fulvia alone now my soul meet this new trial firmly this dissembling that talks in smiles when the sad hearts in tears  enter maximian fulvia kneeling to him witness this pious tender of my duty how gladly i behold my fathers presence thus may i ever see the laureled wreath circling his brows with glory sure my lord she rises ah whence that coldness that averted look the fierce and hardy germans are a conquest worthy the ancient majesty of rome  maximian how did they dare rebel ye powers immortal who formed the imperial city to its greatness how are we fallen the majesty of rome shall it be deemed a conquest to have quelled a single nation this days idle pomp be numbered with the triumphs we have seen when the world sunk beneath us but our eagles that used to soar with empire on their wings now bend their flight like birds of meaner plume to stoop at worthless triumphs while our emperor   fulvia aside now now the cloud is opening into thunder  maximian his thoughts are heavenward  in his holy zeal for this new sect this christian superstition he has transferred the eternal seat of empire from where the gods had fixed it to this city now honored with his name allsovereign jove where are the thunders that assert thy godhead the temples where we offered to thy name the vows of human kind can thou behold them defiled polluted and not pour thy wrath upon his head this emperor of christians  fulvia oh spare the dreadful image gracious heaven throw your own shield of safety over his life protect him from the schemes of fierce ambition unhallowed vengeance and the midnight treason that dares not rise to the fair face of day  maximian what would our empress mean  fulvia oh shall the sword  it was a soldiers present to a soldier  to deeds of honor was it ever sacred nor in the wild tumultuous hour of fight ever stained its luster with a cowards blood but with distinguished slaughter swept the field and shall maximian for less noble purpose unsheath its terrors he who often has led the roman war to conquest he whose life should guard the life of empire  shall my father   maximian coward aurelian base betraying christian aside who dares accuse me  fulvia sir your daughter must not  maximian my daughter no my empress as it seems the wife of constantine thou young ingratitude  can thou forget  but i will not bid the gods the avenging gods remember how i have loved thee go parricide betray thy fathers age to cruelty and tortures when my heart shall burst in death when my strong sinews crack in agonizing anguish let your eye delighted see my torments and your ear enjoy my groans  fulvia oh save me save me nature from the dire scene from horrors to distract me but i will offend no more for even my grief distraction and despair shall speak the language of duty and of love yet hear them speak and then imagine that last night in sleep i saw my fathers hand bathed deep in blood his sons his emperors blood how did i rend the air with shrieks and on his bleeding corse pour my distracted sorrows while my tears flowed fast  they flowed in no unreal streams such as you see them now  maximian i see the visions of a disordered fancy that has formed its own wild images of grief and terror if there be aught more real in thy story give me to know the slave who dares accuse me  fulvia accuse what accusation shall maximian the glory once the example of the brave be in his age accused and oh for ever be numbered with the guilty and their crimes better be lost to fame for ever lost no eye to weep your memory not even mine mine shall be closed in death or wildest horror sit gazing on its open sense for ever  maximian wild as the dreams of madness tell me madam  but i will not chide you for the unkind suspicions these visionary terrors have inspired they too shall pass away in this days triumph and peace return to thy affrighted spirit  fulvia oh never never these imagined terrors to me are real anguish and despair oh hear me sir throwing herself on her knees your purpose  should it prosper  what horrors shall alarm your waking sense dwell on your sleep and fright your dreams to madness the tempests of the night shall rage within you and when you hear the thunder cold pale fear shall sit upon your heart shall stop its beatings and freeze the stream of life o constantine rising while we are meditating death your love perhaps is forming some fond generous scheme to make your fulvia happy and to crown her fathers days with glory  maximian ha can constantine add to maximians glory did there need this second outrage are my old years thus o curse of age insulted by my child  fulvia am i your child will you and nature own me  maximian were thou not every joy to every sense that pours the passions here and now ungrateful  yet you can weep  those tears  can they be false ones how gladly would thy fathers love believe them how gladly think thou fondness of my soul some villains arts have wrought upon thy weakness to do this act of outrage on my heart  fulvia have i then wronged you  how my soul rejoices in the sweet hope these these the tears of joy they they alone shall witness for my truth they only shall implore forgiveness for me  maximian i do believe them they are natures truth and thou the purest bliss my prayers ever asked or heavens large bounty gave me pray retire dry these illomend tears rely upon me maximian never can forget his honor never forget a fathers tenderness leads her out returns and speaks then all is lost revenge ambition empire or henceforth to be held by vile dependence on a weak girls affection by dissembling he who has led to war the fate of nations and swayed the imperial scepter  o maximian how are thy glories withered is it fear let me not think it  can the love of life a poor precarious casual hour of breathing subdue me thus no it is some nobler passion unsated rage and vengeance on the slave whose christian fears betrayed me if albinus  should he betray me too my fame my life  but that is a trifle  my revenge is lost  enter albinus maximian without looking back who is there  albinus my everroyal lord   maximian turning from albinus albinus start at the presence of a friend what power can thus control the senses my confusion it doubles on me  to be seen surpised thus in my souls disorder  in its weakness  albinus i have stood thus long my lord in silent wonder   maximian there is an unsleeping spirit here albinus that ceaseless talks to memory and tells me i was an emperor once  albinus a truly great one  maximian it is in my dreams it lives among my slumbers while fancy wild creations various mistress forms my full court and bids them bend the knee as if my frowns were death the lictors fasces the applauding senate and praetorian guards start at my nod to execute to strike at my great bidding but the glorious vision dazzling the eye of fancy when i wake melts into air and i am again a slave  albinus what power can shake that temper which unmoved ruled the fierce hour of fight like oceans god who sits upon the storm and guides its raging  maximian war is no more o rome thy arts are lost the honored name of soldier and his glory to shine in arms to dare the front of danger and follow fortune through the doubtful field our emperor needs thee not his holy warfare to quell the passions and subdue the heart his triumphs need thee not  albinus call back my lord these wanderings into reason  maximian why to reason will it not tell me i am a subject now to me as hateful as the name of slave will it not tell me that i dare not punish a villain who betrays me  albinus sir aurelian  maximian and shall the gods of rome behold me kneel beneath the throne of constantine his name darts like a burning fever through my veins and shall i enter into vile debate to clear my insulted honor god of vengeance why did i trust thy cause  for it was thine  to any other hand i should myself have struck the destined sacrifice at thine and great ambitions altar  albinus hark his trumpets he now is entering the triumphal gate we must prepare to meet him  maximian yes and join the universal shout that calls him lord hailed by his christian priests right holy flatterers the conqueror of the world while i o torture beneath whose name in war he rose to empire upon whose ruins he has built his fame must wait upon his fortune and appear to grace his chariotwheels and swell his triumphs  albinus let us not lose my lord this noble heat in idle threats and rashness yet ere night something may be resolved of glorious danger worthy maximian of his fortune worthy when the same rapid moment in its flight shall form and execute   maximian despair shall execute what hope had formed fall swift ye shades of night and all ye powers who wing the midnight darkness whom the sun with this his garish light rebukes appalls inspire our councils shed your influence over them then if i fall  let the gods answer for it exeunt act ii triumphal

your love our truest glory our fairest wreath of fame my noblest triumph oh were it possible should bid the nations unite in mutual amity and peace that all the blessings bounteous nature gives to different climes as sure her wisdom meant should be enjoyed by all take care aurelian that every honor due to great deservings be paid these noble prisoners though the chance of war be fallen upon them yet like us they fought their countrys cause let us remember how long their valor held the doubtful field and numbering over our wounds let them instruct us to reverence their misfortunes  aurelian such a conquest where nor the vanquished mourn their loss of honor nor kings their sceptres nor the world its freedom is worthy caesars fortune pointing to them while the nations from farthest india to the western isles pour at your feet the homage of their treasures rome sends a nobler tribute vows and praise omens of glorious hope in which she sees her once victorious ardor rise renewed through many a distant age from this days triumph  constantine too long my friend has the wild waste of war raged over the earth oh were the sceptred warriors whose lust of empire sets the world in arms were they to see the widows keen affliction or hear the mothers shrieks in her despair what could ambition answer but in peace  see where its fairest image comes to meet us seeing the empress with all its blessings round her enter fulvia maximian albinus o my fulvia next to my peoples happiness and glory thou art my wreath of victory the crown of all my triumphs honor fame and war shall witness for my heart its tenderest joys dwell in thy arms thou purest bliss of love  fulvia my lord my emperor  all other words wrong my full joy my love  constantine it is eloquence beyond all power of words it is the language my heart best understands and talks to thine now by the dear delight of gazing on thee i swear the rage of war its wildest tumults have but endeared this soft return of love this meeting of our hearts but ah my fulvia whence is that air of sadness fear and sorrow are pale upon thy cheek and now a tear stands trembling on the luster of thy eye  fulvia amidst the general joy to pour my soul to call you mine the worlds great master mine his conquests triumphs mine nay more his love is such excess of bliss  yet oh forgive me thou lord of all my thoughts if aught illomend fancy or fear a womans weaker passions should mix themselves with thee  constantine but that i know thou softness of thy sex thy gentle spirit what might i think what terrors must alarm me yet tell me tell the impatience throbbing here is it within the wide command of empire to calm these tender fears for what is empire why have i conquered why this day of triumph but that my fulvia may accept its glories laid at her feet in homage to her beauties  fulvia her matron virtue rather and her love they may accept may feel the joys of greatness because the gift is yours yet midst its glories can i be perfect happy while i see your cold looks there  pointing to maximian while my divided heart divided between tenderness and duty trembles for both  maximian aside to albinus ay now she tells him all now she describes o welldissembled terrors the fearful deed now she protests her love and now with pious seemings goddess nature dares she profane thy name and call me father pleads for my life  o young hypocrisy   constantine to fulvia with what delight has my soul listened to thy pious sorrows nor shall they plead in vain my lord maximian what can i pay you back in rich return for transports such as these you gave her to me you made her beauties made her virtues mine and blessed my soul with love if large ambition its sceptred honors its imperial sway can speak me grateful take divide them with me besides the unhappy gift i late denied you resume the sacred purple let the world ruled by your wisdom learn the arts of peace or conquered by your war make rome immortal  maximian there was a time my lord i thought ambition the spirit of the gods the soul of heroes but these white years which time has poured upon me have quenched its ardors these warwearied limbs wish for repose to lay their feeble strength beneath the peaceful shade which this days triumph spreads over the earth there in an old mans warfare to talk of freezing nights and burning days the toils of glory sieges marches battles and animate our youth to deeds of honor be now my sole ambition  fulvia to constantine tell my heart how to express these transports or let love in its own language thus in this embrace pour forth at once its gratitude and joy  constantine with equal rapture equal joy inspired my soul meets thine thus could i hold thee ever transported thus and gazing over thy beauties with wonder as with love but let us not with impious carelessness forget his praise by whose right arm we conquered in his temple the only god of victory well offer the bannerd trophy and the spoils of war in monumental praise then turn to earth our future cares with liberty and peace best use of sovereign power to bless mankind  exit constantine fulvia aurelian maximian albinus maximian was it of such slight moment to provoke me did he so little dread maximians anger that he has granted to a womans tear what he denied to me for this the legions whom i had led to conquest saw me bend my spirit to the earth confess his power  saw me refused a light unvalued trifle scarce worth a womans tears  albinus but now in recompense he offers half his empire  maximian no twas insult you saw it plain contemptuous purposed insult his insolence of triumph that his courtiers his christians might enjoy their masters pride and my dishonor but it seems in recompense he offers half his empire could his word make me despotick monarch of creation his gift i would disdain it my ambition  shall it from him receive its sullied honors  albinus this talking heat this loose intemperance is this maximians vengeance but be sure suspicion is abroad it marks your steps would you insure these threats which now are air keep your eye constant let no passion shake it no color change your cheek open your face in smiles and let your tongue flow loose in flattery go to their christian temple   maximian what to hear their sainted hymns in pious harmony thrilled through a eunuchs throat their holy minstrelsy suits not my taste give me a soldiers music sung by the voice of war with discords in it or must i hear our roman jove blasphemed his godhead ridiculed in cold harangues that talk i know not what of holy patience that must forgive the man who dares to wrong me doctrines for slaves and cowards  albinus yet my lord what if the empress we may well expect it or should aurelian tell this fatal secret we must with boldness meet the accusation and throw it back upon them if my lord you would have vengeance   maximian if  i will albinus this christian emperor and his favorite slave  shall he enjoy his perfidy in safety  albinus yet would you kill him where he feels most sensibly beyond the pains of his own fancied hell strike at his friendship his highboasted loyalty make constantine suspect him nay believe him a villain and a traitor there are witnesses there are my lord for things impossible what think you of marcellus  maximian what his friend  albinus his friend and then who better can betray him who better be supposed to know his heart not to amuse you longer  this his friend and some of higher note bold roman spirits fond of the ancient privilege of triumphs and high in mirth which i had raised with wine with lavish wit condemned the emperors conduct in the late war and ridiculed his conquests i had them seized confined them told the emperor with some expressions some loose hints of treason which men in wine might possibly forget  maximian methinks i see your purpose and it charms me  albinus i shall by constantines command examine them if fair and friendly methods fail to win them tortures shall make them speak as i shall prompt them then with some wellwrought circumstance of jealousy   maximian of jealousy  albinus what other power can make him suspect the man he loves or will he listen to other crimes ambition shall be virtue and treason seem ambition then my lord all other passions have their hours of thinking and hear the voice of reason this alone breaks at the first suspicion into frenzy and sweeps the soul in tempests  maximian but its pangs  those you forget  do they not rend the heart shall i not hear him groan  albinus you shall my lord for all its fiery seeds are in his temper when honor justice reason bid him act no being firmer but in all his passions the whirlwinds wildness is not more inconstant when he you must remember and aurelian this boasted friend were rivals for your daughter friendship esteem and oftenvowd affection in the first start of jealousy were lost will he rage less when the imperial greatness shall add its pride when the wronged husbands honor brings all its nice suspicions to inflame him  maximian and when my eye when my revenge is sated with gazing on his pangs when his full sense can entertain no more of pain and anguish then in the triumph of my soul to tell him his wife was innocent  ah who was innocent  albinus is this maximian this the unshaken spirit let not the soldier see it let not rome who thinks you like her gods above all weakness  maximian yet tell me can i say to my revenge be thou my daughter to this fierce ambition bequeath my power or bid it to inherit my name and honors can his deepest groans charm my transported soul like those sweet sounds that called me father she is all my children  albinus you are my lord the master of your fate it was not mine the ambition or the vengeance that prompted this great deed not mine the glory had it succeeded to restore o jove thy violated shrines and to mankind the worship of their reason uncontrolled by slavish fears and illimagind terrors nor mine the danger if this muchloved daughter   maximian all that is left me of the name of father  albinus in some loose house of dalliance should betray you i am not known thus honored with your friendship i pay to constantine a courtiers flattery am thought a favorite and oh profess forgive me gods a worship i detest i shall not trembling kneel before his throne and live with infamy or die a traitor  maximian first perish all affections every instinct that breathes these feelings through the parents heart it is past the conflicts over and ambition  methinks i see the radiant goddess come and like a soldiers mistress to my arms painted with blood how fiercely sweet her beauties this night albinus you command the palace and when he sleeps  oh shall maximian kill a sleeping enemy is this the soldier is this the ambition that would rule the world oh shame shame shame what end however glorious can justify such means but not my cause  it is thine o rome thy everliving fame the capitol and all its throned gods they strike the blow they bid the victim bleed exeunt act iii fulvia with what paternal tenderness he soothed me with every dear assurance that his heart abhorred such cruelty then earnest pressed me to ask the emperor to make aurelian commander of his guards now now my soul whence are the ceaseless fears that shake thee thus whence are these strange forebodings  enter constantine constantine why my fulvia while the full voice of triumph over thy name swells higher into rapture while the bowl pours forth its purple spirits to thy beauties why seek this solitude why shun the joys that you alone inspire how has my love unwittingly offended does maximian why startled at his name does he believe my friendship insincere why does your eye gaze with so soft an earnestness upon me and now it melts into a mingled stream of tenderness and sorrow  fulvia it is because this is perhaps my last last look of tenderness and all the rest is sorrow  constantine by our friendship its mutual trust and confidence of heart  or shall i urge the husbands sacred rights no i disclaim all rights but those of love then in the name of all its chaste endearments its holy raptures its mysterious joys tell me thy fears tell me thy sorrows fulvia i have a right of love to share them with you  fulvia why did i move you thus o sir forgive me it may be it is the weakness of my sex but they who hate our faith revile its worship and treat its pure simplicity with scorn are they fit guardians of your sacred person the lord of our religion when i see these worshippers of jove whose dire example can justify even treason can my heart even in thy arms in yours and loves protection can it speak peace and safety to its fears  constantine how amiable those fears though formed by fancy their coloring is of love yet are they not turning to her whatever their gods the noblest worth of rome and in their breasts that great divinity their countrys love  fulvia let them enjoy your bounty let every honor their ambition aims at reward their worth but not to them alone your lifes exposed this everopen palace even to the meanest boldest of mankind unfolds its gates  constantine are they not all my subjects what have i done what acts of tyranny what violated laws what bold oppressions invade their rights that i should fear their presence o misery of princes when they dread whom most they ought to love you know my fulvia you know your power is sovereign over my will yet prythee do not make a coward of me  oh spare my fame nor brand it with ingratitude to them by whom that fame may be immortal  fulvia yes thou unkind these tears  i will obey you  shall flow no more my heart shall beat no more i will repress these terrors will not start even at the shrieks of murder  oh my brain see there my lord it hovers over your head a poniard streaming blood the goary drops glare through the midnight darkness earth and heaven that hand  o nature universal parent whose is that hand does mercy dwell in heaven i will gaze no more  oh hide me in thy bosom lest my brain turn and i run mad for ever  constantine aside sure this is more than fancy more than fear they are the words of fate awake look up all shall be well but these the sons of riot whose bold intemperance has alarmed you thus shall they not feel my rage  be sure ye shall  the vengeance of my love turning back as if speaking to them fulvia and can their groans when life is on the rack and stretched with pain their tortures ease my heart think you these tears i would restrain them flow for their intemperance does not this wildness this distraction tell you what my tongue cannot utter  constantine if the danger be mine alone and aim not at my love let it descend in thunders on my head let it appear in any other form than in thy griefs  there my soul sinks in weakness  and in thy fears i feel my heart a coward  fulvia and yet a little longer hear oh hear me is there not one among our christian chiefs loyal as brave the rising hope of rome the glory of the war the soldiers praise the soul of all their actions would you give them a general worthy of them or in war to lead them on to conquest or in peace with liberal spirit to reward their toils give the command of the praetorian cohorts to your aurelian and in him alone you place a guard of virtues round your person  constantine oh why those tears you do not need their aid to bid my heart obey you could you doubt i must reproach you could you doubt your power and did you doubt my love but the request is due to my aurelian and to friendship  enter maximian maximian friendship a commerce between fools and knaves of sordid flattery and weak believing had not the gracious gods in mercy saved you   to constantine fulvia saved him from what  maximian his friends from the dire schemes of deepest hell for where where else can treason that aims its dagger at the life of princes where else can it inhabit  fulvia sir of treason that aims its dagger at the life of princes  constantine why do you thus oppress her sexs weakness you fright her gentle spirit into frenzy  fulvia to constantine now let me claim your promise let aurelian command the palaceguards let him assemble all who are firm to honor and allegiance all who are true to loyalty  maximian aurelian command the palaceguards  fulvia is he not honest why do you start is he not true to honor does he not love my lord is he not loyal  maximian so i once thought marcellus he seemed honest of honor much he talked of friendship much he was aurelians friend and much of loyalty o constantine thy clemency of temper  how has it been abused now sir let justice assume a firmer spirit as for me though my own blood were tainted though the child of all my love  should she fall off from goodness in spite of natures powerful throbbings here this hand should vindicate thy wrongs and mine  constantine what strange insinuation can a father delighted view such images of horror no more my lord of this mysterious language  enter albinus or you albinus give me all the story its every circumstance its deepest guilt  albinus my lord maximian   constantine why do look at him why with that air of anger and reproach  albinus because it better had become his wisdom to thank high heaven in silence for your safety than thus to rend your heart where it must feel most sensibly the pangs of love and friendship  constantine friendship and love why are they named with traitors in my aurelians friendship for marcellus i feel for his distress but why my love they did not dare  it is impious to believe it  they did not dare to violate that temple where virtue dwells with beauty but marcellus  what had his age his wisdom with such crimes could his ambition  no some secret villain of bolder hopes  by heaven that look confirms it oh give him to my rage my vengeance give him the justice of my love  fulvia aside alas my father  constantine to fulvia why do you tremble thus why does your eye melt into tears thy husbands love is round thee his arms thy soft security albinus give me his name nor let me ask again  albinus there is my lord  why is it mine to name him  in horrid violation of all faith allegiance gratitude   fulvia to albinus albinus stop this dreadful preparation hear him not  to constantine or ere you hear resolve no act of blood shall stain this day of triumph oh let mercy add to its pious joys an holier sacrifice than could we set arabias hills on fire and wast their mingled odours up to heaven  constantine each moment that delays my just resentment is a new wrong an injury to thee  turning to albinus albinus my lord   constantine no more nor trifle with my anger  albinus then hear  o virtue honor hear it not  this traytors name  this traitor is  aurelian  constantine ye sacred powers of friendship hover over me maximian speak to my astonished spirit my fulvia tell me it is impossible or say what crimes what horrors i have committed that honor wisdom virtue sure aurelian possessed them all should arm themselves against me but shall the oaths of traitors they who owned the purposed guilt of murder shall their oaths weigh down a life of friendship tell me sir for i will know what hellinvented arts thus wrong the man i love  albinus what arts my lord i hope my honesty is unsuspected  constantine who shall be unsuspected who is honest if my aurelians false  maximian here constantine thy guardian genius cries aloud beware no farther tempt your fate inquire no more this is the utmost limit of your happiness here you may stop with honor all beyond is misery and shame constantine looks at albinus as commanding him to speak albinus sir i obey you but it is a tale so full of fear and wonder perhaps of falsehood too that i could wish no other ear might hear it  constantine to maximian good my lord leave us alone my fulvias gentle spirit will gladly quit the scene one little hour turning to the empress how sadly due to justice and to friendship and all the rest is yours is loves and yours he leads her out maximian aside it is now your cause ye gods and see it prospers  as maximian is going out he seems strongly agitated gazing earnestly after his daughter constantine observing it starting confused the stern maximian tremble while from the fiery fierceness of his eye a look of wild compassion at the empress shot forth its softness  albinus though maximians manners are of the sterner kind he has an heart  no father softer to behold his daughter in such unwonted agonies of sorrow   constantine oh she is all her sexs tenderness i have known her weep to hear a wellfeignd tale of one who fell from honor if aurelian  if he is a traitor are they not most lovely these pious sorrows of esteem and friendship  albinus friendship esteem i thought were manly virtues too firm for womans wayward wandering spirit but if the empress sir   constantine the empress sir why is she named why these licentious hints against her sex say wherefore is her name insulted with their weakness with their frailties  albinus insulted sir long may you think her virtuous long may she live untainted unsuspected  constantine untainted unsuspected think her virtuous roman take heed though i believe thee honest and love that soldiers plainness in thy manners yet dare not for thy life  by my just rage thy life shall answer for a thought that wrongs her  albinus sir i obey you gladly for i know not a greater curse to any honest heart than to think ill of others  constantine ill of whom not of my wife my fulvia is she not a noble proof where men may see and wonder at womans perfect worth still still thy looks are darkened over with some mysterious mischief you are a christian truth is your religion you are a soldier honors your profession you were my fathers friend he loved esteemed you by his great name by every sacred power if aught be sacred now allegiance honor let me conjure thee tell me thy worst meanings  albinus it was my sense of honor and allegiance that prompted me thus far were i a courtier i might have learned not thus abrupt and bold with silken language to have clothed my purpose but sir i am a soldier rough and simple and now in plain blunt honesty must tell you  yet if the distant fear can shake you thus will not the glaring certainty of shame   constantine what uninvented unimagind tortures have i to dread my heart is on the rack  albinus would i could give it ease alas my lord you saw maximian saw the agitation that shook his frame it was the fathers fondness laboring to disbelieve against conviction but such the proofs  sure they were strong indeed if he condemned if he could think her guilty and yet a moments pause there is a circumstance that throws its light  its light of hope around us did she this morning sir the empress ask you to make aurelian captain of your guards  constantine she did  albinus your wife your empress sir your fulvia  constantine what means this passiond repetition she fulvia my wife  albinus to place him near your person sure not with much entreaties  constantine yes most earnest  albinus then hells intelligence is true  constantine now tell me why did you ask  albinus what did i ask my lord in this confusion memory no longer holds its firm seat  constantine i will tell you then you asked me whether my wife with strong entreaties pressed me to make aurelian captain of my guards  albinus oh my dear lord forget it lest the idea murder your sweetest slumbers and unfix the seated throne of reason for they swore when sure the soul speaks truth in deaths last pangs when wide eternity was opening on them  they swore your wife had promised even with tears with every art and subtlety of woman to make the bold request  constantine why wherefore bold  albinus i cannot  must not tell you  sir they swore that his attendance on your sacred person might with more ease more frequent opportunity   constantine ha dare not for thy soul one added thought carries such ruin such perdition with it   albinus and yet what harm my lord their frequent meetings no doubt were pious ones to give success to our new faith and propagate its doctrines such as this morn  but that perhaps was zeal twas friendships warmth to tell of your return  constantine what of this morning where what frequent meetings  albinus here in the palace two full hours at least the empress was in private with aurelian jocund he seemed as one who gained some point of highest moment doubtless then he urged the unwary princess to this bold request and such his form such shows of manly virtue   constantine his form why that deceive her but this morning  see her in private two long hours and more leave his command leave that officious zeal with which he ever waited on our person leave them for what for a religious council for holy pious meetings  albinus dear my lord   constantine she was most just most faithful to her promise with more than womans arts with tears distraction with frenzyd terrors with the shrieks of murder with fancied visions  all ye powers of hell where could she learn where was she practiced thus  albinus in truth it is somewhat strange yet still my lord appearances most probable are often most false truth is of simpler kind and unperplexd with circumstance aurelian has every show of worth is brave and wise and though he loved the empress twas before that marriage made her yours  constantine oh well remembered yes we were rivals once and sure his passion flamed high as mine impetuous even to madness he loved to madness  for he loved like me fool that i was dull fool i thought his friendship conquered his love but oh that thought how vain my own heart proves amidst these wildest transports my reason hates my glory sickens at her yet still my souls in love with lavish tongue she dwelt upon his praise  the soldiers pride  the rising hope of rome  o blushless wanton thy tears thy terrors now want no explaining nor those strong cries for mercy  albinus most amazing is it possible these transports for a woman a false one too to see you thus afflicted oercomes thy soldiers firmness  constantine what affliction thou see it not it is in my heart my head it is in my brain through every beating pulse it drinks my vital blood through every sense it pours the gushing sorrow fast upon me  albinus had i suspected you could feel it thus were it not better have concealed her riots her loosest most luxurious   constantine villain hold is this a scene and for an husbands eye by hell thou do insult me hence begone yet stay thy natural fierceness may assist me if thou did ever know an art of cruelty or if from nature thou abhorst all mercy aid my revenge and let aurelian feel  arrest him seize him drag him to his fate that he may feel if possible the pangs that rend my heart and thou o jealousy invoked arise from thy profoundest hell to no mean scenes of horror art thou called arise and with thee bring thy kindred fiends revenge and murder i will employ them all vengeance and blood o woman woman vengeance exeunt act iv maximian albinus albinus and yet such horrors i have filled his heart with methinks even i could pity him see him start distraction in his look and wildest rage  even when he weeps for still he weeps her name his softest transports madness then he swears as with a moments interval of reason it is all a lie and with a lovers rapture talks over her form her beauties and her virtue  maximian these intervals of reason may be dangerous  albinus rather like lightnings flashing over a storm they show the danger and insure its terrors his jealousy sagacious selftormentor prevents all farther witness every look each trivial circumstance of joy or sadness that careless innocence throws off the heart are now by painful memory treasured up and brought in proof with shadows with suspicions light as a madmans dreamings  maximian but aurelian  how does he brook his prison  albinus struck with wonder he saw the imperial order to arrest him then cried  o constantine most gracious master  the hand of blood is on thee and aurelian   it was my guilt concealed the fatal secret  i am indeed thy murderer while the soldiers stood wondering round i took him at his word and called him murderer with a chosen party then dragged him to his dungeon  maximian there to lie where never sunbeam pierced the solid gloom where rattling chains and doors that grind the hinge to let in new distress make hideous concert there let my vengeance find him but albinus the emperor must not see his wife  albinus he shall not we will not trust his weakness or her power  maximian i will not trust his rage do not his passions start from his soul in tempests should he kill her   albinus my lord he dares not see her look he comes despair and grief and shame  no deeper darkness dwells on the face of night than on his heart stand and observe him here  enter constantine constantine is there no cure for ills like these no wondrous art to heal these agonies of sense to endless ages marked out a thing of vileness  oh my heart  i must not dare to name shall all my glories  they are already lost  my honors triumphs lost by a womans falsehood i who thought her the excellence of virtue as of beauty that no unhallowed thought  o woman woman tainted her breast  to me so icy chaste my loves pure kiss was cold upon her lip even then her hot imagination glowed with lewd luxurious wishes hell and devils  maximian if duty sir and friendship may approach you   constantine talking to himself her death  what can her death oh poor atonement for what i feel  a thousand deaths at once seeing maximian where is my wife my wife o memory reflection reason ye were given to heal the wounded spirit not increase its anguish but tell me how she looks her faded cheek  has it not lost that holiest blush of innocence bear with my weakness  there was once a time had virtue worn the perfect form of beauty or clothed it in an angels robe of radiance it would have looked like her is she not changed is she not altered much haste bring her hither  to albinus i will myself mark the first starts of shame the guilty colors that must taint her cheek  albinus aside oh would he stab her now and give our cause with somewhat better grace to call him tyrant exit constantine to maximian as he is going out come back my lord you shall yourself be witness though my firm nerves will tremble when i see her and my eye start with horror yet unheard she shall not be condemned  maximian has a fathers love condemned his child and were the proofs so weak to need a second trial then my lord is your heart firm its beatings all secured her eye still holds its luster beauty still grows fresh upon her cheek when she shall weep when she shall wind her sorrows round your heart when loves soft language melting from her lip charms you to hear to pity to believe her your soul may in its rage reproach upbraid her and in its rage forgive her  constantine ha forgive her the very thought is insult oh should mercy fairest of heavenly beings descend to earth such as when offering to the throne of grace the sins of humankind she weeps their pardon here she should weep in vain  maximian aside this only means  ye powers instruct assist me to preserve her your own best gift but sir her fate is mine and should she die by any other hand my great revenge were lost could a plebeian assume a nobleness his birth denied him and kill his only child his loved virginia to save the humble honors of his house and shall maximians name be stained with vileness through ages tainted with a wantons frailty and shall he trust his vengeance to another  constantine there is a savage justice in thy purpose horridly pleasing i allow your claim but will you sir be faithful to your trust search deep into the bosomed seats of pain where life resides will thou when art grows tired renew its languid rage when the keen sense grows dull with suffering will thou wake its feelings through every trembling nerve will thou do this  maximian aside my lord i will dear nature hear it not or see the pious meaning of my vow  constantine then take her to your wrath enjoy her pangs and charm me with the story if the story return my lord can charm me sure the sight will give a fierce delight a gloomy transport i will assist you sir our mutual wrongs shall animate inspire relieve each other vary her pains and draw them slowly out then both together strike one roman blow and both run mad for ever  maximian kneeling to constantine here my lord behold me kneel this knee that never bowed but to imperial jove supreme of gods and him the fireeyd power of war oh hear me  constantine no every moment that has seen her wrong me impatient waits for vengeance  enter fulvia behind fulvia ha for vengeance my father on his knee

power though boundless and almighty a deity of awefulness and fear but in the whirlwind of its wrath when flies the burning shaft if mercys saving hand arrest its flight then then we kneel and worship and mix our praise with gratitude and love  constantine to maximian did she not talk of heaven and heavenly beings  fulvia not hear not look upon me what is my crime to ask his life the author of my being is this a fault then why great parent nature why have thou poured with such abundant hand thy filial instincts through the vast of air the howling desert and the ocean stream is he not still my father though his crimes be such as constantine alone can pardon for constantine is sure the prince of mercy  constantine is it in all the stories of her sex to make this possible accuse her father add parricide to shame  maximian she has discovered by some dark means that all her guilt is known and conscious that in me she must expect a roman fathers wrath she would destroy the object of her fears then boldly hopes to win the heart of love to hear her vows to doubt believe forgive  fulvia oh sir  maximian away my soul disclaims thy father knows thee not  fulvia take take my life it is yours i here resign the unhappy gift but oh in pity spare my innocence my yet untainted name let not our holy matrons hate my memory or the light wanton dare by my example indulge her wanderings by my mothers virtue  she was her sexs chastity and honor  will she not rise in horror from her tomb fill the wild air with shrieking and demand her muchwrongd daughters fame  constantine to maximian bid them drag forth lingering in death freshbleeding from the rack then fitted for the arms the base aurelian  exit maximian oh all ye powers immortal see she starts at mention of his name spite of her art spite of the desperate spirit of her sex when first surpised in guilt the unwilling blush glows on her cheek and flashes from her heart  fulvia no more of tears no more of womans weakness in her own strength my soul shall take her flight above my sexs weakness true i started at mention of his name for then i saw first saw the dreadful train of death and treason that spreads around your life your fame your empire  constantine for me thy fears my danger for my fame swear it  oh could thou swear till i believed thee  fulvia oaths would debase the dignity of virtue else i could swear by him the power who clothed the sun with light and gave yon starry host their chaste unsullied luster by the fire which burns unceasing on that sacred altar where first  o memory  our loves were plighted   constantine if you have aught to plead but oaths and tears let me not kill thee uncondemnd unheard answer me speak unhesitating speak  how his name trembles on my tongue  aurelian  when did you see him last  fulvia this morning sir some hours ere your return  constantine why wherefore see him what for some holy some religious purpose or was it to rejoice for my return  fulvia no thou insulter no for thy return what has it brought me home but wrongs and outrage yet for aurelians sake   constantine ha for his sake  fulvia sure not for thine who dare insult me thus i condescend to tell you that he came in loyalty  in friendship to inform me of such intended horrors  that the sword which ten successive emperors had worn  our first great caesar wore it and with glory for with it honor victory and fame were girded on his thigh   constantine you do not mean the sword i gave maximian did i not  though then i marked it not yet sure i saw aurelian wear it was it not a pledge of friendship to your father did he give it  why for what purpose give it to aurelian  fulvia o dire necessity but i must tell you fierce in resentment of your late refusal and burning to resume the imperial throne unwillingly resigned  o tell me nature how to proceed  may i invoke thy name and call my father murderer shall his child open the bloody volume of the law her voice call forth the ministers of justice  constantine aside maximians plots were ever stained with blood his desperate ambition his resentment  but to accuse his daughter can her shame  for it must break my heart  not torture his  fulvia look through my life is there a witness there to vouch this guilt against me or can nature at once start forward to the extremes of vice look through the days through every tender hour since first our loves began did not my heart number with thine its beatings all its joys i shared with you its sorrows were my own are these the proofs of falsehood even in justice reflect upon aurelians early worth   constantine take heed be cautious for you tread on fires  fulvia is not his life a copy drawn from yours by friendships warmest hand you were his fame his glory his ambition even his virtue when late the sword of war with swift descent was falling on your life did not aurelian oppose his bosom to the stroke is this is this to be a traitor this his crime  constantine it is sacred reason all and heavenly truth if she be false  how innocent she looks  the sun is made of darkness and the stars are rayless as the dust if she be false then heaven that poured these thousand graces round her marrs its own loveliest work and mocks all truth oh fulvia whither has my heart been wandering from love and friendship happiness and thee but love impatient to resume his bliss embracing her rushes with wonted transports to thy arms nor will he coldly wait to ask forgiveness but in the calmer temper of my joys i will implore and kneel and weep for pardon swearing by beautys power no thought hereafter of cursed jealousy or base suspicion shall stain thy brightest image in my heart  fulvia again i melt to tears the gushing rapture unutterable else breaks forth in weeping be these embraces  oh believe them chaste ones  my worst resentments these the only marks i ever shall think my lord was once unkind  constantine thou wonder of all goodness as of beauty but now even now perhaps my best aurelian  o tyrant savage constantine  thy friend expiring lies in death albinus enter albinus haste fly bring him to my arms though shame confusion and fearful friendship dare not hope for pardon my fulvia  she shall ask forgiveness for me  albinus whom shall i bring my lord  constantine whom thou have wronged whom i have injured him to whom i owe my life my love why need i name aurelian  albinus my lord aurelians fled   constantine ha fled  albinus this morning it is thought to italy soon as he heard marcellus by your orders was arrested  fulvia it is false he is not fled why should he fly his innocence   constantine oh fulvia was he innocent whence then his flight  albinus my lord we found this paper in his apartment seeing the address we did not dare to open it  constantine to the empress why should he write to her what direful omen what presage this that on my trembling limbs hangs these cold fearful drops  reads then lets the paper drop fulvia what passion thus shakes your firm frame your eye now fixed in horror stands motionless and now its straining sense starts into wildness whence that rending sigh of vehement distress  constantine away begone there is magic in thy touch  fulvia my lord my constantine  constantine to albinus tear off her hold my senses cannot bear her the infection  now  it rises to my brain charms poisons incantations are about her the sorceries of beauty exit fulvia taking it up ha this paper  now your decrees ye fates then learn to bear them reads  it is resolved no human aid can save him  and constantine must die this night he dies throws away the paper ye powers shall this intelligence be lost angels and ye who guard the throne of princes this night be watchful over your sacred charge this night with stronger pinions hover over him let not ambition or revenge approach him now now they enter now they rush upon him ye conscious stars that view the impious scene dart all your baleful influence and blast yon lifted arm but oh the conscious stars the smiling fiends and weeping angels see it  the lord of empire dies falls into the arms of her attendants and is carried out albinus aside now by the god who thus inspires her it is a glorious vision methinks i see it too  enter maximian maximian where is the emperor retired to his apartment  albinus yes my lord  maximian retired alone what hinders then albinus but that i rush upon him and at once strike for revenge and empire how the idea glows through my blood my rage already stabs him  albinus my lord another hour   maximian another hour what to behold my daughter at my feet imploring me to save her fame her innocence thou can not judge of natures workings here thou have no child shame indignation pity  but they shall now be satisfied with vengeance  going out to constantine s apartment albinus who waits there  enter officers etc  guards arrest the prince maximian maximian arrest me villain ha thou double traitor soldiers i charge you bear me to the emperor  albinus behold the imperial signet and obey it or woe upon your lives this instant bear him to his apartment  the guards carry off maximian this the only means to save him from himself his own wild temper i now am equal master of the fate of both these princes if the imperial throne  suppose it vacant  rome has seen her emperors and of no godlike strain o fortune fortune if i durst follow where thy favor leads  down down thou swelling spirit proud ambition nor let thy wandering fires mislead my reason exit fifth act maximian and albinus albinus you see the strong necessity  maximian i do and thank thy friendly care  albinus that moments rashness  it was notless my lord  with sure destruction had blasted all our hopes but now your fortune comes smiling forward all your friends engaged to catch the alarm and spread its terrors round i have dispatched marcellus to the legions to hold them firm and promise them such presents   maximian larger than nero gave with the rich plunder of this new town its temples shrines and saints and all their worshippers but why marcellus a trust of such importance  why a christian a traitor to his country and its gods  albinus you know my lord how numerous these enthusiasts through all our troops you know his influence over them my life upon his truth or were he false he could not hurt us now the palace ours its sleeping constantine and  hark my lord it thunders are not the gods who roll these awful sounds are they not ours  maximian yes it is the voice of jove speaking his own omnipotence again that peal of glory these wellomend thunders like drums and trumpets in the day of battle shall drown the cries of death  albinus seize the glad omen there lies your way to empire and to fame go and return an emperor  maximian an emperor oh for a moment to enjoy the idea to see the roman senate once the dread the gods of earth to see the haughty flatterers as insolent as abject kneel before me then with a look to kill like caius marius to nod a senator to death or exile  aurelian then thy perfidy   albinus my lord   maximian i thank thee friend it was an idle rapture but yet transporting too now fare thee well though my hearts high in hope yet should i fail be this our last embrace   albinus my lord my sovereign   maximian of friendship and esteem this pealing thunder calls me again yes constantine i go to prove whose gods are mightier yours or mine your newly fabled race or those who raised old rome to glory ha look there albinus do my eyes dazzle and my old brain turn a stream of sulphurd fire  see where it rolls and now it is dashed by a strong wave of blood specter and hideous fiends and shapeless forms with ghastly smiles invite me to go on and now they dart their hissings through my brain  albinus your agitated fancy  it is no more perhaps some wandering phantoms of the night  maximian how little do they know maximians soul were all the crimes of humankind upon it thus would i plunge into the burning wave and breast the fiery surge to seize my vengeance  exit as to constantines apartment albinus what could it mean such strongly imagd terrors more than imagination shook his brain but all is silent yet ye rapid moments that carry doubt and fear upon your flight how slowly do ye move what noise was that maximian returns maximian is there light in the chamber  albinus no my lord he bad me leave him to his shame and darkness  exit maximian albinus why this return was it not most illomend why did i trust his old unsinewed arm i ought myself  it is not yet too late  should he awake  the double noise may wake him  by all the gods maximians voice and loud   maximian behind the scenes this for ambition this for my revenge this for my daughters wrongs  albinus o glorious sounds worthy the voice of jove  enter maximian his sword bloody maximian it is done behold the blood that ere these humbler christian doctrines drew its rich stream from jove  albinus all hail maximian master of human kind  maximian he struggled strongly for thrice he rose when this old faithful arm not yet by years nor idleness enfeebled thrice struck my victim down as in the field when younger spirits filled my glowing veins i smote the gaul who with gigantick strength defied the tents of rome  albinus an act of glory romes annals make immortal but that sword aurelian gave you in exchange for yours left in the bed beyond a thousand witnesses will prove the deed upon him then at leisure under the legal forms of public justice you may command his death  maximian i will leave it there i brought it forth to see what richer drops fed the proud heart whose insolence once awed me whose spirit towrd above me oh albinus i am almost ashamed even yet to tell you how often as if in some superior presence my soul has bowed before him and my blood run awstruck to my heart  albinus well has this night repaid his insolence but now my lord retire to rest and when the alarm begins be not too suddenly awaked then rouse you in all your wonted majesty assume the imperial purple as your proper right and join with pious zeal the public sorrows order his funeral with a pomp of honors and rank him with the gods  maximian this vile dissembling when shall my soul resume its native greatness and yet tiberius blushed even nero wept and mightiest caesar in his height of empire trembled with art before the roman talker spite of these great examples let maximian rise like the sun and hold his course of glory with majesty unclouded unobscurd then show at evening like the setting god a larger orb though with less heat it shine exit albinus this is the hour of rest but not for me not till another death secure my safety this fond old man shall for an idle tear dropped from a womans eye forget my services she must not live  why should the wretched live looking at her entering and such thou art  a very wretch indeed but thou art near the end of thy afflictions exit fulvia cornelia cornelia they were the groans of death its sharpest pangs and wafted on the hollow gloom of night broke through the affrighted air  fulvia then then cornelia the majesty of nations and their praise expiring groaned in death yet heaven could roll its idle noise and the pale lightnings flashed their harmless fires perhaps with impious light directed to the deed he died cornelia and thought his fulvia false  cornelia ah yet retire as we advance among these pathless terrors your eye grows wilder and in broken pantings your quick breath heaves should you see aught more dreadful will not imagination catch its horrors strike the weak sense and fright it into madness  fulvia no my cornelia no i will not run mad what though my brains on fire my glowing eyes just starting from their orbs and every sense confused and wild yet why should i run mad it is not to tear this hair to shriek with pain to rend these eye balls from their bleeding rings and dash them rayless to their native earth that can express my griefs why then run mad  cornelia ye pitying powers   fulvia you talked of pathless terrors is not despair my guide and see cornelia faithful it points to yonder open door there treason entered there the man of blood  and there i will enter too blood blood cornelia see the gory steps where murder stalked along now now ye powers in mercy justice anger pity strike this head devoted lest in desperate frenzy i should give way to horror and perform the ever damning deed of selfdestruction  enter albinus cornelia to albinus if you have ever known where pity dwells that drops the tender tears over others woes if you have an human heart oh sir assist me fulvia breaking away from cornelia or as you seem a demon of the night presiding over the terrors you have raised if you know aught of my loved lord oh tell me if you are privy to his death oh tell me give me his mangled corse deformed with wounds besmeared with blood and deaths own paleness on it i will over it play a scene of such wild sorrows  such frenzy such distraction as shall charm you to shed a human tear and think of pity  albinus of that i question but my present hours have other cares this night your lord your emperor began to be immortal ere he went to take his throne among his kindred gods we shall tomorrow deify his virtues he left a present for his muchloved fulvia that noble choice of death  enter a soldier with a dagger and a bowl of poison fulvia oh truly welcome thou freedom of the soul at whose great bidding the immortal spirit wings its gladsome way throws off its earth and sports without its weight in yonder fields of light there mine perhaps may meet my lord clothed with ethereal brightness how the world shrinks with all its vast ambition its little greatness at a thought like this taking the bowl now thou immortal spirit of my lord in whatsoever orb of light enthroned look down upon me your suspected fulvia this to our second nuptial day in heaven  as she is going to drink constantine enters with aurelian marcellus etc  guards seize albinus constantine is it then given me ye allgracious powers once more to gaze upon thy beautys wonders while love  for oh the rage of jealousy even madness self was love  now covered over with blushes with confusion kneels before thee he kneels fulvia restored to life can miracles do this constantine rises it is he it is he my living lord my emperor for oh my heart i feel thy wonted transports which he alone the lord of love inspires  constantine oh excellent in goodness my aurelian behold and wonder at the bright perfection  to fulvia he too forgives o generous proof of friendship the outrage to his virtue see marcellus and know my safety thence albinus thought him firm to their cause and sent him to the legions to gain their strength he thence returned at night came by the secret way to my apartment and told to my astonished ears such horrors  then begged in proof of his fidelity to lay a slave who was this morn condemned in the imperial bed maximians rage declares the rest  fulvia maximians sir maximians  constantine pointing to albinus hence with that slave and bear him to his fate albinus carried out fulvia but sir my father  speak oh look upon me oh hear these speechless sorrows hear and pity me  constantine with all the fearful tenderness of love with eyes that flow in pity with a tongue that faulters to pronounce it  can i speak it the justice of the world demands his fate as commanding him to go marcellus though i know the ungrateful office   fulvia kneeling oh for his sake the eternal power of mercy who when thy great hearts quelled by age or sickness shall hear thy weakness hear thy cries of pain give me my fathers life this day has joined my fame to his misfortunes should he perish oh will it not be said that i betrayed him and can you sir behold me can you make me a name of horrid parricide for ever to all succeeding times unnumberd ages shall curse your fulvias memory  to marcellus stay oh stay i see soft pity drop the saving tear   to marcellus a little moment more  and constantine becomes a god of mercy  constantine is there a strength in man that can resist the power of beauty when it pleads its tears go my aurelian and relieve his terrors sooth his despair his disappointed rage assure him of his life nor life alone but graced with honors worthy of our friendship my fulvia shall be mistress of his fate  exit aurelian fulvia angels of mercy hear the sacred sounds that bid my father live and thou o love in all thy golden records for it is thine preserve this act of wonder and on thy purple pinions waft it wide over earth and heaven the glory of thy reign  enter maximian and aurelian at the top of the stage maximian speaking as he comes forward well then the gods have otherwise decreed and be it so maximian shall appear i thank thee jove the trials worthy of me in his own strength superior to his fortune and caesars haughty clemency  to aurelian  lead on  fulvia my father   maximian how that name comes over my heart she kneels and weeps art thou so wondrous good can thou forgive me fulvia call me father and give me back thy love did not my rage accuse thy innocence and blast thy fame  fulvia it was ambitions rage no more remembered but even ambition shall be satisfied greatness and power for constantine has spoke it duty and love shall wait upon your age till time with lenient hand shall lay it down in honorable death till fame shall crown your life and that last hour with equal glory  maximian if life could pass away in the delight of fondly gazing on thee could the idea of that full sway which awed the western world be ever from my memory could i forget i was an emperor once dispensing fame greatness and honors round me then perhaps i might forget i lived to be forgiven and bowed me to the power that gave me life  constantine it shall not need   maximian indeed my lord it shall not maximian better shall consult his glory your father sir deposed me not by war by the fair fortune of the embattled field but by his better arts and skill in treaties arts which i boasted not but yet it joyd my gloomy soul to think i should repay them with equal vengeance thence my haughty spirit stooped to the baseness of a midnight murder you now would give me life  to crown that gift an honorable share of power and greatness now mark a generosity above thee take from this hand the unrivaled throne of power the undivided empire of the world stabs himself for my last groan gives you the universe  constantine oh fulvia  but i will not insult thy sorrows by talking comfort to them yet remember why we are placed thus high not to exempt us from human woes but that the world may learn a nobler fortitude by our example to wake the soul to virtue and impart a warmer spirit to the languid heart the passions were designed but here behold looking back to the scenes wild when they rage by reason uncontrolled less rapid is the storms destructive sway while guilt remorse
