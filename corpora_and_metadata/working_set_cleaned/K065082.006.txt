xxxiii death of honorius  valentinian iii emperor of the east  administration of his mother placidia  aetius and boniface  conquest of africa by the vandals during a long and disgraceful reign of of twentyeight years honorius emperor of the west was separated from the friendship last years and death of honorius a d     aug    of his brother and afterward of his nephew who reigned over the east and constantinople beheld with apparent indifference and secret joy the calamities of rome the strange adventures of placidia see chap xxxi gradually renewed and cemented the alliance of the two empires the daughter of the great theodosius had been the captive and the queen of the goths she lost an affectionate husband she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin she tasted the pleasure of revenge and was exchanged in the treaty of peace for six hundred thousand measures of wheat after her return from spain to italy placidia experienced a new persecution in the bosom of her family she was averse to a marriage which had been stipulated without her consent and the brave constantius as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had vanquished received from the hand of honorius himself the struggling and reluctant hand of the widow of adolphus but her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials nor did placidia refuse to become the mother of honoria and valentinian the third or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over the mind of her grateful husband the generous soldier whose time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and military service was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition he extorted the title of augustus and the servant of honorius was associated to the empire of the west the death of constantius in the seventh month of his reign instead of diminishing seemed to increase the power of placidia and the indecent familiarity  is the expression of olympiodorus apud photium p     who means perhaps to describe the same caresses which mahomet bestowed on his daughter phatemah quando says the prophet himself quando subit mihi desiderium paradisi osculor came et ingero linguam meam in os ejus but this sensual indulgence was justified by miracle and mystery and the anecdote has been communicated to the public by the reverend father maracci in his version and confutation of the koran tom i p    of her brother which might be no more than the symptoms of a childish affection were universally attributed to incestuous love on a sudden by some base intrigues of a steward and a nurse this excessive fondness was converted into an irreconcilable quarrel the debates of the emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of the palace and as the gothic soldiers adhered to their queen the city of ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary retreat of placidia and her children the royal exiles landed at constantinople soon after the marriage of theodosius during the festival of the persian victories they were treated with kindness and magnificence but as the statues of the emperor constantius had been rejected by the eastern court the title of augusta could not decently be allowed to his widow within a few months after the arrival of placidia a swift messenger announced the death of honorius the consequence of a dropsy but the important secret was not divulged till the necessary orders had been dispatched for the march of a large body of troops to the seacoast of dalmatia the shops and the gates of constantinople remained shut during seven days and the loss of a foreign prince who could neither be esteemed nor regretted was celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public grief  while the ministers of constantinople deliberated elevation and fall of the usurper john a d          the vacant throne of honorius was usurped by the ambition of a stranger the name of the rebel was john he filled the confidential office of primicerius or principal secretary and history has attributed to his character more virtues than can easily be reconciled with the violation of the most sacred duty elated by the submission of italy and the hope of an alliance with the huns john presumed to insult by an embassy the majesty of the eastern emperor but when he understood that his agents had been banished imprisoned and at length chaced away with deserved ignominy john prepared to assert by arms the injustice of his claims in such a cause the grandson of the great theodosius should have marched in person but the young emperor was easily diverted by his physicians from so rash and hazardous a design and the conduct of the italian expedition was prudently entrusted to ardaburius and his son aspar who had already signalised their valor against the persians it was resolved that ardaburius should embark with the infantry whilst aspar at the head of the cavalry conducted placidia and her son valentinian along the seacoast of the hadriatic the march of the cavalry was performed with such active diligence that they surprised without resistance the important city of aquileia when the hopes of aspar were unexpectedly confounded by the intelligence that a storm had dispersed the imperial fleet and that his father with only two galleys was taken and carried a prisoner into the port of ravenna yet this incident unfortunate as it might seem facilitated the conquest of italy ardaburius employed or abused the courteous freedom which he was permitted to enjoy to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and gratitude and as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution he invited by private messages and pressed the approach of aspar a shepherd whom the popular credulity transformed into an angel guided the eastern cavalry by a secret and it was thought an impassable road through the morasses of the po the gates of ravenna after a short struggle were thrown open and the defenseless tyrant was delivered to the mercy or rather to the cruelty of the conquerors his right hand was first cut off and after he had been exposed mounted on an ass to the public derision john was beheaded in the circus of aquileia the emperor theodosius when he received the news of the victory interrupted the horseraces and singing as he marched through the streets a suitable psalm conducted his people from the hippodrome to the church where he spent the remainder of the day in grateful devotion for these revolutions of the western empire consult olympiodor apud phot p                  00 sozomen l ix c    socrates l vii       philostorgius l xii c  0    and godefroy dissertat p     procopius de bell vandal l i c   p         theophanes in chronograph p       and the chronicles   in a monarchy which according to various precedents might be considered as elective or hereditary or patrimonial it was impossible that valentinian iii emperor of the west a d        the intricate claims of female and collateral succession should be clearly defined see grotius de jure belli et pacis l ii c   he has laboriously but vainly attempted to form a reasonable system of jurisprudence from the various and discordant modes of royal succession which have been introduced by fraud or force by time or accident  and theodosius by the right of consanguinity or conquest might have reigned the sole legitimate emperor of the romans for a moment perhaps his eyes were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway but his indolent temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy he contented himself with the possession of the east and wisely relinquished the laborious task of waging a distant and doubtful war against the barbarians beyond the alps or of securing the obedience of the italians and africans whose minds were alienated by the irreconcilable difference of language and interest instead of listening to the voice of ambition theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather and to seat his cousin valentinian on the throne of the west the royal infant was distinguished at constantinople by the title of nobilissimus he was promoted before his departure from thessalonica to the rank and dignity of caesar and after the conquest of italy the patrician helion by the authority of theodosius and in the presence of the senate saluted valentinian the third by the name of augustus and solemnly invested him with the diadem and the imperial purple the original writers are not agreed see muratori annali ditalia tom iv p     whether valentinian received the imperial diadem at rome or ravenna in this uncertainty i am willing to believe that some respect was shown to the senate  by the agreement of the three females who governed the roman world the son of placidia was betrothed to eudoxia the daughter of theodosius and athenais and as soon as the lover and his bride had attained the age of puberty this honorable alliance was faithfully accomplished at the same time as a compensation perhaps for the expenses of the war the western illyricum was detached from the italian dominions and yielded to the throne of constantinople the count de buat hist des peuples de leurope tom vii p     00 has established the reality explained the motives and traced the consequences of this remarkable cession  the emperor of the east acquired the useful dominion of the rich and maritime province of dalmatia and the dangerous sovereignty of pannonia and noricum which had been filled and ravaged above twenty years by a promiscuous crowd of huns ostrogoths vandals and bavarians theodosius and valentinian continued to respect the obligations of their public and domestic alliance but the unity of the roman government was finally dissolved by a positive declaration the validity of all future laws was limited to the dominions of their peculiar author unless he should think proper to communicate them subscribed with his own hand for the approbation of his independent colleague see the first novel of theodosius by which he ratifies and communicates a d     the theodosian code about forty years before that time the unity of legislation had been proved by an exception the jews who were numerous in the cities of apulia and calabria produced a law of the east to justify their exemption from municipal offices cod theod l xvi tit viii leg    and the western emperor was obliged to invalidate by a special edict the law quam constat meis partibus esse damnosam cod theod l xi tit i leg       valentinian when he received the title of augustus administration of his mother placidia a d        0 was no more than six years of age and his long minority was entrusted to the guardian care of a mother who might assert a female claim to the succession of the western empire placidia envied but she could not equal the reputation and virtues of the wife and sister of theodosius the elegant genius of eudocia the wise and successful policy of pulcheria the mother of valentinian was jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising cassiodorius varior l xi epist i p     has compared the regencies of placidia and amalasuntha he arraigns the weakness of the mother of valentinian and praises the virtues of his royal mistress on this occasion flattery seems to have spoken the language of truth  she reigned twentyfive years in the name of her son and the character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the suspicion that placidia had enervated his youth by a dissolute education and studiously diverted his attention from every manly and honorable pursuit amidst the decay her two generals aetius and boniface of military spirit her armies were commanded by two generals aetius philostorgius l xii c    and godefroys dissertat p     etc and renatus frigeridus apud gregor turon l ii c   in tom ii p     the father of aetius was gaudentius an illustrious citizen of the province of scythia and mastergeneral of the cavalry his mother was a rich and noble italian from his earliest youth aetius as a soldier and a hostage had conversed with the barbarians and boniface for the character of boniface see olympiodorus apud phot p     and st augustine apud tillemont memoires eccles tom xiii p              the bishop of hippo at length deplored the fall of his friend who after a solemn vow of chastity had married a second wife of the arian sect and who was suspected of keeping several concubines in his house  who may be deservedly named as the last of the romans their union might have supported a sinking empire their discord was the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of africa the invasion and defeat of attila has immortalized the fame of aetius and though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival the defense of marscelles and the deliverance of africa attest the military talents of count boniface in the field of battle in partial encounters in single combats he was still the terror of the barbarians the clergy and particularly his friend augustine were edified by the christian piety which had once tempted him to retire from the world the people applauded his spotless integrity the army dreaded his equal and inexorable justice which may be displayed in a very singular example a peasant who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife and a gothic soldier was directed to attend his tribunal the following day in the evening the count who had diligently informed himself of the time and place of the assignation mounted his horse rode ten miles into the country surprised the guilty couple punished the soldier with instant death and silenced the complaints of the husband by presenting him the next morning with the head of the adulterer the abilities of aetius and boniface might have been usefully employed against the public enemies in separate and important commands but the experience of their past conduct should have decided the real favor and confidence of the empress placidia in the melancholy season of her exile and distress boniface alone had maintained her cause with unshaken fidelity and the troops and treasures of africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion the same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of aetius who brought an army of sixty thousand huns from the danube to the confines of italy for the service of the usurper the untimely death of john compelled him to accept an advantageous treaty but he still continued the subject and the soldier of valentinian to entertain a secret perhaps a treasonable correspondence with his barbarian allies whose retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts and more liberal promises but aetius possessed an advantage of singular moment in a female reign he was present he besieged with artful and assiduous flattery the palace of ravenna disguised his dark designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship and at length deceived both his mistress and his absent rival by a subtle conspiracy which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily suspect he error and revolt of boniface in africa a d     secretly persuaded procopius de bell vandal l i c     p          relates the fraud of aetius the revolt of boniface and the loss of africa this anecdote which is supported by some collateral testimony see ruinart hist persecut vandal p   0     seems agreeable to the practice of ancient and modern courts and would be naturally revealed by the repentance of boniface placidia to recall boniface from the government of africa he secretly advised boniface to disobey the imperial summons to the one he represented the order as a sentence of death to the other he stated the refusal as a signal of revolt and when the credulous and unsuspectful count had armed the province in his defense aetius applauded his sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion which his own perfidy had excited a temperate enquiry into the real motives of boniface would have restored a faithful servant to his duty and to the republic but the arts of aetius still continued to betray and to inflame and the count was urged by persecution to embrace the most desperate counsels the success with which he eluded or repelled the first attacks could not inspire a vain confidence that at the head of some loose disorderly africans he should be able to withstand the regular forces of the west commanded by a rival whose military character it was impossible for him to despise after some hesitation the last struggles of prudence and loyalty boniface dispatched a trusty friend to the court or rather to the camp of gonderic king of the vandals with the proposal of a strict alliance and the offer of an advantageous and perpetual settlement  after the retreat of the goths the authority of he invites the vandals a d     honorius had obtained a precarious establishment in spain except only in the province of gallicia where the suevi and the vandals had fortified their camps in mutual discord and hostile independence the vandals prevailed and their adversaries were besieged in the nervasian hills between leon and oviedo till the approach of count asterius compelled or rather provoked the victorious barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the plains of boetica the rapid progress of the vandals soon required a more effectual opposition and the mastergeneral castinus marched against them with a numerous army of romans and goths vanquished in battle by an inferior enemy castinus fled with dishonor to tarragona and this memorable defeat which has been represented as the punishment was most probably the effect of his rash presumption see the chronicles of prosper and idatius salvian de gubernat dei l vii p     paris   0  ascribes the victory of the vandals to their superior piety they fasted they prayed they carried a bible in the front of the host with the design perhaps of reproaching the perfidy and sacrilege of their enemies  seville and carthagena became the reward or rather the prey of the ferocious conquerors and the vessels which they found in the harbor of carthagena might easily transport them to the isles of majorca and minorca where the spanish fugitives as in a secure recess had vainly concealed their families and their fortunes the experience of navigation and perhaps the prospect of africa encouraged the vandals to accept the invitation which they received from count boniface and the death of gonderic served only to forward and animate the bold enterprise in the room of a prince not conspicuous for any superior powers of the mind or body they acquired his bastard brother the terrible genseric gizericus his name is variously expressed statura mediocris et equi casu claudicans animo profundus sermon rarus luxuriae contemptor ira turbidus habendi cupidus ad solicitandas gentes providentissimus semina contentionum jacere odia miscere paratus jornandes de rebus geticis c    p     this portrait which is drawn with some skill and a strong likeness must have been copied from the gothic history of cassiodorius  a name genseric king of the vandals which in the destruction of the roman empire has deserved an equal rank with the names of alaric and attila the king of the vandals is described to have been of a middle stature with a lameness in one leg which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his horse his slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep purposes of his soul he disdained to imitate the luxury of the vanquished but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and revenge the ambition of genseric was without bounds and without scruples and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark engines of policy of solicit the allies who might be useful to his success or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred and contention almost in the moment of his departure he was informed that hermanric king of the suevi had presumed to ravage the spanish territories which he was resolved to abandon impatient of the insult genseric pursued the hasty retreat of the suevi as far as merida precipitated the king and his army into the river anas and calmly returned to the seashore to embark his victorious troops the vessels which transported the vandals over the modern streights he lands in africa a d     may of gibraltar a channel only twelve miles in breadth were furnished by the spaniards who anxiously wished their departure and by the african general who had implored their formidable assistance see the chronicle of idatius that bishop a spaniard and a contemporary places the passage of the vandals in the month of may of the year of abraham which commences in october      this date which coincides with a d     is confirmed by isidore another spanish bishop and is justly preferred to the opinion of those writers who have marked for that event one of the two preceding years see pagi critica tom ii p  0  etc   our fancy so long accustomed to exaggerate and reviews his army a d     and multiply the martial swarms of barbarians that seemed to issue from the north will perhaps be surprised by the account of the army which genseric mustered on the coast of mauritania the vandals who in twenty years had penetrated from the elbe to mount atlas were united under the command of their warlike king and he reigned with equal authority over the alani who had passed within the term of human life from the cold of scythia to the excessive heat of an african climate the hopes of the bold enterprise had excited many brave adventurers of the gothic nation and many desperate provincials were tempted to repair their fortunes by the same means which had occasioned their ruin yet this various multitude amounted only to fifty thousand effective men and though genseric artfully magnified his apparent strength by appointing eighty chiliarchs or commanders of thousands the fallacious increase of old men of children and of slaves would scarcely have swelled his army to the number of fourscore thousand persons compare procopius de bell vandal l i c   p   0 and victor vitensis de persecutione vandal l i c   p   edit ruinart we are assured by idatius that genseric evacuated spain cum vandalis omnibus eorumque familiis and possidius in vit augustine c    apud ruinart p     describes his army as manus ingens immanium gentium vandalorum et alanorum commixtam secum habens gothorum gentem aliarumque diversarum personas  but his own dexterity and the discontents of africa soon fortified the vandal powers by the accession of numerous and active allies the parts of mauritania which the moors border on the great desert and the atlantic ocean were filled with a fierce and untractable race of men whose savage temper had been exasperated rather than reclaimed by their dread of the roman arms the wandering moors for the manners of the moors see procopius de bell vandal l ii c   p     for their figure and complexion m de busson histoire naturelle tom iii p   0 procopius says in general that the moors had joined the vandals before the death of valentinian de bell vandal l i c   p   0 and it is probable that the independent tribes did not embrace any uniform system of policy  as they gradually ventured to approach the seashore and the camp of the vandals must have viewed with terror and astonishment the dress the armor the martial pride and discipline of the unknown strangers who had landed on their coast and the fair complexions of the blueeyed warriors of germany formed a very singular contrast with the swarthy or olive hue which is derived from the neighborhood of the torrid zone after the first difficulties had in some measure been removed which arose from the mutual ignorance of their respective language the moors regardless of any future consequence embraced the alliance of the enemies of rome and a crowd of naked savages rushed from the woods and valleys of mount atlas to satiate their revenge on the polished tyrants who had injuriously expelled them from the native sovereignty of the land  the persecution of the donatists see tillemont memoires eccles tom xiii p          and the whole series of the persecution in the original monuments published by dupin at the end of optatus p          was an the donatists event not less favorable to the designs of genseric seventeen years before he landed in africa a public conference was held at carthage by the order of the magistrate the catholics were satisfied that after the invincible reasons which they had alleged the obstinacy of the schismatics must be inexcusable and voluntary and the emperor honorius was persuaded to inflict the most rigorous penalties on a faction which had so long abused his patience and clemency three hundred bishops the donatist bishops at the conference of carthage amounted to     and they asserted that their whole number was not less than

banished to the islands and proscribed by the laws if they presumed to conceal themselves in the provinces of africa their numerous congregations both in cities and in the country were deprived of the rights of citizens and of the exercise of religious worship a regular scale of fines from ten to two hundred pounds of silver was curiously ascertained according to the distinctions of rank and fortune to punish the crime of assisting at a schismatic conventicle and if the fine had been levied five times without subduing the obstinacy of the offender his future punishment was referred to the discretion of the imperial court the fifth title of the sixteenth book of the theodosian code exhibits a series of the imperial laws against the donatists from the year  00 to the year     of these the   th law promulgated by honorius a d     is the most severe and effectual  by these severities which obtained the warmest approbation of st augustine st augustine altered his opinion with regard

another philosopher the celebrated bail tom ii p          has refused with superfluous diligence and ingenuity the arguments by which the bishop of hippo justified in his old age the persecution of the donatists  great numbers of donatists were reconciled to the catholic church but the fanatics who still persevered in their opposition were provoked to madness and despair the distracted country was filled with tumult and bloodshed the armed troops of circumcellions alternately pointed their rage against themselves or against their adversaries and the calendar of martyrs received on both sides a considerable augmentation see tillemont mem eccles tom xiii p           0  the donatists boasted of thousands of these voluntary martyrs augustine asserts and probably with truth that these numbers were much exaggerated but he sternly maintains that it was better that some should burn themselves in this world than that all should burn in hell flames  under these circumstances genseric a christian but an enemy of the orthodox communion showed himself to the donatists as a powerful deliverer from whom they might reasonably expect the repeal of the odious and oppressive edicts of the roman emperors according to st augustine and theodoret the donatists were inclined to the principles or at least to the party of the arians which genseric supported tillemont mem eccles tom vi p     the conquest of africa was facilitated by the active zeal or the secret favor of a domestic faction the wanton outrages against the churches and the clergy of which the vandals are accused may be fairly imputed to the fanaticism of their allies and the intolerant spirit which disgraced the triumph of christianity contributed to the loss of the most important province of the west see baronius

persecutions see tillemont mem eccles tom vi p     etc   the court and the people were astonished by tardy repentance of boniface a d   0 the strange intelligence that a virtuous hero after so many favors and so many services had renounced his allegiance and invited the barbarians to destroy the province entrusted to his command the friends of boniface who still believed that his criminal behavior might be excused by some honorable motive solicited during the absence of aetius a free conference with the count of africa and darius an officer of high distinction was named for the important embassy in a confidential letter to count boniface st augustine without examining the grounds of the quarrel piously exhorts him to discharge the duties of a christian and a subject to extricate himself without delay from his dangerous and guilty situation and even if he could obtain the consent of his wife to embrace a life of celibacy and penance tillemont mem eccles tom xiii p

of aetius were produced and compared and the fraud was easily detected placidia and boniface lamented their fatal error and the count had sufficient magnanimity to confide in the forgiveness of his sovereign or to expose his head to her future resentment his repentance was fervent and sincere but he soon discovered that it was no longer in his power to restore the edifice which he had shaken to its foundations carthage and the roman garrisons returned with their general to the allegiance of valentinian but the rest of africa was still distracted with war and faction and the inexorable king of the vandals disdaining all terms of accommodation sternly refused to relinquish the possession of his prey the band of veterans who marched under the standard of boniface and his hasty levies of provincial troops were defeated with considerable loss the victorious barbarians insulted the open country and carthage cirta and hippo regius were the only cities that appeared to rise above the general inundation  the long and narrow tract of the african coast desolation of africa was filled with frequent monuments of roman art and magnificence and the respective degrees of improvement might be accurately measured by the distance from carthage and the mediterranean a simple reflection will impress every thinking mind with the clearest idea of fertility and cultivation the country was extremely populous the inhabitants reserved a liberal subsistence for their own use and the annual exportation particularly of wheat was so regular and plentiful that africa deserved the name of the common granary of rome and of mankind on a sudden the seven fruitful provinces from tangier to tripoli were overwhelmed by the invasion of the vandals whose destructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular animosity religious zeal and extravagant declamation war in its fairest form implies a perpetual violation of humanity and justice and the hostilities of barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which incessantly disturbs their peaceful and domestic society the vandals where they found resistance seldom gave quarter and the deaths of their valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin of the cities under whose walls they had fallen careless of the distinctions of age or sex or rank they employed every species of indignity and torture to force from the captives a discovery of their hidden wealth the stern policy of genseric justified his frequent examples of military execution he was not always the master of his own passions or of those of his followers and the calamities of war were aggravated by the licentiousness of the moors and the fanaticism of the donatists yet i shall not easily be persuaded that it was the common practice of the vandals to extirpate the olives and other fruit trees of a country where they intended to settle nor can i believe that it was a usual stratagem to slaughter great numbers of their prisoners before the walls of a besieged city for the sole purpose of infecting the air and producing a pestilence of which they themselves must have been the first victims the original complaints of the desolation of

finally destroyed by the arabs in the seventh century but a new town at the distance of two miles was built with the materials and it contained in the sixteenth century about three hundred families of industrious but turbulent manufacturers the adjacent territory is renowned for a pure air a fertile soil and plenty of exquisite fruits  about two hundred miles westward of carthage had formerly acquired the distinguishing epithet of regius from the residence of numidian kings and some remains of trade and populousness still adhere to the modern city which is known in europe by the corrupted name of bona the military labors and anxious reflections of count boniface were alleviated by the edifying conversation of his friend st augustine the life of st augustine by tillemont fills a quarto

the impending calamities of his country the youth of augustine had been stained by the vices and errors which he so ingenuously confesses but from the moment of his conversion to that of his death the manners of the bishop of hippo were pure and austere and the most conspicuous of his virtues was an ardent zeal against heretics of every denomination the manichaeans the donatists and the pelagians against whom he waged a perpetual controversy when the city some months after his death was burnt by the vandals the library was fortunately saved which contained his voluminous writings two hundred and thirtytwo separate books or treatises on theological subjects besides a complete exposition of the psalter and the gospel and a copious magazine of epistles and homilies such at least is the account of victor vitensis de persecutvandal l i c   though gennadius seems to doubt whether any person had read or even collected all the works of st augustine see hieronym opera tom i p     in catalog scriptor eccles they have been repeatedly printed and dupin bibliotheque eccles tom iii p          has given a large and satisfactory abstract of them as they stand in the last edition of the benedictines my personal acquaintance with the bishop of hippo does not extend beyond the confessions and the city of god  according to the judgment of the most impartial critics the superficial learning of augustine was confined to the latin language in his early youth confess i    st augustine disliked and neglected the study of greek and he frankly owns that he read the platonists in a latin version confess vii   some modern critics have thought that his ignorance of greek disqualified him from expounding the scriptures and cicero or quintilian would have required the knowledge of that language in a professor of rhetoric  and his style though sometimes animated by the eloquence of passion is usually clouded by false and affected rhetoric but he possessed a strong capacious argumentative mind he boldly sounded the dark abyss of grace predestination free will and original sin and the rigid system of christianity which he framed or restored these questions were seldom agitated from the time of st paul to that of st augustine i am informed that the greek fathers maintain the natural sentiments of the semipelagians and that the orthodoxy of st augustine was derived from the manichaean school  has been entertained with public applause and secret reluctance by the latin church the church of rome has canonised augustine and reprobated calvin yet as the real difference between them is invisible even to a theological microscope the molinists are oppressed by the authority of the saint and the jansenists are disgraced by their resemblance to the heretic in the mean while the protestant armenians stand aloof and deride the mutual perplexity of the disputants see a curious review of the controversy by le clerc bibliotheque universelle tom xiv p          perhaps a reasoner still more independent may smile in his turn when he peruses an arminian commentary on the epistle to the romans   by the skill of boniface and perhaps by the ignorance of the vandals the siege of hippo death and retreat of boniface a d     was protracted above fourteen months the sea was continually open and when the adjacent country had been exhausted by irregular rapine the besiegers themselves were compelled by famine to relinquish their enterprise the importance and danger of africa were deeply felt by the regent of the west placidia implored the assistance of her eastern ally and the italian fleet and army were reinforced by aspar who failed from constantinople with a powerful armament as soon as the force of the two empires was united under the command of boniface he boldly marched against the vandals and the loss of a second battle irretrievably decided the fate of africa he embarked with the precipitation of despair and the people of hippo were permitted with their families and effects to occupy the vacant place of the soldiers the greatest part of whom were either slain or made prisoners by the vandals the count whose fatal credulity had wounded the vitals of the republic might enter the palace of ravenna with some anxiety which was soon removed by the smiles of placidia boniface accepted with gratitude the rank of patrician and the dignity of mastergeneral of the roman armies but he must have blushed at the sight of those medals in which he was represented with the name and attributes of victory ducange fam byzant p    on one

battle boniface was successful but he his death a d     received in the conflict a mortal wound from the spear of his adversary of which he expired within a few days in such christian and charitable sentiments that he exhorted his wife a rich heiress of spain to accept aetius for her second husband but aetius could not derive any immediate advantage from the generosity of his dying enemy he was proclaimed a rebel by the justice of placidia and though he attempted to defend some strong fortresses erected on his patrimonial estate the imperial power soon compelled him to retire into pannonia

something like a regular duel   it might naturally be expected after the retreat progress of the vandals in africa a d          of boniface that the vandals would atchieve without resistance or delay the conquest of africa eight years however elapsed from the evacuation of hippo to the reduction of carthage in the midst of that interval the ambitious genseric in the full tide of apparent prosperity negociated a treaty of peace by which he gave his son hunneric for an hostage and consented to leave the western emperor in the undisturbed possession of the three mauritanias see procopius

strong inland city of corta still persisted in obstinate independence possidius in vit augustine c    apud ruinart p      these difficulties were gradually subdued by the spirit the perseverance and the cruelty of genseric who alternately applied the arts of peace and war to the establishment of his african kingdom he subscribed a solemn treaty with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of its continuance and the moment of its violation the vigilance of his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendship which concealed his hostile approach and carthage was at length surprised by the vandals five hundred and eightyfive years after the destruction of the city and republic by the younger scipio see the chronicles of idatius isidore prosper and marcellinus they mark

yield to the royal prerogatives of constantinople and perhaps to the trade of alexandria or the splendour of antioch she still maintained the second rank in the west as the rome if we may use the style of contemporaries of the african world that wealthy and opulent metropolis the picture of carthage as it flourished in the fourth and fifth centuries is taken from the expositio totius mundi p

not place either a mint or an arsenal at carthage but only a gynecaeum or female manufacture displayed in a dependent condition the image of a flourishing republic carthage contained the manufactures the arms and the treasures of the six provinces a regular subordination of civil honors gradually ascended from the procurators of the streets and quarters of the city to the tribunal of the supreme magistrate who with the title of proconsul represented the state and dignity of a consul of ancient rome schools and gymnasia were instituted for the education of the african youth and the liberal arts and manners grammar rhetoric and philosophy were publicly taught in the greek and latin languages the buildings of carthage were uniform and magnificent a shady grove was planted in the midst of the capital the new port a secure and capacious harbor was subservient to the commercial industry of citizens and strangers and the splendid games of the circus and theater were exhibited almost in the presence of the barbarians the reputation of the carthaginians was not equal to that of their country and the reproach of punic faith still adhered to their subtle and faithless character the anonymous author of the expositio totius mundi compares in his barbarous latin the country and the inhabitants and after stigmatising their want of faith he coolly concludes difficile autem inter eos invenitur bonus tamen in multis pauci boni esse possunt p     the habits of trade and the abuse of luxury had corrupted their manners but their impious contempt of monks and the shameless practice of unnatural lusts are the two abominations which excite the pious vehemence of salvian the preacher of the age he declares that the peculiar vices of each country were collected in the sink of carthage

impious scorn and ridicule detestantibus ridentium cachinnis p      the king of the vandals severely reformed the vices of a voluptuous people and the ancient noble ingenuous freedom of carthage these expressions of victor are not without energy was reduced by genseric into a state of ignominious servitude after he had permitted his licentious troops to satiate their rage and avarice he instituted a more regular system of rapine and oppression an edict was promulgated which enjoined all persons without fraud or delay to deliver their gold silver jewels and valuable furniture or apparel to the royal officers and the attempt to secret any part of their patrimony was inexorably punished with death and torture as an act of treason against the state the lands of the proconsular province which formed the immediate district of carthage were accurately measured and divided among the barbarians and the conqueror reserved for his peculiar domain the fertile territory of byzacium and the adjacent parts of numidia and getulia compare procopius de bell vandal l i c   p       0 and victor vitensis de persecut vandal l i c     it was natural enough that genseric should hate african exiles and captives those whom he had injured the nobility and senators of carthage were exposed to his jealousy and resentment and all those who refused the ignominious terms which their honor and religion forbade them to accept were compelled by the arian tyrant to embrace the condition of perpetual banishment rome italy and the provinces of the east were filled with a crowd of exiles of fugitives and

from theodoret and other authors the misfortunes real and fabulous of the inhabitants of carthage  the syrian bishop deplores the misfortunes of caelestian who from the state of a noble and opulent senator of carthage was reduced with his wife and family and servants to beg his bread in a foreign country but he applauds the resignation of the christian exile and the philosophic temper which under the pressure of such calamities could enjoy more real happiness than was the ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity the story of maria the daughter of the magnificent eudaemon is singular and interesting in the sack of carthage she was purchased from the vandals by some merchants of syria who afterward sold her as a slave in their native country a female attendant transported in the same ship and sold in the same family still continued to respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the common level of servitude and the daughter of eudaemon received from her grateful affection the domestic services which she had once required from her obedience this remarkable behavior divulged the real condition of maria who in the absence of the bishop of cyrrhus was redeemed from slavery by the generosity of some soldiers of the garrison the liberality of theodoret provided for her decent maintenance and she passed ten months among the deaconesses of the church till she was unexpectedly informed that her father who had escaped from the ruin of carthage exercised an honorable office in one of the western provinces her filial impatience was seconded by the pious bishop theodoret in a letter still extant recommends maria to the bishop of aegae a maritime city of cilicia which was frequented during the annual fair by the vessels of the west most earnestly requesting that his colleague would use the maiden with a tenderness suitable to her birth and that he would entrust her to the care of such faithful merchants as would esteem it a sufficient gain if they restored a daughter lost beyond all human hope to the arms of her afflicted parent  among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical fable of the seven sleepers history i am tempted to distinguish the memorable fable of the seven sleepers the choice of fabulous circumstances is of small importance yet i have confined myself to the narrative which was translated from the syriac by the care of gregory of tours de

       place the resurrection of the seven sleepers in the years     a d     or     a d     of the era of the seleucides their greek acts which photius had read assign the date of the thirtyeighth year of the reign of theodosius which may coincide either with a d     or     the period which had elapsed since the persecution of decius is easily ascertained and nothing less than the ignorance of mahomet or the legendaries could suppose an interval of three or four hundred years  when the emperor decius persecuted the christians seven noble youths of ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side of an adjacent mountain where they were doomed to perish by the tyrant who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured with a pile of huge stones they immediately fell into a deep slumber which was miraculously prolonged without injuring the powers of life during a period of one hundred and eightyseven years at the end of that time the slaves of adolius to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice the light of the sun darted into the cavern and the seven sleepers were permitted to awake after a slumber as they thought of a few hours they were pressed by the calls of hunger and resolved that jamblichus one of their number should secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his companions the youth if we may still employ that appellation could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect of his native country and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a large cross triumphantly erected over the principal gate of ephesus his singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker to whom he offered an ancient medal of decius as the current coin of the empire and jamblichus on the suspicion of a secret treasure was dragged before the judge their mutual enquiries produced the amazing discovery that two centuries were almost elapsed since jamblichus and his friends had escaped from the rage of a pagan tyrant the bishop of ephesus the clergy the magistrates the people and as it is said the emperor theodosius himself hastened to visit the cavern of the seven sleepers who bestowed their benediction related their story and at the same instant peaceably expired the origin of this mavelous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and credulity of the modern greeks since the authentic tradition may be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle james of sarug a syrian bishop who was born only two years after the death of the younger theodosius has devoted one of his two hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of ephesus james one of the orthodox fathers of the syrian church was born a d     he

imperceptibly advance from youth to age without observing the gradual but incessant change of human affairs and even in our larger experience of history the imagination is accustomed by a perpetual series of causes and effects to unite the most distant revolutions but if the interval between two memorable aeras could be instantly annihilated if it were possible after a momentary slumber of two hundred years to display the new world to the eyes of a spectator who still retained a lively and recent impression of the old his surprise and his reflections would furnish the pleasing subject of a philosophical romance the scene could not be more advantageously placed than in the two centuries which elapsed between the reigns of decius and of theodosius the younger during this period the seat of government had been transported from rome to a new city on the banks of the thracian bosphorus and the abuse of military spirit had been suppressed by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude the throne of the persecuting decius was filled by a succession of christian and orthodox princes who had extirpated the fabulous gods of antiquity and the public devotion of the age was impatient to exalt the saints and martyrs of the catholic church on the altars of diana and hercules the union of the roman empire was dissolved its genius was humbled in the dust and armies of

three hundred and fifty pounds of gold and of disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title of general which the king of the huns condescended to accept the public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce impatience of the barbarians and the perfidious intrigues of the byzantine court four dependent nations among whom we may distinguish the bavarians disclaimed the sovereignty of the huns and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a roman alliance till the just claims and formidable power of rugilas were effectually urged by the voice of eslaw his ambassador peace was the unanimous wish of the senate their decree was ratified by the emperor and two ambassadors were named plinthas a general of scythian extraction but of consular rank and the quaestor epigenes a wise and experienced statesman who was recommended to that office by his ambitious colleague  the death of rugilas suspended the progress reign of attila a d          of the treaty his two nephews attila and bleda who succeeded to the throne of their uncle consented to a personal interview with the ambassadors of constantinople but as they proudly refused to dismount the business was transacted on horseback in a spacious plain near the city of margus in the upper maesia the kings of the huns assumed the solid benefits as well as the vain honors of the negotiation they dictated the conditions of peace and each condition was an insult on the majesty of the empire besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks of the danube they required that the annual contribution should be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds of gold that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be paid for every roman captive who had escaped from his barbarian master that the emperor should renounce all treaties and engagements with the enemies of the huns and that all the fugitives who had taken refuge in the court or provinces of theodofius should be delivered to the justice of their offended sovereign this justice was rigorously inflicted on some unfortunate youths of a royal race they were crucified on the territories of the empire by the command of attila and as soon as the king of the huns had impressed the romans with the terror of his name he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent

broad shoulders and a short square body of nervous strength though of a disproportioned form the haughty step and demeanor of the king of the huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind and he had a custom of fiercely rolling his eyes as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he inspired yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity his suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or pardon and attila was considered by his subjects as a just and indulgent master he delighted in war but after he had ascended the throne in a mature age his head rather than his hand achieved the conquest of the north and the fame of an adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent and successful general the effects of personal valor are so incosiderable except in poetry or romance that victory even among barbarians must depend on the degree of skill with which the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the service of a single man the scythian conquerors attila and zingis surpassed their rude countrymen in art rather than in courage and it may be observed that the monarchies both of the huns and of the moguls were erected by their founders on the basis of popular superstition the miraculous conception which fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin mother of zingis raised him above the level of human nature and the naked prophet who in the name of the deity invested him with the empire of the earth pointed the valor of the moguls with irresistible enthusiasm abulpharag dynast verse pocock p

skilfully adapted to the character of his age and country it was natural enough that the scythians should adore with peculiar devotion the god of war but as they were incapable of forming either an abstract idea or a corporeal representation they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron cimeter nec templum apud eos visitur aut delubrum ne tugurium quidem culmo tectum cerni

discovered among the long grass the point of an ancient sword which he dug out of the ground and presented to attila that magnanimous or rather that artful prince accepted with pious gratitude this celestial favor and as the rightful possessor of the sword of mars asserted his divine and indefeasible claim to the dominion of the earth priscus relates this remarkable story both in his own text p    and in the quotation made by jornandes c    p     he might have explained the tradition or fable which characterised this famous sword and the name as well as attributes of the scythian deity whom he has translated into the mars of the greeks and romans  if the rites of scythia were practiced on this solemn occasion a lofty altar or rather pile of faggots three hundred yards in length and in breadth was raised in a spacious plain and the sword of mars was placed erect on the summit of this rustic altar which was annually consecrated by the blood of sheep horses and of the hundredth

drew omens and presages from the manner of their falling on the pile  whether human sacrifices formed any part of the worship of attila or whether he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually offered in the field of battle the favorite of mars soon acquired a sacred character which rendered his conquests more easy and more permanent and the barbarian princes confessed in the

chastised and almost exterminated the burgundians of the rhine he subdued the islands of the ocean the kingdoms of scandinavia encompassed and divided by the waters of the baltic and the huns might derive a tribute of furs from that northern region which has been protected from all other conquerors by the severity of the climate and the courage of the natives toward the east it is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of attila over the scythian deserts yet we may be assured that he reigned on the banks of the volga that the king of the huns was dreaded not only as a warrior but as a magician see hist des huns tom ii p     the geougen believed that the huns could excite at pleasure storms of wind and rain this phenomenon was produced by the stone gezi to whose magic power the loss

trembled at his frown and at the first signal of his will they executed without murmur or hesitation his stern and absolute commands in time of peace the dependent princes with their national troops

whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of rome or of persia some of the great vassals of the king of the huns who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes had been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the emperor or rather with the general of the west they related during their residence at rome the circumstances of an expedition which they had lately made into the east after passing a desert and a morass supposed by the romans to be the lake moeotis they penetrated through the mountains and arrived at the end of fifteen days march on the confines of media where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of basic and cursic they encountered the persian army in the plains of media and the air according to their own expression was darkened by a cloud of arrows but the huns were obliged to retire before the numbers of the enemy their laborious retreat was effected by a different road they lost the greatest part of their booty and at length returned to the royal camp with some knowledge of the country and an impatient desire of revenge in the free conversation of the imperial ambassadors who discussed at the court of attila the character and designs of their formidable enemy the ministers of constantinople expressed their hope that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of sassan the more sagacious italians admonished their eastern brethren of the folly and danger of such a hope and convinced them that the medes and persians were incapable of resisting the arms of the huns and that the easy and important acquisition would exalt the pride as well as power of the conqueror instead of contenting himself with a moderate contribution and a military title which equalled him only

alliance of attila maintained the vandals in the possession of africa an enterprise had been concerted between the courts of ravenna and constantinople for the recovery of that valuable province and the ports of sicily were already filled with the military and naval forces of theodosius but the subtle genseric who spread his negociations round the world prevented their designs by exciting the king of the huns to invade the eastern empire and a trifling incident soon became the motive or pretense of a destructive war priscus p     his history contained a copious and elegant account of the war evagrius l i c    but the extracts which relate to the embassies are the only parts that have reached our times the original work was accessible however to the writers from whom we borrow our

northern side of the danube which was protected by a roman fortress surnamed constantia a troop of barbarians violated the commercial security killed or dispersed the unsuspecting traders and levelled the fortress with the ground the huns justified this outrage as an act of reprisal alleged that the bishop of margus had entered their territories to discover and steal a secret treasure of their kings and sternly demanded the guilty prelate the sacrilegious spoil and the fugitive subjects who had escaped from the justice of attila the refusal of the byzantine court was the signal of war and the maesians at first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign but they were soon intimidated by the destruction of viminiacum and the adjacent towns and the people was persuaded to adopt the convenient maxim that a private citizen however innocent or respectable may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his country the bishop of margus who did not possess the spirit of a martyr resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected he boldly treated with the princes of the huns secured by solemn oaths his pardon and reward posted a numerous detachment of barbarians in silent ambush on the banks of the danube and at the appointed hour opened with his own hand the gates of his episcopal city this advantage which had been obtained by treachery served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive victories the illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles and fortresses and though the greatest part of them consisted only of a single tower with a small garrison they were commonly sufficient to repel or to intercept the inroads of an enemy who was ignorant of the art and impatient of the delay of a regular siege but these slight obstacles were instantly swept away by the inundation of the huns procopius de edificiis l iv c   these fortresses were afterward restored strengthened and enlarged by the emperor justinian but they were soon destroyed by the abares who

constantinople of europe as it extends above five hundred miles from the euxine to the hadriatic was at once invaded and occupied and desolated by the myriads of barbarians whom attila led into the field the public danger and distress could not however provoke theodosius to interrupt his amusements and devotion or to appear in person at the head of the roman legions but the troops which had been sent against genseric were hastily recalled from sicily the garrisons on the side of persia were exhausted and a military force was collected in europe formidable by their arms and numbers if the generals had understood the science of command and their soldiers the duty of obedience the armies of the eastern empire were vanquished in three successive engagements and the progress of attila may be traced by the fields of battle the two former on the banks of the utus and under the walls of marcianapolis were fought in the extensive plains between the danube and mount haemus as the romans were pressed by a victorious enemy they gradually and unskilfully retired toward the chersonesus of thrace and that narrow peninsula the last extremity of the land was marked by their third and irreparable defeat by the destruction of this army attila acquired the indisputable possession of the field from the hellespont to thermopylae and the suburbs of constantinople he ravaged without resistance and without mercy the provinces of thrace and macedonia heraclea and hadrianople might perhaps escape this dreadful irruption of the huns but the words the most expressive of total

the scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and destructive spirit the laws of war that restrain the exercise of national rapine and murder are founded on two principles of substantial interest the knowledge of the permanent benefits which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest and a just apprehension lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemys country may be retaliated on our own but these considerations of hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of nations the huns of attila may without injustice be compared to the moguls and tartars before their primitive manners were changed by religion and luxury and the evidence of oriental history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals of rome after the moguls had subdued the northern provinces of china it was seriously proposed not in the hour of victory and passion but in calm deliberate council to exterminate all the inhabitants of that populous country that the vacant land might be converted to the pasture of cattle the firmness of a chinese mandarin he represented to the emperor of the moguls that the four provinces petcheli chantong chansi and leaotong

of discipline which may with equal reason though not with equal authority be imputed to the victorious huns the inhabitants who had submitted to their discretion were ordered to evacuate their houses and to assemble in some plain adjacent to the city where a division was made of the vanquished into three parts the first class consisted of the soldiers of the garrison and of the young men capable of bearing arms and their fate was instantly decided they were either inlisted among the moguls or they were massacred on the spot by the troops who with pointed spears and bended bows had formed a circle round the captive multitude the second class composed of the young and beautiful women of the artificers of every rank and profession and of the more wealthy or honorable citizens from whom a private ransom might be expected was distributed in equal or proportionable lots the remainder whose life or death was alike useless to the conquerors were permitted to return to the city which in the mean while had been stripped of its valuable furniture and a tax was imposed on those wretched inhabitants for the indulgence of breathing their native air such was the behavior of the moguls when they were not conscious of any extraordinary rigor particular instances would be endless but the curious reader may consult the life of gengiscan by petit de la croix the histoire des mongous and the fifteenth book of the history of the huns  but the most casual provocation the slightest motive of caprice or convenience often provoked them to involve a whole people in an indiscriminate massacre and the ruin of some flourishing cities was executed with such unrelenting perseverance that according to their own expression horses might run without stumbling over the ground where they had once

a wise legislator such an industrious colony might have contributed to diffuse through the deserts of scythia the rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts but these captives who had been taken in war were accidentally dispersed among the hords that obeyed the empire of attila the estimate of their respective value was formed by the simple judgment of unenlightened and unprejudiced barbarians

zeal of the christian missionaries without approaching the person or the palace of the monarch successfully labored in the propagation of the gospel the missionaries of st chrysostom had converted

satisfaction that the viper could no longer hiss florus iv     the perpetual intercourse of the huns and the goths had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national dialects and the barbarians were ambitious of conversing in latin the military idiom even of the eastern empire priscus p    it should seem that the huns preferred the gothic and latin languages to their own which was probably a harsh and barren idiom  but they disdained the language and the sciences of the greeks and the vain sophist or grave philosopher who had enjoyed the flattering applause of the schools was mortified to find that his robust servant was a captive of more value and importance than himself the mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed as they tended to satisfy the wants of the huns an architect in the service of onegesius one of the favorites of attila was employed to construct a bath but this work was a rare example of private luxury and the trades of the smith the carpenter the armourer were much more adapted to supply a wandering people with the useful instruments of peace and war but the merit of the physician was received with universal favor and respect the barbarians

philip de comines in his admirable picture of the last moments of lewis xi memoires l vi c    represents the insolence of his physician who in five months extorted   000 crowns and a rich bishopric

subjects of attila claimed and exercised the power of life and death over their slaves see a remarkable instance in the second book of agathias  but their manners were not susceptible of a refined system of oppression and the efforts of courage and diligence were often recompensed by the gift of freedom the historian priscus whose embassy is a source of curious instruction was accosted in the camp of attila by a stranger who saluted him in the greek language but whose dress and figure displayed the appearance of a wealthy scythian in the siege of viminiacum he had lost according to his own account his fortune and liberty he became the slave of onegesius but his faithful services against the romans and the acatzires had gradually raised him to the rank of the native huns to whom he was attached by the domestic pledges of a new wife and several children the spoils of war had restored and improved his private property he was admitted to the table of his former lord and the apostate greek blessed the hour of his captivity since it had been the introduction to an happy and independent state which he held by the honorable tenure of military service this reflection naturally produced a dispute on the advantages and defects of the roman government which was severely arraigned by the apostate and defended by priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation the freedman of onegesius exposed in true and lively colors the vices of a declining empire of which he had so long been the victim the cruel absurdity of the roman princes unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defense the intolerable weight of taxes rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings the partial administration of justice and the universal corruption which increased the influence of the rich and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor a sentiment of patriotic sympathy was at length revived in the breast of the fortunate exile and he lamented with a flood of tears the guilt or weakness of those magistrates who had perverted the wisest and most salutary institutions see the whole conversation in priscus p          the timid or selfish policy of the western treaty of peace between attila

in the west and his observation implies a censure  the loss of armies and the want of discipline or virtue were not supplied by the personal character of the monarch theodosius might still affect the style as well as the title of invincible augustus but he was reduced to solicit the clemency of attila who imperiously dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions of peace i the emperor of the east resigned by an express or tacit convention an extensive and important territory which stretched along the southern banks of the danube from singidunum or belgrade as far as novae in the diocese of thrace the breadth was defined by the vague computation of fifteen days journey but from the proposal of attila to remove the situation of the national market it soon appeared that he comprehended the ruined city of naissus within the limits of his dominions ii the king of the huns required and obtained that his tribute or subsidy should be augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum of two thousand one hundred and he stipulated the immediate payment of six thousand pounds of gold to defray the expenses or to expiate the guilt of the war one might imagine that such a demand which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire of the east and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the impoverished or at least of the disorderly state of the finances a large proportion of the taxes extorted from the people was detained and intercepted in their passage through the foulest channels to the treasury of constantinople the revenue was dissipated by theodosius and his favorites in wasteful and profuse luxury which was disguised by the names of imperial magnificence or christian charity the immediate supplies had been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military preparations a personal contribution rigorously but capriciously imposed on the members of the senatorian order was the only expedient that could disarm without loss of time the impatient avarice of attila and the poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of exposing to public auction the jewels of their wives and the hereditary ornaments of their palaces according to the description or rather invective of chrysostom an auction of byzantine luxury must have been very productive every wealthy house possessed a semicircular table of massy silver such as two men could scarcely lift a vase of solid gold of the weight of forty pounds cups dishes of the same metal etc  iii the king of the huns appears to have established as a principle of national jurisprudence that he could never lose the property which he had once acquired in the persons who had yielded either a voluntary or reluctant submission to his authority from this principle he concluded and the conclusions of attila were irrevocable laws that the huns who had been taken prisoners in war should be released without delay and without ransom that every roman captive who had presumed to escape should purchase his right to freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold and that all the barbarians who had deserted the standard of attila should be restored without any promise or stipulation of pardon in the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty the imperial officers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble deserters who refused to devote themselves to certain death and the romans forfeited all reasonable claims to the friendship of any scythian people by this public confession that they were destitute either of faith or power to protect the suppliants who had embraced the throne of theodosius the articles of the treaty expressed without much order or precision may be found in priscus p

tamely expecting their approach the azimuntines attacked in frequent and successful sallies the troops of the huns who gradually declined the dangerous neighborhood rescued from their hands the spoil and the captives and recruited their domestic force by the voluntary association of fugitives and deserters after the conclusion of the treaty attila still menaced the empire with implacable war unless the azimuntines were persuaded or compelled to comply with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted the ministers of theodosius confessed with shame and with truth that they no longer possessed any authority over a society of men who so bravely asserted their natural independence and the king of the huns condescended to negociate an equal exchange with the citizens of azimus they demanded the restitution of some shepherds who with their cattle had been accidentally surprised a strict though fruitless inquiry was allowed but the huns were obliged to swear that they did not detain any prisoners belonging to the city before they could recover two surviving countrymen whom the azimuntines had reserved as pledges for the safety of their lost companions attila on his side was satisfied and deceived by their solemn asseveration that the rest of the captives had been put to the sword and that it was their constant practice immediately to dismiss the romans and the deserters who had obtained the security of the public faith this prudent and officious dissimulation may be condemned or excused by the casuists as they incline to the rigid decree of st augustine or to the milder sentiment of st jerome and st chrysostom but every soldier every statesman must acknowledge that if the race of the azimuntines had been encouraged and multiplied the barbarians would have ceased to trample on the majesty of the empire the peevish dispute of st jerome and st augustine who labored by different expedients to reconcile the seeming quarrel of the two apostles st peter and st paul depends on the solution of an important question middletons works vol ii p     0 which has been frequently agitated by catholic and protestant divines and even by lawyers and philosophers of every age   it would have been strange indeed if theodosius embassies from attila to constantinople had purchased by the loss of honor a secure and solid tranquillity or if his tameness had not invited the repetition of injuries the byzantine court was insulted by five or six successive embassies montesquien considerations sur la grandeur etc c xix has delineated with a bold and easy pencil some of the most striking circumstances of the pride of attila and the disgrace of the romans he deserves the praise of having read the fragments of priscus which have been too much disregarded  and the ministers of attila were uniformly instructed to press the tardy or imperfect execution of the last treaty to produce the names of fugitives and deserters who were still protected by the empire and to declare with seeming moderation that unless their sovereign obtained complete and immediate satisfaction it would be impossible for him were it even his wish to check the resentment of his warlike tribes besides the motives of pride and interest which might prompt the king of the huns to continue this train of negotiation he was influenced by the less honorable view of enriching his favorites at the expense of his enemies the imperial treasury was exhausted to procure the friendly offices of the ambassadors and their principal attendants whose favorable report might conduce to the maintenance of peace the barbarian monarch was flattered by the liberal reception of his ministers he computed with pleasure the value and splendor of their gifts rigorously exacted the performance of every promise which would contribute to their private emolument and treated as an important business of state the marriage of his secretary constantius see priscus p          etc i would fain believe that this adventurer was afterward crucified by the order of attila on a suspicion of treasonable practices but priscus p    has too plainly distinguished two persons of the name of constantius who from the similar events of their lives might have been easily confounded  that gallic adventurer who was recommended by aetius to the king of the huns had engaged his service to the ministers of constantinople for the stipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife and the daughter of count saturninus was chosen to discharge the obligations of her country the reluctance of the victim some domestic troubles and the unjust confiscation of her fortune cooled the ardour of her interested lover but he still demanded in the name of attila an equivalent alliance and after many ambiguous delays and excuses the byzantine court was compelled to sacrifice to this insolent stranger the widow of armatius whose birth opulence and beauty placed her in the most illustrious rank of the roman matrons for these importunate and oppressive embassies attila claimed a suitable return he weighed with suspicious pride the character and station of the imperial envoys but he condescended to promise that he would advance as far as sardica to receive any ministers who had been invested with the consular dignity the council of theodosius eluded this proposal by representing the desolate and ruined condition of sardica and even ventured to insinuate that every officer of the army or household was qualified to treat with the most powerful princes of scythia maximin in the persian treaty concluded in the year     the wise and eloquent maximin had been the assessor of ardaburius socrates l vii c  0 when marcian ascended the throne the office of great chamberlain was bestowed on

 notwithstanding the charitable judgment of the critics i suspect that priscus was a pagan  embraced the opportunity of observing the barbarian hero in the peaceful and domestic scenes of life but the secret of the embassy a fatal and guilty secret was entrusted only to the interpreter vigilius the two last ambassadors of the huns orestes a noble subject of the pannonian province and edecon a valiant chieftain of the tribe of the scyrri returned at the same time from constantinople to the royal camp their obscure names were afterward illustrated by the extraordinary fortune and the contrast of their sons the two servants of attila became the fathers of the last roman emperor of the west and of the first barbarian king of italy  the ambassadors who were followed by a numerous the embassy of maximin to attila a d     train of men and horses made their first halt at sardica at the distance of three hundred and fifty miles or thirteen days journey from constantinople as the remains of sardica were still included within the limits of the empire it was incumbent on the romans to exercise the duties of hospitality they provided with the assistance of the provincials a sufficient number of sheep and oxen and invited the huns to a splendid or at least a plentiful supper but the harmony of the entertainment was soon disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion the greatness of the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their ministers the huns with equal ardour asserted the superiority of their victorious monarch the dispute was inflamed by the rash and unseasonable flattery of vigilius who passionately rejected the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine theodosius and it was with extreme difficulty that maximin and priscus were able to divert the conversation or to soothe the angry minds of the barbarians when they rose from table the imperial ambassador presented edecon and orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and indian pearls which they thankfully accepted yet orestes could not forbear insinuating that he had not always been treated with such respect and liberality and the offensive distinction which was implied between his civil office and the hereditary rank of his colleague seems to have made edecon a doubtful friend and orestes an irreconcilable enemy after this entertainment they traveled about one hundred miles from sardica to naissus that flourishing city which had given birth to the great constantine was levelled with the ground the inhabitants were destroyed or dispersed and the appearance of some sick persons who were still permitted to exist among the ruins of the churches served only to increase the horror of the prospect the surface of the country was covered with the bones of the slain and the ambassadors who directed their course to the northwest were obliged to pass the hills of modern servia before they descended into the flat and marshy grounds which are terminated by the danube the huns were masters of the great river their navigation was performed in large canoes hollowed out of the trunk of a single tree the ministers of theodosius were safely landed on the opposite bank and their barbarian associates immediately hastened to the camp of attila which was equally prepared for the amusements of hunting or of war no sooner had maximin advanced about two miles from the danube than he began to experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror he was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley lest he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal mansion the ministers of attila pressed him to communicate the business and the instructions which he reserved for the ear of their sovereign when maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of nations he was still more confounded to find that the resolutions of the sacred consistory those secrets says priscus which should not be revealed to the gods themselves had been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy on his refusal to comply with such ignominious terms the imperial envoy was commanded instantly to depart the order was recalled it was again repeated and the huns renewed their ineffectual attempts to subdue the patient firmness of maximin at length by the intercession of scotta the brother of onegesius whose friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift he was admitted to the royal presence but instead of obtaining a decisive answer he was compelled to undertake a remote journey toward the north that attila might enjoy the proud satisfaction of receiving in the same camp the ambassadors of the eastern and western empires his journey was regulated by the guides who obliged him to halt to hasten his march or to deviate from the common road as it best suited the convenience of the king the romans who traversed the plains of hungary suppose that they passed several navigable rivers either in canoes or portable boats but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of the teyss or tibiscus might present itself in different places under different names from the contiguous villages they received a plentiful and regular supply of provisions mead instead of wine millet in the place of bread and a certain liquor named camus which according to the report of priscus was distilled from barley the huns themselves still continued to despise the labors of agriculture they abused the privilege of a victorious nation and the goths their industrious subjects who cultivated the earth dreaded their neighborhood like that of so many ravenous wolves priscus p    in the same manner the sarts and tadgies provide for their own subsistence and for that of the usbec tartars their lazy and rapacious sovereigns see genealogical history of the tartars p         etc  such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to men who had tasted the luxury of constantinople but in their accidental distress they were relieved by the gentleness and hospitality of the same barbarians so terrible and so merciless in war the ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large morass a violent tempest of wind and rain of thunder and lightning overturned their tents immersed their baggage and furniture in the water and scattered their retinue who wandered in the darkness of the night uncertain of their road and apprehensive of some unknown danger till they awakened by their cries the inhabitants of a neighboring village the property of the widow of bleda a bright illumination and in a few moments a comfortable fire of reeds was kindled by their officious benevolence the wants and even the desires of the romans were liberally satisfied and they seem to have been embarrassed by the singular politeness of bledas widow who added to her other favors the gift or at least the loan of a sufficient number of beautiful and obsequious damsels the sunshine of the succeeding day was dedicated to repose to collect and dry the baggage and to the refreshment of the men and horses but in the evening before they pursued their journey the ambassadors expressed their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village by a very acceptable present of silver cups red fleeces dried fruits and indian pepper soon after this adventure they rejoined the march of attila from whom they had been separated about six days and slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire which did not contain in the space of several thousand miles a single city  as far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure the royal village and palace geography of priscus this capital appears to have been seated between the danube the teyss and the carpathian hills in the plains of upper hungary and most probably in the neighborhood of jazberin agria or tokay it is evident that priscus passed the danube and the teyss and that he did not reach the foot of the carpathian hills agria tokay and jazberin are situated in the plains circumscribed by this definition m de buat histoire des peuples etc tom vii p     has chosen tokay otrokosci p   0 apud mascou ix    a learned hungarian has preferred jazberin a place about thirtysix miles westward of buda and the danube  in its origin it could be no more than an accidental camp which by the long and frequent residence of attila had insensibly swelled into a huge village for the reception of his court of the troops who followed his person and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves and retainers the royal village of attila may be compared to the city of karacorum the residence of the successors of zingis which though it appears to have been a more stable habitation did not equal the size or splendour of the town and abbey of st denis in the   th century see rubruquis in the history generale des voyages tom vii p     the camp of aurengzebe as it is so agreeably described by bernier tom ii p          blended the manners of scythia with the magnificence and luxury of hindostan  the baths constructed by onegesius were the only edifice of stone the materials had been transported from pannonia and since the adjacent country was destitute even of large timber it may be presumed that the meaner habitations of the royal village consisted of straw of mud or of canvas the wooden houses of the more illustrious huns were built and adorned with rude magnificence according to the rank the fortune or the taste of the proprietors they seem to have been distributed with some degree of order and symmetry and each spot became more honorable as it approached the person of the sovereign the palace of attila which surpassed all other houses in his dominions was built entirely of wood and covered an ample space of ground the outward enclosure was a lofty wall or pallisade of smooth square timber intersected with high towers but intended rather for ornament than defense this wall which seems to have encircled the declivity of a hill comprehended a great variety of wooden edifices adapted to the uses of royalty a separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of attila and instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement imposed by asiatic jealousy they politely admitted the roman ambassadors to their presence their table and even to the freedom of an innocent embrace when maximin offered his presents to cerca the principal queen he admired the singular architecture of her mansion the height of the round columns the size and beauty of the wood which was curiously shaped or turned or polished or carved and his attentive eye was able to discover some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the proportions after passing through the guards who watched before the gate the ambassadors were introduced into the private apartment of cerca the wife of attila received their visit sitting or rather lying on a soft couch the floor was covered with a carpet the domestics formed a circle round the queen and her damsels seated on the ground were employed in working the variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the barbaric warriors the huns were ambitious of displaying those riches which were the fruit and evidence of their victories the trappings of their horses their swords and even their shoes were studded with gold and precious stones and their tables were profusely spread with plates and goblets and vases of gold and silver which had been fashioned by the labor of grecian artists the monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to the simplicity of his scythian ancestors when the moguls displayed the spoils of asia in the diet of toncat the throne of zingis was still covered with the original black felt carpet on which he had been seated when he was raised to the command of his warlike countrymen see vie de gengiscan l iv c    the dress of attila his arms and the furniture of his horse were plain without ornament and of a single color the royal table was served in wooden cups and platters flesh was his only food and the conqueror of the north never tasted the luxury of bread  when attila first gave audience to the roman ambassadors on the banks of the danube his tent the behavior of attila to the roman ambassadors was encompassed with a formidable guard the monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair his stern countenance angry gestures and impatient tone astonished the firmness of maximin but vigilius had more reason to tremble since he distinctly understood the menace that if attila did not respect the law of nations he would nail the deceitful interpreter to a cross and leave his body to the vultures the barbarian condescended by producing an accurate list to expose the bold falsehood of vigilius who had affirmed that no more than seventeen deserters could be found but he arrogantly declared that he apprehended only the disgrace of contending with his fugitive slaves since he despised their impotent efforts to defend the provinces which theodofius had entrusted to their arms for what fortress added attila what city in the wide extent of the roman empire can hope to exist secure and impregnable if it is our pleasure that it should be erazed from the earth he dismissed however the interpreter who returned to constantinople with his peremptory demand of more complete restitution and a more splendid embassy his anger gradually subsided and his domestic satisfaction in a marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of eslam might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fierceness of his temper the entrance of attila into the royal village was marked by a very singular ceremony a numerous troop of women came out to meet their hero and their king they marched before him distributed into long and regular files the intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin linen which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins who chanted hymns and songs in the scythian language the wife of his favorite onegesius with a train of female attendants saluted attila at the door of her own house on his way to the palace and offered according to the custom of the country her respectful homage by entreating him to taste the wine and meat which she had prepared for his reception as soon as the monarch had graciously accepted her hospitable gift his domestics lifted a small silver table to a convenient height as he sat on horseback and attila when he had touched the goblet with his lips again saluted the wife of onegesius and continued his march during his residence at the seat of empire his hours were not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio and the king of the huns could maintain his superior dignity without concealing his person from the public view he frequently assembled his council and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations and his people might appeal to the supreme tribunal which he held at stated times and according to the eastern custom before the principal gate of his wooden palace the romans both of the east and of the west were twice invited to the banquets where attila feasted with the princes and nobles of scythia maximin the royal feast and his colleagues were stopped on the threshold till they had made a devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the huns and were conducted after this ceremony to their respective seats in a spacious hall the royal table and couch covered with carpets and fine linen was raised by several steps in the midst of the hall and a son an uncle or perhaps a favorite king were admitted to share the simple and homely repast of attila two lines of small tables each of which contained three or four guests were ranged in order on either hand the right was esteemed the most honorable but the romans ingenuously confess that they were placed on the left and that beric an unknown chieftain most probably of the gothic race preceded the representatives of theodosius and valentinian the barbarian monarch received from his cup bearer a goblet filled with wine and courteously drank to the health of the most distinguished guest who rose from his seat and expressed in the same manner his loyal and respectful vows this ceremony was successively performed for all or at least for the illustrious persons of the assembly and a considerable time must have been consumed since it was thrice repeated as each course of service was placed on the table but the wine still remained after the meat had been removed and the huns continued to indulge their intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet yet before they retired they enjoyed a singular opportunity of observing the manners of the nation in their convivial amusements two scythians stood before the couch of attila and recited the verses which they had composed to celebrate his valor and his victories a profound silence prevailed in the hall and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal harmony which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own exploits a martial ardour flashed from the eyes of the warriors who were impatient for battle and the tears of the old men expressed their generous despair that they could no longer partake the danger and glory of the field if we may believe plutarch in demetrio tom v p    it was the custom of the scythians when they indulged in the pleasures of the table to awaken their languid courage by the martial harmony of twanging their bowstrings  this entertainment which might be considered as a school of military virtue was succeeded by a farce that debased the dignity of human nature a moorish and a scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of the rude spectators by their deformed figure ridiculous dress antic gestures absurd speeches and the strange unintelligible confusion of the latin the gothic and the hunnic languages and the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals of laughter in the midst of this intemperate riot attila alone without a change of countenance maintained his steadfast and inflexible gravity which was never relaxed except on the entrance of irnac the youngest of his sons he embraced the boy with a smile of paternal tenderness gently pinched him by the cheek and betrayed a partial affection which was justified by the assurance of his prophets that irnac would be the future support of his family and empire two days afterward the ambassadors received a second invitation and they had reason to praise the politeness as well as the hospitality of attila the king of the huns held a long and familiar conversation with maximin but his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty reproaches and he was provoked by a motive of interest to support with unbecoming zeal the private claims of his secretary constantius the emperor said attila has long promised him a rich wife constantius must not be disappointed nor should a roman emperor deserve the name of liar on the third day the ambassadors were dismissed the freedom of several captives was granted for a moderate ransom to their pressing entreaties and besides the royal presents they were permitted to accept from each of the scythian nobles the honorable and useful gift of a horse maximin returned by the same road to constantinople and though he was involved in an accidental dispute with beric the new ambassador of attila he flattered himself that he had contributed by the laborious journey to confirm the peace and alliance of the two nations the curious narrative of this embassy which required few observations and was not susceptible of any collateral evidence may be found in priscus p      0 but i have not confined myself to the same order and i had previously extracted the historical circumstances which were less intimately connected with the journey and business of the roman ambassadors   but the roman ambassador was ignorant of the conspiracy of the romans against the life of attila treacherous design which had been concealed under the mask of the public faith the surprise and satisfaction of edecon when he contemplated the splendor of constantinople had encouraged the interpreter vigilius to procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch chrysaphius m de tillemont has very properly given the succession of chamberlains who reigned in the name of theodosius chrysaphius was the last and according to the unanimous evidence of history the worst of these favorites see hist des empereurs tom vi p          mem eccles tom xv p     his partiality for his godfather the heresiarch eutyches engaged him to persecute the orthodox party  who governed the emperor and the empire after some previous conversation and a mutual oath of secrecy the eunuch who had not from his own feelings or experience imbibed any exalted notions of ministerial virtue ventured to propose the death of attila as an important service by which edecon might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury which he admired the ambassador of the huns listened to the tempting offer and professed with apparent zeal his ability as well as readiness to execute the bloody deed the design was communicated to the master of the offices and the devout theodosius consented to the assassination of his invincible enemy but this perfidious conspiracy was defeated by the dissimulation or the repentance of edecon and though he might exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason which he seemed to approve he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and voluntary confession if we now review the embassy of maximin and the behavior of attila we must applaud the barbarian who respected the laws of hospitality and generously entertained and dismissed the minister of a prince who had conspired against his life but the rashness of vigilius will appear still more extraordinary since he returned conscious of his guilt and danger to the royal camp accompanied by his son and carrying with him a weighty purse of gold which the favorite eunuch had furnished to satisfy the demands of edecon and to corrupt the fidelity of the guards the interpreter was instantly seized and dragged before the tribunal of attila where he asserted his innocence with specious firmness till the threat of inflicting instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere discovery of the criminal transaction under the name of ransom or confiscation the rapacious king of the huns accepted two hundred pounds of gold for the life of a traitor whom he disdained to punish he pointed his just indignation against a nobler object his ambassadors eslaw and orestes were he reprimands and forgives the emperor immediately dispatched to constantinople with a peremptory instruction which it was much safer for them to execute than to disobey they boldly entered the imperial presence with the fatal purse hanging down from the neck of orestes who interrogated the eunuch chrysaphius as he stood beside the throne whether he recognized the evidence of his guilt but the office of reproof was reserved for the superior dignity of his colleague eslaw who gravely addressed the emperor of the east in the following words theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent attila likewise is descended from a noble race and he has supported by his actions the dignity which he inherited from his father mundzuk but theodosius has forfeited his paternal honors and by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself to the condition of a slave it is therefore just that he should reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him instead of attempting like a wicked slave clandestinely to conspire against his master the son of arcadius who was accustomed only to the voice of flattery heard with astonishment the severe language of truth he blushed and trembled nor did he presume directly to refuse the head of chrysaphius which eslaw and orestes were instructed to demand a solemn embassy armed with full powers and magnificent gifts was hastily sent to deprecate the wrath of attila and his pride was gratified by the choice of nomius and anatolius two ministers of consular or patrician rank of whom the one was great treasurer and the other was mastergeneral of the armies of the east he condescended to meet these ambassadors on the banks of the river drenco and though he at first affected a stern and haughty demeanor his anger was insensibly mollified by their eloquence and liberality he condescended to pardon the emperor the eunuch and the interpreter bound himself by an oath to observe the conditions of peace released a great number of captives abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate and resigned a large territory to the south of the danube which he had already exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants but this treaty was purchased at an expense which might have supported a vigorous and successful war and the subjects of theodosius were compelled to redeem the safety of a worthless favorite by oppressive taxes which they would more cheerfully have paid for his destruction this secret conspiracy and its important consequences may be traced in the fragments of priscus p              0       the chronology of that historian is not fixed by any precise date but the series of negociations between attila and the eastern empire must be included within the three or four years which are terminated a d   0 by the death of theodosius   the emperor theodosius did not long survive the most humiliating circumstance of an inglorious life as he was riding or hunting in the theodosius the younger dies a d   0 july

the fortythird of his reign theodorus the reader see vales hist eccles tom iii p     and the paschal chronicle mention the fall without specifying the injury but the consequence was so likely to happen and so unlikely to be invented that we may safely give credit to nicephorus callistus a greek of the fourteenth century  his sister pulcheria whose authority had been controuled both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the eunuchs was unanimously proclaimed empress of the east and the romans for the first time submitted to a female reign no sooner had pulcheria ascended the throne than she indulged her own and the public resentment by an act of popular justice without any legal trial the eunuch chrysaphius was executed before the gates of the city and the immense riches which had been accumulated by the rapacious favorite served only to hasten and to justify his punishment pulcheriae nutu says count marcellinus sua cum avaritia interemptus est she abandoned the eunuch to the pious revenge of a son whose father had suffered at his instigation  amidst the general acclamations of the clergy and people the empress did not forget the prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed and she wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a colleague who would always respect the superior rank and virgin chastity of his wife she gave her hand to marcian a senator about and is succeeded by marcian aug    sixty years of age and the nominal husband of pulcheria was solemnly invested with the imperial purple the zeal which he displayed for the orthodox creed as it was established by the council of chalcedon would alone have inspired the grateful eloquence of the catholics but the behavior of marcian in a private life and afterward on the throne may support a more rational belief that he was qualified to restore and invigorate an empire which had been almost dissolved by the successive weakness of two hereditary monarchs he was born in thrace and educated to the profession of arms but marcians youth had been severely exercised by poverty and misfortune since his only resource when he first arrived at constantinople consisted in two hundred pieces of gold which he had borrowed of a friend he passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of aspar and his son ardaburius followed those powerful generals to the persian and african wars and obtained by their influence the honorable rank of tribune and senator his mild disposition and useful talents without alarming the jealousy

honorable peace but it was attila threatens both empires and prepares to invade gaul a d   0 likewise his opinion that peace cannot be honorable or secure if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to war this temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of attila who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute the emperor signified to the barbarians that they must no longer insult the majesty of rome by the mention of a tribute that he was disposed to reward with becoming liberality the faithful friendship of his allies but that if they presumed to violate the public peace they should feel that he possessed troops and arms and resolution to repel their attacks the same language even in the camp of the huns was used by his ambassador apollonius whose bold refusal to deliver the presents till he had been admitted to a personal interview displayed a sense of dignity and a contempt of danger which attila was not prepared to expect from the degenerate romans see priscus p        he threatened to chastise the rash successor of theodosius but he hesitated whether he should first direct his invincible arms against the eastern or the western empire while mankind awaited his decision with awful suspense he sent an equal defiance to the courts of ravenna and constantinople and his ministers saluted the two emperors with the same haughty declaration attila my lord and thy lord commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception the alexandrian or paschal chronicle which introduces this haughty message during the lifetime of theodosius may have anticipated the date but the dull annalist was incapable of inventing the original and genuine style of attila  but as the barbarian despised or affected to despise the romans of the east whom he had so often vanquished he soon declared his resolution of suspending the easy conquest till he had achieved a more glorious and important enterprise in the memorable invasions of gaul and italy the huns were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces but the particular motives and provocations of attila can only be explained by the state of the western empire under the reign of valentinian or to speak more correctly under the administration of aetius the second book of the histoire critique de letablissement de la monarchy francoise tom i p          throws great light on the state of gaul when it was invaded by attila but the ingenious author the abbe dubos too often bewilders himself in system and conjecture   after the death of his rival

have been ascribed to clemency was the effect of weakness or fear she delivered herself her son valentinian and the western empire into the hands of an insolent subject nor could placidia protect the

are faintly marked in the chronicles of marcellinus and idatius in his distress he was always followed by a numerous train since he could ravage the hellespont and propontis and seize the city of barcelona  from the implacable persecution which urged him from one kingdom to another till he miserably perished in the service of the vandals the fortunate aetius who was immediately promoted to the rank of patrician and thrice invested with the honors of the confulship assumed with the title of master of the cavalry and infantry the whole military power of the state and he is sometimes styled by contemporary writers the duke or general of the romans of the west his prudence rather than his virtue engaged him to leave the grandson of theodosius in the possession of the purple and valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of italy while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and a patriot who supported near twenty years the ruins of the western empire the gothic historian ingenuously confesses that aetius was born for the salvation of the roman republic reipublicae romanae singulariter natus qui superbiam suevorum francorumque barbariem immensis coedibus servire imperio romano coegisset jornandes de rebus geticis c    p   0  and the following portrait though it is drawn in the fairest colors must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than of flattery his mother was a wealthy and noble italian and his father gaudentius who held a distinguished rank in the province of scythia gradually rose from the station of a military domestic to the dignity of master of the cavalry their son who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards was given as a hostage first to alaric and afterward to the huns and he successively obtained the civil and military honors of the palace for which he was equally qualified by superior merit the graceful figure of aetius was not above the middle stature but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength beauty and agility and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing a horse drawing the bow and darting the javelin he could patiently endure the want of food or of sleep and his mind and body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts he possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers but injuries and it was impossible either to corrupt or deceive or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul this portrait is drawn by renatus profuturus frigeridus a contemporary historian known only by some extracts which are preserved by gregory of tours l ii c   in tom ii p     it was probably the duty or at least the interest of renatus to magnify the virtues of aetius but he would have shown more dexterity if he had not insisted on his patient forgiving disposition  the barbarians who had seated themselves in the western provinces were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the patrician aetius he soothed their passions consulted their prejudices balanced their interests and checked their ambition a seasonable treaty which he concluded with genseric protected italy from the depredations of the vandals the independent britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid the imperial authority was restored and maintained in gaul and spain and he compelled the franks and the suevi whom he had vanquished in the field to become the useful confederates of the republic  from a principle of interest as well as gratitude his connection with the huns and alani aetius assiduously cultivated the alliance of the huns while he resided in their tents as a hostage or an exile he had familiarly conversed with attila himself the nephew of his benefactor and the two famous antagonists appear to have been connected by a personal and military friendship which they afterward confirmed by mutual gifts frequent embassies and the education of carpilio the son of aetius in the camp of attila by the specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment the patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the scythian conqueror who pressed the two empires with his innumerable armies his demands were obeyed or eluded when he claimed the spoils of a vanquished city some vases of gold which had been fraudulently embezzled the civil and military governors of noricum were immediately dispatched to satisfy his complaints the embassy consisted of count romulus of promotus president of noricum and of romanus the military duke they were accompanied by tatullus an illustrious citizen of petovio in the same province and father of orestes who had married the daughter of count romulus see priscus p       cassiodorius variar i   mentions another embassy which was executed by his father and carpilio the son of aetius and as attila was no more he could safely boast of their manly intrepid behavior in his presence  and it is evident from their conversation with maximin and priscus in the royal village that the valor and prudence of aetius had not saved the western romans from the common ignominy of tribute yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of a salutary peace and a numerous army of huns and alani whom he had attached to his person was employed in the defense of gaul two colonies of these barbarians were judiciously fixed in the territories of valens and orleans deserta valentinae urbis rura alanis

the reign of theodoric a d          the southern provinces of gaul had gradually acquired strength and maturity and the conduct of those ambitious barbarians either in peace or war engaged the perpetual vigilance of aetius after the death of wallia the gothic scepter devolved to theodoric the son of the great alaric theodoric ii the son of theodoric i declares to avitus his resolution of repairing or expiating the fault which his grandfather had committed  quae noster peccavit avus quem fuscat id unum quod te roma capit  sidon panegyric avit  0   this character applicable only to the great alaric establishes the genealogy of the gothic kings which has hitherto been unnoticed    and his prosperous reign of more than thirty years over a turbulent people may be allowed to prove that his prudence was supported by uncommon vigor both of mind and body impatient of his narrow limits theodoric aspired to the possession of arles the wealthy seat of government and commerce but the city was saved by the timely approach of aetius and the gothic king who had raised the siege with some loss and disgrace was persuaded for an adequate subsidy to divert the martial valor of his subjects in a spanish war yet theodoric still watched and eagerly seized the favorable moment of renewing his hostile attempts the goths a d          besieged narbonne while the belgic provinces were invaded by the burgundians and the public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union of the enemies of rome on every side the activity of aetius and his scythian cavalry opposed a firm and successful resistance twenty thousand burgundians were slain in battle and the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the mountains of savoy the name of sapaudia the origin of savoy is first mentioned by ammianus marcellinus and two military posts are ascertained by the notitia within the limits of that province a cohort was stationed at grenoble in dauphine and ebredunum or iverdun sheltered a fleet of small vessels which commanded the lake of neufchatel see valesius notit galliarum p  0  danville notice de lancienne gaul p          the walls of narbonne had been shaken by the battering engines and the inhabitants had endured the last extremities of famine when count litorius approaching in silence and directing each horseman to carry behind him two sacks of flour cut his way through the intrenchments of the besiegers the siege was immediately raised and the more decisive victory which is ascribed to the personal conduct of aetius himself was marked with the blood of eight thousand goths but in the absence of the patrician who was hastily summoned to italy by some public or private interest count litorius succeeded to the command and his presumption soon discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing of cavalry or to direct the operations of an important war at the head of an army of huns he rashly advanced to the gates of thoulouse full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his misfortunes had rendered prudent and his situation made desperate the predictions of the augurs had inspired litorius with the profane confidence that he should enter the gothic capital in triumph and the trust which he reposed in his pagan allies encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of theodoric the king of the goths exhibited in his distress the edifying contrast of christian piety and moderation nor did he lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for the combat his soldiers animated with martial and religious enthusiasm assaulted the camp of litorius the conflict was obstinate the slaughter was mutual the roman general after a total defeat which could be imputed only to his unskilful rashness was actually led through the streets of thoulouse not in his own but in a hostile triumph and the misery which he experienced in a long and ignominious captivity excited the compassion of the barbarians themselves salvian has attempted to explain the moral government of the deity a task which may be readily performed by supposing that the calamities of the wicked are judgments and those of the righteous trials  such a loss in a country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted could not easily be repaired and the goths assuming in their turn the sentiments of ambition and revenge would have planted their victorious standards on the banks of the rhone if the presence of aetius had not restored strength and discipline to the romans  capto terrarum damna patebant litorio in rhodanum proprios producere fines theudoridae fixum nec erat pugnare necesse sed migrare getis rabidam trux asperat iram victor quod sensit

the whole merit from aetius to his minister avitus    the two armies expected the signal of a decisive action but the generals who were conscious of each others force and doubtful of their own superiority prudently sheathed their swords in the field of battle and their reconciliation was permanent and sincere theodoric king of the visigoths appears to have deserved the love of his subjects the confidence of his allies and the esteem of mankind his throne was surrounded by six valiant sons who were educated with equal care in the exercises of the barbarian camp and in those of the gallic schools from the study of the roman jurisprudence they acquired the theory at least of law and justice and the harmonious sense of virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their native manners theodoric ii revered in the person of avitus the character of his preceptor   mihi romula dudum per te jura placent parvumque ediscere jussit ad tua verba pater docili quo prisca maronis carmine molliret scythicos mihi pagina mores sidon panegyr avit     etc    the two daughters of the gothic king were given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the suevi and of the vandals who reigned in spain and africa but these illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord the queen of the suevi bewailed the death of an husband inhumanly massacred by her brother the princess of the vandals was the victim of a jealous tyrant whom she called her father the cruel genseric suspected that his sons wife had conspired to poison him the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her nose and ears and the unhappy daughter of theodoric was ignominiously returned to the court of thoulouse in that deformed and mutilated condition this horrid act which must seem incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator but theodoric was urged by the feelings of a parent and a king to revenge such irreparable injuries the imperial ministers who always cherished the discord of the barbarians would have supplied the goths with arms and ships and treasures for the african war and the cruelty of genseric might have been fatal to himself if the artful vandal had not armed in his cause the formidable power of the huns his rich gifts and pressing solicitations inflamed the ambition of attila and the designs of aetius and theodoric were prevented by

submitted to the new lovers who were imposed on them by the chance of war this advantage which had been obtained by the skill and activity of aetius might reflect some disgrace on the military

the father of childeric  was persuaded to implore the protection of rome he was received at the imperial court as the ally of valentinian and the adopted son of the patrician aetius and dismissed to his native country with splendid gifts and the strongest assurances of friendship and support during his absence his elder brother had solicited with equal ardour the formidable aid of attila and the king of the huns embraced an alliance which facilitated the passage of the rhine and justified by a specious and honorable pretense the invasion of gaul under the merovingian race the throne was hereditary but all the sons of the deceased monarch were equally entitled to their share of his treasures and territories see the dissertations of m de foncemagne in the sixth and eighth volumes of the memoires de lacademie   when attila declared his resolution of supporting the adventures of the princess honoria the cause of his allies the vandals and the franks at the same time and almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry the savage monarch professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess honoria the sister of valentinian was educated in the palace of ravenna and as her marriage might be productive of some danger to the state she was raised by the title of augusta a medal is still extant which exhibits the pleasing countenance of honoria with the title of augusta and on the reverse the improper legend of salus reipublicae round the monagram of christ see ducange famil byzantin p        above the hopes of the most presumptuous subject but the fair honoria had no sooner attained the sixteenth year of her age than she detested the importunate greatness which must for ever exclude her from the comforts of honorable love in the midst of vain and unsatisfactory pomp honoria sighed yielded to the impulse of nature and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain eugenius her guilt and shame such is the absurd language of imperious man were soon betrayed by the apperances of pregnancy but the disgrace of the royal family was published to the world by the imprudence of the empress placidia who dismissed her daughter after a strict and shameful confinement to a remote exile at constantinople the unhappy princess passed twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of theodosius and their chosen virgins to whose crown honoria could no longer aspire and whose monastic assiduity of prayer fasting and vigils she reluctantly imitated her impatience of long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and desperate resolution the name of attila was familiar and formidable at constantinople and his frequent embassies entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the imperial palace in the pursuit of love or rather of revenge the daughter of placidia sacrificed every duty and every prejudice and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a barbarian of whose language she was ignorant whose figure was scarcely human and whose religion and manners she abhorred by the ministry of a faithful eunuch she transmitted to attila a ring the pledge of her affection and earnestly conjured him to claim her as a lawful spouse to whom he had been secretly betrothed these indecent advances were received however with coldness and disdain and the king of the huns continued to multiply the number of his wives till his love was awakened by the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice the invasion of gaul was preceded and justified by a formal demand of the princess honoria with a just and equal share of the imperial patrimony his predecessors the ancient tanjous had often addressed in the same hostile and peremptory manner the daughters of china and the pretensions of attila were not less offensive to the majesty of rome a firm but temperate refusal was communicated to his ambassadors the right of female succession though it might derive a specious argument from the recent examples of placidia and pulcheria was strenuously denied and the indissoluble engagements of honoria were opposed to the claims of her scythian lover see priscus p     0 it might be fairly alleged that if females could succeed to the throne valentinian himself who had married the daughter and heiress of the younger theodosius would have asserted her right to the eastern empire  on the discovery of her connection with the king of the huns the guilty princess had been sent away as an object of horror from constantinople to italy her life was spared but the ceremony of her marriage was performed with some obscure and nominal husband before she was immured in a perpetual prison to bewail those crimes and misfortunes which honoria might have escaped had she not been born the daughter of an emperor the adventures of honoria are imperfectly related by jornandes de successione regn c    and de reb get c    p     and in the chronicles of prosper and marcellinus but they cannot be made consistent or probable unless we separate by an interval of time and place her intrigue with eugenius and her invitation of attila   a native of gaul and a contemporary the attila invades gaul and besieges orleans learned and eloquent sidonius who was afterward bishop of clermont had made a promise to one of his friends that he would compose a regular history of the war of attila if the modesty a d     of

plains of hungary his standard moved toward the west and after a march of seven or eight hundred miles he reached the conflux of the rhine and the necker where he was joined by the franks who adhered to his ally the elder of the sons of clodion a troop of light barbarians who roamed in quest of plunder might choose the winter for the convenience of passing the river on the ice but the innumerable cavalry of the huns required such plenty of forage and provisions as could be procured only in a milder season the hercynian forest supplied materials for a bridge of boats and the hostile myriads were poured with resistless violence into the belgic provinces the most authentic and circumstantial account of this war is contained in jornandes de reb geticis c        p          who has sometimes abridged and sometimes transcribed the larger history of cassiodorius jornandes a quotation which it would be superfluous to repeat may be corrected and illustrated by gregory of tours l   c       and

from the chronicle of idatius among the fragments of fredegarius tom ii p     which often contradicts the genuine text of the gallician bishop  the consternation of gaul was universal and the various fortunes of its cities have been adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles the ancient legendaries deserve some regard as they are obliged to connect their fables with the real history of

among which he enumerates metz  their customary maxims of war they involved in a promiscuous massacre the priests who served at the altar and the infants who in the hour of danger had been providently baptized by the bishop the flourishing city was delivered to the flames and a solitary chapel of st stephen marked the place where it formerly stood from the rhine and the moselle attila advanced into the heart of gaul crossed the seine at auxerre and after a long and laborious march fixed his camp under the walls of orleans he was desirous of securing his conquests by the possession of an advantageous post which commanded the passage of the loire and he depended on the secret invitation of sangiban king of the alani who had promised to betray the city and to revolt from the service of the empire but this treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed orleans had been strengthened with recent fortifications and the assaults of the huns were vigorously repelled by the faithful valor of the soldiers or citizens who defended the place the pastoral diligence of anianus a bishop of primitive sanctity and consummate prudence exhausted every art of religious policy to support their courage till the arrival of the expected succors after an obstinate siege the walls were shaken by the battering rams the huns had already occupied the suburbs and the people who were incapable of bearing arms lay prostrate in prayer anianus who anxiously counted the days and hours dispatched a trusty messenger to observe from the rampart the face of the distant country he returned twice without any intelligence that could inspire hope or comfort but in his third report he mentioned a small cloud which he had faintly descried at the extremity of the horizon it is the aid of god exclaimed the bishop in a tone of pious confidence and the whole multitude repeated after him it is the aid of god the remote object on which every eye was fixed became each moment larger and more distinct the roman and gothic banners were gradually perceived and a favorable wind blowing aside the dust discovered in deep array the impatient squadrons of aetius and theodoric who pressed forwards to the relief of orleans  the facility with which attila had penetrated alliance of the romans and visigoths into the heart of gaul may be ascribed to his insidious policy as well as to the terror of his arms his public declarations were skilfully mitigated by his private assurances he alternately soothed and threatened the romans and the goths and the courts of ravenna and thoulouse mutually suspicious of each others intentions beheld with supine indifference the approach of their common enemy aetius was the sole guardian of the public safety but his wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction which since the death of placidia infested the imperial palace the youth of italy trembled at the sound of the trumpet and the barbarians who from fear or affection were inclined to the cause of attila awaited with doubtful and venal faith the event of the war the patrician passed the alps at the head of some troops whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army  vix liquerat alps aetius tenue et rarum sine milite ducens robur in auxiliis geticum male credulus agmen incassum propriis praesumens adfore castris panegyr avit     etc    but on his arrival at arles or lions he was confounded by the intelligence that the visigoths refusing to embrace the defense of gaul had determined to expect within their own territories the formidable invader whom they professed to despise the senator avitus who after the honorable exercise of the praetorian praefecture had retired to his estate in auvergne was persuaded to accept the important embassy which he executed with ability and success he represented to theodoric that an ambitious conqueror who aspired to the dominion of the earth could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance of the powers whom he labored to oppress the lively eloquence of avitus inflamed the gothic warriors by the description of the injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the huns whose implacable fury still pursued them from the danube to the foot of the pyrenees he strenuously urged that it was the duty of every christian to save from sacrilegious violation the churches of god and the relics of the saints that it was the interest of every barbarian who had acquired a settlement in gaul to defend the fields and vineyards which were cultivated for his use against the desolation of the scythian shepherds theodoric yielded to the evidence of truth adopted the measure at once the most prudent and the most honorable and declared that as the faithful ally of aetius and the romans he was ready to expose his life and kingdom for the common safety of gaul the policy of attila of aetius and of the visigoths is imperfectly described in the panegyric of avitus and the thirtysixth chapter of jornandes the poet and the historian were both biassed by personal or national prejudices the former exalts the merit and importance of avitus orbis avite salus etc the latter is anxious to show the goths in the most favorable light yet their agreement when they are fairly interpreted is a proof of their veracity  the visigoths who at that time were in the mature vigor of their fame and power obeyed with alacrity the signal of war prepared their arms and horses and assembled under the standard of their aged king who was resolved with his two eldest sons torismond and theodoric to command in person his numerous and valiant people the example of the goths determined several tribes or nations that seemed to fluctuate between the huns and the romans the indefatigable diligence of the patrician

of independent allies the laeti the armoricans the breones the saxons the burgundians the sarmatians or alani the ripuarians and the franks who followed meroveus as their lawful prince such was the various army which under the conduct of aetius and theodoric advanced by rapid marches to relieve orleans and to give battle to the innumerable host of attila the review of the army of aetius is made by jornandes c    p     edit grot tom ii p    of the historians of france with the notes of the benedictine editor the laeti were a promiscuous race of barbarians born or naturalized in gaul and the riparii or ripuarii derived their name from their posts on the three rivers the rhine the meuse and the moselle the armoricans possessed the independent cities between the seine and the loire a colony of saxons had been planted in the diocese of bayeux the burgundians were settled in savoy and the breones were a warlike tribe of rhaetians to the east of the lake of constance   on their approach the king of the huns immediately attila retires to the plains of champagne raised the siege and sounded a retreat to recall the foremost of his troops from the pillage of a city which they had already entered aurelianensis urbis obsidio oppugnatio irruptio nec direptio l v sidon apollin l viii epist    p     the preservation of orleans might be easily turned into a miracle obtained and foretold by the holy bishop  the valor of attila was always guided by his prudence and as he foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of gaul he repassed the seine and expected the enemy in the plains of chalons whose smooth and level surface was adapted to the operations of his scythian cavalry but in this tumultuary retreat the vanguard of the romans and their allies continually pressed and sometimes engaged the troops whom attila had posted in the rear the hostile columns in the darkness of the night and the perplexity of the roads might encounter each other without design and the bloody conflict of the franks and gepidae in which fifteen thousand the common editions read xcm but there is some authority of manuscripts and almost any authority is sufficient for the more

vague measurement of jornandes to the length of one hundred and fifty and the breadth of one hundred miles over the whole province which is entitled to the appellation of a champaign country the name of campania or champagne is frequently mentioned by gregory of tours and that great province of which rheims was the capital obeyed the command of a duke vales notit p   0       this spacious plain was distinguished however by some inequalities of ground and the importance of an height which commanded the camp of attila was understood and disputed by the two generals the young and valiant torismond first occupied the summit the goths rushed with irresistible weight on the huns who labored to ascend from the opposite side and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory the anxiety of attila prompted him to consult his priests and haruspices it was reported that after scrutinizing the entrails of victims and scraping their bones they revealed in mysterious language his own defeat with the death of his principal adversary and that the barbarian by accepting the equivalent expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior merit of aetius but the unusual despondency which seemed to prevail among the huns engaged attila to use the expedient so familiar to the generals of antiquity of animating his troops by a military oration and his language was that of a king who had often fought and conquered at their head i am sensible that these military orations are usually composed by the historian yet the old ostrogoths who had served under attila might repeat his discourse to cassiodorius the ideas and even the expressions have an original scythian cast and i doubt whether an italian of the sixth century would have thought of the hujus certaminis gaudia  he pressed them to consider their past glory their actual danger and their future hopes the same fortune which opened the deserts and morasses of scythia to their unarmed valor which had laid so many warlike nations prostrate at their feet had reserved the joys of this memorable field for the consummation of their victories the cautious steps of their enemies their strict alliance and their advantageous posts he artfully represented as the effects not of prudence but of fear the visigoths alone were the strength and nerves of the opposite army and the huns might securely trample on the degenerate romans whose close and compact order betrayed their apprehensions and who were equally incapable of supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle the doctrine of predestination so favorable to martial virtue was carefully inculcated by the king of the huns who assured his subjects that the warriors protected by heaven were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy but that the unerring fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious peace i myself continued attila will throw the first javelin and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his sovereign is devoted to inevitable death the spirit of the barbarians was rekindled by the presence the voice and the example of their intrepid leader and attila yielding to their impatience immediately formed his order of battle at the head of his brave and faithful huns he occupied in person the center of the line the nations subject to his empire the rugians the heruli the thuringians the franks the burgundians were extended on either hand over the ample space of the catalaunian fields the right wing was commanded by ardaric king of the gepidae and the three valiant brothers who reigned over the ostrogoths were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes of the visigoths the disposition of the allies was regulated by a different principle sangiban the faithless king of the alani was placed in the center where his motions might be strictly watched and his treachery might be instantly punished aetius assumed the command of the left and theodoric of the right wing while torismond still continued to occupy the heights which appear to have stretched on the flank and perhaps the rear of the scythian army the nations from the volga to the atlantic were assembled on the plain of chalons but many of these nations had been divided by faction or conquest or emigration and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns which threatened each other presented the image of a civil war  the discipline and tactics of the greeks and romans form an interesting part of their national battle of chalons manners the attentive study of the military operations of xenophon or caesar or frederic when they are described by the same genius which conceived and executed them may tend to improve if such improvement can be wished the art of destroying the human species but the battle of chalons can only excite our curiosity by the magnitude of the object since it was decided by the blind impetuosity of barbarians and has been related by partial writers whose civil or ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of military affairs cassiodorius however had familiarly conversed with many gothic warriors who served in that memorable engagement a conflict as they informed him fierce various obstinate and bloody such as could not be paralleled either in the present or in past ages the number of the slain amounted to one hundred and sixtytwo thousand or according to another account three hundred thousand persons the expressions of jornandes or rather of cassiodorius are extremely strong bellum atrox multiplex

critique tom i p         attempts to reconcile the    000 of jornandes with the  00000 of idatius and isidore by supposing that the larger number included the total destruction of the war the effects of disease the slaughter of the unarmed people etc  and these incredible exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss sufficient to justify the historians remark that whole generations may be swept away by the madness of kings in the space of a single hour after the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons in which the archers of scythia might signalize their superior dexterity the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were furiously mingled in closer combat the huns who fought under the eyes of their king pierced through the feeble and doubtful center of the allies separated their wings from each other and wheeling with a rapid effort to the left directed their whole force against the visigoths as theodoric rode along the ranks to animate his troops he received a mortal stroke from the javelin of andages a noble ostrogoth and immediately fell from his horse the wounded king was oppressed in the general disorder and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry and this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of the haruspices attila already exulted in the confidence of victory when the valiant torismond descended from the hills and verified the remainder of the prediction the visigoths who had been thrown into confusion by the flight or defection of the alani gradually restored their order of battle and the huns were undoubtedly vanquished since attila was compelled to retreat he had exposed his person with the rashness of a private soldier but the intrepid troops of the center had pushed forwards beyond the rest of the line their attack was faintly supported their flanks were unguarded and the conquerors of scythia and germany were saved by the approach of the night from a total defeat they retired within the circle of wagons that fortified their camp and the dismounted squadrons prepared themselves for a defense to which neither their arms nor their temper were adapted the event was doubtful but attila had secured a last and honorable resource the saddles and rich furniture of the cavalry were collected by his order into a funeral pile and the magnanimous barbarian had resolved if his intrenchments should be forced to rush headlong into the flames and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have acquired by the death or captivity of attila the count de buat hist des peuples etc tom vii p          still depending on the false and again rejecting the true idatius has divided the defeat of attila into two great battles the former near orleans the latter in champagne in the one theodoric was slain in the other he was revenged   but his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and anxiety the inconsiderate courage of torismond was tempted to urge the pursuit retreat of attila till he unexpectedly found himself with a few followers in the midst of the scythian wagons in the confusion of a nocturnal combat he was thrown from his horse and the gothic prince must have perished like his father if his youthful strength and the intrepid zeal of his companions had not rescued him from this dangerous situation in the same manner but on the left of the line aetius himself separated from his allies ignorant of their victory and anxious for their fate encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered over the plains of chalons and at length reached the camp of the goths which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of shields till the dawn of day the imperial general was soon satisfied of the defeat of attila who still remained inactive within his intrenchments and when he contemplated the bloody scene he observed with secret satisfaction that the loss had principally fallen on the barbarians the body of theodoric pierced with honorable wounds was discovered under a heap of the slain his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations and his funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy the goths clashing their arms elevated on a buckler his eldest son torismond to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their success and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge as a sacred portion of his paternal inheritance yet the goths themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of their formidable antagonist and their historian has compared attila to a lion encompassed in his den and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury the kings and nations who might have deserted his standard in the hour of distress were made sensible that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and inevitable danger all his instruments of martial music incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance and the foremost troops who advanced to the assault were checked or destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the intrenchments it was determined in a general council of war to besiege the king of the huns in his camp to intercept his provisions and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful treaty or an unequal combat but the impatience of the barbarians soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures and the mature policy of aetius was apprehensive that after the extirpation of the huns the republic would be oppressed by the pride and power of the gothic nation the patrician exerted the superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions which the son of theodoric considered as a duty represented with seeming affection and real truth the dangers of absence and delay and persuaded torismond to disappoint by his speedy return the ambitious designs of his brothers who might occupy the throne and treasures of thoulouse jornandes de rebus geticis c    p     the policy of aetius and the behavior of torismond are extremely natural and the patrician according to gregory of tours l ii c   p     dismissed the prince of the franks by suggesting to him a similar apprehension the false idatius ridiculously pretends that aetius paid a clandestine nocturnal visit to the kings of the huns and of the visigoths from each of whom he obtained a bribe of ten thousand pieces of gold as the price of an undisturbed retreat  after the departure of the goths and the separation of the allied army attila was surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of chalons the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him several days within the circle of his wagons and his retreat beyond the rhine confessed the last victory which was attchieved in the name of the western empire meroveus and his franks observing a prudent distance and magnifying the opinion of their strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night continued to follow the rear of the huns till they reached the confines of thuringia the thuringians served in the army of attila they traversed both in their march and in their return the territories of the franks and it was perhaps in this war that they exercised the cruelties which about fourscore years afterward were revenged by the son of clovis they massacred their hostages as well as their captives two hundred young maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage their bodies were torn asunder by wild horses or their bones were crushed under the weight of rolling wagons and their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads as a prey to dogs and vultures such were those savage ancestors whose imaginary virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilized ages these cruelties which are passionately deplored by theodoric the son of clovis gregory of tours l iii c  0 p   0 suit the time and circumstances of the invasion of artila his residence in thuringia was long attested by popular tradition

italy and besieged aquileia with an innumerable host of barbarians those barbarians were unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege which even among the ancients required some knowledge or at least some practice of the mechanic arts but the labor of many thousand provincials and captives whose lives were sacrificed without pity might execute the most painful and dangerous work the skill of the roman artists might be corrupted to the destruction of their country the walls of aquileia were assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams moveable turrets and engines that threw stones darts and fire machinis constructis omnibusque tormentorum generibus adhibitis jornandes c    p     in the thirteenth century the moguls battered the cities of china with large engines constructed by the mahometans or christians in their service which threw stones from   0 to  00 pounds weight in the defense of their country the chinese used gunpowder and even bombs above an hundred years before they were known in europe yet even those celestial or infernal arms were insufficient to protect a pusillanimous nation see gaubil hist des mongous p  0            etc  and the monarch of the huns employed the forcible impulse of hope fear emulation and interest to subvert the only barrier which delayed the conquest of italy aquileia was at that period one of the richest the most populous and the strongest of the maritime cities of the hadriatic coast the gothic auxiliaries who appear to have served under their native princes alaric and antala communicated their intrepid spirit and the citizens still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which their ancestors had opposed to a fierce inexorable barbarian who disgraced the majesty of the roman purple three months were consumed without effect in the siege of aquileia till the want of provisions and the clamours of his army compelled attila to relinquish the enterprise and reluctantly to issue his orders that the troops should strike their tents the next morning and begin their retreat but as he rode round the walls pensive angry and disappointed he observed a stork preparing to leave her nest in one of the towers and to fly with her infant family toward the country he seized with the ready penetration of a statesman this trifling incident which chance had offered to superstition and exclaimed in a loud and cheerful tone that such a domestic bird so constantly attached to human society would never have abandoned her ancient seats unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and solitude the same story is told by jornandes and by procopius de bell vandal l i c   p         nor is it easy to decide which is the original but the greek historian is guilty of an inexcuseable mistake in placing the siege of aquileia after the death of aetius  the favorable omen inspired an assurance of victory the siege was renewed and prosecuted with fresh vigor a large breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had taken her flight the huns mounted to the assault with irresistible fury and the succeeding generation could scarcely discover the ruins of aquileia jornandes about an hundred years afterward affirms that aquileia was so completely ruined ita ut vix ejus vestigia ut appareant reliquerint see jornandes de reb geticis c    p     paul diacon l ii c    p     liutprand

milan and pavia submitted without resistance to the loss of their wealth and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from the flames the public as well as private buildings and spared the lives of the captive multitude the popular traditions of comum turin or modena may justly be suspected yet they concur with more authentic evidence to prove that attila spread his ravages over the rich plains of modern lombardy which are divided by the po and bounded by the alps and apennine in describing this war of attila a war so famous but so imperfectly known i have taken for my guides two learned italians who considered the subject with some peculiar advantages sigonius de imperio occidentali l xiii in his works tom i p       0  and muratori aunali ditalia tom iv p           vo edition  when he took possession of the royal palace of milan he was surprised and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the caesars seated on their throne and the princes of scythia prostrate at their feet the revenge which attila inflicted on this monument of roman vanity was harmless and ingenious he commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes and the emperors were delineated on the same canvass approaching in a suppliant posture to empty their bags of tributary gold before the throne of the scythian monarch this article may be found under two different articles

fable of the dispute between the lion and the man leo respondit humana hoc pictum manu videres hominem dejectum si pingere leones scirent appendix ad phaedrum fab xxv the lion in phaedrus very foolishly appeals from pictures to the amphitheatre and i am glad to observe that the native taste of la fontaine l iii fable x has omitted this most lame and impotent conclusion     it is a saying

rhaetian and julian alps before the irruption of the barbarians fifty venetian cities flourished in peace and prosperity aquileia was placed in the most conspicuous station but the ancient dignity of padua was supported by agriculture and manufactures and the property of five hundred citizens who were entitled to the equestrian rank must have amounted at the strictest computation to one million seven hundred thousand pounds many families of aquileia padua and the adjacent towns who fled from the sword of the huns found a safe though obscure refuge in the neighboring islands this emigration is not attested by any contemporary evidence but the fact is proved by the event and the circumstances might be preserved by tradition the citizens of aquileia retired to the isle of gradus those of padua to rivus altus or rialto where the city of venice was afterward built etc  at the extremity of the gulf where the hadriatic feebly imitates the tides of the ocean near an hundred small islands are separated by shallow water from the continent and protected from the waves by several long slips of land which admit the entrance of vessels through some secret and narrow channels the topography

these remote and sequestered spots remained without cultivation with few inhabitants and almost without a name but the manners of the venetian fugitives their arts and their government were gradually formed by their new situation and one of the epistles of cassiodorius cassiodor variar l xii epist    maffei verona illustrata part i p   0      has translated and explained this curious letter in the spirit of a learned antiquarian and a faithful subject who considered venice as the only legitimate offspring of the roman republic he fixes the date of the epistle and consequently the praefecture of cassiodorius a d     and the marquiss authority has the more weight as he had prepared an edition of his works and actually published a dissertation on the true orthography of his name see osservazioni letteraire tom ii p   0       which describes their condition about seventy years afterward may be considered as the primitive monument of the republic the minister of theodoric compares them in his quaint declamatory style to waterfowl who had fixed their nests on the bosom of the waves and though he allows that the venetian provinces had formerly contained many noble families he insinuates that they were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble poverty fish was the common and almost the universal food of every rank their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt which they extracted from the sea and the exchange of that commodity so essential to human life was substituted in the neighboring markets to the currency of gold and silver a people whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or water soon became alike familiar with the two elements and the demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity the islanders who from grado to chiozza were intimately connected with each other penetrated into the heart of italy by the secure though laborious navigation of the rivers and inland canals their vessels which were continually increasing in size and number visited all the harbors of the gulf and the marriage which venice annually celebrates with the hadriatic was contracted in her early infancy the epistle of cassiodorius the praetorian prefect is addressed to the maritime tribunes and he exhorts them in a mild tone of authority to animate the zeal of their countrymen for the public service which required their assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the province of istria to the royal city of ravenna the ambiguous office of these magistrates is explained by the tradition that in the twelve principal islands twelve tribunes or judges were created by an annual and popular election the existence of the venetian republic under the gothic kingdom of italy is attested by the same authentic record which annihilates their lofty claim of original and perpetual independence see in the second volume of amelot de la houssaie histoire du gouvernement de venise a translation of the famous squittinio this book which has been exalted far above its merits is stained in every line with the disingenuous malevolence of party but the principal evidence genuine and apocryphal is brought together and the reader will easily choose the fair medium   the italians who had long since renounced attila gives peace to the romans the exercise of arms were surprised after forty years peace by the approach of a formidable barbarian whom they abhorred as the enemy of their religion as well as of their republic amidst the general consternation aetius alone was incapable of fear but it was impossible that he should atchieve alone and unassisted any military exploits worthy of his former renown the barbarians who had defended gaul refused to march to the relief of italy and the succors promised by the eastern emperor were distant and doubtful since aetius at the head of his domestic troops still maintained the field and harassed or retarded the march of attila he never showed himself more truly great than at the time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful people sirmond not ad sidon apollin p    has published a curious passage from the chronicle of prosper attila redintegratis viribus quas in gallia amiserat italiam ingredi per pannonias intendit nihil duce nostro aetio secundum prioris belli opera prospiciente etc he reproaches aetius with neglecting to guard the alps and with a design to abandon italy but this rash censure may at least be counterbalanced by the favorable testimonies of idatius and isidore  if the mind of valentinian had been susceptible of any generous sentiments he would have chosen such a general for his example and his guide but the timid grandson of theodosius instead of sharing the dangers escaped from the sound of war and his hasty retreat from ravenna to rome from an impregnable fortress to an open capital betrayed his secret intention of abandoning italy as soon as the danger should approach his imperial person this shameful abdication was suspended however by the spirit of doubt and delay which commonly adheres to pusillanimous counsels and sometimes corrects their pernicious tendency the western emperor with the senate and people of rome embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating by a solemn and suppliant embassy the wrath of attila this important commission was accepted by avienus who from his birth and riches his consular dignity the numerous train of his clients and his personal abilities held the first rank in the roman senate the specious and artful character of avienus see the original portraits of avienus and his rival basilius delineated and contrasted in the epistles i   p    of sidonius he had studied the characters of the two chiefs of the senate but he

themselves too freely in the use of bread of wine and of meat prepared and seasoned by the arts of cookery and the progress of disease revenged in some measure the injuries of the italians si statim

vini mitigatos etc this passage of florus iii   is still more applicable to the huns than to the cimbri and it may serve as a commentary on the celestial plague with which idatius and isidore have afflicted the troops of attila  when attila declared his resolution of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of rome he was admonished by his friends as well as by his enemies that alaric had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city his mind superior to real danger was assaulted by imaginary terrors nor could he escape the influence of superstition which had so often been subservient to his designs the historian priscus had positively mentioned the effect which this example produced on the mind of attila jornandes c    p      the pressing eloquence of leo his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes excited the veneration of attila for the spiritual father of the christians the apparition of the two apostles st peter and st paul who menaced the barbarian with instant death if he rejected the prayer of their successor is one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition the safety of rome might deserve the interposition of celestial beings and some indulgence is due to a

unseemly wounds and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved not with the tears of women but with the blood of warriors the remains of attila were enclosed within three coffins of gold of silver

grateful spectacle to the people of constantinople attila had fondly or superstitiously believed that irnac the youngest of his sons was destined to perpetuate the glories of his race the character of that prince who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother dengisich was more suitable to the declining condition of the huns and irnac with his subject hords retired into the heart of the

apparent security to undermine the foundations of his own throne by the murder of the patrician aetius from the instinct of a base and jealous mind he hated the man who was universally celebrated as

hopes of his son gaudentius who was already contracted to eudoxia the emperors daughter had raised him above the rank of a subject the ambitious designs of which he was secretly accused excited the fears as well as the resentment of valentinian aetius himself supported by the consciousness of his merit his services and perhaps his innocence seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet behavior the patrician offended his sovereign by an hostile declaration he aggravated the offense by compelling him to ratify with a solemn oath a treaty of reconciliation and alliance he proclaimed his suspicions he neglected his safety and from a vain confidence that the enemy whom he despised was incapable even of a manly crime he rashly ventured his person in the palace of rome whilst he urged perhaps with intemperate vehemence the marriage of his son valentinian drawing his sword the first sword he had ever drawn plunged it in the breast of a general who had saved his empire his courtiers and eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master and aetius pierced with an hundred wounds fell dead in the royal presence boethius the praetorian prefect was killed at the same moment and before the event could be divulged the principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace and separately murdered the horrid deed palliated by the specious names of justice and necessity was immediately communicated by the emperor to his soldiers his subjects and his allies the nations who were strangers or enemies to aetius generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero the barbarians who had been attached to his service dissembled their grief and resentment and the public contempt which had been so long entertained for valentinian was at once converted into deep and universal abhorrence such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of a palace yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a roman whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit i am ignorant

avit     the poet knew the world and was not inclined to flatter a minister who had injured or disgraced avitus and majorian the successive heroes of his song   the luxury of rome seems to have attracted the long and frequent visits of valentinian who was consequently more despised at rome than in and ravishes the wife of maximus any other part of his dominions a republican spirit was insensibly revived in the senate as their authority and even their supplies became necessary for the support of his feeble government the stately demeanor of an hereditary monarch offended their pride and the pleasures of valentinian were injurious to the peace and honor of noble families the birth of the empress eudoxia was equal to his own and her charms and tender affection deserved those testimonies of love which her inconstant husband dissipated in vague and unlawful amors petronius maximus a wealthy senator of the anician family who had been twice consul was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife her obstinate resistance served only to irritate the desires of valentinian and he resolved to accomplish them either by stratagem or force deep gaming was one of the vices of the court the emperor who by chance or contrivance had gained from maximus a considerable sum uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife with an order in her husbands name that she should immediately attend the empress eudoxia the unsuspecting wife of maximus was conveyed in her litter to the imperial palace the emissaries of her impatient lover conducted her to a remote and silent bedchamber and valentinian violated without remorse the laws of hospitality her tears when she returned home her deep affliction and her bitter reproaches against her husband whom she considered as the accomplice of his own shame excited maximus to a just revenge the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition and he might reasonably aspire by the free suffrage of the roman senate to the throne of a detested and despicable rival valentinian who supposed that every human breast was devoid like his own of friendship and gratitude had imprudently admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of aetius two of these of barbarian race were persuaded to execute a sacred and honorable duty by punishing with death the assassin of their patron and their intrepid courage did not long expect a favorable moment whilst valentinian amused himself in the field of mars with the spectacle of some military sports they suddenly rushed upon him

empire but its fall was announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures the roman government appeared every day less formidable to its enemies more odious and oppressive to its subjects the

published after the loss of africa a d     and before attilas war a d      the taxes were multiplied with the public distress economy was neglected in proportion as it became necessary and the injustice of the rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people whom they defrauded of the indulgencies that might sometimes have alleviated their misery the severe inquisition which confiscated their goods and tortured their persons compelled the subjects of valentinian to prefer the more simple tyranny of the barbarians to fly to the woods and mountains or to embrace the vile and abject condition of mercenary servants they abjured and abhorred the name of roman citizens which had formerly excited the ambition of mankind the armorican provinces of gaul and the greatest part of spain were thrown into a state of disorderly independence by the confederations of the bagaudae and the imperial ministers pursued with proscriptive laws and ineffectual arms the rebels whom they had made the bagaudae of spain who fought pitched battles with the roman troops are repeatedly mentioned in the chronicle of idatius salvian has described their distress and rebellion in very forcible

was irretrievably naval power of the vandals a d          destroyed by the separation of africa the rapacious vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates of the senators and intercepted the regular subsidies which relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the plebeians the distress of the romans was soon aggravated by an unexpected attack and the province so long cultivated for their use by industrious and obedient subjects was armed against them by an ambitious barbarian the vandals and alani who followed the successful standard of genseric had acquired a rich and fertile territory which stretched along the coast above ninety days journey from tangier to tripoli but their narrow limits were pressed and confined on either side by the sandy desert and the mediterranean the discovery and conquest of the black nations that might dwell beneath the torrid zone could not tempt the rational ambition of genseric but he cast his eyes toward the sea he resolved to create a naval power and his bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance the woods of mount atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of timber his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation and shipbuilding he animated his daring vandals to embrace a mode of warfare which would render every maritime country accessible to their arms the moors and africans were allured by the hopes of plunder and after an interval of six centuries the fleets that issued from the port of carthage again claimed the empire of the mediterranean the success of the vandals the conquest of sicily the sack of palermo and the frequent descents on the coast of lucania awakened and alarmed the mother of valentinian and the sister of theodosius alliances were formed and armaments expensive and ineffectual were prepared for the destruction of the common enemy who reserved his courage to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude the designs of the roman government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays ambiguous promises and apparent concessions and the interposition of his formidable confederate the king of the huns recalled the emperors from the conquest of africa to the care of their domestic safety the revolutions of the palace which left the western empire without a defender and without a lawful prince dispelled the apprehensions and stimulated the avarice of genseric he immediately equipped a numerous fleet of vandals and moors and cast anchor at the mouth of the tyber about three months after the death of valentinian and the elevation of maximus to the imperial throne  the private life of the senator petronius maximus sidonius apollinaris composed the thirteenth epistle of the second book to refute the paradox of his friend serranus who entertained a singular though generous enthusiasm for the deceased emperor this epistle with some indulgence may claim the praise of an elegant composition and it throws much light on the character of maximus  the character and reign of the emperor maximus a d     march    was often alleged as a rare example of human felicity his birth was noble and illustrious since he descended from the anician family his dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal arts and decent manners which adorn or imitate the inestimable gifts of genius and virtue the luxury of his palace and table was hospitable and elegant whenever maximus appeared in public he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients clientum praevia pedisequa circumfusa populositas is the train which sidonius himself l i epist   assigns to another senator of consular rank  and it is possible that among these clients he might deserve and possess some real friends his merit was rewarded by the favor of the prince and senate he thrice exercised the office of praetorian prefect of italy he was twice invested with the consulship and he obtained the rank of patrician these civil honors were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and tranquillity his hours according to the demands of pleasure or reason were accurately distributed by a waterclock and this avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which maximus entertained of his own happiness the injury which he received from the emperor valentinian appears to excuse the most bloody revenge yet a philosopher might have reflected that if the resistance of his wife had been sincere her chastity was still inviolate and that it could never be restored if she had consented to the will of the adulterer a patriot would have hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the royal house of theodosius the imprudent maximus disregarded these salutary considerations he gratified his resentment and ambition he saw the bleeding corpse of valentinian at his feet and he heard himself saluted emperor by the unanimous voice of the senate and people but the day of his inauguration was the last day of his happiness he was imprisoned such is the lively expression of sidonius in the palace and after passing a sleepless night he sighed that he had attained the summit of his wishes and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation oppressed by the weight of the diadem he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor fulgentius and when he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of his former life the emperor exclaimed o fortunate damocles districtus ensis cui super impia cervice pendet non siculae dapes dulcem elaborabunt saporem non avium citharaeque cantus somnum reducent horat carm iii   sidonius concludes his letter with the story of damocles which cicero tusculan v  0    had so inimitably told    thy reign began and ended with the same dinner a wellknown allusion which fulgentius afterward repeated as an instructive lesson for princes and subjects  the reign of maximus continued about three his death a d     june    months his hours of which he had lost the command were disturbed by remorse or guilt or terror and his throne was shaken by the seditions of the soldiers the people and the confederate barbarians the marriage of his son palladius with the eldest daughter of the late emperor might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his family but the violence which he offered to the empress eudoxia could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge his own wife the cause of these tragic events had been seasonably removed by death and the widow of valentinian was compelled to violate her decent mourning perhaps her real grief and to submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper whom she suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband these suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of maximus himself and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride who was still conscious that she descended from a line of emperors from the east however eudoxia could not hope to obtain any effectual assistance her father and her aunt pulcheria were dead her mother languished at jerusalem in disgrace and exile and the scepter of constantinople was in the hands of a stranger she directed her eyes toward carthage secretly implored the aid of the king of the vandals and persuaded genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising his rapacious designs by the specious names of honor justice and compassion notwithstanding the evidence of procopius evagrius idatius marcellinus etc the learned muratori annali ditalia tom iv p     doubts the reality of this invitation and observes with great truth non si puo dir quanto sia facile il popolo a sognare e spacciar voci false but his argument from the interval of time and place is extremely feeble the figs which grew near carthage were produced to the senate of rome on the third day  whatever abilities maximus might have shown in a subordinate station he was found incapable of administering an empire and though he might easily have been informed of the naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of africa he expected with supine indifference the approach of the enemy without adopting any measures of defense of negotiation or of a timely retreat when the vandals disembarked at the mouth of the tyber the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy by the clamours of a trembling and exasperated multitude the only hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a precipitate flight and he exhorted the senators to imitate the example of their prince but no sooner did maximus appear in the streets than he was assaulted by a shower of stones a roman or a burgundian soldier claimed the honor of the first wound his mangled body was ignominiously cast into the tyber the roman people rejoiced in the punishment which they had inflicted on the author of the public calamities and the domestics of eudoxia signalized their zeal in the service of their mistress  infidoque tibi burgundio ductu extorquet trepidas mactandi principis iras sidon in panegyr avit     a remarkable line which insinuates that rome and maximus were betrayed by their burgundian mercenaries     on the third day after the tumult genseric sack of rome by the vandals a d     june        boldly advanced from the port of ostia to the gates of the defenseless city instead of a sally of the roman youth there issued from the gates an unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his clergy the apparent success of pope leo may be justified by prosper and the historia miscellan but the improbable notion of baronius a d     no    that genseric spared the three apostolical churches is not countenanced even by the doubtful testimony of the liber pontificalis  the fearless spirit of leo his authority and eloquence again mitigated the fierceness of a barbarian conqueror the king of the vandals promised to spare the unresisting multitude to protect the buildings from fire and to exempt the captives from torture and although such orders were neither seriously given nor strictly obeyed the mediation of leo was glorious to himself and in some degree beneficial to his country but rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the licentiousness of the vandals and moors whose blind passions revenged the injuries of carthage the pillage lasted fourteen days and nights and all that yet remained of public or private wealth of sacred or profane treasure was diligently transported to the vessels of genseric among the spoils the splendid relics of two temples or rather of two religions exhibited a memorable example of the vicissitude of human and divine things since the abolition of paganism the capitol had been violated and abandoned yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still respected and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for the rapacious hands of genseric the profusion of catulus the first who gilt the roof of the capitol was not universally approved plin hist nature xxxiii    but it was far exceeded by the emperors and the external gilding of the temple cost domitian   000 talents   00000l the expressions of claudian and rutilius luce metalli

branches originally framed according to the particular instructions of god himself and which were placed in the sanctuary of his temple had been ostentatiously displayed to the roman people in the triumph of titus they were afterward deposited in the temple of peace and at the end of four hundred years the spoils of jerusalem were transferred from rome to carthage by a barbarian who derived his origin from the shores of the baltic these ancient monuments might attract the notice of curiosity as well as of avarice but the christian churches enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege and the pious liberality of pope leo who melted six silver vases the gift of constantine each of an hundred pounds weight is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to repair in the fortyfive years that had elapsed since the gothic invasion the pomp and luxury of rome were in some measure restored and it was difficult either to escape or to satisfy the avarice of a conqueror who possessed leisure to collect and ships to transport the wealth of the capital the imperial ornaments of the palace the magnificent furniture and wardrobe the sideboards of massy plate were accumulated with disorderly rapine the gold and silver amounted to several thousand talents yet even the brass and copper were laboriously removed eudoxia herself who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer soon bewailed the imprudence of her own conduct she was rudely stripped of her jewels and the unfortunate empress with her two daughters the only surviving remains of the great theodosius was compelled as a captive to follow the haughty vandal who immediately hoisted sail and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of carthage the vessel which transported the relics of the capitol was the only one of the whole fleet that suffered shipwreck if a bigoted sophist a pagan bigot had mentioned the accident he might have rejoiced that this cargo of sacrilege was lost in the sea  many thousand romans of both sexes chosen for some useful or agreeable qualifications reluctantly embarked on board the fleet of genseric and their distress was aggravated by the unfeeling barbarians who in the division of the booty separated the wives from their husbands and the children from their parents the charity of deogratias bishop of

wealthy and honorable family in the diocese of auvergne the convulsions of the times urged him to embrace with the same ardour the civil and military professions and the indefatigable youth blended

negotiation and the soldier of aetius after executing the most important embassies was raised to the station of praetorian prefect of gaul either the merit of avitus excited envy or his moderation was desirous of repose since he calmly retired to an estate which he possessed in the neighborhood of clermont a copious stream issuing from the mountain and falling headlong in many a loud and foaming

ambassador he was received with courteous hospitality by theodoric the king of the goths but while avitus laid the foundations of a solid alliance with that powerful nation he was astonished by the intelligence that the emperor maximus was slain and that rome had been pillaged by the vandals a vacant throne which he might ascend without guilt or danger tempted his ambition seventy lines of

aspect and behavior the noisy crowd of his barbarian guards occupies the hall of audience but they are not permitted to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the councilchamber from vulgar eyes the ambassadors of the nations are successively introduced theodoric listens with attention answers them with discreet brevity and either announces or delays according to the nature of their business his final resolution about eight the second hour he rises from his throne and visits either his treasury or his stables if he chooses to hunt or at least to exercise himself on horseback his bow is carried by a favorite youth but when the game is marked he bends it with his own hand and seldom misses the object of his aim as a king he disdains to bear arms in such ignoble warfare but as a soldier he would blush to accept any military service which he could perform himself on common days his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen but every saturday many honorable guests are invited to the royal table which on these occasions is served with the elegance of greece the plenty of gaul and the order and diligence of italy videas ibi elegantiam graecam abundantiam

taste is gratified without the help of foreign and costly luxury the size and number of the cups of wine are regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance and the respectful silence that prevails is interrupted only by grave and instructive conversation after dinner theodoric sometimes indulges himself in a short slumber and as soon as he wakes he calls for the dice and tables encourages his friends to forget the royal majesty and is delighted when they freely express the passions which are excited by the incidents of play at this game which he loves as the image of war he alternately displays his eagerness his skill his patience and his cheerful temper if he loses he laughs he is modest and silent if he wins yet notwithstanding this seeming indifference his courtiers choose to solicit any favor in the moments of victory and i myself in my applications to the king have derived some benefit from my losses tunc etiam ego aliquid obsecraturus feliciter vincor et mihi

oclock the tide of business again returns and flows incessantly till after sunset when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of suppliants and pleaders at the supper a more familiar repast buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes introduced to divert not to offend the company by their ridiculous wit but female singers and the soft effeminate modes of music are severely banished and such martial tunes as animate the soul to deeds of valor are alone grateful to the ear of theodoric he retires from table and the nocturnal guards are immediately posted at the entrance of the treasury the palace and the private apartments  when the king of the visigoths encouraged avitus to assume the purple he offered his person his expedition into spain a d     and his forces as a faithful soldier of the republic theodoric himself had given a solemn and voluntary promise of fidelity which was understood both in gaul and spain   romae sum te duce amicus principe te miles sidon panegyr avit        the exploits of theodoric soon convinced the world that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ancestors after the establishment of the goths in aquitain and the passage of the vandals into africa the suevi who had fixed their kingdom in gallicia aspired to the conquest of spain and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the roman dominion the provincials of carthagena and tarragona afflicted by an hostile invasion represented their injuries and their apprehensions count fronto was dispatched in the name of the emperor avitus with advantageous offers of peace and alliance and theodoric interposed his weighty mediation to declare that unless his brotherinlaw the king of the suevi immediately retired he should be obliged to arm in the cause of justice and of rome tell him replied the haughty rechiarius that i despise his friendship and his arms but that i shall soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of thoulouse such a challenge urged theodoric to prevent the bold designs of his enemy he passed the pyrenees at the head of the visigoths the franks and burgundians served under his standard and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of avitus he privately stipulated for himself and his successors the absolute possession of his spanish conquests the two armies or rather the two nations encountered each other on the banks of the river urbicus about twelve miles from astorga and the decisive victory of the goths appeared for a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the suevi from the field of battle theodoric advanced to braga their metropolis which still retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and dignity quaeque sinu pelagi jactat se bracara dives  auson de claris urbibus p      from the design of the king of the suevi it is evident that the navigation from the ports of gallicia to the mediterranean was known and practiced the ships of bracara or braga cautiously steered along the coast without daring to lose themselves in the atlantic    his entrance was not polluted with blood and the goths respected the chastity of their female captives more especially of the consecrated virgins but the greatest part of the clergy and people were made slaves and even the churches and altars were confounded in the universal pillage the unfortunate king of the suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight he was delivered to his implacable rival and rechiarius who neither desired nor expected mercy received with manly constancy the death which he would probably have inflicted after this bloody sacrifice to policy or resentment theodoric carried his victorious arms as far as merida the principal town of lusitania without meeting any resistance except from the miraculous powers of st eulalia but he was stopped in the full career of success and recalled from spain before he could provide for the security of his conquests in his retreat toward the pyrenees he revenged his disappointment on the country through which he passed and in the sack of pollentia and astorga he showed himself a faithless ally as well as a cruel enemy whilst the king of the visigoths fought and vanquished in the name of avitus the reign of avitus had expired and both the honor and the interest of theodoric were deeply wounded by the disgrace of a friend whom he had seated on the throne of the western empire this suevic was is the most authentic part of the chronicle of idatius who

library among the statues of famous writers and orators sidon apoll l ix epist    p     carm viii p   0  seems to contain a very moderate proportion either of genius or of truth the poet if we may degrade that sacred name exaggerates the merit of a sovereign and a father and his prophecy of a long and glorious reign was soon contradicted by the event avitus at a time when the imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and danger indulged himself in the pleasures of italian luxury age had not extinguished his amorous inclinations and he is accused of insulting with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery the husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated luxuriose agere volens a senatoribus projectus est is the concise expression of gregory of tours l ii c xi in tom ii p     an old chronicle in tom ii p     mentions an indecent jest of avitus which seems more applicable to rome than to treves  but the romans were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to acknowledge his virtues the several parts of the empire became every day more alienated from each other and the stranger of gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt the senate asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor and their authority which had been originally derived from the old constitution was again fortified by the actual weakness of a declining monarchy yet even such a monarchy might have resisted the votes of an unarmed senate if their discontent had not been supported or perhaps inflamed by count ricimer one of the principal commanders of the barbarian troops who formed the military defense of italy the daughter of wallia king of the visigoths was the mother of ricimer but he was descended on the fathers side from the nation of the suevi sidonius panegyr anthem  0  etc praises the royal birth of ricimer the lawful heir as he chooses to insinuate both of the gothic and suevic kingdoms  his pride or patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his countrymen and he obeyed with reluctance an emperor in whose elevation he had not been consulted his faithful and important services against the common enemy rendered him still more formidable see the chronicle of idatius jornandes c    p     styles him with some truth virum egregium et pene tunc in italia ad exercitum singularem  and after destroying on the coast of corsica a fleet of vandals which consisted of sixty galleys ricimer returned in triumph with the appellation of the deliverer of italy he chose that moment to signify to avitus that his reign was at an end and the feeble emperor at a distance from his gothic allies was compelled after a short and unavailing struggle to abdicate the purple by the clemency however or the contempt of ricimer parcens innocentiae aviti is the compassionate but contemptuous language of victor tunnunensis in chron apud scaliger eusebius in another place he calls him vir totius simplicitatis this commendation is more humble but it is more solid and sincere than the praises of sidonius  he was permitted to descend from the throne to the more desirable station of bishop of placentia but the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied and their inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death he fled toward the alps with the humble hope not of arming the visigoths in his cause but of securing his person and treasures in the

gregory of tours l ii c xi p     is concise but correct in the reign of his countryman the words of idatius caret imperio caret et vita seem to imply that the death of avitus was violent but it must have been secret since evagrius l ii c   could suppose that he died of the plague  avitus left only one daughter the wife of sidonius apollinaris who inherited the patrimony of his fatherinlaw lamenting at the same time the disappointment of his public and private expectations his resentment prompted him to join or at least to countenance the measures of a rebellious faction in gaul and the poet had contracted some guilt which it was incumbent on him to expiate by a new tribute of flattery to the succeeding emperor after a modest appeal to the examples of his brethren virgil and horace

heroic character such as sometimes arise in a degenerate age to vindicate the honor of the human species the emperor majorian has deserved the praises of his contemporaries and of posterity and these praises may be strongly expressed in the words of a judicious and disinterested historian that he was gentle to his subjects that he was terrible to his enemies and that he excelled in every virtue all his predecessors who had reigned over the romans the words of procopius deserve to be transcribed  and afterward  de bell vandal l i c   p     a concise but comprehensive definition of royal virtue  such a testimony may justify at least the panegyric of sidonius and we may acquiesce in the assurance that although the obsequious orator would have flattered with equal zeal the most worthless of princes the extraordinary merit of his object confined him on this occasion within the bounds of truth the panegyric was pronounced at lions before the end of the year     while the emperor was still consul it has more art than genius and more labor than art the ornaments are false or trivial the expression is feeble and prolix and sidonius wants the skill to exhibit the principal figure in a strong and distinct light the private life of majorian occupies about two hundred lines  0    0   majorian derived his name from his maternal grandfather who in the reign of the great theodosius had commanded the troops of the illyrian frontier he gave his daughter in marriage to the father of majorian a respectable officer who administered the revenues of gaul with skill and integrity and generously preferred the friendship of aetius to the tempting offers of an insidious court his son the future emperor who was educated in the profession of arms displayed from his early youth intrepid courage premature wisdom and unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune he followed the standard of aetius contributed to his success shared and sometimes eclipsed his glory and at last excited the jealousy of the patrician or rather of his wife who forced him to retire from the service she pressed his immediate death and was scarcely satisfied with his disgrace it should seem that aetius like belisarius and marlborough was governed by his wife whose fervent piety though it might work miracles gregor turon l ii c   p     was not incompatible with base and sanguinary counsels  majorian after the death of aetius was recalled and promoted and his intimate connection with count ricimer was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of the western empire during the vacancy that succeeded the abdication of avitus the ambitious barbarian whose birth excluded him from the imperial dignity governed italy with the title of patrician resigned to his friend the conspicuous station of mastergeneral of the cavalry and infantry and after an interval of some months consented to the unanimous wish of the romans whose favor majorian had solicited by a recent

of the roman world which we have saved from foreign and domestic enemies ab externo host et a domestica clade liberavimus by the latter majorian must understand the tyranny of avitus whose death he

glories in the name of senator and who is anxious that you should never repent of the judgment which you have pronounced in his favor the emperor who amidst the ruins of the roman world revived the ancient language of law and liberty which trajan would not have disclaimed must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart since they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age or the example of his predecessors see the whole edict or epistle of majorian to the senate novell tit iv p    yet the expression regnum nostrum bears some taint of the age and does not mix kindly with the word respublica which he frequently repeats   the private and public actions of majorian his salutary laws a d          are very imperfectly known but his laws remarkable for an original cast of thought and expression faithfully represent the character of a sovereign who loved his people who sympathized in their distress who had studied the causes of the decline of the empire and who was capable of applying as far as such reformation was practicable judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders see the laws of majorian they are only nine in number but very long and various at the end of the theodosian code novell l iv p        godefroy has not given any commentary on these additional pieces  his regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove or at least to mitigate the most intolerable grievances i from the first hour of his reign he was solicitous i translate his own words to relieve the weary fortunes of the provincials oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and superindictions fessas provincialium varia atque multiplici tributorum exactione fortunas et extraordinariis fiscalium solutionum oneribus attritas etc novell majorian tit iv p     with this view he granted an universal amnesty a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of tribute of all debts which under any pretense the fiscal officers might demand from the people this wise dereliction of obsolete vexatious and unprofitable claims improved and purified the sources of the public revenue and the subject who could now look back without despair might labor with hope and gratitude for himself and for his country ii in the assessment and collection of taxes majorian restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates and suppressed the extraordinary commissions which had been introduced in the name of the emperor himself or of the praetorian praefects the favorite servants who obtained such irregular powers were insolent in their behavior and arbitrary in their demands they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals and they were discontented if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury one instance of their extortion would appear incredible were it not authenticated by the legislator himself they exacted the whole payment in gold but they refused the current coin of the empire and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of faustina or the antonines the subject who was unprovided with these curious medals had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands or if he succeeded in the research his imposition was doubled according to the weight and value of the money of former times the learned greaves vol i p       0     has found by a diligent inquiry that aurei of the antonines weighed one hundred and eighteen and those of the fifth century only sixtyeight english grains majorian gives currency to all gold coin excepting only the gallic solidus from its deficiency not in the weight but in the standard  iii the municipal corporations says the emperor the lesser senates so antiquity has justly styled them deserve to be considered as the heart of the cities and the sinews of the republic and yet so low are they now reduced by the injustice of magistrates and the venality of collectors that many of their members renouncing their dignity and their country have taken refuge in distant and obscure exile he urges and even compels their return to their respective cities but he removes the grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their municipal functions they are directed under the authority of the provincial magistrates to resume their office of levying the tribute but instead of being made responsible for the whole sum assessed on their district they are only required to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public iv but majorian was not ignorant that these corporate bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered and he therefore revives the useful office of the defenders of cities he exhorts the people to elect in a full and free assembly some man of discretion and integrity who would dare to assert their privileges to represent their grievances to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under the sanction of his name and authority  the spectator who casts a mournful view over the edifices of rome the ruins of ancient rome is tempted to accuse the memory of the goths and vandals for the mischief which they had neither leisure nor power nor perhaps inclination to perpetrate the tempest of war might strike some lofty turrets to the ground but the destruction which undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics was prosecuted slowly and silently during a period of ten centuries and the motives of interest that afterward operated without shame or control were severely checked by the taste and spirit of the emperor majorian the decay of the city had gradually impaired the value of the public works the circus and theaters might still excite but they seldom gratified the desires of the people the temples which had escaped the zeal of the christians were no longer inhabited either by gods or men the diminished crowds of the romans were lost in the immense space of their baths and porticoes and the stately libraries and halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation whose repose was seldom disturbed either by study or business the monuments of consular or imperial greatness were no longer revered as the immortal glory of the capital they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials cheaper and more convenient than the distant quarry specious petitions were continually addressed to the easy magistrates of rome which stated the want of stones or bricks for some necessary service the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced for the sake of some paltry or pretended repairs and the degenerate romans who converted the spoil to their own emolument demolished with sacrilegious hands the labors of their ancestors majorian who had often sighed over the desolation of the city applied a severe remedy to the growing evil the whole edict novell majorian tit vi p    is curious antiquarum aedium dissipatur speciosa constructio et ut aliquid reparetur magna diruuntur hinc jam occasio nascitur ut etiam unusquisque privatum aedificium construens per gratiam judicum praesumere de publicis locis necessaria et transfer non dubitet etc with equal zeal but with less power petrarch in the fourteenth century repeated the same complaints vie de petrarque tom i p         if i prosecute this history i shall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the city of rome an interesting object to which my plan was originally consined he reserved to the prince and senate the sole congnisance of the extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient edifice imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold two thousand pounds sterling on every magistrate who should presume to grant such illegal and scandalous license and threatened to chastise the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers by a severe whipping and the amputation of both their hands in the last instance the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of guilt and punishment but his zeal arose from a generous principle and majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of those ages in which he would have desired and deserved to live the emperor conceived that it was his interest to increase the number of his subjects that it was his duty to guard the purity of the marriage bed but the means which he employed to accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous and perhaps exceptionable kind the pious maids who consecrated their virginity to christ were restrained from taking the veil till they had reached their fortieth year windows under that age were compelled to form a second alliance within the term of five years by the forfeiture of half their wealth to their nearest relations or to the state unequal marriages were condemned or annulled the punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so inadequate to the guilt of adultery that if the criminal returned to italy he might by the express declaration of majorian be slain with impunity the emperor chides the lenity of rogatian consular of tuscany in a style of acrimonious reproof which sounds almost like personal resentment novell tit ix p    the law of majorian which punished obstinate widows was soon afterward repealed by his successor severus novell sever tit i p      while the emperor majorian assiduously labored majorian prepares to invade africa a d     to restore the happiness and virtue of the romans he encountered the arms of genseric from his character and situation their most formidable enemy a fleet of vandals and moors landed at the mouth of the liris or

kings brotherinlaw was found in the number of the slain sidon panegyr majorian        0  such vigilance might announce the character of the new reign but the strictest vigilance and the most numerous forces were insufficient to protect the longextended coast of italy from the depredations of a naval war the public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the genius of majorian rome expected from him alone the restitution of africa and the design which he formed of attacking the vandals in their new settlements was the result of bold and judicious policy if the intrepid emperor could have infused his own spirit into the youth of italy if he could have revived in the field of mars the manly exercises in which he had always surpassed his equals he might have marched against genseric at the head of a roman army such a reformation of national manners might be embraced by the rising generation but it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy that to obtain some immediate advantage or to avert some impending danger they are forced to countenance and even to multiply the most pernicious abuses majorian like the weakest of his predecessors was reduced to the disgraceful expedient of substituting barbarian auxiliaries in the place of his unwarlike subjects and his superior abilities could only be displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous instrument so apt to recoil on the hand that used it besides the confederates who were already engaged in the service of the empire the fame of his liberality and valor attracted the nations of the danube the borysthenes and perhaps of the tanais many thousands of the bravest subjects of attila the gepidae the ostrogoths the rugians the burgundians the suevi the alani assembled in the plains of liguria and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities the review of the army and passage of the alps contain the

winter the emperor led the way on foot and in complete armor sounding with his long staff the depth of the ice or snow and encouraging the scythians who complained of the extreme cold by the cheerful assurance that they should be satisfied with the heat of africa the citizens of lions had presumed to shut their gates they soon implored and experienced the clemency of majorian he vanquished theodoric in the field and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king whom he had found not unworthy of his arms the beneficial though precarious reunion of the greatest part of gaul and spain was the effect of persuasion as well as of force  is the just and forcible distinction of priscus excerpt legate p    in a short fragment which throws much light on the history of majorian jornandes has suppressed the defeat and alliance of the visigoths which were solemnly proclaimed in galicia and are marked in the chronicle of idatius  and the independent bagaudae who had escaped or resisted the oppression of former reigns were disposed to confide in the virtues of majorian his camp was filled with barbarian allies his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectinate people but the emperor had foreseen that it was impossible without a maritime power to atchieve the conquest of africa in the first punic war the republic had exerted such incredible diligence that within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had been given in the forest a fleet of one hundred and sixty galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea florus l ii c   he amuses himself with the poetical fancy that the

and gaul vied with each other in liberal contributions to the public service and the imperial navy of three hundred large galleys with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels was

   the number of ships which priscus fixes at  00 is magnified by an indefinite comparison with the fleets of agamemnon xerxes and augustus    the intrepid countenance of majorian animated his troops with a confidence of victory and if we might credit the historian procopius his courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence anxious to explore with his own eyes the state of the vandals he ventured after disguising the color of his hair to visit carthage in the character of his own ambassador and genseric was afterward mortified by the discovery that he had entertained and dismissed the emperor of the romans such an anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction but it is a fiction which would not have been imagined unless in the life of a hero procopius de bell vandal l i c   p     when genseric conducted his unknown guest into the arsenal of carthage the arms clashed of their own accord majorian had tinged his yellow locks with a black color   without the help of a personal interview genseric was sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his adversary he practiced his the loss of his fleet customary arts of fraud and delay but he practiced them without success his applications for peace became each hour more submissive and perhaps more sincere but the inflexible majorian had adopted the ancient maxim that rome could not be safe as long as carthage existed in a hostile state the king of the vandals distrusted the valor of his native subjects who were enervated by the luxury of the south  spoliisque potitus immensis robur luxu jam perdidit omne quo valuit dum pauper erat panegyr majorian   0  he afterward applies to genseric unjustly as it should seem the vices of his subjects    he suspected the fidelity of the vanquished

genseric was saved from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some powerful subjects envious or apprehensive of their masters success guided by their secret intelligence he surprised the unguarded fleet in the bay of carthagena many of the ships were sunk or taken or burnt and the preparations of three years were destroyed in a single day idatius who was safe in gallicia from the power of ricimer boldly and honestly declares vandali per proditores admoniti etc he dissembles however the name of the traitor  after this event the behavior of the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune the vandal instead of being elated by this accidental victory immediately renewed his solicitations for peace the emperor of the west who was capable of forming great designs and of supporting heavy disappointments consented to a treaty or rather to a suspension of arms in the full assurance that before he could restore his navy he should be supplied with provocations to justify a second war majorian returned to italy to prosecute his labors for the public happiness and as he was conscious of his own integrity he might long remain ignorant of the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life the recent misfortune of carthagena sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the multitude almost every description of civil and military officers were exasperated against the reformer since they all derived some advantage from the abuses which he endeavored to suppress and the patrician rieimer impelled the inconstant passions of the barbarians against a prince whom he esteemed and hated the virtues of majorian could not protect him from the impetuous sedition which broke out in the camp near tortona at the foot of the alps he was compelled

lines of his venal panegyric   it was not perhaps without some regret that ricimer reigns under the name of severus a d          ricimer sacrificed his friend to the interest of his ambition but he resolved in a second choice to avoid the imprudent preference of superior virtue and merit at his command the obsequious senate of rome bestowed the imperial title on libius severus who ascended the throne of the west without emerging from the obscurity of a private condition history has scarcely deigned to notice his birth his elevation his character or his death severus expired as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron sidonius panegyr anthem     dismisses him to heaven auxerat augustus naturae lege severus divorum numerum  and an old list of the emperors composed about the time of justinian praises his piety and fixes his residence at rome sirmond not ad sidon p            and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the vacant interval of six years between the death of majorian and the elevation of anthemius during that period the government was in the hands of ricimer alone and although the modest barbarian disclaimed the name of king he accumulated treasures formed a separate army negociated private alliances and ruled italy with the same independent and despotic authority which was afterward exercised by odoacer and theodoric but his dominions were bounded by the alps and two roman generals marcellinus and aegidius maintained their allegiance to the republic by rejecting with disdain the phantom which he styled an emperor marcellinus still adhered to the old revolt of marcellinus in dalmatia religion and the devout pagans who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state applauded his profound skill in the science of divination but he possessed the more valuable qualifications of learning virtue and courage tillemont who is always scandalized by the virtues of infidels attributes this advantageous portrait of marcellinus which suidas has preserved to the partial zeal of some pagan historian hist des empereurs tom vi p   0  the study of the latin literature had improved his taste and his military talents had recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great aetius in whose ruin he was involved by a timely flight marcellinus escaped the rage of valentinian and boldly asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the western empire his voluntary or reluctant submission to the authority of majorian was rewarded by the government of sicily and the command of an army stationed in that island to oppose or to attack the vandals but his barbarian mercenaries after the emperors death were tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of ricimer at the head of a band of faithful followers the intrepid marcellinus occupied the province of dalmatia assumed the title of patrician of the west secured the love of his subjects by a mild and equitable reign built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the hadriatic and alternately alarmed the coasts of italy and of africa procopius de bell vandal l i c   p     in various circumstances of the life of marcellinus it is not easy to reconcile the greek historian with the latin chronicles of the times  aegidius the mastergeneral of gaul who equalled or at least who imitated the heroes and of aegidius in gaul of ancient rome i must apply to aegidius the praises which sidonius panegyr majorian     bestows on a nameless mastergeneral who commanded the rearguard of majorian idatius from public report commends his christian piety and priscus mentions p    his military virtues  proclaimed his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved master a brave and numerous army was attached to his standard and though he was prevented by the arts of ricimer and the arms of the visigoths from marching to the gates of rome he maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the alps and rendered the name of aegidius respectable both in peace and war the franks who had punished with exile the youthful follies of childeric elected the roman general for their king his vanity rather than his ambition was gratified by that singular honor and when the nation at the end of four years repented of the injury which they had offered to the merovingian family he patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince the authority of aegidius ended only with his life and the suspicions of poison and secret violence which derived some countenance from the character of ricimer were eagerly entertained

numerosa class quotannis militat excidium conversoque ordine fati torrida caucaseos infert mihi byrsa furores   in the spring of each year they equipped a formidable navy in the port of carthage and genseric himself though in a very advanced age still commanded in person the most important expeditions his designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy till the moment that he hoisted sail when he was asked by his pilot what course he should steer leave the determination to the winds replied the barbarian with pious arrogance they will transport us to the guilty coast whose inhabitants have provoked the divine justice but if genseric himself deigned to issue more precise orders he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal the vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of spain liguria tuscany campania lucania bruttium apulia calabria venetia dalmatia epirus greece and sicily they were tempted to subdue the island of sardinia so advantageously placed in the center of the mediterranean and their arms spread desolation or terror from the columns of hercules to the mouth of the nile as they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory they seldom attacked any fortified cities or engaged any regular troops in the open field but the celerity of their motions enabled them almost at the same time to threaten and to attack the most distant objects which attracted their desires and as they always embarked a sufficient number of horses they had no sooner landed than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry yet notwithstanding the example of their king the native vandals and alani insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare the hardy generation of the first conquerors was almost extinguished and their sons who were born in africa enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valor of their fathers their place was readily supplied by a various multitude of moors and romans of captives and outlaws and those desperate wretches who had already violated the laws of their country were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of genseric in the treatment of his unhappy prisoners he sometimes consulted his avarice and sometimes indulged his cruelty and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of zant or zacynthus whose mangled bodies he cast into the ionian sea was imputed by the public indignation to his latest posterity  such crimes could not be excused by any provocations but the war which the king of the vandals prosecuted against the roman empire negociations with the eastern empire a d     etc was justified by a specious and reasonable motive the widow of valentinian eudoxia whom he had led captive from rome to carthage was the sole heiress of the theodosian house her elder daughter eudocia became the reluctant wife of hunneric his eldest son and the stern father asserting a legal claim which could not easily be refuted or satisfied demanded a just proportion of the imperial patrimony an adequate or at least a valuable compensation was offered by the eastern emperor to purchase a necessary peace eudoxia and her younger daughter placidia were honorably restored and the fury of the vandals was confined to the limits of the western empire the italians destitute of a naval force which alone was capable of protecting their coasts implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the east who had formerly acknowledged in peace and war the supremacy of rome but the perpetual division of the two empires had alienated their interest and their inclinations the faith of a recent treaty was alleged and the western romans instead of arms and ships could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual mediation the haughty ricimer who had long struggled with the difficulties of his situation was at length reduced to address the throne of constantinople in the humble language of a subject and italy submitted as the price and security of the alliance to accept a master from the choice of the emperor of the east the poet himself is compelled to acknowledge the distress of ricimer praeterea invict us ricimer

constantinople renounces her ancient claims and implores the friendship of aurora the goddess of the east this fabulous machinery which the genius of claudian had used and abused is the constant and miserable resource of the muse of sidonius    it is not the purpose of the present chapter or even of the present volume to continue the distinct series of the byzantine history but a concise view of the reign and character of the emperor leo may explain the last efforts that were attempted to save the falling empire of the west the original authors of the reigns of marcian leo and zeno are reduced to some imperfect fragments whose deficiencies must be supplied from the more recent compilations of theophanes zonaras and cedrenus   since the death of the younger theodosius the domestic repose of constantinople had never been leo emperor of the east a d          interrupted by war or faction pulcheria had bestowed her hand and the scepter of the east on the modest virtue of marcian he gratefully reverenced her august rank and virgin chastity and after her death he gave his people the example of the religious worship that was due to the memory of the imperial saint st pulcheria died a d     four years before her nominal husband and her festival is celebrated on the  0th of september by the modern greeks she bequeathed an immense patrimony to pious or at least to ecclesiastical uses see tillemont memoires eccles tom xv p           attentive to the prosperity of his own dominions marcian seemed to behold with indifference the misfortunes of rome and the obstinate refusal of a a brave and active prince to draw his sword against the vandals was ascribed to a secret promise which had formerly been exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of genseric see procopius de bell vandal l i c   p      the death of marcian after a reign of seven years would have exposed the east to the danger of a popular election if the superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline the balance in favor of the candidate whose interest they supported the patrician aspar might have placed the diadem on his own head if he would have subscribed the nicene creed from this disability of aspar to acend the throne it may be inferred that the stain of heresy was perpetual and indelible while that of barbarism disappeared in the second generation  during three generations the armies of the east were successively commanded by his father by himself and by his son ardaburius his barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed the palace and the capital and the liberal distribution of his immense treasures rendered aspar as popular as he was powerful he recommended the obscure name of leo of thrace a military tribune and the principal steward of his household his nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate and the servant of aspar received the imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch or bishop who was permitted to express by this unusual ceremony the suffrage of the deity theophanes p    this appears to be the first origin of a ceremony which all the christian princes of the world have since adopted and from which the clergy have deduced the most formidable consequences  this emperor the first of the name of leo has been distinguished by the title of the great from a succession of princes who gradually fixed in the opinion of the greeks a very humble standard of heroic or at least of royal perfection yet the temperate firmness with which leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor showed that he was conscious of his duty and of his prerogative aspar was astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a prefect of constantinople he presumed to reproach his sovereign with a breach of promise and insolently shaking his purple it is not proper said he that the man who is invested with this garment should be guilty of lying nor is it proper replied leo that a prince should be compelled to resign his own judgment and the public interest to the will of a subject cedrenus p         who was conversant with the writers of better days has preserved the remarkable words of aspar   after this extraordinary scene it was impossible that the reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere or at least that it could be solid and permanent an army of isaurians the power of the isaurians agitated the eastern empire in the two succeeding reigns of zeno and anastasius but it ended in the destruction of those barbarians who maintained their fierce independence about two hundred and thirty years was secretly levied and introduced into constantinople and while leo undermined the authority and prepared the disgrace of the family of aspar his mild and cautious behavior restrained them from any rash and desperate attempts which might have been fatal to themselves or their enemies the measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution as long as aspar degraded the majesty of the throne the secret correspondence of religion and interest engaged him to favor the cause of genseric when leo had delivered himself from that ignominious servitude he listened to the complaints of the italians resolved to extirpate the tyranny of the vandals and declared his alliance with his colleague anthemius whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the west  the virtues of anthemius have perhaps been anthemius emperor of the west a d         magnified since the imperial descent which he could only deduce from the usurper procopius has been swelled into a line of emperors  tali tu civis ab urbe procopio genitore micas cui prisca propago augustis venit a proavis the poet sidon panegyr anthem      0  then proceeds to relate the private life and fortunes of the future emperor with which he must have been very imperfectly acquainted    but the merit of his immediate parents their honors and their riches rendered anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the east his father procopius obtained after his persian embassy the rank of general and patrician and the name of anthemius was derived from his maternal grandfather the celebrated prefect who protected with so much ability and success the infant reign of theodosius the grandson of the prefect was raised above the condition of a private subject by his marriage with euphemia the daughter of the emperor marcian this splendid alliance which might supersede the necessity of merit hastened the promotion of anthemius to the successive dignities of count of mastergeneral of consul and of patrician and his merit or fortune claimed the honors of a victory which was obtained on the banks of the danube over the huns without indulging an extravagant ambition the soninlaw of marcian might hope to be his successor but anthemius supported the disappointment with courage and patience and his subsequent elevation was universally approved by the public who esteemed him worthy to reign till he ascended the throne sidonius discovers with tolerable ingenuity that this disappointment added new luster to the virtues of anthemius   0 etc who declined one scepter and reluctantly accepted another    etc  the emperor of the west marched from constantinople attended by several counts of high distinction and a body of guards almost equal to the strength and numbers of a regular army he entered rome in triumph and the choice of leo a d     april    was confirmed by the senate the people and the barbarian confederates of italy the poet again celebrates the unanimity of all orders of the state        and the chronicle of idatius mentions the forces which attended his march  the solemn inauguration of anthemius was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the patrician ricimer a fortunate event which was considered as the firmest security of the union and happiness of the state the wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed and many senators completed their ruin by an expensive effort to disguise their poverty all serious business was suspended during this festival the courts of justice were shut the streets of rome the theaters the places of public and private resort resounded with hymenaeal songs and dances and the royal bride clothed in silken robes with a crown on her head was conducted to the palace of ricimer who had changed his military dress for the habit of a consul and a senator on this memorable occasion sidonius whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted appeared as the orator of auvergne among the provincial deputies who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints interveni autem nuptiis patricii ricimeris cui filia perennis augusti in spem publicae securitatis copulabatur the journey of sidonius from lions and the festival of rome are described with some spirit l i epist   p       epist   p     the calends of january were now approaching and the venal poet who had loved a d     january   avitus and esteemed majorian was persuaded by his friends to celebrate in heroic verse the merit the felicity the second consulship and the future triumphs of the emperor anthemius sidonius pronounced with assurance and success a panegyric which is still extant and whatever might be the imperfections either of the subject or of the composition the welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the praefecture of rome a dignity which placed him among the illustrious personages of the empire till he wisely preferred the more respectable character of a bishop and a saint sidonius l i epist   p       very fairly states his motive his labor and his reward hic ipse panegyricus si non judicium certe eventum boni operis accepit he was made bishop of clermont a d     tillemont mem eccles tom xvi p   0   the greeks ambitiously commend the piety the festival of the lupercalia and catholic faith of the emperor whom they gave to the west nor do they forget to observe that when he left constantinople he converted his palace into the pious foundation of a public bath a church and an hospital for old men the palace of anthemius stood on the banks of the propontis in the ninth century alexius the soninlaw of the emperor theophilus obtained permission to purchase the ground and ended his days in a monastery which he founded on that delightful spot ducange constantinopolis christiana p          yet some suspicious appearances are found to sully the theological fame of anthemius from the conversation of philotheus a macedonian sectary he had imbibed the spirit of religious toleration and the heretics of rome would have assembled with impunity if the bold and vehement censure which pope hilary pronounced in the church of st peter had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence papa hilarus apud beatum petrum apostolum palam ne id fieret clara voce constrinxit in tantum ut non ea facienda cum interpositione juramenti idem promitteret imperator gelasius epistol ad andronicum apud baron a d     no   the cardinal observes with some complacency that it was much easier to plant heresies at constantinople than at rome  even the pagans a feeble and obscure remnant conceived some vain hopes from the indifference or partiality of anthemius and his singular friendship for the philosopher severus whom he promoted to the consulship was ascribed to a secret project of reviving the ancient worship of the gods damascius in the life of the philosopher isidore apud photium p  0   damascius who lived under justinian composed another work consisting of   0 praeternatural stories of souls demons apparitions the dotage of platonic paganism  these idols were crumbled into dust and the mythology which had once been the creed of nations was so universally disbelieved that it might be employed without scandal or at least without suspicion by christian poets in the poetical works of sidonius which he afterward condemned l ix epist    p     the fabulous deities are the principal actors if jerome was scourged by the angels for only reading virgil the bishop of clermont for such a vile imitation deserved an additional whipping from the muses  yet the vestiges of superstition were not absolutely obliterated and the festival of the lupercalia whose origin had preceded the foundation of rome was still celebrated under the reign of anthemius the savage and simple rites were expressive of an early state of society before the invention of arts and agriculture the rustic deities who presided over the toils and pleasures of the pastoral life pan faunus and their train of satyrs were such as the fancy of shepherds might create sportive petulant and lascivious whose power was limited and whose malice was inoffensive a goat was the offering the best adapted to their character and attributes the flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits and the riotous youths who crowded to the feast ran naked about the fields with leather thongs in their hands communicating as it was supposed the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they touched ovid fast l ii

laughter  the altar of pan was erected perhaps by evander the arcadian in a dark recess in the side of the palatinehill watered by a perpetual fountain and shaded by an hanging grove a tradition that in the same place romulus and remus were suckled by the wolf rendered it still more sacred and venerable in the eyes of the romans and this sylvan spot was gradually surrounded by the stately edifices of the forum see dionys halicarn l i p       edit hudson the roman antiquaries donatus l ii c    p         and nardini p         have labored to ascertain the true situation of the lupercal  after the conversion of the imperial city the christians still continued in the month of february the annual celebration of the lupercalia to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world the bishops of rome were solicitous to abolish a profane custom so repugnant to the spirit of christianity but their zeal was not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate the inveterate abuse subsisted till the end of the fifth century and pope gelasius who purified the capital from the last stain of idolatry appeased by a formal apology the murmurs of the senate and people baronius published from the mss of the vatican this epistle of pope gelasius a d     no        which is entitled adversus andromachum senatorem caeterosque romanos qui lupercalia secundum morem pristinum colenda constituebant gelasius always supposes that his adversaries are nominal christians and that he may not yield to them in absurd prejudice he imputes to this harmless festival all the calamities of the age   in all his public declarations the emperor leo preparations against the vandals of africa a d     assumes the authority and professes the affection of a father for his son anthemius with whom he had divided the administration of the universe itaque nos quibus totius mundi regimen commisit superna provisio pius et triumphator semper augustus filius noster anthemius licet divina majestas et nostra creatio pietati ejus plenam imperii commiserit potestatem etc such is the dignified style of leo whom anthemius respectfully names dominus et pater meus princeps sacratissimus leo see novell anthem tit ii iii p    ad calcem cod theod  the situation and perhaps the character of leo dissuaded him from exposing his person to the toils and dangers of an african war but the powers of the eastern empire were strenuously exerted to deliver italy and the mediterranean from the vandals and genseric who had so long oppressed both the land and sea was threatened from every side with a formidable invasion the campaign was opened by a bold and successful enterprise of the prefect heraclius the expedition of heraclius is clouded with difficulties tillemont hist des empereurs tom vi p   0 and it requires some dexterity to use the circumstances afforded by theophanes without injury to the more respectable evidence of procopius  the troops of egypt thebais and libya were embarked under his command and the arabs with a train of horses and camels opened the roads of the desert heraclius landed on the coast of tripoli surprised and subdued the cities of that province and prepared by a laborious march which cato had formerly executed the march of cato from berenice in the province of cyrene was much longer than that of heraclius from tripoli he passed the deep sandy desert in thirty days and it was found necessary to provide besides the ordinary supplies a great number of skins filled with water and several psylli who were supposed to possess the art of sucking the wounds which had been made by the serpents of their native country see plutarch in caton uticens tom iv p     strabon geograph l xvii p       to join the imperial army under the walls of carthage the intelligence of this loss extorted from genseric some insidious and ineffectual propositions of peace but he was still more seriously alarmed by the reconciliation of marcellinus with the two empires the independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the legitimate title of anthemius whom he accompanied in his journey to rome the dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of italy the active valor of marcellinus expelled the vandals from the island of sardinia and the languid efforts of the west added some weight to the immense preparations of the eastern romans the expense of the naval armament which leo sent against the vandals has been distinctly ascertained and the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire the royal demesnes or private patrimony of the prince supplied seventeen thousand pounds of gold fortyseven thousand pounds of gold and seven hundred thousand of silver were levied and paid into the treasury by the praetorian praefects but the cities were reduced to extreme poverty and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures as a valuable object of the revenue does not suggest the idea of a just or merciful administration the whole expense by whatsoever means it was defrayed of the african campaign amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds of gold about five millions two hundred thousand pounds sterling at a time when the value of money appears from the comparative price of corn to have been somewhat higher than in the present age the principal sum is clearly expressed by procopius de bell vandal l i c vi p     the smaller constituent parts which tillemont hist des empereurs tom vi p     has laboriously collected from the byzantine writers are less certain and less important the historian malchus laments the public misery excerpt ex suida in corp hist byzant p    but he is surely unjust when he charges leo with hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the people  the fleet that sailed from constantinople to carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships and the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand men basiliscus the brother of the empress vorina was entrusted with this important command his sister the wife of leo had exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the scythians but the discovery of his guilt or incapacity was reserved for the african war and his friends could only save his military reputation by asserting that he had conspired with aspar to spare genseric and to betray the last hope of the western empire  experience has shown that the success of an invader most commonly depends on the vigor failure of the expedition and celerity of his operations the strength and sharpness of the first impression are blunted by delay the health and spirit of the troops insensibly languish in a distant climate the naval and military force a mighty effort which perhaps can never be repeated is silently consumed and every hour that is wasted in negotiation accustoms the enemy to contemplate and examine those hostile terrors which on their first appearance he deemed irresistible the formidable navy of basiliscus pursued its prosperous navigation from the thracian bosphorus to the coast of africa he landed his troops at cape

vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land were successively vanquished theophanes p  00 affirms that many ships of the vandals were sunk the assertion of jornandes de successione regn that basiliscus attacked carthage must be understood in a very qualisied sense  if basiliscus had seized the moment of consternation and boldly advanced to the capital carthage must have surrendered and the kingdom of the vandals was extinguished genseric beheld the danger with firmness and eluded it with his veteran dexterity he protested in the most respectful language that he was ready to submit his person and his dominions to the will of the emperor but he requested a truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission and it was universally believed that his secret liberality contributed to the success of this public negotiation instead of obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly solicited the guilty or the credulous basiliscus consented to the fatal truce and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim that he already considered himself as the conqueror of africa during this short interval the wind became favorable to the designs of genseric he manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the moors and vandals and they towed after them many large barks filled with combustible materials in the obscurity of the night these destructive vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the romans who were awakened by the sense of their instant danger their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire which was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence and the noise of the wind the crackling of the flames the dissonant cries of the soldiers and mariners who could neither command nor obey increased the horror of the nocturnal tumult whilst they labored to extricate themselves from the fireships and to save at least a part of the navy the galleys of genseric assaulted them with temperate and disciplined valor and many of the romans who escaped the fury of the flames were destroyed or taken by the victorious vandals among the events of that disastrous night the heroic or rather desperate courage of john one of the principal officers of basiliscus has rescued his name from oblivion when the ship which he had bravely defended was almost consumed he threw himself in his armor into the sea disdainfully rejected the esteem and pity of genso the son of genseric who pressed him to accept honorable quarter and sunk under the waves exclaiming with his last breath that he would never fall alive into the hands of those impious dogs actuated by a far different spirit basiliscus whose station was the most remote from danger disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement returned to constantinople with the loss of more than half of his fleet and army and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of st sophia till his sister by her tears and entreaties could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor heraclius effected his retreat through the desert marcellinus retired to sicily where he was assassinated perhaps at the instigation of ricimer by one of his own captains and the king of the vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction that the romans themselves should remove from the world his most formidable antagonists damascius in vit

by the defense of arles and the victory of orleans saved gaul and checked during his lifetime the progress of the visigoths their ambition was soon rekindled and the design of extinguishing the roman empire in spain and gaul was conceived and almost completed in the reign of euric who assassinated his brother theodoric and displayed with a more savage temper superior abilities both in peace and war he passed the pyrenees at the head of a numerous army subdued the cities of saragossa and pampeluna vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the tarragonese province carried his victorious arms

with sirmonds notes this letter does honor to his heart as well as to his understanding the prose of sidonius however vitiated by a false and affected taste is much superior to his insipid verses  from the perils which he had escaped arvandus imbibed confidence rather than wisdom and such was the various though uniform imprudence of his behavior that his prosperity must appear much more surprising than his downfall the second praefecture which he obtained within the term of five years abolished the merit and popularity of his preceding administration his easy temper was corrupted by flattery and exasperated by opposition he was forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of the province his capricious insolence offended the nobles of gaul and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred the mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct before the senate and he passed the sea of tuscany with a favorable wind the presage as he vainly imagined of his future fortunes a decent respect was still observed for the praefectorian rank and on his arrival at rome arvandus was committed to the hospitality rather than to the custody of flavius asellus the count of the sacred largesses who resided in the capitol when the capitol ceased to be a temple it was appropriated to the use of the civil magistrate and it is still the residence of the roman senator the jewellers etc might be allowed to expose their precious wares in the porticoes  he was eagerly pursued by his accusers the four deputies of gaul who were all distinguished by their birth their dignities or their eloquence in the name of a great province and according to the forms of roman jurisprudence they instituted a civil and criminal action requiring such a restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals and such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state their charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty but they placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had intercepted and which they could prove by the evidence of his secretary to have been dictated by arvandus himself the author of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the goths from a peace with the greek emperor he suggested the attack of the britons on the loire and he recommended a division of gaul according to the law of nations between the visigoths and the burgundians haec ad regem gothorum charta videbatur emitti pacem cum graeco imperatore dissuadens britannos super ligerim sitos impugnari opportere demonstrans cum burgundionibus jure gentium gallias dividi debere confirmans  these pernicious schemes which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion were susceptible of a treasonable interpretation and the deputies had artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons till the decisive moment of the contest but their intentions were discovered by the zeal of sidonius he immediately apprised the unsuspecting criminal of his danger and sincerely lamented without any mixture of anger the haughty presumption of arvandus who rejected and even resented the salutary advice of his friends ignorant of his real situation arvandus showed himself in the capitol in the white robe of a candidate accepted indiscriminate salutations and offers of service examined the shops of the merchants the silks and gems sometimes with the indifference of a spectator and sometimes with the attention of a purchaser and complained of the times of the senate of the prince and of the delays of justice his complaints were soon removed an early day was fixed for his trial and arvandus appeared with his accusers before a numerous assembly of the roman senate the mournful garb which they affected excited the compassion of the judges who were scandalized by the gay and splendid dress of their adversary and when the prefect arvandus with the first of the gallic deputies were directed to take their places on the senatorial benches the same contrast of pride and modesty was observed in their behavior in this memorable judgment which presented a lively image of the old republic the gauls exposed with force and freedom the grievances of the province and as soon as the minds of the audience were sufficiently inflamed they recited the fatal epistle the obstinacy of arvandus was founded on the strange supposition that a subject could not be convicted of treason unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple as the paper was read he repeatedly and with a loud voice acknowledged it for his genuine composition and his astonishment was equal to his dismay when the unanimous voice of the senate declared him guilty of a capital offense by their decree he was degraded from the rank of a prefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public prison after a fortnights adjournment the senate was again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death but while he expected in the island of aesculapius the expiration of the thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors senatusconsultum tiberianum sirmond not p    but that law allowed only ten days between the sentence and execution the remaining twenty were added in the reign of theodosius  his friends interposed the emperor anthemius relented and the prefect of gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and confiscation the faults of arvandus might deserve compassion but the impunity of seronatus accused the justice of the republic till he was condemned and executed on the complaint of the people of auvergne that flagitious minister the catiline of his age and country held a secret correspondence with the visigoths to betray the province which he oppressed his industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes and obsolete offenses and his extravagant vices would have inspired contempt if they had not excited fear and abhorrence catilina seculi nostri sidonius l ii epist   p    l v epist    p     l vii epist   p     he execrates the crimes and applauds the punishment of seronatus perhaps with the indignation of a virtuous

powerful barbarian was able to contend or to negociate with the prince whose alliance he had condescended to accept the peaceful and prosperous reign which anthemius had promised to the west was soon clouded by misfortune and discord ricimer apprehensive or impatient of a superior retired from rome and fixed his residence at milan an advantageous situation either to invite or to repel the warlike

of insolent moderation i am still inclined to embrace the friendship of the galatian galatam concitatum sirmond in his notes to ennodius applies this appellation to anthemius himself the emperor was probably born in the province of galatia whose inhabitants the gallogrecians were supposed to unite the vices of a savage and a corrupted people  but who will undertake to appease his anger or to mitigate the pride which always rises in proportion to our submission they informed him that epiphanius bishop of pavia epiphanius was thirty years bishop of pavia a d          see tillemont mem

strongest opposition either of interest or passion their recommendation was approved and epiphanius assuming the benevolent office of mediation proceeded without delay to rome where he was received with the honors due to his merit and reputation the oration of a bishop in favor of peace may be easily supposed he argued that in all possible circumstances the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy or magnanimity or prudence and be seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce barbarian which might be fatal to himself and must be ruinous to his dominions anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims but he deeply felt with grief and indignation the behavior of ricimer and his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse what favors he warmly exclaimed have we refused to this ungrateful man what provocations have we not endured regardless of the majesty of the purple i gave my daughter to a goth i sacrificed my own blood to the safety of the republic the liberality which ought to have secured the eternal attachment of ricimer has exasperated him against his benefactor what wars has he not excited against the empire how often has he instigated and assisted the fury of hostile nations shall i now accept his perfidious friendship can i hope that he will respect the engagements of a treaty who has already violated the duties of a son but the anger of anthemius evaporated in these passionate exclamations he insensibly yielded to the proposals of epiphanius and the bishop returned to his diocese with the satisfaction of restoring the peace of italy by a reconciliation ennodius p            has related this embassy of epiphanius and his narrative verbose and turgid as it must appear illustrates some curious passages in the fall of the western empire  of which the sincerity and continuance might be reasonably suspected the clemency of the emperor was extorted from his weakness and ricimer suspended his ambitious designs till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved to subvert the throne of anthemius the mask of peace and moderation was then thrown aside the army of ricimer was fortified by a numerous reinforcement of burgundians and oriental suevi he disclaimed all allegiance to the greek emperor marched from milan to the gates of rome and fixing his camp on the banks of the anio impatiently expected the arrival of olybrius his imperial candidate  the senator olybrius of the anician family olybrius emperor of the west a d     march    might esteem himself the lawful heir of the western empire he had married placidia the younger daughter of valentinian after she was restored by genseric who still detained her sister eudoxia as the wife or rather as the captive of his son the king of the vandals supported by threats and solicitations the fair pretensions of his roman ally and assigned as one of the motives of the war the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful prince and the unworthy preference which they had given to a stranger priscus excerpt legation p    procopius de bell vandal l i c   p     eudoxia and her daughter were restored after the death of majorian perhaps the consulship of olybrius a d     was bestowed as a nuptial present  the friendship of the public enemy might render olybrius still more unpopular to the italians but when ricimer meditated the ruin of the emperor anthemius he tempted with the offer of a diadem the candidate who could justify his rebellion by an illustrious name and a royal alliance the husband of placidia who like most of his ancestors had been invested with the consular dignity might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of constantinople nor does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot be amused or occupied unless by the administration of an empire yet olybrius yielded to the importunities of his friends perhaps of his wife rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a civil war and with the secret connivance of the emperor leo accepted the italian purple which was bestowed and resumed at the capricious will of a barbarian he landed without obstacle for genseric was master of the sea either at ravenna or the port of ostia and immediately proceeded to the camp of ricimer where he was received as the sovereign of the western world the hostile appearance of olybrius is fixed notwithstanding the opinion of pagi by the duration of his reign the secret connivance of leo is acknowledged by theophanes and the paschal chronicle we are ignorant of his motives but in this obscure period our ignorance extends to the most public and important facts   the patrician who had extended his posts from the anio to the milvian bridge already possessed two quarters of rome the vatican and sack of rome and death of anthemius a d     july    the janiculum which are separated by the tyber from the rest of the city of

roma antica p    it would require a tedious dissertation to mark the circumstances in which i am inclined to depart from the topography of that learned roman  and it may be conjectured that an assembly of seceding senators imitated in the choice of olybrius the forms of a legal election but the body of the senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of anthemius and the more effectual support of a gothic army enabled him to prolong his reign and the public distress by a resistance of three months which produced the concomitant evils of famine and pestilence at length ricimer made a furious assault on the bridge of hadrian or st angelo and the narrow pass was defended with equal valor by the goths till the death of gilimer their leader the victorious troops breaking down every barrier rushed with irresistible violence into the heart of the city and rome if we may use the language of a contemporary pope was subverted by the civil fury of anthemius and ricimer nuper anthemii

stranger and a king who invaded italy with an army of foreigners his native subjects  and in this promiscuous multitude the names of the heruli the scyrri the alani the turcilingi and the rugians appear to have predominated the example of these warriors was imitated by orestes orestes qui eo tempore quando attila ad italiam venit se illi junxit et ejus notarius factus fuerat anonym vales p     he is mistaken in the date but we may credit his assertion that the secretary of attila was the father of augustulus  the son of tatullus and the father of the last roman emperor of the west orestes who has been already mentioned in this history had never deserted his country his birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious subjects of pannonia when that province was ceded to the huns he entered into the service of attila his lawful sovereign obtained the office of his secretary and was repeatedly sent ambassador to constantinople to represent the person and signify the commands of the imperious monarch the death of that conqueror restored him to his freedom and orestes might honorably refuse either to follow the sons of attila into the scythian desert or to obey the ostrogoths who had usurped the dominion of pannonia he preferred the service of the italian princes the successors of valentinian and as he possessed the qualifications of courage industry and experience he advanced with rapid steps in the military profession till he was elevated by the favor of nepos himself to the dignities of patrician and mastergeneral of the troops these troops had been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of orestes who affected their manners conversed with them in their own language and was intimately connected with their national chieftains by long habits of familiarity and friendship at his solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure greek who presumed to claim their obedience and when orestes from some secret motive declined the purple they consented with the same facility to acknowledge his son augustulus as the emperor of the west by the abdication of nepos orestes had now attained the his son augustulus the last emperor of the west a d     summit of his ambitious hopes but he soon discovered before the end of the first year that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude which a rebel must inculcate will be retorted against himself and that the precarious sovereign of italy was only permitted to choose whether he would be the slave or the victim of his barbarian mercenaries the dangerous alliance of these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of roman freedom and dignity at each revolution their pay and privileges were augmented but their insolence increased in a still more extravagant degree they envied the fortune of their brethren in gaul spain and africa whose victorious arms had acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance and they insisted on their peremptory demand that a third part of the lands of italy should be immediately divided among them orestes with a spirit which in another situation might be entitled to our esteem chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed multitude than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people he rejected the audacious demand and his refusal was favorable to the ambition of odoacer a bold barbarian who assured his fellow soldiers that if they dared to associate under his command they might soon extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions from all the camps and garrisons of italy the confederates actuated by the same resentment and the same hopes impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular leader and the unfortunate patrician overwhelmed by the torrent hastily retreated to the strong city of pavia the episcopal seat of the holy epiphanites pavia was immediately besieged the fortifications were stormed the town was pillaged and although the bishop might labor with much zeal and some success to save the property of the church and the chastity of female captives the tumult could only be appeased by the execution of orestes see ennodius in vit epiphan sirmond tom i p

action near ravenna and the helpless augustulus who could no longer command the respect was reduced to implore the clemency of odoacer  that successful barbarian was the son of edecon odoacer king of italy a d        0 who in some remarkable transactions particularly described in a preceding chapter had been the colleague of orestes himself the honor of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion and edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his sovereign but this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or repentance his rank was eminent and conspicuous he enjoyed the favor of attila and the troops under his command who guarded in their turn the royal village consisted in a tribe of scyrri his immediate and hereditary subjects in the revolt of the nations they

western empire a d     or a d     submissive people of italy was prepared to obey without a murmur the authority which he should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the emperor of the west but odoacer had resolved to abolish that useless and expensive office and such is the weight of antique prejudice that it required some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme facility of the enterprise the unfortunate augustulus was made the instrument of his own disgrace he signified his resignation to the senate and that assembly in their last act of obedience to a roman prince still

sole monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect at the same time both the east and the west in their own name and in the name of the people they consent that the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from rome to constantinople and they basely renounce the right of choosing their master the only vestige that yet remained of the authority which had given laws to the world the republic they repeat that name without a blush might safely confide in the civil and military virtues of odoacer and they humbly request that the emperor would invest him with the title of patrician and the administration of the diocese of italy the deputies of the senate were received at constantinople with some marks of displeasure and indignation and when they were admitted to the audience of zeno he sternly reproached them with their treatment of the two emperors anthemius and nepos whom the east had successively granted to the prayers of italy the first continued he you have murdered the second you have expelled but the second is still alive and whilst he lives he is your lawful sovereign but the prudent zeno soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague his vanity was gratified by the title of sole emperor and by the statues erected to his honor in the several quarters of rome he entertained a friendly though ambiguous correspondence with the patrician odoacer and

friend papirius paetus under the military despotism of caesar the argument however of vivere pulcherrimum duxi is more forcibly addressed to a roman philosopher who possessed the free alternative of life or death  the distress of italy was mitigated by the prudence and humanity of odoacer who had bound himself at the price of his elevation to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent multitude the kings of the barbarians were frequently resisted deposed or murdered by their native subjects and the various bands of italian mercenaries who associated under the standard of an

the loose and imperfect practice of religion satisfied the conscience of the multitude the prince or magistrate the soldier or merchant reconciled their fervent zeal and implicit faith with the exercise of their profession the pursuit of their interest and the indulgence of their passions but the ascetics who obeyed and abused the rigid precepts of the gospel were inspired by the savage enthusiasm which represents man as a criminal and god as a tyrant they seriously renounced the business and the pleasures of the age abjured the use of wine of flesh and of marriage chastised their body mortified their affections and embraced a life of misery as the price of eternal happiness in the reign of constantine the ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate world to perpetual solitude or religious society like the first christians of jerusalem cassian collat xviii   claims this origin for the institution of the coenobites which gradually decayed till it was restored by anthony and

of death the pythagorean silence and submission were revived in their servile discipline and they disdained as firmly as the cynics themselves all the forms and decencies of civil society but the

miles to the east of antioch within the space of a mandra or circle of stones to which he had attached himself by a ponderous chain he ascended a column which was successively raised from the height

the rude imperfect idiom of soldiers and shepherds so illqualified to communicate any spiritual ideas was improved and modulated by his genius and ulphilas before he could frame his version was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twentyfour letters four of which he invented to express the peculiar sounds that were unknown to the greek and latin pronunciation a mutilated copy of the four

in their moral and political condition they received at the same time the use of letters so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a sacred book and while they studied the divine truth their minds were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history of nature of the arts and of society the version of the scriptures into their native tongue which had facilitated their conversion must excite among their clergy some curiosity to read the original text to understand the sacred liturgy of the church and to examine in the writings of the fathers the chain of ecclesiastical tradition these spiritual gifts were preserved in the greek and latin languages which concealed the inestimable monuments of ancient learning the immortal productions of virgil cicero and livy which were accessible to the christian barbarians maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of augustus and the times of clovis and charlemagne the emulation of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect state and the flame of science was secretly kept alive to warm and enlighten the mature age of the western world in the most corrupt state of christianity the barbarians might learn justice from the law and mercy from the gospel and if the knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions or to regulate their passions they were sometimes restrained by conscience and frequently punished by remorse but the direct authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion which united them with their christian brethren in spiritual friendship the influence of these sentiments contributed to secure their fidelity in the service or the alliance of the romans to alleviate the horrors of war to moderate the insolence of conquest and to preserve in the downfall of the empire a permanent respect for the name and institutions of rome in the days of paganism the priests of gaul and germany reigned over the people and controuled the jurisdiction of the magistrates and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal or more ample measure of devout obedience to the pontiffs of the christian faith the sacred character of the bishops was supported by their temporal possessions they obtained an honorable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and freemen and it was their interest as well as their duty to mollify by peaceful counsels the fierce spirit of the barbarians the perpetual correspondence of the latin clergy the frequent pilgrimages to rome and jerusalem and the growing authority of the popes cemented the union of the christian republic and gradually produced the similar manners and common jurisprudence which have distinguished from the rest of mankind the independent and even hostile nations of modern europe  but the operation of these causes was checked they are involved in the arian heresy and retarded by the unfortunate accident which infused a deadly poison into the cup of salvation whatever

freedom and perhaps with sincerity that the son was not equal or consubstantial to the father the opinions of ulphilas and the goths inclined to semiarianism since they would not say that the son was

the clergy theodoret l iv c     communicated these errors to the clergy and people and infected the barbaric world with an heresy the arianism of the goths has been imputed to the emperor valens

of episcopal functions and punished the popular bishops of aquitain with imprisonment exile and confiscation such are the contemporary complaints of sidonius bishop of clermont l vii c   p     etc edit sirmond gregory of tours who quotes this epistle l ii c    in tom ii p     extorts an unwarrantable assertion that of the nine vacancies in aquitain some had been produced by episcopal martyrdoms

communion and the apostate could neither grant nor expect a sincere forgiveness he was exasperated to find that the africans who had fled before him in the field still presumed to dispute his will in synods and churches and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of compassion his catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant laws and arbitrary punishments the language of genseric was furious and formidable the knowledge of his intentions might justify the most unfavourable interpretation of his actions and the arians were reproached with the frequent executions which stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant arms and ambition were however the ruling passions of the monarch of the sea but hunneric his inglorious hunneric a d     son who seemed to inherit only his vices tormented the catholics with the same unrelenting fury which had been fatal to his brother his nephews and the friends and favorites of his father and even to the arian patriarch who was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of carthage the religious war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce persecution was made the serious and important business of the vandal court and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of hunneric revenged the injuries without contributing to the deliverance of the church the throne of africa was successively filled by the two nephews of hunneric by gundamund who reigned about twelve and by gundamund a d     thrasimund who governed the nation above twentyseven years their administration was hostile and oppressive to the orthodox party gundamund appeared to emulate or even to surpass the cruelty of his uncle and if at length he relented if he recalled the bishops and restored the freedom of athanasian worship a premature death intercepted the benefits of his tardy clemency his brother thrasimund was the greatest and most accomplished of the vandal thrasimund a d     kings whom he excelled in beauty prudence and magnanimity of soul but this magnanimous character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful clemency instead of threats and tortures he employed the gentle but efficacious powers of seduction wealth dignity and the royal favor were the liberal rewards of apostasy the catholics who had violated the laws might purchase their pardon by the renunciation of their faith and whenever thrasimund meditated any rigorous measure he patiently waited till the indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious opportunity bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death and he exacted from his successor a solemn oath that he would never tolerate the sectaries of athanasius but his successor hilderic the gentle son of the savage hunneric preferred the duties of hilderic a d     humanity and justice to the vain obligation of an impious oath and his accession was gloriously marked by the restoration of peace and universal freedom the throne of that virtuous though feeble monarch was usurped by his cousin gelimer a zealous arian but the vandal kingdom gelimer a d   0 before he could enjoy or abuse his power was subverted by the arms of belisarius and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries which

life of st fulgentius who was distinguished in the persecution of thrasimond in biblioth max patrum tom ix p       and in the first book of the vandalic war by the impartial procopius c     p

general view of the persecution in africa the sole historians of this persecution cannot afford any distinct series of causes and events any impartial view of characters or counsels but the most remarkable circumstances that deserve either credit or notice may be referred to the following heads i in the original law which is still extant victor iv   p    hunneric refuses the name of catholics to the homoousians he describes as the very divinae majestatis cultores his own party who professed the faith confirmed by more than a thousand bishops in the synods of rimini and seleucia  hunneric expressly declares and the declaration appears to be correct that he had faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the imperial edicts against the heretical congregations the clergy and the people who dissented from the established religion if the rights of conscience had been understood the catholics must have condemned their past conduct or acquiesced in their actual sufferings but they still persisted to refuse the indulgence which they claimed while they trembled under the lash of persecution they praised the laudable severity of hunneric himself who burnt or banished great numbers of manichaeans victor ii   p       laudabilior videbatur in the mss which omit this word the passage is unintelligible see ruinart not p      and they rejected with horror the ignominious compromise that the disciples of arius and of athanasius should enjoy a reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the romans and in those of the vandals victor ii   p       the clergy of carthage called these conditions periculosae and they seem indeed to have been proposed as a snare to entrap the catholic bishops  ii the practice of a conference which the catholics had so frequently used to insult and punish their obstinate antagonists was retorted against themselves see the narrative of this conference and the treatment of the bishops in victor ii        p        and the whole fourth book p         the third book p        is entirely filled by their apology or confession of faith  at the command of hunneric four hundred and sixtysix orthodox bishops assembled at carthage but when they were admitted into the hall of audience they had the mortification of beholding the arian cirila exalted on the patriarchal throne the disputants were separated after the mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence of delay and precipitation of military force and of popular clamor one martyr and one confessor were selected among the catholic bishops twentyeight escaped by flight and eightyeight by conformity fortysix were sent into corsica to cut timber for the royal navy and three hundred and two were banished to the different parts of africa exposed to the insults of their enemies and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual comforts of life see the list of the african bishops in victor p        0 and ruinarts notes p          the schismatic name of donatus frequently occurs and they appear to have adopted like our fanatics of the last age the pious appellations of deodatus deogratias quidvultdeus habetdeum etc  the hardships of ten years exile must have reduced their numbers and if they had complied with the law of thrasimund which prohibited any episcopal consecrations the orthodox church of africa must have expired with the lives of its actual members they disobeyed and their disobedience was punished by a second exile of two hundred and twenty bishops into sardinia where they languished fifteen years till the accession of the gracious hilderic fulgent vit c        thrasimund affected the praise of moderation and learning and fulgentius addressed three books of controversy to the arian tyrant whom he styles jiissime rex biblioth maxim patrum tom ix p    only sixty bishops are mentioned as exiles in the life of fulgentius they are increased to one hundred and twenty by victor tunnunensis and isidore but the number of two hundred and twenty is specified in the historia miscella and a short authentic chronicle of the times see ruinart p   0      the two islands were judiciously chosen by the malice of their arian tyrants seneca from his own experience has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of corsica see the base and insipid epigrams of the stoic who could not support exile with more fortitude than ovid corsica might not produce corn wine or oil but it could not be destitute of grass water and even fire  and the plenty of sardinia was overbalanced by the unwholesome quality of the air si ob gravitatem coeli interissent viie damnum tacit annal ii    in this application thrasimund would have adopted the reading of some critics utile damnum  iii the zeal of genseric and his successors for the conversion of the catholics must have rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the vandal faith before the churches were finally shut it was a crime to appear in a barbarian dress and those who presumed to neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their long hair see these preludes of a general persecution in victor ii       and the two edicts of hunneric l ii p    l iv p     the palatine officers who refused to profess the religion of their prince were ignominiously stripped of their honors and employments banished to sardinia and sicily or condemned to the servile labors of slaves and peasants in the fields of utica in the districts which had been peculiarly allotted to the vandals the exercise of the catholic worship was more strictly prohibited and severe penalties were denounced against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte by these arts the faith of the barbarians was preserved and their zeal was inflamed they discharged with devout fury the office of spies informers or executioners and whenever their cavalry took the field it was the favorite amusement of the march to defile the churches and to insult the clergy of the adverse faction see procopius de bell vandal l i c   p         a moorish prince endeavored to propitiate the god of the christians by his diligence to eraze the marks of the vandal sacrilege  iv the citizens who had been educated in the luxury of the roman province were delivered with exquisite cruelty to the moors of the desert a venerable train of bishops presbyters and deacons with a faithful crowd of four thousand and ninetysix persons whose guilt is not precisely ascertained were torn from their native homes by the command of hunneric during the night they were confined like a herd of cattle amidst their own ordure during the day they pursued their march over the burning sands and if they fainted under the heat and fatigue they were goaded or dragged along till they expired in the hands of their tormentors see this story in victor ii       p  0     victor describes the distress of these confessors as an eyewitness  these unhappy exiles when they reached the moorish huts might excite the compassion of a people whose native humanity was neither improved by reason nor corrupted by fanaticism but if they escaped the dangers they were condemned to share the distress of a savage life v it is incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme they excite the flame which they strive to extinguish and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy as well as the crime of the offender the fine which he is unable or unwilling to discharge exposes his person to the severity of the law and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of capital punishment through the veil of fiction and declamation we may clearly perceive that the catholics more especially under the reign of hunneric endured the most cruel and ignominious treatment see the fifth book of victor his passionate complaints are confirmed by the sober testimony of procopius and the public declaration of the emperor justinian cod l i tit xxvii  respectable citizens noble matrons and consecrated virgins were stripped naked and raised in the air by pullies with a weight suspended at their feet in this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges or burnt in the most tender parts with redhot plates of iron the amputation of the ears the nose the tongue and the right hand was inflicted by the arians and although the precise number cannot be defined it is evident that many persons among whom a bishop victor ii    p    and a proconsul victor v   p       his name was victorianus and he was a wealthy citizen of adrumetum who enjoyed the confidence of the king by whose favor he had obtained the office or at least the title of proconsul of africa may be named were entitled to the crown of martyrdom the same honor has been ascribed to the memory of count sebastian who professed the nicene creed with unshaken constancy and genseric might detest as an heretic the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival victor i   p     after relating the firm resistance and dextrous reply of count sebastian he adds quare alio generis argumento postea bellicosum virum occidit  vi a new mode of conversion which might subdue the feeble and alarm the timorous was employed by the arian ministers they imposed by fraud or violence the rites of baptism and punished

tom vi p  0   the hostile sects had formerly allowed the validity of each others baptism and the innovation so fiercely maintained by the vandals can be imputed only to the example and advice of the

ministry of a great church and the africans after the loss of their orthodox pastors were deprived of the public exercise of christianity viii the emperors were the natural protectors of the homoousian doctrine and the faithful people of africa both as romans and as catholics preferred their lawful sovereignty to the usurpation of the barbarous heretics during an interval of peace and friendship hunneric restored the cathedral of carthage at the intercession of zeno who reigned in the east and of placidia the daughter and relict of emperors and the sister of the queen of the vandals victor ii     p     but this decent regard was of short duration and the haughty tyrant displayed his contempt for the religion of the empire by studiously arranging the bloody images of persecution in all the principal streets through which the roman ambassador must pass in his way to the palace victor v   p    he appeals to the ambassador himself whose name was uranius  an oath was required from the bishops who were assembled at carthage that they would support the succession of his son hilderic and that they would renounce all foreign or transmarine correspondence this engagement consistent as it should seem with their moral and religious duties was refused by the more sagacious members astutiores victor iv   p  0 he plainly intimates that their quotation of the gospel non jurabitis in toto was only meant to elude the obligation of an inconvenient oath the fortysix bishops who refused were banished to corsica the three hundred and two who swore were distributed through the provinces of africa of the assembly their refusal faintly colored by the pretense that it is unlawful for a christian to swear must provoke the suspicious of a jealous tyrant  the catholics oppressed by royal and military catholic frauds force were far superior to their adversaries in numbers and learning with the same weapons which the greek fulgentius bishop of ruspae in the byzacene province was of a senatorial family and had received a liberal education he could repeat all homer and menander before he was allowed to study latin his native tongue vit fulgent c   many african bishops might understand greek and many greek theologians were translated into latin and latin fathers had already provided for the arian controversy they repeatedly silenced or vanquished the fierce and illiterate successors of ulphilas the consciousness of their own superiority might have raised them above the arts and passions of religious warfare yet instead of assuming such honorable pride the orthodox theologians were tempted by the assurance of impunity to compose fictions which must be stigmatized with the epithets of fraud and forgery they ascribed their own polemical works to the most venerable names of christian antiquity the characters of athanasius and augustine were aukwardly personated by vigilius and his disciples compare the two prefaces to the dialogue of vigilius of thapsus p         edit chiflet he might amuse his learned reader with an innocent fiction but the subject was too grave and the africans were too ignorant  and the famous creed which so clearly

and every language of modern europe  the example of fraud must excite suspicion and miracles and the specious miracles by which the african catholics have defended the truth and justice of their cause may be ascribed with more reason to their own industry than to the visible protection of heaven yet the historian who views this religious conflict with an impartial eye may condescend to mention one preternatural event which will edify the devout and surprise the incredulous tipasa plin hist natural v   itinerar wesseling p    cellarius geograph antiq tom ii part ii p     this tipasa which must

the catholics in the forum and in the presence of the whole province deprived the guilty of their righthands and their tongues but the holy confessors continued to speak without tongues and this miracle is attested by victor an african bishop who published an history of the persecution within two years after the event victor vitensis v   p    ruinart p           if any one says victor should doubt of the truth let him repair to constantinople and listen to the clear and perfect language of restitutus the subdeacon one of these glorious sufferers who is now lodged in the palace of the

supernatural gift of the african confessors who spoke without tongues will command the assent of those and of those only who already believe that their language was pure and orthodox but the stubborn mind of an infidel is guarded by secret incurable suspicion and the arian or socinian who has seriously rejected the doctrine of the trinity will not be shaken by the most plausible evidence of an

the suevi and the franks to the destruction of his native land he folicited the dangerous aid of the romans who possessed africa and a part of the spanish coast and his holy ambassador the archbishop leander effectually negociated in person with the byzantine court but the hopes of the catholics were crushed by the active diligence of a monarch who commanded the troops and treasures of spain and the guilty hermenegild after his vain attempts to resist or to escape was compelled to surrender himself into the hands of an incensed father leovigild was still mindful of that sacred character and the rebel despoiled of the regal ornaments was still permitted in a decent exile to profess the catholic religion his repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length provoked the indignation of the gothic king and the sentence of death which he pronounced with apparent reluctance was privately executed in the tower of seville the inflexible constancy with which he refused to accept the arian communion as the price of his safety may excuse the honors that have been paid to the memory of st hermenegild his wife and infant son were detained by the romans in ignominious captivity and this domestic misfortune tarnished the glories of leovigild and embittered the last moments of his life  his son and successor recared the first catholic king of spain had imbibed the faith of conversion of recared and the visigoths of spain a d          his unfortunate brother which he supported with more prudence and success instead of revolting against his father recared patiently expected the hour of his death instead of condemning his memory he piously supposed that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of arianism and recommended to his son the conversion of the gothic nation to accomplish that salutary end recared convened an assembly of the arian clergy and nobles declared himself a catholic and exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince the laborious interpretation of doubtful texts or the curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments would have excited an endless controversy and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate audience two substantial and visible arguments the testimony of earth and of heaven the earth had submitted to the nicene synod the romans the barbarians and the inhabitants of spain unanimously professed the same orthodox creed and the visigoths resisted almost alone the consent of the christian world a superstitious age was prepared to reverence as the testimony of heaven the preternatural cures which were performed by the skill or

life and two counts excited a dangerous revolt in the narbonnese gaul but recared disarmed the conspirators defeated the rebels and executed severe justice which the arians in their turn might brand with the reproach of persecution eight bishops whose names betray their barbaric origin abjured their errors and all the books of arian theology were reduced to ashes with the house in which they had been purposely collected the whole body of the visigoths and suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the catholic communion the faith at least of the rising generation was fervent and sincere

had been baptized should be constrained for the honor of the church to persevere in the external practice of a religion which they disbelieved and detested their frequent relapses provoked one of the successors of sisebut to banish the whole nation from his dominions and a council of toledo published a decree that every gothic king should swear to maintain this salutary edict but the tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims whom they delighted to torture or to deprive themselves of the industrious slaves over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression the jews still continued in

questions and new disputes and it was always in the power of an ambitious prelate or a fanatic monk to violate the peace of the church and perhaps of the empire the historian of the empire may overlook those disputes which were confined to the obscurity of schools and synods the manichaeans who labored to reconcile the religions of christ and of zoroaster had secretly introduced themselves

peace as well as in war and as soon as clovis had dismissed a synod of the gallican church he calmly assassinated all the princes of the merovingian race gregory l ii c  0     in tom ii p          after coolly relating the repeated crimes and affected remorse of clovis concludes perhaps undesignedly with a lesson which ambition will never hear his ita transactis obiit  yet the king of the franks might sincerely worship the christian god as a being more excellent and powerful than his national deities and the signal deliverance and victory of tolbiac encouraged clovis to confide in the future protection of the lord of hosts martin the most popular of the saints had filled the western world with the fame of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy sepulcher of tours his visible or invisible aid promoted the cause of a liberal and orthodox prince and the profane remark of clovis himself that st martin was an expensive friend after the gothic victory clovis made rich offerings to st martin of tours he wished to redeem his warhorse by the gift of one hundred pieces of gold but the enchanted steed could not move from the stable till the price of his redemption had been doubled this miracle provoked the king to exclaim vere b martinus est bonus in auxilio sed carus in negotio gesta francorum in tom ii p          need not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational skepticism but earth as well as heaven rejoiced in the conversion of the franks on the memorable day when clovis ascended from the baptismal font he alone in the christian world deserved the name and prerogatives of a catholic king the emperor anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning the nature of the divine incarnation and the barbarians of italy africa spain and gaul were involved in the arian heresy the eldest or rather the only son of the church was acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign or glorious deliverer and the arms of clovis were strenuously supported by the zeal and favor of the catholic faction see the epistle from pope anastasius to the royal convert in tom iv p  0    avitus bishop of vienna addressed clovis on the same subject p    and many of the latin bishops would assure him of their joy and attachment   under the roman empire the wealth and jurisdiction submission of the armoricans and the roman troops a d     etc of the bishops their sacred character and perpetual office their numerous dependents popular eloquence and provincial assemblies had rendered them always respectable and sometimes dangerous their influence was augmented with the progress of superstition and the establishment of the french monarchy may in some degree be ascribed to the firm alliance of an hundred prelates who reigned in the discontented or independent cities of gaul the slight foundations of the armorican republic had been repeatedly shaken or overthrown but the same people still guarded their domestic freedom asserted the dignity of the roman name and bravely resisted the predatory inroads and regular attacks of clovis who labored to extend his conquests from the seine to the loire their successful opposition introduced an equal and honorable union the franks esteemed the valor of the armoricans instead of the  an unknown people who now appear in the text of procopius hadrian de valois has restored the proper name of the  and this easy correction has been almost universally approved yet an unprejudiced reader would naturally suppose that procopius means to describe a tribe of germans in the alliance of rome and not a confederacy of gallic cities which had revolted from the empire  and the armoricans were reconciled by the religion of the franks the military force which had been stationed for the defense of gaul consisted of one hundred different bands of cavalry or infantry and these troops while they assumed the title and privileges of roman soldiers were renewed by an incessant supply of the barbarian youth the extreme fortifications and scattered fragments of the empire were still defended by their hopeless courage but their retreat was intercepted and their communication was impracticable they were abandoned by the greek princes of constantinople and they piously disclaimed all connection with the arian usurpers of gaul they accepted without shame or reluctance the generous capitulation which was proposed by a catholic hero and this spurious or legitimate progeny of the roman legions was distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms their ensigns and their peculiar dress and institutions but the national strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary accessions and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded the numbers as well as the spirit of the franks the reduction of the northern provinces of gaul instead of being decided by the chance of a single battle appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual operation of war and treaty and clovis acquired each object of his ambition by such efforts or such concessions as were adequate to its real value his savage character and the virtues of henry iv suggest the most opposite ideas of human nature yet some resemblance may be found in the situation of two princes who conquered france by their valor their policy and the merits of a seasonable conversion this important digression of procopius de bell gothic l i c    in tom ii p        illustrates the origin of the french monarchy yet i must observe   that the greek historian betrays an inexcusable ignorance of the

valiant and ambitious prince had reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of two brothers one of whom was the father of clotilda mascou hist of the germans xi  0 who very reasonably distrusts the testimony of gregory of tours has produced a passage from avitus epist v to prove that gundobald affected to deplore the tragic event which his subjects affected to applaud  but his imperfect prudence still permitted godegesil the youngest of his brothers to possess the dependent principality of geneva the arian monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction and the hopes which seemed to animate his clergy and people after the conversion of clovis and gundobald convened at lions an assembly of his bishops to reconcile if it were possible their religious and political discontents a vain conference was agitated between the two factions the arians upbraided the catholics with the worship of three gods the catholics defended their cause by theological distinctions and the usual arguments objections and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor till the king revealed his secret apprehensions by an abrupt but decisive question which he addressed to the orthodox bishops if you truly profess the christian religion why do you not restrain the king of the franks he has declared war against me and forms alliances with my enemies for my destruction a sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a sincere conversion let him show his faith by his works the answer of avitus bishop of vienna who spoke in the name of his brethren was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel we are ignorant of the motives and intentions of the king of the franks but we are taught by scripture that the kingdoms which abandon the divine law are frequently subverted and that enemies will arise on every side against those who have made god their enemy return with thy people to the law of god and he will give peace and security to thy dominions the king of burgundy who was not prepared to accept the condition which the catholics considered as essential to the treaty delayed and dismissed the ecclesiastical conference after reproaching his bishops that clovis their friend and proselyte had privately tempted the allegiance of his brother see the original conference in tom iv p      0  avitus the principal actor and probably the secretary of the meeting was bishop of vienna a short account of his person and works may be found in dupin bibliotheque ecclesiastique tom v p     0   the allegiance of his brother was already seduced victory of clovis a d  00 and the obedience of godegesil who joined the royal standard with the troops of geneva more effectually promoted the success of the conspiracy while the franks and burgundians contended with equal valor his seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle and as gundobald was faintly supported by the disaffected gauls he yielded to the arms of clovis and hastily retreated from the field which appears to have been situate between langres and dijon he distrusted the strength of dijon a quadrangular fortress encompassed by two rivers and by a wall thirty feet high and fifteen thick with four gates and thirtythree towers gregory of tours l iii c    in tom ii p     indulges his genius or rather transcribes some more eloquent writer in the description of dijon a castle which already deserved the title of a city it depended on the bishops of langres till the twelfth century and afterward became the capital of the dukes of burgundy longuerue description de la france part i p   0  he abandoned to the pursuit of clovis the important cities of lions and vienna and gundobald still fled with precipitation till he had reached avignon at the distance of two hundred and fifty miles from the field of battle a long siege and an artful negotiation admonished the king of the franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise he imposed a tribute on the burgundian prince compelled him to pardon and reward his brothers treachery and proudly returned to his own dominions with the spoils and captives of the southern provinces this splendid triumph was soon clouded by the intelligence that gundobald had violated his recent obligations and that the unfortunate godegesil who was left at vienna with a garrison of five thousand franks the epitomizer of gregory of tours in tom ii p  0  has supplied this number of franks but he rashly supposes that they were cut in pieces by gundobald the prudent burgundian spared the soldiers of clovis and sent these captives to the king of the visigoths who settled them in the territory of thoulouse  had been besieged surprised and massacred by his inhuman brother such an outrage might have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful sovereign yet the conqueror of gaul dissembled the injury released the tribute and accepted the alliance and military service of the king of burgundy clovis no longer possessed those advantages which had assured the success of the preceding war and his rival instructed by adversity had found new resources in the affections of his people the gauls or romans applauded the mild and impartial laws of gundobald which almost raised them to the same level with their conquerors the bishops were reconciled and flattered by the hopes which he artfully suggested of his approaching conversion and though he eluded their accomplishment to the last moment of his life his moderation secured the peace and suspended the ruin of the kingdom of burgundy in this burgundian war i have

embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth he received a severe admonition from one of his attendants it is not his situation o king it is thine which deserves pity and lamentation the reproaches of a guilty conscience were alleviated however by his liberal donations to the monastery of agaunum or st maurice in vallais which he himself had founded in honor of the imaginary martyrs of the thebaean legion before the end of the fifth century the church of st maurice and his thebaean legion had rendered agaunum a place of devout pilgrimage a promiscuous community of both sexes had introduced some

austere devotion of the monks and it was his humble prayer that heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of his sins his prayer was heard the avengers were at hand and the provinces of burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious franks after the event of an unsuccessful battle sigismond who wished to protract his life that he might prolong his penance concealed himself in the desert in a religious habit till he was discovered and betrayed by his subjects who solicited the favor of their new masters the captive monarch with his wife and two children was transported to orleans and buried alive in a deep well by the stern command of the sons of clovis whose cruelty might derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age their ambition which urged them to atchieve the conquest of burgundy was inflamed or disguised by filial piety and clotilda whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of injuries pressed them to revenge her fathers death

negotiation a personal interview of the two kings was proposed and accepted this conference of clovis and alaric was held in a small island of the loire near amboise they embraced familiarly conversed and feasted together and separated with the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love but their apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and treacherous designs and their mutual complaints solicited eluded and disclaimed a final arbitration at paris which he already considered as his royal seat clovis declared to an assembly of the princes and warriors the pretense and the motive of a gothic war it grieves me to see that the arians still possess the fairest portion of gaul let us march against them with the aid of god and having vanquished the heretics we will possess

and recent zeal applauded the generous design of their monarch expressed their resolution to conquer or die since death and conquest would be equally profitable and solemnly protested that they would never shave their beards till victory should absolve them from that inconvenient vow the enterprise was promoted by the public or private exhortations of clotilda she reminded her husband how effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the deity and his servants and the christian hero darting his battle axe with a skilful and nervous hand there said he on that spot where my

of gaul and he assumed or affected for that purpose the impartial character of a mediator but the sagacious monarch dreaded the rising empire of clovis and he was firmly engaged to support the

clovis a d  0  of the divine favor he marched from paris and as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy diocese of tours his anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine of st martin the sanctuary and the oracle of gaul his messengers were instructed to remark the words of the psalm which should happen to be chaunted at the precise moment when they entered the church those words most fortunately expressed the valor and victory of the champions of heaven and the application was easily transferred to the new joshua the new gideon who went forth to battle against the enemies of the lord this mode of divination by accepting as an omen the first sacred words which in particular circumstances should be presented to the eye or ear was derived from the pagans and the psalter or bible was substituted to the poems of homer and virgil from the fourth to the fourteenth century these sorts sanctorum as they are styled were repeatedly condemned by the decrees of councils and repeatedly practiced by kings bishops and saints see a curious dissertation of the abbe du resnel in the memoires de lacademie tom xix p        0  orleans secured to the franks a bridge on the loire but at the distance of forty miles from poitiers their progress was intercepted by an extraordinary swell of the river vigenna or vienne and the opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the visigoths delay must be always dangerous to barbarians who consume the country through which they march and had clovis possessed leisure and materials it might have been impracticable to construct a bridge or to force a passage in the face of a superior enemy but the affectionate peasants who were impatient to welcome their deliverer could easily betray some unknown or unguarded ford the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the useful interposition of fraud or fiction and a white heart of singular size and beauty appeared to guide and animate the march of the catholic army the counsels of the visigoths were irresolute and distracted a crowd of impatient warriors presumptuous in their strength and disdaining to sly before the robbers of germany excited alaric to assert in arms the name and blood of the conqueror of rome the advice of the graver chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardour of the franks and to expect in the southern provinces of gaul the veteran and victorious ostrogoths whom the king of italy had already sent to his assistance the decisive moments were wasted in idle deliberation the goths too hastily abandoned perhaps an advantageous post and the opportunity of a secure retreat was lost by their slow and disorderly motions after clovis had passed the ford as it is still named of the heart he advanced with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy his nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor suspended in the air above the cathedral of poitiers and this signal which might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of st hilary was compared to the column of fire that guided the israelites in the desert at the third hour of the day about ten miles beyond poitiers clovis overtook and instantly attacked the gothic army whose defeat was already prepared by terror and confusion yet they rallied in their extreme distress and the martial youths who had clamorously demanded the battle refused to survive the ignominy of flight the two kings encountered each other in single combat alaric fell by the hand of his rival and the victorious frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass and the vigor of his horse from the spears of two desperate goths who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of their sovereign the vague expression of a mountain of the slain serves to indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter but gregory has carefully observed that his valiant countryman apollinaris the son of sidonius lost his life at the head of the nobles of auvergne perhaps these suspected catholics had been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy and perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal attachment or military honor after correcting the text or excusing the mistake of procopius who places the defeat of alaric near carcassone we may conclude from the evidence of gregory fortunatus and the author of the gesta francorum that the battle was fought in campo vocladensi on the banks of the clain about ten miles to the south of poitiers clovis overtook and attacked the visigoths near vivonne and the victory was decided near a village still named champagne st hilaire see the dissertations of the abbe le boeuf tom i p  0         such is the empire of fortune if we may still conquest of aquitain by the franks a d  0  disguise our ignorance under that popular name that it is almost equally difficult to foresee the events of war or to explain their various consequences a bloody and complete victory has sometimes yielded no more than the possession of the field and the loss of ten thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy in a single day the work of ages the decisive battle of poitiers was followed by the conquest of aquitain alaric had left behind him an infant son a bastard competitor factious nobles and a disloyal people and the remaining forces of the goths were oppressed by the general consternation or opposed to each other in civil discord the victorious king of the franks proceeded without delay to the siege of angouleme at the sound of his trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of jericho and instantly fell to the ground a splendid miracle which may be reduced to the supposition that some clerical engineers had secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart angouleme is in the road from poitiers to bordeaux and although gregory delays the siege i can more readily believe that he confounded the order of history than that clovis neglected the rules of war  at bordeaux which had submitted without resistance clovis established his winter quarters and his prudent economy transported from thoulouse the royal treasures which were deposited in the capital of the monarchy the conqueror penetrated as far as the confines of spain pyrenaeos montes usque perpinianum subjecit is the expression of rorico which betrays his recent date since perpignan did not exist before the tenth century marca hispanica p     this florid and fabulous writer perhaps a monk of amiens see the abbe le boeuf mem de lacademie tom xvii p          relates in the allegorical character of a shepherd the general history of his countrymen the franks but his narrative ends with the death of clovis  restored the honors of the catholic church fixed in aquitain a colony of franks the author of the gesta francorum positively affirms that clovis fixed a body of franks in the saintonge and bourdelois and he is not injudiciously followed by rorico electos milites atque fortissimos cum parvulis utque mulieribus yet it should seem that they soon mingled with the romans of aquitain till charlemagne introduced a more numerous and powerful colony dubos hist critique tom ii p      and delegated to his lieutenants the easy task of subduing or extirpating the nation of the visigoths but the visigoths were protected by the wise and powerful monarch of italy while the balance was still equal theodoric had perhaps delayed the march of the ostrogoths but their strenuous efforts successfully resisted the ambition of clovis and the army of the franks and their burgundian allies was compelled to raise the siege of arles with the loss as it is said of thirty thousand men these vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of clovis to acquiesce in an advantageous treaty of peace the visigoths were suffered to retain the possession of septimania a narrow tract of seacoast from the rhone to the pyrenees but the ample province of aquitain from those mountains to the loire was indissolubly

ambitiously bestowed on consulship of clovis a d   0 the most powerful rival of theodoric the title and ensigns of that eminent dignity yet from some unknown cause the name of clovis has not been inscribed in the fasti either of the east or west the fasti of italy would naturally reject a consul the enemy of their sovereign but any ingenious hypothesis that might explain the silence of constantinople and egypt the chronicle of marcellinus and the paschal is overturned by the similar silence of marius bishop of avenche who composed his fasti in the kingdom of burgundy if the evidence of gregory of tours were less weighty and positive l ii c    in tom ii p     i could believe that clovis like odoacer received the lasting title and honors of patrician pagi critica tom ii p          on the solemn day the monarch of gaul placing a diadem on his head was invested in the church of st martin with a purple tunic and mantle from thence he proceeded on horseback to the cathedral of tours and as he passed through the streets profusely scattered with his own hand a donative of gold and silver to the joyful multitude who incessantly repeated their acclamations of consul and augustus the actual or legal authority of clovis could not receive any new accessions from the consular dignity it was a name a shadow an empty pageant and if the conqueror had been instructed to claim the ancient prerogatives of that high office they must have expired with the period of its annual duration but the romans were disposed to revere in the person of their master that antique title which the emperors condescended to assume the barbarian himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the majesty of the republic and the successors of theodosius by soliciting his friendship tacitly forgave and almost ratified the usurpation of gaul  twentyfive years after the death of clovis final establishment of the french monarchy in gaul a d     this important concession was more formally declared in a treaty between his sons and the emperor justinian the ostrogoths of italy unable to defend their distant acquisitions had resigned to the franks the cities of arles and marseilles of arles still adorned with the seat of a praetorian prefect and of marseilles enriched by the advantages of trade and navigation under the merovingian kings marseilles still imported from the east paper wine oil linen silk precious stones spices etc the gauls or franks traded to syria and the syrians were established in gaul see m de guignes mem de lacademie tom xxxvii p           this transaction was confirmed by the imperial authority and justinian generously yielding to the franks the sovereignty of the countries beyond the alps which they already possessed absolved the provincials from their allegiance and established on a more lawful though not more solid foundation the throne of the merovingians  this strong declaration of procopius de bell gothic l iii cap    in tom ii p    would almost suffice to justify the abbe dubos  from that era they enjoyed the right of celebrating at arles the games of the circus and by a singular privilege which was denied even to the persian monarch the gold coin impressed with their name and image obtained a legal currency in the empire the franks who probably used the mints of treves lions and arles imitated the coinage of the roman emperors of seventytwo solidi or pieces to the pound of gold but as the franks established only a decuple proportion of gold and silver ten shillings will be a sufficient valuation of their solidus of gold it was the common standard of the barbaric fines and contained forty denarii or silver threepences twelve of these denarii made a solidus or shilling the twentieth part of the ponderal and numeral livre or pound of silver which has been so strangely reduced in modern france see le blanc traite historique des monnoyes de france p        etc  a greek historian of that age has praised the private and public virtues of the franks with a partial enthusiasm which cannot be sufficiently justified by their domestic annals agathias in tom ii p    gregory of tours exhibits a very different picture perhaps it would not be easy within the same historical space to find more vice and less virtue we are continually shocked by the union of savage and corrupt manners  he celebrates their politeness and urbanity their regular government and orthodox religion and boldly asserts that these barbarians could be distinguished only by their dress and language from the subjects of rome perhaps the franks already displayed the social disposition and lively graces which in every age have disguised their vices and sometimes concealed their intrinsic merit perhaps agathias and the greeks were dazzled by the rapid progress of their arms and the splendor of their empire since the conquest of burgundy gaul except the gothic province of septimania was subject in its whole extent to the sons of clovis they had extinguished the german kingdom of thuringia and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the rhine into the heart of their native forests the alemanni and bavarians who had occupied the roman provinces of rhaetia and noricum to the south of the danube confessed themselves the humble vassals of the franks and the feeble barrier of the alps was incapable of resisting their ambition when the last survivor of the sons of clovis united the inheritance and conquests of the merovingians his kingdom extended far beyond the limits of modern france yet modern france such has

dissertation mem de lacademie tom viii p  0       the extent and limits of the french monarchy   the franks or french are the only people of political controversy europe who can deduce a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the western empire but their conquest of gaul was followed by ten centuries of anarchy and ignorance on the revival of learning the students who had been formed in the schools of athens and rome disdained their barbarian ancestors and a long period elapsed before patient labor could provide the requisite materials to satisfy or rather to excite the curiosity of more enlightened times the abbe dubos histoire critique tom i p        has truly and agreeably represented the slow progress of these studies and he observes that gregory of tours was only once printed before the year    0 according to the complaint of heineccius opera tom iii sylloge iii p     etc germany received with indifference and contempt the codes of barbaric laws which were published by heroldus lindenbrogius etc at present those laws as far as they relate to gaul the history of gregory of tours and all the monuments of the merovingian race appear in a pure and perfect state in the first four volumes of the historians of france  at length the eye of criticism and philosophy was directed to the antiquities of france but even philosophers have been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and passion the most extreme and exclusive systems of the personal servitude of the gauls or of their voluntary and equal alliance with the franks have been rashly conceived and obstinately defended and the intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring against the prerogative of the crown the dignity of the nobles or the freedom of the people yet the sharp conflict has usefully exercised the adverse powers of learning and genius and each antagonist alternately vanquished and victorious has extirpated some ancient errors and established some interesting truths an impartial stranger instructed by their discoveries their disputes and even their faults may describe from the same original materials the state of the roman provincials after gaul had

much instruction from two learned works of heineccius the history and the elements of the germanic law in a judicious preface to the elements he considers and tries to excuse the defects of that barbarous jurisprudence  before the election of the merovingian kings the most powerful tribe or nation of the franks appointed four venerable chieftains to compose the salic laws latin appears to have been the original language of the salic law it was probably composed in the beginning of the fifth century before the era a d     of the real or fabulous pharamond the preface mentions the four cantons which produced the four legislators and many provinces franconia saxony hanover brabant etc have claimed them as their own see an excellent dissertation of heineccius de lege salica tom iii sylloge iii p           and their labors were examined and approved in three successive assemblies of the people after the baptism of clovis he reformed several articles that appeared incompatible with christianity the salic law was again amended by his sons and at length under the reign of dagobert the code was revised and promulgated in its actual form one hundred years after the establishment of the french monarchy within the same period the customs of the ripuarians were transcribed and published and charlemagne himself the legislator of his age and country had accurately studied the two national laws which still prevailed among the franks eginhard in vit caroli magni c    in tom v p  00 by these two laws most critics understand the salic and the ripuarian the former extended from the carbonarian forest to the loire tom iv p     and the latter might be obeyed from the same forest to the rhine tom iv p      the same care was extended to their vassals and the rude institutions of the alemanni and bavarians were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme authority of the merovingian kings the visigoths and burgundians whose conquests in gaul preceded those of the franks showed less impatience to attain one of the principal benefits of civilized society euric was the first of the gothic princes who expressed in writing the manners and customs of his people and the composition of the burgundian laws was a measure of policy rather than of justice to alleviate the yoke and regain the affections of their gallic subjects consult the ancient and modern prefaces of the several codes in the fourth volume of the historians of france the original prologue to the salic law expresses though in a foreign dialect the genuine spirit of the franks more forcibly than the ten books of gregory of tours  thus by a singular coincidence the germans framed their artless institutions at a time when the elaborate system of roman jurisprudence was finally consummated in the salic laws and the pandects of justinian we may compare the first rudiments and the full maturity of civil wisdom and whatever prejudices may be suggested in favor of barbarism our calmer reflections will ascribe to the romans the superior advantages not only of science and reason but of humanity and justice yet the laws of the barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires their occupations and their capacity and they all contributed to preserve the peace and promote the improvements of the society for whose use they were originally established the merovingians instead of imposing an uniform rule of conduct on their various subjects permitted each people and each family of their empire freely to enjoy their domestic institutions the ripuarian law declares and defines this indulgence in favor of the plaintiff tit xxxi in tom iv p   0 and the same toleration is understood or expressed in all the codes except that of the visigoths of spain tanta diversitas legum says agobard in the ninth century quanta non solum in regionibus aut civitatibus sed etiam in multis domibus habetur nam plerumque contingit ut simul eant aut sedeant quinque homines et nullus eorum communem legem cum altero habeat in tom vi p     he foolishly proposes to introduce an uniformity of law as well as of faith  nor were the romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal toleration inter romanos negotia causarum romany legibus praecipimus terminari such are the words of a general constitution promulgated by clotaire the son of clovis and sole monarch of the franks in tom iv p     about the year   0  the children embraced the law of their parents the wife that of her husband the freedman that of his patron and in all causes where the parties were of different nations the plaintiff or accuser was obliged to follow the tribunal of the defendant who may always plead a judicial presumption of right or innocence a more ample latitude was allowed if every citizen in the presence of the judge might declare the law under which he desired to live and the national society to which he chose to belong such an indulgence would abolish the partial distinctions of victory and the roman provincials might patiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condition since it depended on themselves to assume the privilege if they dared to assert the character of free and warlike barbarians this liberty of choice has been aptly deduced esprit des loix l xxviii   from a constitution of lothaire i leg langobard l ii tit lvii in codex lindebrog p     though the example is too recent and partial from a various reading in the salic law tit xliv not xlv the abbe de mably tom i p   0      has conjectured that at first a barbarian only and afterward any man consequently a roman might live according to the law of the franks i am sorry to offend this ingenious conjecture by observing that the stricter sense barbarum is expressed in the reformed copy of charlemagne which is confirmed by the royal and wolfenbuttle mss the looser interpretation hominem is authorized only by the ms of fulda from whence heroldus published his edition see the four original toxts of the salic law in tom iv p               0   when justice inexorably requires the death of pecuniary fines for homicide a murderer each private citizen is fortified by the assurance that the laws the magistrate and the whole community are the guardians of his personal safety but in the loose society of the germans revenge was always honorable and often meritorious the independent warrior chastised or vindicated with his own hand the injuries which he had offered or received and he had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions the magistrate conscious of his weakness interposed not to punish but to reconcile and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been ascertained as the price of blood in the heroic times of greece the guilt of murder was expiated by a pecuniary satisfaction to the family of the deceased feithius antiquitat homeric l ii c   heineccius in his preface to the elements of germanic law favorably suggests that at rome and athens homicide was only punished with exile it is true but exile was a capital punishment for a citizen of rome or athens  the fierce spirit of the franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence the same fierceness despised these ineffectual restraints and when their simple manners had been corrupted by the wealth of gaul the public peace was continually violated by acts of hasty or deliberate guilt in every just government the same penalty is inflicted or at least is imposed for the murder of a peasant or a prince but the national inequality established by the franks in their criminal proceedings was the last insult and abuse of conquest this proportion is fixed by the salic tit xliv in tom iv p     and the ripuarian tit vii xi xxxvi in tom iv p         laws but the latter does not distinguish any difference of romans yet the orders of the clergy are placed above the franks themselves and the burgundians and alemanni between the franks and the romans  in the calm moments of legislation they solemnly pronounced that the life of a roman was of smaller value than that of a barbarian the antrustion the antrustiones qui in trust dominica sunt leudi fideles undoubtedly represent the first order of franks but it is a question whether their rank was personal or hereditary the abbe de mably tom i p          is not displeased to mortify the pride of birth esprit l xxx c    by dating the origin of french nobility from the reign of clotaire ii a d      a name expressive of the most illustrious birth or dignity among the franks was appreciated at the sum of six hundred pieces of gold while the noble provincial who was admitted to the kings table might be legally murdered at the expense of three hundred pieces two hundred were deemed sufficient for a frank of ordinary condition but the meaner romans were exposed to disgrace and danger by a trifling compensation of one hundred or even fifty pieces of gold had these laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason the public protection should have supplied in just proportion the want of personal strength but the legislator had weighed in the scale not of justice but of policy the loss of a soldier against that of a slave the head of an insolent and rapacious barbarian was guarded by an heavy fine and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenseless subjects time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and the patience of the vanquished and the boldest citizen was taught by experience that he might suffer more injuries than he could inflict as the manners of the franks became less ferocious their laws were rendered more severe and the merovingian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigor of the visigoths and burgundians see the burgundian laws tit ii in tom iv p     the code of the visigoths l vi tit v in tom iv p     and the constitution of childebert not of paris but most evidently of austrasia in tom iv p     their premature severity was sometimes rash and excessive childebert condemned not only murderers but robbers quomodo sine lege involavit sine lege moriatur and even the negligent judge was involved in the same sentence the visigoths abandoned an unsuccessful surgeon to the family of his deceased patient ut quod de eo facere voluerint habeant potestatem l xi tit i in tom iv p      under the empire of charlemagne murder was universally punished with death and the use of capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the jurisprudence of modern europe see in the sixth volume of the works of heineccius the elementa juris germanici l ii p ii no           0      yet some vestiges of these pecuniary compositions for murder have been traced in germany as late as the sixteenth century   the civil and military professions which had judgments of god been separated by constantine were again united by the barbarians the harsh sound of the teutonic appellations was mollified into the latin titles of duke of count or of prefect and the same officer assumed within his district the command of the troops and the administration of justice the whole subject of the germanic judges and their jurisdiction is copiously treated by heineccius element jur germ l iii no       i cannot find any proof that under the merovingian race the scabini or assessors were chosen by the people  but the fierce and illiterate chieftain was seldom qualified to discharge the duties of a judge which require all the faculties of a philolophic mind laboriously cultivated by experience and study and his rude ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple and visible methods of ascertaining the cause of justice in every religion the deity has been invoked to confirm the truth or to punish the falsehood of human testimony but this powerful instrument was misapplied and abused by the simplicity of the german legislators the party accused might justify his innocence by producing before their tribunal a number of friendly witnesses who solemnly declared their belief or assurance that he was not guilty according to the weight of the charge this legal number of compurgators was multiplied seventytwo voices were required to absolve an incendiary or assassin and when the chastity of a queen of france was suspected three hundred gallant nobles swore without hesitation that the infant prince had been actually begotten by her deceased husband gregor turon l viii c   in tom ii p     montesquieu observes esprit des loix l xxviii c    that the salic law did not admit these negative proofs so universally established in the barbaric codes yet this obscure concubine fredegundis who became the wife of the grandson of clovis must have followed the salic law  the sin and scandal of manifest and frequent perjuries engaged the magistrates to remove these dangerous temptations and to supply the defects of human testimony by the famous experiments of fire and water these extraordinary trials were so capriciously contrived that in some cases guilt and innocence in others could not be proved without the interposition of a miracle such miracles were readily provided by fraud and credulity the most intricate causes were determined by this easy and infallible method and the turbulent barbarians who might have disdained the sentence of the magistrate submissively acquiesced in the judgment of god muratori in the antiquities of italy has given two dissertations xxxviii xxxix on the judgments of god it was expected that fire would not burn the innocent and that the pure element of water would not allow the guilty to sink into its bosom   but the trials by single combat gradually obtained judicial combats superior credit and authority among a warlike people who could not believe that a brave man deserved to suffer or that a coward deserved to live montesquieu esprit des loix l xxviii c    has condescended to explain and excuse la maniere de penser de nos peers on the subject of judicial combats he follows this strange institution from the age of gundobald to that of st lewis and the philosopher is sometimes lost in the legal antiquarian  both in civil and criminal proceedings the plaintiff or accuser the defendant or even the witness were exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs and it was incumbent on them either to desert their cause or publicly to maintain their honor in the lists of battle they fought either on foot or on horseback according to the custom of their nation in a memorable duel at aixlachapelle a d   0 before the emperor lewis the pious his biographer observes secundum legem propriam utpote quia uterque

which was unknown to the franks  and the decision of the sword or lance was ratified by the sanction of heaven of the judge and of the people this sanguinary law was introduced into gaul by the burgundians and their legislator gundobald in his original edict published at lions a d  0  gundobald establishes and justifies the use of judicial combat leg burgund tit xlv in tom ii p         three hundred years afterward agobard bishop of lions solicited lewis the pious to abolish the law of an arian tyrant in tom vi p          he relates the conversation of gundobald and avitus condescended to answer the complaints and objections of his subject avitus is it not true said the king of burgundy to the bishop that the event of national wars and private combats is directed by the judgment of god and that his providence awards the victory to the juster cause by such prevailing arguments the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels which had been peculiar to some tribes of germany was propagated and established in all the monarchies of europe from sicily to the baltic at the end of ten centuries the reign of legal violence was not totally extinguished and the ineffectual censures of saints of popes and of synods may seem to prove that the influence of superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason and humanity the tribunals were stained with the blood perhaps of innocent and respectable citizens the law which now favors the rich then yielded to the strong and the old the feeble and the infirm were condemned either to renounce their fairest claims and possessions to sustain the dangers of an unequal conflict accidit says agobard ut non solum valentes viribus sed etiam infirmi et senes lacessantur ad pugnam etiam pro vilissimis rebus quibus foralibus certaminibus contingunt homicidia injusta et crudeles ac perversi eventus judiciorum like a prudent rhetorician he suppresses the legal privilege of hiring champions  or to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary champion this oppressive jurisprudence was imposed on the provincials of gaul who complained of any injuries in their persons and property whatever might be the strength or courage of individuals the victorious barbarians excelled in the love and exercise of arms and the vanquished roman was unjustly summoned to repeat in his own person the bloody contest which had been already decided against his country montesquien esprit des loix xxviii c    who understands why the judicial combat was admitted by the burgundians ripuarians alemanni bavarians lombards thuringians frisons and saxons is satisfied and agobard seems to countenance the assertion that it was not allowed by the salic law yet the same custom at least in cases of treason is mentioned by ermoldus nigellus l iii     in tom vi p    and the anonymous biographer of lewis the pious c    in tom vi p     as the mos antiquus francorum more francis solito etc expressions too general to exclude the noblest of their tribes   a devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand germans had formerly passed the rhine division of lands by the barbarians under the command of ariovistus one third part of the fertile lands of the sequani was appropriated to their use and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third for the accommodation of a new colony of twentyfour thousand barbarians whom he had invited to share the rich harvest of gaul caesar de bell gall l i c    in tom i p      at the distance of five hundred years the visigoths and burgundians who revenged the defeat of ariovistus usurped the same unequal proportion of two thirds of the subject lands but this distribution instead of spreading over the province may be reasonably confined to the peculiar districts where the victorious people had been planted by their own choice or by the policy of their leader in these districts each barbarian was connected by the ties of hospitality with some roman provincial to this unwelcome guest the proprietor was compelled to abandon twothirds of his patrimony but the german a shepherd and a hunter might sometimes content himself with a spacious range of wood and pasture and resign the smallest though most valuable portion to the toil of the industrious husbandman the obseure hints of a division of lands occasionally scattered in the laws of the burgundians tit live no     in tom iv p         and visigoths l x tit i no        in tom iv p           0 are skilfully explained by the president montesquieu esprit des loix l xxx c       i shall only add that among the goths the division seems to have been ascertained by the judgment of the neighborhood that the barbarians frequently usurped the remaining third and that the romans might recover their right unless they were barred by a prescription of fifty years  the silence of ancient and authentic testimony has encouraged an opinion that the rapine of the franks was not moderated or disguised by the forms of a legal division that they dispersed themselves over the provinces of gaul without order or control and that each victorious robber according to his wants his avarice and his strength measured with his sword the extent of his new inheritance at a distance from their sovereign the barbarians might indeed be tempted to exercise such arbitrary depredation but the firm and artful policy of clovis must curb a licentious spirit which would aggravate the misery of the vanquished whilst it corrupted the union and discipline of the conquerors the memorable vase of soissons is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the gallic spoils it was the duty and the interest of clovis to provide rewards for a successful army and settlements for a numerous people without inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on the loyal catholics of gaul the ample fund which he might lawfully acquire of the imperial patrimony vacant lands and gothic usurpations would diminish the cruel necessity of seizure and confiscation and the humble provincials would more patiently acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of their loss it is singular enough that the president de montesquieu esprit des loix l xxx c   and the abbe de mably observations tom i p       agree in this strange supposition of arbitrary and private rapine the count de boulainvilliers etat de la france tom i p       shows a strong understanding through a cloud of ignorance and prejudice   the wealth of the merovingian princes consisted in their extensive domain after the conquest of gaul they still delighted in the rustic domain and benefices of the merovingians simplicity of their ancestors the cities were abandoned to solitude and decay and their coins their charters and their synods are still inscribed with the names of the villas or rural palaces in which they successively resided one hundred and sixty of these palaces a title which need not excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury were scattered through the provinces of their kingdom and if some might claim the honors of a fortress the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of profitable farms the mansion of the longhaired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and stables for the cattle and the poultry the garden was planted with useful vegetables the various trades the labors of agriculture and even the arts of hunting and fishing were exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign his magazines were filled with corn and wine either for sale or consumption and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest maxims of private economy see the rustic edict or rather code of charlemagne which contains seventy distinct and minute regulations of that great monarch in tom v p          he requires an account of the horns and skins of the goats allows his fish to be sold and carefully directs that the larger villas capitaneae shall maintain one hundred hens and thirty geese and the smaller mansionales fifty hens and twelve geese mabillon de re diplomatica has investigated the names the number and the situation of the merovingian villas  this ample patrimony was appropriated to supply the hospitable plenty of clovis and his successors and to reward the fidelity of their brave companions who both in peace and war were devoted to their personal service instead of an horse or a suit of armor each companion according to his rank or merit or favor was invested with a benefice the primitive name and most simple form of the feudal possessions these gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of the sovereign and his feeble prerogative derived some support from the influence of his liberality but this dependent tenure was gradually abolished from a passage of the burgundian law tit i no   in tom iv p     it is evident that a deserving son might expect to hold the lands which his father had received from the royal bounty of gundobald the burgundians would firmly maintain their privilege and their example might encourage the beneficiaries of france by the independent and rapacious nobles of france who established the perpetual property and hereditary succession of their benefices a revolution salutary to the earth which had been injured or neglected by its precarious masters the revolutions of the benefices and siess are clearly fixed by the abbe de mably his accurate distinction of times gives him a merit to which even montesquieu is a stranger  besides these royal and beneficiary estates a large proportion had been assigned in the division of gaul of allodial and salic lands they were exempt from tribute and the salic lands were equally shared among the male descendants of the franks see the salic law tit lxii in tom iv p     the origin and nature of these salic lands which in times of ignorance were perfectly understood now perplex our most learned and sagacious critics   in the bloody discord and silent decay of the merovingian line a new order of tyrants arose in the provinces who under the appellation of seniors private usurpations or lords usurped a right to govern and a license to oppress the subjects of their peculiar territory their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an equal but the laws were extinguished and the sacrilegious barbarians who dared to provoke the

transaction irrecoverably fixed their own condition and that of their latest posterity from the reign of clovis during five successive centuries the laws and manners of gaul uniformly tended to promote the increase and to confirm the duration of personal servitude time and violence almost obliterated the intermediate ranks of society and left an obscure and narrow interval between the noble and the slave this arbitrary and recent division has been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national distinction universally established by the arms and the laws of the merovingians the nobles

quantity of poultry his wishes should be satisfied the master who already aspired to the merit of elegant hospitality assumed as his own the praise which the voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook and the dextrous leo insensibly acquired the trust and management of his household after the patient expectation of a whole year he cautiously whispered his design to attalus and exhorted him

energy and refinement decedente atque immo potius pereunte ab urbibus gallicanis liberalium cultura literarum etc in praefat in tom ii p     is the complaint of gregory himself which he fully verifies by his own work his style is equally devoid of elegance and simplicity in a conspicuous station he still remained a stranger to his own age and country and in a prolix work the five last books contain ten years he has omitted almost every thing that posterity desires to learn i have tediously acquired by a painful perusal the right of pronouncing this unfavourable sentence   we are now qualified to despise the opposite privileges of the romans of gaul and perhaps artful misrepresentations which have softened or exaggerated the oppression of the romans of gaul under the reign of the merovingians the conquerors never promulgated any universal edict of servitude or confiscation but a degenerate people who excused their weakness by the specious names of politeness and peace was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious barbarians who contemptuously insulted their possessions their freedom and their safety their personal injuries were partial and irregular but the great body of the romans survived the revolution and still preserved the property and privileges of citizens a large portion of their lands was exacted for the use of the franks but they enjoyed the remainder exempt from tribute the abbe de mably tom i p          has diligently confirmed this opinion of the president de montesquieu esprit des loix l xxx c     and the same irresistible violence which swept away the arts and manufactures of gaul destroyed the elaborate and expensive system of imperial despotism the provincials must frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the salic or ripuarian laws but their private life in the important concerns of marriage testaments or inheritance was still regulated by the theodosian code and a discontented roman might freely aspire or descend to the title and character of a barbarian the honors of the state were accessible to his ambition the education and temper of the romans more peculiarly qualified them for the offices of civil government and as soon as emulation had rekindled their military ardour they were permitted to march in the ranks or even at the head of the victorious germans i shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates whose names see dubos hist critique de la monarchy francoise tom ii l vi c    0 the french antiquarians establish as a principle that the romans and barbarians may be distinguished by their names

even from the orders of the church see fleury discourse iii sur lhistoire ecclesiastique  the clergy of gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials the haughty franks fell prostrate at the feet of their subjects who were dignified with the episcopal character and the power and riches which had been lost in war were insensibly recovered by superstition the bishop of tours himself has

tom ii p      in all temporal affairs the theodosian code was the universal law of the clergy but the barbaric jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety a subdeacon was equivalent

ripuarian code tit xxxvi in tom iv p     the salic law does not provide for the safety of the clergy and we might suppose on the behalf of the more civilized tribe that they had not foreseen such an

through the medium of the romance has gradually been polished into the actual form of the french language under the carlovingian race the kings and nobles of france still understood the dialect of their german ancestors  but their language and their religion had alike degenerated from the simple purity of the augustan and apostolic age the progress of superstition and barbarism was rapid and universal the worship of the saints concealed from vulgar eyes the god of the christians and the rustic dialect of peasants and soldiers was corrupted by a teutonic idiom and pronunciation yet such intercourse of sacred and social communion eradicated the distinctions of birth and victory and the nations of gaul were gradually confounded under the name and government of the franks  the franks after they mingled with their anarchy of the franks gallic subjects might have imparted the most valuable of human gifts a spirit and system of constitutional liberty under a king hereditary but

polished and improved by the civil wisdom of the romans but the careless barbarians secure of their personal independence disdained the labor of government the annual assemblies of the month of march were silently abolished and the nation was separated and almist dissolved by the conquest of gaul see the abbe de mably observations etc tom i p        it should seem that the institution of national assemblies which are coeval with the french nation have never been congenial to its temper  the monarchy was left without any regular establishment of justice of arms or of revenue the successors of clovis wanted resolution to assume or strength to exercise the legislative and executive powers which the people had abdicated the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample privilege of rapine and murder and the love of freedom so often invigorated and disgraced by private ambition was reduced among the licentious franks to the contempt of order and the desire of impunity seventyfive years after the death of clovis his grandson gontran king of burgundy sent an army to invade the gothic possessions of septimania or languedoc the troops of burgundy berry auvergne and the adjacent territories were excited by the hopes of spoil they marched without discipline under the banners of german or gallic counts their attack was feeble and unsuccessful but the friendly and hostile provinces were desolated with indiscriminate rage the cornfieldsd the villages the churches themselves were consumed by fire the inhabitants were massacred or dragged into captivity and in the disorderly retreat five thousand of these inhuman savages were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord when the pious gontran reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders and threatened to inflict not a legal sentence but instant and arbitrary execution they accused the universal and incurable corruption of the people no one they said any longer fears or respects his king his duke or his count each man loves to do evil and freely indulges his criminal inclinations the most gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult and the rash magistrate who presumes to censure or restrain

odious abuse of freedom and to supply its loss by the spirit of honor and humanity which now alleviates and dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign  the visigoths had resigned to clovis the the visigoths of spain greatest part of their gallic possessions but their loss was amply compensated by the easy conquest and secure enjoyment of the provinces of spain from the monarchy of the goths which soon involved the suevic kingdom of galicia the modern spaniards still derive some national vanity but the historian of the roman empire is neither invited nor compelled to pursue the obscure and barren series of their annals spain in these dark ages has been peculiarly unfortunate the franks had a gregory of tours the saxons or angles a bid the lombards a paul warnefrid etc but the history of the visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect chronicles of isidore of seville and john of biclar  the goths of spain were separated from the rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the pyrenaean mountains their manners and institutions as far as they were common to the germanic tribes have been already explained i have anticipated in the preceding chapter the most important of their ecclesiastical events the fall of arianism and the persecution of the jews and it only remains to observe some interesting circumstances which relate to the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the spanish kingdom  after their conversion from idolatry or heresy legislative assemblies of spain the franks and the visigoths were disposed to embrace with equal submission the inherent evils and the accidental benefits of superstition but the prelates of france long before the extinction of the merovingian race had degenerated into fighting and hunting barbarians they disdained the use of synods forgot the laws of temperance and chastity and preferred the indulgence of private ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal profession such are the complaints of st boniface the apostle of germany and the reformer of gaul in tom iv p    the fourscore years which he deplores of license and corruption would seem to insinuate that the barbarians were admitted into the clergy about the year   0  the bishops of spain respected themselves and were respected by the public their indissoluble union disguised their vices and confirmed their authority and the regular discipline of the church introduced peace order and stability into the government of the state from the reign of recared the first catholic king to that of witiza the immediate predecessor of the unfortunate roderic sixteen national councils were successively convened the six metropolitans toledo seville merida braga tarragona and narbonne presided according to their respective seniority the assembly was composed of their suffragan bishops who appeared in person or by their proxies and a place was assigned to the most holy or opulent of the spanish abbots during the first three days of the convocation as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical questions of doctrine and discipline the profane laity was excluded from their debates which were conducted however with decent solemnity but on the morning of the fourth day the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the palace the dukes and counts of the provinces the judges of the cities and the gothic nobles and the decrees of heaven were ratified by the consent of the people the same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies the annual synods which were empowered to hear complaints and to redress grievances and a legal government was supported by the prevailing influence of the spanish clergy the bishops who in each revolution were prepared to flatter the victorious and to insult the prostrate labored with diligence and success to kindle the flames of persecution and to exalt the mitre above the crown yet the national councils of toledo in which the free spirit of the barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal policy have established some prudent laws for the common benefit of the king and people the vacancy of the throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and palatines and after the failure of the line of alaric the regal dignity was still limited to the pure and noble blood of the goths the clergy who anointed their lawful prince always recommended and sometimes practiced the duty of allegiance and the spiritual censures were denounced on the heads of the impious subjects who should resist his authority conspire against his life or violate by an indecent union the chastity even of his widow but the monarch himself when he ascended the throne was bound by a reciprocal oath to god and his people that he would faithfully execute his important trust the real or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to the control of a powerful aristocracy and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a fundamental privilege that they should not be degraded imprisoned tortured nor punished with death exile or confiscation unless by the free and public judgment of their peers the acts of the councils of toledo are still the most authentic records of the church and constitution of spain the following passages are particularly important iii       iv    v           vi                   vii   xiii       i have found mascou hist of the ancient germans xv    and annotations xxvi and xxxiii and ferreras hist generale de lespagne tom ii very useful and accurate guides   one of these legislative councils of toledo code of the visigoths examined and ratified the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of gothic kings from the fierce euric to the devout egica as long as the visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors they indulged their subjects of aquitain and spain in the enjoyment of the roman law their gradual improvement in arts in policy and at length in religion encouraged them to imitate and to supersede these foreign institutions and to compose a code of civil and criminal jurisprudence for the use of a great and united people the same obligations and the same privileges were communicated to the nations of the spanish monarchy and the conquerors insensibly renouncing the teutonic idiom submitted to the restraints of equity and exalted the romans to the participation of freedom the merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation of spain under the reign of the visigoths the provincials were long separated from their arian masters by the irreconcilable difference of religion after the conversion of recared had removed the prejudices of the catholics the coasts both of the ocean and mediterranean were still possessed by the eastern emperors who secretly excited a discontented people to reject the yoke of the barbarians and to assert the name and dignity of roman citizens the allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually secured by their own persuasion that they hazard more in a revolt than they can hope to obtain by a revolution but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom we hate and fear that the contrary system well deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation the code of the visigoths regularly divided into twelve books has been correctly published by dom bouquet in tom iv p        0 it has been treated by the president de montesquieu esprit des loix l xxviii c   with excessive severity i dislike the style i detest the superstition but i shall presume to think that the civil jurisprudence displays a more civilized and enlightened state of society than that of the burgundians or even of the lombards   while the kingdoms of the franks and visigoths revolution of britain were established in gaul and spain the saxons achieved the conquest of britain the third great diocese of the praefecture of the west since britain was already separated from the roman empire i might without reproach decline a story familiar to the most illiterate and obscure to the most learned of my readers the saxons who excelled in the use of the oar or the battleaxe were ignorant of the art

britain had indeed been unknown to the saxons the measure of its calamities would have been less complete but the strength of the roman government could not always guard the maritime province against the pirates of germany the independent and divided states were exposed to their attacks and the saxons might sometimes join the scots and the picts in a tacit or express confederacy of rapine and destruction vortigern could only balance the various perils which assaulted on every side his throne and his people and his policy may deserve either praise or excuse if he preferred the alliance of those barbarians whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous enemies and the most serviceable allies hengist and horsa as they ranged along the eastern coast with three ships were engaged by the promise of an ample stipend to embrace the defense of britain and their intrepid valor soon delivered the country from the caledonian invaders the isle of thanet a secure and fertile district was allotted for the residence of these german auxiliaries and they were supplied according to the treaty with a plentiful allowance of clothing and provisions this favorable reception encouraged five thousand warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels and the infant power of hengist was fortified by this strong and seasonable reinforcement the crafty barbarian suggested to

the orkneys and disembarked a new army on the coast of northumberland or lothian at the opposite extremity of the devoted land it was easy to foresee but it was impossible to prevent the impending evils the two nations were soon divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies the saxons magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an ungrateful people while the britons regretted the liberal rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty mercenaries the causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irreconcilable quarrel the saxons flew to arms and if they perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a feast the destroyed the reciprocal confidence which sustains the intercourse of peace and war nennius imputes to the saxons the murder of

the elbe the weser and the rhine were principally composed of three valiant tribes or nations of germany the jutes the old saxons and the angles the jutes who fought under the peculiar banner of hengist assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the paths of glory and of erecting in kent the first independent kingdom the fame of the enterprise was attributed to the primitive saxons and the common laws and language of the conquerors are described by the national appellation of a people which at the end of four hundred years produced the first monarchs of south britain the angles were distinguished by their numbers and their success and they claimed the honor of fixing a perpetual name on the country of which they occupied the most ample portion the barbarians who followed the hopes of rapine either on the land or sea were insensibly blended with this triple confederacy the frisians who had been tempted by their vicinity to the british shores might balance during a short

smartly exposed this glaring absurdity which had passed unnoticed by the general historians as they were hastening to more interesting and important events  under the long dominion of the emperors britain had been insensibly molded into the elegant and servile form of a roman province whose safety was entrusted to a foreign power the subjects of honorius contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution and their uncertain rulers wanted either skill or courage or authority to direct the public force against the common enemy the introduction of the saxons betrayed their internal weakness and degraded the character both of the prince and people their consternation magnified the danger the want of union diminished their resources and the madness of civil factions was more solicitous to accuse than to remedy the evils which they imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries yet the britons were not ignorant they could not be ignorant of the manufacture or the use of arms the successive and disorderly attacks of the saxons allowed them to recover from their amazement and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added discipline and experience to their native valor  while the continent of europe and africa their resistance yielded without resistance to the barbarians the british island alone and unaided maintained a long a vigorous though an unsuccessful struggle against the formidable pirates who almost at the same instant assaulted the northern the eastern and the southern coasts the cities which had been fortified with skill were defended with resolution the advantages of ground hills forests and morasses were diligently improved by the inhabitants the conquest of each district was purchased with blood and the defeats of the saxons are strongly attested by the discreet silence of their annalist hengist might hope to atchieve the conquest of britain but his ambition in an active reign of thirtyfive years was confined to the possession of kent and the numerous colony which he had planted in the north was extirpated by the sword of the britons the monarchy of the west saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of three martial generations the life of cerdic one of the bravest of the children of woden was consumed in the conquest of hampshire and the isle of

encountered with their short swords the long lances of the britons and maintained an equal conflict till the approach of night two decisive victories the death of three british kings and the reduction

angles and their various confederates advanced from the north from the east and from the south till their victorious banners were united in the center of the island beyond the severn the britons still asserted their national freedom which survived the heptarchy and even the monarchy of the saxons the bravest warriors who preferred exile to slavery found a secure refuge in the mountains of wales the reluctant submission of cornwall was delayed for some ages cornwall was finally subdued by athelstan a d          who planted an english colony at exeter and confined the britons beyond the river

king or general of the nation according to the most rational account he defeated in twelve successive battles the angles of the north and the saxons of the west but the declining age of the hero was embittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes the events of his life are less interesting than the singular revolutions of his fame during a period of five hundred years the tradition of his exploits was preserved and rudely embellished by the obscure bards of wales and armorica who were odious to the saxons and unknown to the rest of mankind the pride and curiosity of the norman conquerors prompted them to enquire into the ancient history of britain they listened with fond credulity to the tale of arthur and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince who had triumphed over the saxons their common enemies his romance transcribed in the latin of jeffrey of monmouth and afterward translated into the fashionable idiom of the times was enriched with the various though incoherent ornaments which were familiar to the experience the learning or the fancy of the twelfth century the progress of a phrygian colony from the tyber to the thames was easily engrafted on the fable of the aeneid and the royal ancestors of arthur derived their origin from troy and claimed their alliance with the caesars his trophies were decorated with captive provinces and imperial titles and his danish victories avenged the recent injuries of his country the gallantry and superstition of the british hero his feasts and tournaments and the memorable institution of his knights of the round table were faithfully copied from the reigning manners of chivalry and the fabulous exploits of uthers son appear less incredible than the adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valor of the normans pilgrimage and the holy wars introduced into europe the specious miracles of arabian magic fairies and giants flying dragons and enchanted palaces were blended with the more simple sictions of the west and the fate of britain depended on the art or the predictions of merlin every nation embraced and adorned the popular romance of arthur and the knights of the round table their names were celebrated in greece and italy and the voluminous tales of sir lancelot and sir tristram were devoutly studied by the princes and nobles who disregarded the genuine heroes and historians of antiquity at length the light of science and reason was rekindled the talisman was broken the visionary fabric melted into air and by a natural though unjust reverse of the public opinion the severity of the present age is inclined to question the existence of arthur the progress of romance and the state of learning in the middle ages are illustrated by mr thomas wharton with the taste of a poet

avert must increase the desolation of britain miseries of conquest and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and destructive than in the hands of the saxons who hated the valor of their enemies

were abolished and the british clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers the kings of france maintained the privileges of their roman subjects but the ferocious saxons trampled on the laws of rome and of the emperors the proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction the titles of honor the forms of office the ranks of society and even the domestic rights of marriage testament and inheritance were finally suppressed and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs which had been coarsely framed for the

gaul or spain and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants was covered by a thin varnish of italian manners  this strange alteration has persuaded historians servitude and even

air is healthy the waters are pure and plentiful and the earth yields her regular and fruitful increase in the west beyond the wall the air is infectious and mortal the ground is covered with serpents

motives of policy to prefer his fathers widow the sister of theodebert king of the franks theodebert grandson of clovis and king of austrasia was the most powerful and warlike prince of the age and

and visigoths and the dependent kingdoms of the suevi and burgundians africa was exposed to the cruel persecution of the vandals and the savage insults of the moors rome and italy as far as the banks of the danube were afflicted by an army of barbarian mercenaries whose lawless tyranny was succeeded by the reign of theodoric the ostrogoth all the subjects of the empire who by the use of the latin language more particularly deserved the name and privileges of romans were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign conquest and the victorious nations of germany established a new system of manners and government in the western countries of europe the majesty of rome was faintly represented by the princes of constantinople the feeble and imaginary successors of augustus yet they

may still afford a long series of instructive lessons and interesting revolutions  general observations on the fall of the roman empire in the west the greeks after their country had been reduced into

to each other and to the state was confirmed by the habits of education and the prejudices of religion honor as well as virtue was the principle of the republic the ambitious citizens labored to deserve the solemn glories of a triumph and the ardour of the roman youth was kindled into active emulation as often as they beheld the domestic images of their ancestors sallust de bell jugurthin c   such were the generous professions of p scipio and q maximus the latin historian had read and most probably transcribes polybius their contemporary and friend  the temperate struggles of the patricians and plebeians had finally established the firm and equal balance of the constitution which united the freedom of popular assemblies with the authority and wisdom of a senate and the executive powers of a regal magistrate when the consul displayed the standard of the republic each citizen bound himself by the obligation of an oath to draw his sword in the cause of his country till he had discharged the sacred duty by a military service of ten years this wise institution continually poured into the field the rising generations of freemen and soldiers and their numbers were reinforced by the warlike and populous states of italy who after a brave resistance had yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance of the romans the sage historian who excited the virtue of the

conquest which might have been defeated by the seasonable conspiracy of mankind was attempted and achieved and the perpetual violation of justice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence and courage the arms of the republic sometimes vanquished in battle always victorious in war advanced with rapid steps to the euphrates the danube the rhine and the ocean and the images of gold or silver or brass that might serve to represent the nations and their kings were successively broken by the iron monarchy of rome see daniel ii      0 and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and subdueth all things the remainder of the prophecy the mixture of iron and clay was accomplished according to st jerome in his own ime sicut enim in principio nihil romano imperio fortius et durius ita in sine rerum nihil imbecillius quum et in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas nationes aliarum gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus opera tom v p       the rise of a city which swelled into an empire may deserve as a singular prodigy the reflection of a philosophic mind but the decline of rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness prosperity ripened the principle of decay the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight the story of its ruin is simple and obvious and instead of enquiring why the roman empire was destroyed we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long the victorious legions who in distant wars acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries first oppressed the freedom of the republic and afterward violated the majesty of the purple the emperors anxious for their personal safety and the public peace were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy the vigor of the military government was relaxed and finally dissolved by the partial institutions of constantine and the roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of barbarians  the decay of rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation of the seat of empire but this history has already shown that the powers of government were divided rather than removed the throne of constantinople was erected in the east while the west was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their residence in italy and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces this dangerous novelty impaired the strength and fomented the vices of a double reign the instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were multiplied and a vain emulation of luxury not of merit was introduced and supported between the degenerate successors of theodosius extreme distress which unites the virtue of a free people embitters the factions of a declining monarchy the hostile favorites of arcadius and honorius betrayed the republic to its common enemies and the byzantine court beheld with indifference perhaps with pleasure the disgrace of rome the misfortunes of italy and the loss of the west under the succeeding reigns the alliance of the two empires was restored but the aid of the oriental romans was tardy doubtful and ineffectual and the national schism of the greeks and latins was enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners of interest and even of religion yet the salutary event approved in some measure the judgment of constantine during a long period of decay his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of barbarians protected the wealth of asia and commanded both in peace and war the important streights which connect the euxine and mediterranean seas the foundation of constantinople more essentially contributed to the preservation of the east than to the ruin of the west  as the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion we may hear without surprise or scandal that the introduction or at least the abuse of christianity had some influence on the decline and fall of the roman empire the clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity the active virtues of society were discouraged and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the cloister a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion and the soldiers pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity faith zeal curiosity and the more earthly passions of malice and ambition kindled the flame of theological discord the church and even the state were distracted by religious factions whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always implacable the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods the roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country yet partyspirit however pernicious or absurd is a principle of union as well as of dissension the bishops from eighteen hundred pulpits inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign their frequent assemblies and perpetual correspondence maintained the communion of distant churches and the benevolent temper of the gospel was strengthened though confined by the spiritual alliance of the catholics the sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age but if superstition had not afforded a decent retreat the same vices would have tempted the unworthy romans to desert from baser motives the standard of the republic religious precepts are easily obeyed which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries but the pure and genuine influence of christianity may be traced in its beneficial though imperfect effects on the barbarian proselytes of the north if the decline of the roman empire was hastened by the conversion of constantine his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors  this awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction of the present age it is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the exclusive interest and glory of his native country but a philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views and to consider europe as one great republic whose various inhabitants have attained almost the same level of politeness and cultivation the balance of power will continue to fluctuate and the prosperity of our own or the neighboring kingdoms may be alternately exalted or depressed but these partial events cannot essentially injure our general state of happiness the system of arts and laws and manners which so advantageously distinguish above the rest of mankind the europeans and their colonies the savage nations of the globe are the common enemies of civilized society and we may inquire with anxious curiosity whether europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of rome perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that mighty empire and explain the probable causes of our actual security  i the romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger and the number of their enemies beyond the rhine and danube the northern countries of europe and asia were filled with innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds poor voracious and turbulent bold in arms and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry the barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse of war and the peace of gaul or italy was shaken by the distant revolutions of china the huns who fled before a victorious enemy directed their march toward the west and the torrent was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies the flying tribes who yielded to the huns assumed in their turn the spirit of conquest the endless column of barbarians pressed on the roman empire with accumulated weight and if the foremost were destroyed the vacant space was instantly replenished by new assailants such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from the north and the long repose which has been imputed to the decrease of population is the happy consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture instead of some rude villages thinly scattered among its woods and morasses germany now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns the christian kingdoms of denmark sweden and poland have been successively established and the hanse merchants with the teutonic knights have extended their colonies along the coast of the baltic as far as the gulf of finland from the gulf of finland to the eastern ocean russia now assumes the form of a powerful and civilized empire the plough the loom and the forge are introduced on the banks of the volga the oby and the lena and the fiercest of the tartar hords have been taught to tremble and obey the reign of independent barbarism is now contracted to a narrow span and the remnant of calmucks or uzbecks whose forces may be almost numbered cannot seriously excite the apprehensions of the great republic of europe the french and english editors of the genealogical history of the tartars have subjoined a curious though imperfect description of their present state we might question the independence of the calmucks or eluths since they have been recently vanquished by the chinese who in the year      subdued the lesser bucharia and advanced into the country of badakshan near the sources of the oxus memoires sur les chinois tom i p       00 but these conquests are precarious nor will i venture to ensure the safety of the chinese empire  yet this apparent security should not tempt us to forget that new enemies and unknown dangers may possibly arise from some obscure people scarcely visible in the map of the world the arabs or saracens who spread their conquests from india to sapin had languished in poverty and contempt till mahomet breathed into those savage bodies the soul of enthusiasm  ii the empire of rome was firmly established by the singular and perfect coalition of its members the subject nations resigning the hope and even the wish of independence embraced the character of roman citizens and the provinces of the west were reluctantly torn by the barbarians from the bosom of their mothercountry the prudent reader will determine how far this general proposition is weakened by the revolt of the isaurians the independence of britain and armorica the moorish tribes or the bagaudae of gaul and spain vol i p   0 vol iii p              but this union was purchased by the loss of national freedom and military spirit and the servile provinces destitute of life and motion expected their safety from the mercenary troops and governors who were directed by the orders of a distant court the happiness of an hundred millions depended on the personal merit of one or two men perhaps children whose minds were corrupted by education luxury and despotic power the deepest wounds were inflicted on the empire during the minorities of the sons and grandsons of theodosius and after those incapable princes seemed to attain the age of manhood they abandoned the church to the bishops the state to the eunuchs and the provinces to the barbarians europe is now divided into twelve powerful though unequal kingdoms three respectable commonwealths and a variety of smaller though independent states the chances of royal and ministerial talents are multiplied at least with the number of its rulers and a julian or semiramis may reign in the north while arcadius and honorius again slumber on the thrones of the south the abuses of tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame republics have acquired order and stability monarchies have imbibed the principles of freedom or at least of moderation and some sense of honor and justice is introduced into the most defective constitutions by the general manners of the times in peace the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by the emulation of so many active rivals in war the european forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests if a savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of tartary he must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of russia the numerous armies of germany the gallant nobles of france and the intrepid freemen of britain who perhaps might confederate for their common defense should the victorious barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the atlantic ocean ten thousand vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of civilized society and europe would revive and flourish in the american world which is already filled with her colonies and institutions america now contains about six millions of european blood and descent and their numbers at least in the north are continually increasing whatever may be the changes of their political situation they must preserve the manners of europe and we may reflect with some pleasure that the english language will probably be diffused over an immense and populous continent   iii cold poverty and a life of danger and fatigue fortify the strength and courage of barbarians in every age they have oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of china india and persia who neglected and still neglect to counterbalance these natural powers by the resources of military art the warlike states of antiquity greece macedonia and rome educated a race of soldiers exercised their bodies disciplined their courage multiplied their forces by regular evolutions and converted the iron which they possessed into strong and serviceable weapons but this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and manners and the feeble policy of constantine and his successors armed and instructed for the ruin of the empire the rude valor of the barbarian mercenaries the military art has been changed by the invention of gunpowder which enables man to command the two most powerful agents of nature air and fire mathematics chemistry mechanics architecture have been applied to the service of war and the adverse parties oppose to each other the most elaborate modes of attack and of defense historians

displeased that the subversion of a city should be a work of cost and difficulty or that an industrious people should be protected by those arts which survive and supply the decay of military virtue cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable barrier against the tartar horse and europe is secure from any future irruption of barbarians since before they can conquer they must cease to be barbarous their gradual advances in the science of war would always be accompanied as we may learn from the example of russia with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy and they themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom they subdue  should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious there still remains a more humble source of comfort and hope the discoveries of ancient and modern navigators and the domestic history or tradition of the most enlightened nations represent the human savage naked both in mind and body and destitute of laws of arts of ideas and almost of language it would be an easy though tedious task to produce the authorities of poets philosophers and historians i shall therefore content myself with appealing to the decisive and authentic testimony of diodorus siculus tom i l i p       l iii p     etc edit wesseling the icthyophagi who in his time wandered along the shores of the red sea can only be compared to the natives of new holland dampiers voyages vol i p          fancy or perhaps reason may still suppose an extreme and absolute state of nature far below the level of these savages who had acquired some arts and instruments  from this abject condition perhaps the primitive and universal state of man he has gradually arisen to command the animals to fertilise the earth to traverse the ocean and to measure the heavens his progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and corporeal faculties see the learned and rational work of the president goguet de lorigine des loix des arts et des sciences he traces from facts or conjectures tom i p          edit   mo the first and most difficult steps of human invention has been irregular and various infinitely slow in the beginning and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity ages of laborious ascent have been followed by a moment of rapid downfall and the several climates of the globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness yet the experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes and diminish our apprehensions we cannot determine to what height the human species may aspire in their advances toward perfection but it may safely be presumed that no people unless the face of nature is changed will relapse into their original barbarism the improvements of society may be viewed under a threefold aspect   the poet or philosopher illustrates his age and country by the efforts of a single mind but these superior powers of reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions and the genius of homer or cicero or newton would excite less admiration if they could be created by the will of a prince or the lessons of a preceptor   the benefits of law and policy of trade and manufactures of arts and sciences are more solid and permanent and many individuals may be qualified by education and discipline to promote in their respective stations the interest of the community but this general order is the effect of skill and labor and the complex machinery may be decayed by time or injured by violence   fortunately for mankind the more useful or at least more necessary arts can be performed without superior talents or national subordination without the powers of one or the union of many each village each family each individual must always possess both ability and inclination to perpetuate the use of fire it is certain however strange that many nations have been ignorant of the use of fire even the ingenious natives of otaheite who are destitute of metals have not invented any earthen vessels capable of sustaining the action of fire and of communicating the heat to the liquids which they contain and of metals the propagation and service of domestic animals the methods of hunting and fishing the rudiments of navigation the imperfect cultivation of corn or other nutritive grain and the simple practice of the mechanic trades private genius and public industry may be extirtirpated but these hardy plants survive the tempest and strike an everlasting root into the most unfavourable soil the splendid days of augustus and trajan were eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance and the barbarians subverted the laws and palaces of rome but the scythe the invention or emblem of saturn plutarch quaest romans in tom ii p     macrob saturnal l i c   p     edit london the arrival of saturn of his religious worship in a ship may indicate that the savage coast of latium was first discovered and civilized by the phoenicians  still continued annually to mow the harvests of italy and the human feasts of the laestrigons in the ninth and tenth books of the odyssey homer has embellished the tales of fearful and credulous sailors who transformed the cannibals of italy and sicily into monstrous giants have never been renewed on the coast of campania  since the first discovery of the arts war commerce and religious zeal have diffused among the savages of the old and new world these inestimable gifts they have been successively propagated they can never be lost we may therefore acquiesce in the pleasing conclusion that every age of the world has increased and still increases the real wealth the happiness the knowledge and perhaps the virtue of the human race the merit of discovery has too often been stained with avarice cruelty and fanaticism and the intercourse of nations has produced the communication of disease and prejudice a singular exception is due to the virtue of our own times and country the five great voyages successively undertaken by the command of his present majesty were inspired by the pure and generous love of science and of mankind the same prince adapting his benefactions to the different stages of society has founded a school of painting in his capital and has introduced into the islands of the south sea the vegetables and animals most useful to human life   end of the sixth volume
