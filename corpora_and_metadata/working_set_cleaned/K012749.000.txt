a second letter to the bishop of bangor wherein his lordships notions of benediction absolution and church communion are proved to be destructive of every institution of the christian religion  to which is added a postscript in answer to the objections that have been made against his former letter  by william law m a  the second edition  london printed for w innys at the princes arms in st pauls churchyard       price one shilling  errata page    line  0 for sincere read insincere p    l    for easily r equally p    l    for liberty r liberties ibid l  0 for of quakers r of the quakers

was the only motive that engaged me in the examination of your lordships docrines in a former letter to your lordship and the same motive i hope will be thought a sufficient apology for my presuming to give your lordship the trouble of a second letter  amongst the vain contemptible things whereof your lordship would create an abhorrence in the layity are the trifles and niceties of authoritative benedictions absolutions excommunications preservative p    again you say that to expect the grace of god from any hands but his own is to affront him  p     and that all depends upon god and our selves that human benedictions human absolutions human excommunications have nothing to do with the favor of god p  0    it is evident from these maxims for your lordship asserts them as such that whatever institutions are observed in any christian society upon this supposition that thereby grace is conferred through human hands or by the ministry of the clergy such institutions ought to be condemned and are condemned by your lordship as trifling useless and affronting to god  there is an institution my lord in the yet established church of england which we call confirmation it is founded upon the express words of scripture primitive observance and the universal practice of all succeeding ages in the church the design of this institution is that it should be a means of conferring grace by the prayer and imposition of the bishops hands on those who have been already baptized but yet against all this authority both divine and human and the express order of our own church your lordship teaches the layity that all human benedictions are useless niceties and that to expect gods grace from any hands but his own is to affront him  if so my lord what shall we say in defense of the apostles we read  acts      that when philip the deacon had baptized the samaritans the apostles sent peter and john to them who having prayed and laid their hands on them they received the holy ghost who before was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus  my lord several things are here out of question first that something else even in the apostolical times was necessary besides baptism in order to qualify persons to become complete members of the body or partakers of the grace of christ they had been baptized yet did not receive the holy ghost till the apostles hands were laid upon them   dly that gods graces are not only conferred by means of human hands but of some particular hands and not others   dly that this office was so strictly appropriated to the apostles or chief governors of the church that it could not be performed by inspired men though empowered to work miracles who were of an inferior order as philip the deacon   thly that the power of the apostles for the performance of this ordinance was entirely owing to their superior degree in the ministry and not to any extraordinary gifts they were endowed with for then philip might have performed it who was not wanting in those gifts being himself an evangelist and worker of miracles which is a demonstration that his incapacity arose frorn his inferior degree in the ministry  and now my lord are all human benedictions niceties and trifles are the means of gods grace in his own hands alone is it wicked and affronting to god to suppose the contrary how then comes peter and john to confer the holy ghost by the imposition of their hands how comes it that they appropriate this office to themselves is the dispensation of gods grace in his own hands alone and yet can it be dispensed to us by the ministry of some persons and not by that of others  were the apostles so wicked as to distinguish themselves by a pretense to vain powers which god had reserved to himself and which your lordship supposes from the title of your preservative that it is inconsistent with common sense to imagine that god would or could have communicated to men  had any of your lordships wellinstructed layity lived in the apostles days with what indignation must they have rejected this senseless chimerical claim of the apostles they must have said why do you peter or john pretend to this blasphemous power whilst we believe the gospel we cannot expect the grace of god from any hands but his own you give us the holy ghost you confer the grace of god is it not impious to think that he should make our improvement in grace depend upon your ministry or hang our salvation on any particular order of clergymen we know that god is just and good and true and that all depends upon him and our selves and that human benedictions are trisles therefore whether you peter or you philip or both or neither of you lay your hands upon us we are neither better nor worse but just in the same state of grace as we were before  this representation has not one syllable in it but what is founded in your lordships doctrine and perfectly agreeable to it  the late most pious and learned bishop beveridge has these remarkable words upon confirmation how any bishops in our age dare neglect so considerable a part of their office i know not but fear they will have no good account to give of it when they come to stand before gods tribunal first volume of sermons   but we may justly and therefore i hope with decency ask your lordship how you dare perform this part of your office for you have condemned it as trifling and wicked as trifling because it is an human benediction as wicked because it supposes grace conferred by the hands of the bishop if therefore any baptized persons should come to your lordship for confirmation if you are sincere in what you have delivered your lordship ought i humbly conceive to make them this declaration  my friends for the sake of decency and order i have taken upon me the episcopal character and according to custom which has long prevaild against common sense am now to lay my hands upon you but i beseech you as you have any regard to the truth of the gospel or to the honor of god not to imagine there is any thing in this action more than an useless empty ceremony for if you expect to have any spiritual advantage from human benedictions or to receive grace from the imposition of a bishops hands you affront god and in effect renounce christianity  pray my lord consider that passage in the scripture where the apostle speaks of leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ and going on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment heb       my lord here it is undeniably plain that this laying on of hands which is with us called confirmation is so fundamental a part of christs religion that it is called one of the first principles of the doctrine of christ and is placed amongst such primary truths as the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment  st cyprian speaking of this apostolical imposition of hands says the same is now practiced with us they who have been baptized in the church are brought to the presidents of the church that by our prayer and imposition of hands they may receive the holy ghost and be consummated with the lords seal  and must we yet believe that all human benedictions are dreams and the imposition of human hands trifling and useless and that to expect gods graces from them is to affront him though the scriptures expressly teach us that god confers his grace by means of certain particular human hands and not of others though they tell us this human benediction this laying on of hands is one of the first principles of the religion of christ and as much a foundation doctrine as the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and though every age since that of the apostles has strictly observed it as such and the authority of our own church still requires the observance of it  i come now my lord to another sacred and divine institution of christs church which stands exposed and condemned by your lordships doctrine and that is the ordination of the christian clergy where by means of an human benediction and the imposition of the bishops hands the holy ghost is supposed to be conferred on persons toward consecrating them for the work of the ministry  we find it constantly taught by the scriptures that all ecclesiastical authority and the graces whereby the clergy are qualified and enabled to exercise their functions to the benefit of the church are the gifts and graces of the holy spirit thus the apostle exhorts the elders to take heed unto the flock over which the holy ghost has made them overseers ephesians     but how my lord had the holy ghost made them overseers but by the laying on of the apostles hands they were not immediately called by the holy ghost but being consecrated by such human hands as had been authorized to that purpose they were as truly called by him and sanctified with grace for that employment as if they had received an immediate or miraculous commission so again st paul puts timothy in mind to stir up the gift of god that was in him by laying on of his hands   timothy      and now my lord if human benedictions be such idle dreams arid trifles if it be affronting to god to expect his graces from them or through human hands do we not plainly want new scriptures must we not give up the apostles as furious highchurch prelates who aspired to presumptuous claims and talked of conferring the graces of god by their own hands was not this doctrine as strange and unaccountable then as at present was it not as inconsistent with the attributes and sovereignty of god at that time to have his graces pass through other hands than his own as in any succeeding age nay my lord where shall we find any fathers or councils in the primitive church but who owned and asserted these powers they that were so ready to part with their lives rather than do the least dishonor to god or the chiristian name yet were all guilty of this horrid blasphemy in imagining that they were to bless in gods name and that by the benediction and laying on of the bishops hands the graces of the holy ghost could be conferred on any persons  agreeable to the sense of scripture and antiquity our church uses this form of ordination the bishop laying his hands on the persons head says receive the holy ghost for the office and work of a priest in the church of god committed unto thee by the imposition of our hands from this form it is plain first that our church holds that the reception of the holy ghost is necessary to constitute a person a christian priest   dly that the holy ghost is conferred through human hands   dly that it is by the hands of a bishop that the holy ghost is conferred  if therefore your lordship is right in your doctrine the church of england is evidently most corrupt for if it be dishonorable and affronting to god to expect his grace from any human hands it must of necessity be dishonorable and affronting to him for a bishop to pretend to confer it by his hands and can that church be any ways defended that has established such an iniquity by law and made the form of it so necessary how can your lordship answer it to your layity for taking the character or power of a bishop from such a form of words you tell them it is affronting to god to expect his grace from human hands yet to qualify your self for a bishopric you let human hands be laid on you after a manner which directly supposes you thereby receive the holy ghost is it wicked in them to expect it from human hands and is it less so in your lordship to pretend to receive it from human hands he that believes it is affronting to god to expect his grace from human hands must likewise believe that our form of ordination which promises the holy ghost by the bishops hands must be also affronting to god certainly he cannot be said to be very jealous of the honor of god who will submit himself to be made a bishop by a form of words derogatory upon his own principles to gods honor  suppose your lordship was to have been consecrated to the office of a bishop by these words take thou power to sustain all things in being given thee by my hands i suppose your lordship would think it entirely unlawful to submit to the form of such an ordination but my lord receive thou the holy ghost etc is as impious a form according to your lordships doctrine and equally injurious to the eternal power and godhead as the other for if the grace of god can only be had from his own hands would it not be as innocent in the bishop to say receive then power to sustain all things in being as to say receive the holy ghost by the imposition of my hands and would not a compliance with either form be equally unlawful according to your doctrine in each of them gods prerogative is equally invaded and therefore the guilt must be the same  it may also well be wondered how your lordship can accept of a character which is or ought to be chiefly distinguished by the exercise of that power which you disclaim as in the offices of confirmation and ordination for my lord where can be the sincerity of saying receive the holy ghost by the imposition of our hands when you declare it affronting to god to expect it from any hands but his own suppose your lordship had been preaching to the layity against owning any authority in the virgin mary and yet should acquiesce in the conditions of being made a bishop in her name and by recognizing her power could such a submission be consistent with sincerity here you forbid the layity to expect gods grace from any hands but his yet not only accept of an office upon supposition of the contrary doctrine but oblige your self according to the sense of the church wherein you are ordained a bishop to act frequently in direct opposition to your own principles  so that i think it is undeniably plain that you have at once my lord by these doctrines condemned the scriptures the apostles their martyred successors the church of england and your own conduct and have hereby given us some reason though i wish there were no occasion to mention it to suspect whether you who allow of no other church but what is founded in sincerity are your self really a member of any church  i shall now proceed to say something upon the consecration of the lords supper which is as much exposed as a trifle by your lordships doctrine as the other institutions st paul says the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ my lord is not this cup still to be blessed must there not therefore be such a thing as an human benediction and are human benedictions to be all despised though by them the bread and wine become means of grace and are made the spiritual nourishment of our souls can any one bless this cup if not then there is a difference between human benedictions some are authorized by god and their blessing is effectual whilst others only are vain and presumptuous if the prayer over the elements and the consecration be only a trifle and a dream and it be offensive to god to expect they are converted into means of grace by an human benediction why then did st paul pretend to bless them why did he make it the privilege of the church or why do we keep up the same solemnity but if it be to be blessed only by gods ministers then how can your lordship answer it to god for ridiculing and abusing human benedictions and telling the world that a particular order of the clergy are not of any necessity nor can be of any advantage to them for if the sacrament can only be blessed by gods ministers then such ministers are as necessary as the sacraments themselves  st paul says the cup must be blessed if you say any one may bless it then though you contemn the benedictions of the clergy you allow of them by every body else if every body cannot bless it then you must confess that the benedictions of some persons are effectual where others are not  my lord the great sin against the holy ghost was the denial of his operation in the ministry of our savior and how near does your lordship come to it in denying the operation of that same spirit in the ministers whom christ has sent they are employed in the same work that he was he left his authority with them and promised that the holy spirit should remain with them to the end of the world that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound in heaven and whatsoever they should loose on earth should be loosed in heaven that whosoever despises them despises him and him that sent him and yet your lordship tells us we need not to trouble our heads about any particular sort of clergy that all is to be transacted betwixt god and our selves that human benedictions are infignisicant trifles  but pray what proof has your lordship for all this have you any scripture for it has god any where declared that no men on earth have any authority to bless in his name has he any where said that it is a wicked presumptuous thing for any one to pretend to it has he any where cold us that it is inconsistent with his honor to bestow his graces by human hands has he any where told us that he has no ministers no ambassadors on earth but that all his gifts and graces are to be received immediately from his own hands have you any antiquity fathers or councils on your side no the whole tenor of scripture the whole current of tradition is against you your novel doctrine has only this to recommend it to the libertines of the age who universally give into it that it never was the opinion of any church or churchman it is your lordships proper assertion that we offend god in expecting his graces from any hands but his own  now it is strange that god should be offended with his own methods or that your lordship should find us out a way of pleasing him more suitable to his nature and attributes than what he has taught us in the scriptures i call them his own methods for what else is the whole jewish dispensation but a method of gods providence where his blessings and judgments were dispensed by human hands what is the christian religion but a method of salvation where the chief means of grace are offered and dispensed by human hands let me here recommend to your lordship the excellent words of a very learned and judicious prelate on this occasion  this will have no weight with any reasonable man against the censures of the church or any other ordinance of the gospel that they make the intervention of other men necessary to our salvation since it has always been gods ordinary method to dispense his blessings and judgments by the hands of men dr potters church government p       your lordship exclaims against your adversaries as such romantic strange sort of men for talking of benedictions and absolutions and of the necessity of receiving gods ordinances from proper hands yet my lord here is an excellent bishop against whose learnings judgment and protestantism there can be no objection who says if a person have but the use of his reason he will have nothing to object to any ordinances of the gospel which make the intervention of other men necessary toward the conveyance of them since that has always been gods ordinary method the bishop does not say it is necessary a man should be a great divine to acknowledge it so he be but a reasonable man he will allow it yet your lordship is so far from being this reasonable man that you think your adversaries void both of reason and common sense for teaching it you expressly exclude all persons from having any thing to do with our salvation and say it wholly depends upon god and our selves  you tell us that authoritative benediction is another of the terms of art used by your protestant adversaries in which they claim a right in one regular succession of blessing the people page     an ingenious author my lord in the opinion of many if not of most of your friends calls the consecration of the elements conjuration rights of the christian church  your lordship calls the sacerdotal benediction a term of art too plain an intimation though in more remote and somewhat softer terms that in the sense of a certain father of the church her clergy are little better than so many jugglers  your lordship says if they only meant hereby to declare upon what terms god will give his blessings to christians or to express their own hearty wishes for them this might be understood so it might my lord very easily and i suppose every body understands that they may do this whether they be clergy or layity men or women for i presume any one may declare what he takes to be the terms of the gospel and wish that others may faithfully observe them but i humbly presume my lord that the good bishop abovementioned meant something more than this when he spoke of ordinances which make the intervention of other men necessary to our salvation and of gods dispensing his blessings in virtue of them through their hands  there is a superstitious custom in your lordships account it must be so yet remaining in most places of sending for a clergyman to minister to sick persons in imminent danger of death even those who have abused the clergy all their lives long are glad to beg their assistance when they apprehend themselves upon the confines of another world there is no reason my lord to dislike this practice but as it supposes a difference between the sacerdotal prayers and benedictions and those of a nurse  we read my lord that god would not heal abimelech though he knew the integrity of his heart till abraham had prayed for him he is a prophet said god he shall pray for thee and thou shall live genesis  0    pray my lord was not god just and good and true in the days of abraham as he is now yet you see abimelechs integrity was not available it self he was to be pardoned by the prayer of abraham and his prayer was effectual and so represented because it was the prayer of a prophet  suppose my lord that abimelech had said with your lordship that it is affronting to god that we should expect his graces from any hands but his own that all is to be transacted between god and our selves and so had rejected the prayer of abraham as a mere essay of prophetcraft he had then acted with as much prudence and piety as your lordships layity would do if you could persuade them to despise benedictions and absolutions to regard no particular sort of clergy but entirely depend upon god and themselves without any other assistance whatever  we read also that joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hands upon him deuteronomy      was it not as absurd my lord in the days of joshua for human hands to bless as it is now did there not then lie the same objection against moses that there does now against the christian clergy had moses any more natural power to give the spirit of wisdom etc by his hands than the clergy have to confer grace by theirs they are both equally weak and insufficient for these purposes of themselves and equally powerful when it pleases god to make them so  again when eliphaz and his friends had displeased god they were not to be reconciled to god by their own repentance or transact that matter only between god and themselves but they were referred to apply to job my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept job      might not eliphaz here have said shall i so far affront god as to think i cannot be blessed without the prayers of job shall i be so weak or senseless as to imagine my own supplications and repentance will not save me or that i need apply to any one but god alone to quailfie me for the reception of his grace  again the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto aaron and his sons saying on this wise shall ye bless the children of israel saying unto them the lord bless and keep thee etc and i will bless them  numb       again the priests of the sous of levi shall come near for them has the lord thy god chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord  deuteronomy       now my lord this is what we mean by the authoritative administrations of the christian clergy whether they be by way of benediction or of any other kind we take them to be persons whom god has chosen to minister unto him and to bless in his name we imagine that our savior was a greater priest and mediator than aaron or any of gods former ministers we are assured that christ sent his apostles as his father had sent him and that therefore they were his true successors and since they did commission others to succeed them in their office by the imposition of hands as moses commissioned joshua to succeed him the clergy who have succeeded the apostles have as divine a call and commission to their work as those who were called by our savior and are as truly his successors as the apostles themselves were  from the places of scripture above mentioned it is evident and indeed from the whole tenor of sacred writ that it may consist with the goodness and justice of god to depute men to act in his name and be ministerial toward the salvation of others and to lay a necessity upon his creatures of qualifying themselves for his favor and receiving his graces by the hands and intervention of mere men  but my lord if there be now any set of men upon earth that are more peculiarly gods ministers than others and through whose administrations prayers and benedictions god will accept of returning sinners and receive them to grace you have done all you can to prejudice people against them you have taught the layity that all is to be transacted between god and themselves and that they need not value any particular sort of clergy in the world  i leave it to the great judge and searcher of hearts to judge from what principles or upon what motives your lordship has been induced to teach tesethings but must declare that for my own part if i had the greatest hatred to christianity i should think it could not be more expressed than by teaching what your lordship has publicly taught if i could rejoice in the misery and ruin of sinners i should think it sufficient matter of triumph to drive them from the ministers of god and to put them upon inventing new schemes of saving themselves instead of submitting to the ordinary methods of salvation appointed by god  it will not follow from any thing i have said that the layity have lost their christian liberty or that no body can be saved but whom the clergy please to save that they have the arbitrary disposal of happiness to mankind was abimelechs happiness in the disposition of abraham because he was to be received by means of abrahams intercession or could job damn eliphaz because he was to mediate for him and procure his reconciliation to god  neither my lord do the christian clergy pretend to this despotick empire over their flocks they dont assume to themselves a power to damn the innocent or to save the guilty but they assert a sober and just right to reconcile men to god and to act in his name in restoring them to his favor they received their commission from those whom christ sent with full authority to send others and with a promise that he would be with them to the end of the world from this they conclude that they have his authority and that in consequence of it their administrations are necessary and effectual to the salvation of mankind and that none can despise them but who despise him that sent them and are as surely out of the covenant of grace when they leave such his pastors as when they openly despise or omit to receive his sacraments  and what is there in this doctrine my lord to terrify the consciences of the layity what is there here to bring the profane scandal of priestcraft upon the clergy could it be any ground of abimelechs hating abraham because that abraham was to reconcile him to god could eliphaz justly have any prejudice against job because god would hear jobs intercession for him why then my lord must the christian priesthood be so horrid and hateful an institution because the design of it is to restore men to the grace and favor of god why must we be abused and insulted for being sent upon the errand of salvation and made ministers of eternal happiness to our brethren there is a woe due to us if we preach not the gospel or neglect those ministerial offices that christ has entrusted to us we are to watch for their souls as those who are to give an account why then must we be treated as arrogant priests or popishly affected for pretending to have any thing to do in the discharge of our ministry with the salvation of men why must we be reproached with blasphemous claims and absurd senseless powers for assuming to bless in gods name or thinking our administrations more effectual than the office of a common layman  but farther to what purpose does your lordship except against these powers in the clergy from their common frailties and infirmities with the rest of mankind were not abraham and job and the jewish priests men of like passions with us did not our savior command the jews to apply to their priests notwithstanding their personal faults because they sat in mosess chair did not the apostles assure their followers that they were men of like passions with them but did they therefore disclaim their mission or apostolical authority did they teach that their natural infirmities made them less the ministers of god or less necessary to the salvation of men their personal defects did not make them depart from the claim of those powers they were invested with or desert their ministry but indeed gave st paul occasion to say we have this treasure in earthen vessels  ie this authority committed to mere men that the excellency of it may be of god and not of men the apostle happens to differ very much from your lordship he says such weak instruments were made use of that the glory might redound to god your lordship says to suppose such instruments to be of any benefit to us is to lessen the sovereignty of god and in consequence his glory  your lordship imagines you have sufficiently destroyed the sacerdotal powers by showing that the clergy are only men and subject to the common frailties of mankind my lord we own the charge and dont claim any sacerdotal powers from our personal abilities or to acquire any glory to our selves but weak as we are we are gods ministers and if we are either afraid or ashamed of our duty we must perish in the guilt but is a prophet therefore proud because he insists upon the authority of his mission cannot a mortal be gods messenger and employed in his affairs but he must be insolent and assuming for having the resolution to own it if we are to be reproved for pretending to be gods ministers because we are but men the reproach will fall upon providence since it has pleased god chiefly to transact his affairs with mankind by the ministry of their brethren  your lordship has not one word from scripture against these sacerdotal powers no proof that christ has not sent men to be effectual administrators of his graces you only assert that there can be no such ministers because they are mere men  now my lord i must beg leave to say that if the natural weakness of men makes them incapable of being the instruments of conveying grace to their brethren if the clergy cannot be of any use or necessity to their flocks for this reason then it undeniably follows that there can be no positive institutions in the christian religion that can procure any spiritual advantages to the members of it then the sacraments can be no longer any means of grace for i hope no one thinks that bread and wine have any natural force or efficacy to convey grace to the soul the water in baptism has the common qualities of water and is destitute of any intrinsic power to cleanse the soul or purify from sin but your lordship will not say because it has only the common name of water that therefore it cannot be a means of grace why then may not the clergy though they have the common nature of men be constituted by god to convey his graces and to be ministerial to the salvation of their brethren can god consecrate inanimate things to spiritual purposes and make them the means of eternal happiness and is man the only creature that he cannot make subservient to his designs the only being who is too weak for an omnipotent god to render effectual toward attaining the ends of his grace  is it just and reasonable to reject and despise the ministry and benedictions of men because they are men like our selves and is it not as reasonable to despise the sprinkling of water a creature below us a senseless and inanimate creature  your lordship therefore must either find us some other reason for rejecting the necessity of human administrations than because they are human or else give up the sacraments and all positive institutions along with them  surely your lordship must have a mighty opinion of naaman the syrian who when the prophet bid him go wash in jordan seven times to the end he might be clean from his leprosy very wisely remonstrated are not abana and pharlpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel  this my lord discovered naamans great liberty of mind and it is much this has not been produced before as an argument of his being a freethinker he took the water of jordan to be only water as your lordship justly observes a clergyman to be only a man and if you had been with him you could have informed him that the washing seven times was a mere nicety and trifle of the prophet and that since it is god alone who can work miraculous cures we ought not to think that they depend upon any external means or any stated number of repeating them  this my lord is the true scope and spirit of your argument if the syrian was right in despising the water of jordan because it was only  your lordship may be right in despising any particular order of clergy because they are but men your lordship is certainly as right or as wrong as he was  and now my lord let the common sense of mankind here judge whether if the clergy are to be esteemed as having no authority because they are mere men it does not plainly follow that every thing else every institution that has not some natural force and power to produce the effects designed by it is not also to be rejected as equally trifling and ineffectual  the sum of the matter is this it appears from many express facts and indeed from the whole series of gods providence that it is not only consistent with his attributes but also agreeable to his ordinary methods of dealing with mankind that he should substitute men to act in his name and be authoritatively employed in conferring his grace and favors upon mankind it appears that your lordships argument against the authoritative administrations of the christian clergy does not only contradict those facts and condemn the ordinary method of gods dispensations but likewise proves the sacraments and every positive institution of christianity to be ineffectual and as mere dreams and trifles as the several offices and orders of the clergy  this i hope will be esteemed a sufficient confutation of your lordships doctrine by all who have any true regard or zeal for the christian religion and only expect to be saved by the methods of divine grace proposed in the gospel  i shall now in a word or two set forth the sacredness of the ecclesiastical character as it is founded in the new testament with a particular regard to the power of conferring grace and the efficacy of human benedictions  it appears therein that all sacerdotal power as derived from the holy ghost our savior himself took not the minstry upon him till he had this consecration and during the time of his ministry he was under the guidance and direction of the holy ghost through the holy spirit he gave commandment to the apostles whom he had chosen when he ordained them to the work of the ministry it was with these words receive the holy ghost those whom the apostles ordained to the same function it was by the same authority they laid their hands upon the elders exhorting them to take care of she flock of christ over which the holy ghost had made them overseers  hereby they plainly declared that however this office was to descend from man to man through human hands that it was the holy ghost which consecrated them to that employment and gave them authority to execute it  from this it is also manifest that the priesthood is a grace of the holy ghost that it is not a function founded in the natural or civil rights of mankind but is derived from the special authority of the holy ghost and is as truly a positive institution as the sacraments so that they who have no authority to alter the old sacraments and substitute new ones have no power to alter the old order of the clergy or introduce any other order of them  for why can we not change the sacraments is it not because they are only sacraments and operate as they are instituted by the holy ghost because they are useless ineffectual rites without this authority and does not the same reason hold as well for the order of the clergy does not the same scripture tell us they are equally instituted by the holy ghost and oblige only by virtue of his authority how absurd is it therefore to pretend to abolish or depart from the settled order of the clergy to make new orders and think any gods ministers unless we had his authority and could make new sacraments or a new religion  my lord how comes it that we cannot alter the scriptures is it not because they are divinely inspired and dictated by the holy ghost and since it is express scripture that the priesthood is instituted and authorized by the same holy spirit why is not the holy ghost as much to be regarded in one institution as in another why may we not as well make a gospel and say it was writ by the holy ghost as make a new order of clergy and call them his or esteem them as having any relation to him  from this it likewise appears that there is an absolute necessity of a strict succession of authorized ordainers from the apostolical times in order to constitute a christian priest for since a commission from the holy ghost is necessary for the exercise of this office no one now can receive it but from those who have derived their authority in a true succession from the apostles we could not my lord call our present bibles the word of god unless we knew the copies from which they are taken were taken from other true ones till we come to the originals themselves no more could we call any true ministers or authorized by the holy ghost who have not received their commission by an uninterrupted succession of lawful ordainers  what an excellent divine would he be who should tell the world it was not necessary that the several copies and manuscripts through which the scriptures have been transmitted through different ages and languages should be all true ones and none of them forged that this was a thing subject to so great uncertainty that god could not hang our salvation on such niceties suppose for proof of this he should appeal to the scriptures and ask where any mention is made of ascertaining the truth of all the copies would not this be a way of arguing very theological the application is very easy  your lordship has not one word to prove the uninterrupted succession of the clergy a triste or dream but that it is subject to so great uncertainty and is never mentioned in the scriptures and to the uncertainty of it it is equally as uncertain as whether the scriptures be genuine there is just the same sufficient historical evidence for the certainty of one as the other as to its not being mentioned in the scripture the doctrine upon which it is founded plainly made it unnecessary to mention it is it needful for the scriptures to tell us that if we take our bible from any false copy that it is not the word of god why then need they tell us that if we are ordained by usurping false pretenders to ordination not deriving their authority to that end from the apostles that we are no priests does not the thing it self speak as plain in one case as in the other the scriptures are only of use to us as they are the word of god we cannot have this word of god which was written so many years ago unless we receive it from authentic copies and manuscripts  the clergy have their commission from the holy ghost the power of conferring this commission of the holy ghost was left with the apostles therefore the present clergy cannot have the same commission or call but from an order of men who have successively conveyed his power from the apostles to the present time so that my lord i shall beg leave to lay it down as a plain undeniable christian truth that the order of the clergy is an order of as necessary obligation as the sacraments and as unalterable as the holy scriptures the same holy ghost being as truly the author and founder of the priesthood as the institutor of the sacraments or the inspirer of those divine oracles and when your lordship shall offer any fresh arguments to prove that no particular sort of clergy is necessary that the benedictions and administrations of the present clergy of our most excellent church are trifling niceties if i cannot show that the same arguments will conclude against the authority of the sacraments and the scriptures i faithfully promise your lordship to become a convert to your doctrine  what your lordship charges upon your adversaries as an absurd doctrine in pretending the necessity of one regular successive and particular order of the clergy is a true christian doctrine and as certain from scripture as that we are to keep to the institution of particular sacraments or not to alter those particular scriptures which now compose the canon of the old and new testament  by authoritative benediction we do not mean any natural or intrinsic authority of our own but a commission from god to be effectual administrators of his ordnances and to bless in his name thus a person who is sent from god to foretell things of which he had before no knowledge or notion or to denounce judgments which he has no natural power to execute may be truly said to be an authoritative prophet because he has the authority of god for what he does thus when the bishop is said to confer grace in confirmation this is properly an authoritative benediction because he is then as truly doing what god has commissioned him to do as when a prophet declares upon what errand he is sent  it is in this sense my lord that the people are said to be authoritatively blessed by the regular clergy because they are gods clergy and act by his commission bacause by their hands the people receive the graces and benefits of gods ordinances which they have no more reason to expect from other ministers of their own election or if the word may be used in an abusive sense of their own consecration than to receive grace from sacraments of their own appointment the scriptures teach us that the holy ghost has instituted an order of clergy we say a priesthood so authorized can no more be changed by us than we can change the scriptures or make new sacraments because they are all founded on the same authority without any power of a dispensation delegated to us in one case more than in another if therefore we have a mind to continue in the covenant of christ and receive the grace and benefit of his ordinances we must receive them through such hands as he has authorized for that purpose to the end we may be qualified to partake the blessings of them for as a true priest cannot benefit us by administering a false sacrament so a true sacrament is nothing when it is administered by a false uncommissiond minister besides this benediction which attends the ordinances of god when they are thus performed by authorized hands there is a benediction of prayer which we may justly think very effectual when pronounced or dispensed by the same hands  thus when the bishop or priest intercedes for the congregation or pronounces the apostolical benediction upon them we do not consider this barely as an act of charity and humanity of one christian praying for another but as the work of a person who is commissioned by god to bless in his name and be effectually ministerial in the conveyance of his graces or as the prayer of one who is left with us in christs stead to carry on his great design of saving us and whose benedictions are ever ratified in heaven but when we render our selves in one respect or other incapable of them  now my lord they are these sacerdotal prayers these authorized sacraments these commissioned pastors whom the holy ghost has made overseers of the flock of christ that your lordship encourages the layity to despise you bid them contemn the vain words of validity or invalidity of gods ordinances to heed no particular sort of clergy or the pretended necessity of their administrations  your lordship sets up in this controversy for an advocate for the layity against the arrogant pretenses and false claims of the clergy my lord we are no more contending for our selves in this doctrine than when we insist upon any article in the creed neither is it any more our particular cause when we assert our mission than when we assert the necessity of the sacraments  who is to receive the benefit of that commission which we assert but they who is to suffer if we pretend a false one but our selves sad injury indeed offered to the layity that we should affect to be thought ministers of god for their sakes if we really are so they are to receive the benefit if not we are to bear the punishment  but your lordship comes too late in this glorious undertaking to receive the reputation of it the work has been already in the opinion of most people better done to your lordships hands the famous author of the rights of the christian church has carried this christian liberty to as great heights as your lordship and though you have not one notion i can recollect that has given offense to the world but what seems taken from that pernicious book yet your lordship is not so just as ever once to cite or mention the author who if your lordships doctrine be true deserves to have a statue erected to his honor and receive every mark of esteem which is due to the greatest reformer of religion  did not mine own eyes allure me that he has cast no contempt upon the church no reproach upon the evangelical institutions or the sacred function but what has been seconded by your lnrdship i would never have placed your lordship in the same view with so scandalous a declaimer against the ordinannances of christ whether i am right or not in this charge i freely leave to the judgment of those to determine who are acquainted with both your works yet this author my lord has been treated by the greatest and best part of the nation as a freethinking infidel but for what my lord not that he has declared against the scriptures not that he has rejected revelation we are not blessed be god still so far corrupted with the principles of infidelity but because he has reproached every particular church as such and denied all obligation to communion because he has exposed benedictions absolutions and excommunications denied the divine right of the clergy and ridiculed the pretended sacredness and necessity of their administrations as mere niceties and trifles though commonly in more distant i was going to say more decent ways in a word because he made all churches all priests all sacraments however administered equally valid and denied any particular method necessary to salvation yet after all this profane declamation he allows my lord that religious offices may be appropriated to particular men called clergy for order sake only and not on the account of any peculiar spiritual advantages powers or privileges which those who art set apart for them have from heaven page       agreeable to this your lordship owns that you are not against the order or decency or subordination belonging to christian societies answer to dr snape p      but pray my lord do you mean any more by this than the abovementioned author is it for any thing but the sake of a little external order or convenience is there any christian law that obliges to observe this kind of order is there any real essential difference between persons ranked into this order is it a sin for any body especially the civil magistrate to leave this order and make what other orders he prefers to it this your lordship cannot resolve in the affirmative for then you must allow that some communions are safer than others and that some clergy have more authority than others  will your lordship say that no particular order can be necessary yet some order necessary which may be different in different communions this cannot hold good upon your lordships principles for since christ has left no law about any order no members of any particular communion need submit to that order since it is confessed by your lordship that in religion no laws but those of christ are of any obligation so that though you dont disclaim all external order and decency your self yet you have taught other people to do it if they please and as much as they please  suppose my lord some layman upon a pretense of your lordships absence or any other should go into the dlocess of bangor and there pretend to ordain clergymen could your lordship quote one text of scripture against him could you allege any law of christ or his apostles that he had broken could you prove him guilty of any sin no my lord you would not do that because this would be acknowledging such a thing as a sinful ordination and if there be sinful ordinations then there mus be some law concerning ordinations for sin is the transgression of the law and if there be a law concerning ordinations then we must keep to the clergy lawfully ordained and must confess after all your lordship has said or can say that still some communions are safer than others  if you should reprove such a one as an englishman for acting in opposition to the english laws of decency and order he would answer that he has nothing to do with such trifles that christ was sole lawgiver in his kingdom that he was content to have his kingdom as orderly and decent as christ had left it and since he had instituted no laws in that matter it was presuming for others to take upon them to add any thing by way of order or decency by laws of their own that as he had as much authority from christ to ordain clergy as your lordship he would not depart from his christian liberty  if he should remonstrate to your lordship in these or words to the like effect he would only reduce your lordships own doctrine to practice this my lord is pare of that confusion the learned dr snape has charged you with being the author of in the church of god and all persons my lord whom you have taught not to regard any particular sort of clergy must know if they have the common sense to which you appeal that then no clergy are at all necessary and that it is as lawful for any man to be his own priest as to solicit his own cause for to say that no particular sort of clergy are necessary and yet that in general the clergy are necessary is the same as to say that truth is necessary to be believed yet the belief of no particular truth is necessary  the next thing to be considered my lord is your doctrine concerning absolutions you begin thus the same you will find a sufficient reply to their presumptuous claim to an authoritative absolution an infallible absolution cannot belong to fallible men but no absolution can be authoritative which is not infallible therefore no authoritative absolution can belong to any man living preservative p      i must observe here your lordship does not reject this absolution because the claim of it is not founded in scripture but by an argument drawn from the nature of the thing because you imagine such absolution requires infallibility for the execution of it therefore it cannot belong to men should this be true it would prove that if our savior had really so intended he could not have given this power to his ministers but my lord who can see any repugnancy in the reason of the thing it self is it not as easy to conceive that our lord should confer his grace of pardon by the hands of his ministers as by means of the sacraments and may not such absolution be justly called authoritative the power of which is granted and executed by his authority  is it impossible for men to have this authority from god because they may mistake in the exercise of it this argument proves too much and makes as short work with every institution of christianity as with this power of absolution  for if it is impossible that men should have authority from god to absolve in his name because they are not infallible this makes them equally incapable of being entrusted with any other means of grace and consequently supposes the whole priests office to imply a direct impossbility in the very notion of it  your lordships argument is this christians have their sins pardoned upon certain conditions but fallible men cannot certainly know these conditions therefore fallible men cannot have authority to absolve  from hence i take occasion to argue thus persons are to be admitted to the sacraments on certain conditions but fallible men cannot tell whether they come qualified to receive them according to these conditions therefore fallible men cannot have authority to administer the sacraments    dly this argument subverts all authority of the christian religion it self and the reason of every instituted means of grace for if nothing can be authoritative but what a man is infallibly assured of then the christian religion cannot be an authoritative method of salvation since a man by being a christian does not become infallibly certain of his salvation nor does grace infallibly attend the participation of the sacraments so that though your lordship has formed this argument only against this absolving power yet it has as much force against the sacraments and the christian religion it self for if it be absurd to suppose that the priest should absolve any one because he cannot be certain that he deserves absolution does it not imply the same absurdity to suppose that he should have the power of administering the sacraments when he cannot be infallibly rtain that those who receive them are duly qualified if a possibility of error destroys the power in one case it as certainly destroys it in the other again if absolution cannot be authoritative unless it be infallible then it is plain that the christian religion is not an authoritative means of salvation because all christians are not infallibly saved nor can the sacraments be authoritative means of grace because all who partake of them do not infallibly obtain grace  your lordship proceeds with your layity by way of expostulation if they amuse you with that power which christ left with his apostles whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained unto them page      but why amuse my lord are the texts of holy scripture to be treated as only matter of amusement or does your lordship know of any age in the church when the very same doctrine which we now teach has not been taught from the same texts  do you know any successors of the apostles that thought the power there specified did not belong them but however your lordship has taught your layity to believe what we argue from this text all amusement and told them they may securely answer that it is impossible for them to depend upon this right as any thing certain till they can prove to you that every thing spoken to the apostles belongs to ministers in all ages page     the security of this answer my lord is founded upon this false presumption viz that the clergy can claim no right to the exercise of any part of their office as successors of the apostles till they can prove that every thing that was spoken to the apostles belongs to them  this proposition must be true or else there is no force or security in the objection you here bring for the instruction of the layity if it is well founded then the clergy cannot possibly prove they have any more right to the exercise of any part of their office than the layity do they pretend to ordain confirm to admit or exclude men from the sacraments by what authority is all this done is it not because the apostles whose successors they are did the same things but then say your lordships wellinstructed layity this is nothing to the purpose prove your selves apostles prove that every thing said to the apostles belongs to you and then it will be allowed that you may exercise these powers because they exercised them but as this is impossible to be done so it is impossible for you to prove that you have any powers or authorities because they had them  and now my lord if the case be thus what apology shall we make for christianity as it has been practiced in all ages how shall we excuse the noble army of martyrs saints and confessors who have boldly asserted the right to so many apostolical powers could any men in those ages pretend that every thing that was spoken to the apostles belonged to themselves false then was their claim and presumptuous their authority who should pretend to any apostolical powers because the apostles had them when they could not prove that every thing that was spoken to the apostles belonged to them  farther to prove that the abovementioned text does not confer the power of absolution in the clergy you reason thus whatever contradicts the natural notions of god and the design and tenor of the gospel cannot be the true meaning of any passage in the gospel but to make the absolution of weak and fallible men so necessary or so valid that god will not pardon without them or that all are pardoned who have them pronounced over them is to contradict those notions as well as the plain tenor of the gospel page      be pleased my lord to point out your adversary name any one church of england man that ever taught this romantic doctrine which you are confuting whoever taught such a necessity of absolutions that god will pardon none without them whoever declared that all are pardoned who have them pronounced over them we teach the necessity and validity of sacraments but do we ever declare that all are saved who receive them is there no medium between two extremes no such thing my lord as moderation must every thing be thus absolute and extravagant or nothing at all  in another page we have more of this same coloring but to claim a right to stand in gods stead in such a sense that they can absolutely and certainly bless or not bless with their voice alone this is the highest absurdity and blasphemy as it supposes god to place a set of men above himself and to put out of his own hands the disposal of his blessings and curses page      if your lordship had employed all this oratory against worshipping the sun or moon it had just affected your adversaries as much as this for whoever taught that any set of men could absolutely bless or withold blessing independent of god whoever taught that the christian religion or sacraments or absolution saved people on course or without proper dispositions who ever claimed such an absolving power as to set himself above god and to take from him the disposal of his own blessings and curses what has such extravagant descriptions such romantic characters of absolution to do with that power the clergy justly claim cannot there be a necessity in some cases of receiving absolution from their hands except they set themselves above god is god robbed of the disposal of his blessings when in obedience to his own commands and in virtue of his own authority they admit some as members of the church and exclude others from the communion of it do they pretend to be channels of grace or the means of pardon by any rights or powers naturally inherent in them do they not in all these things consider themselves as lnstruments of god that are made ministerial to the edification of the church purely by his will and only so far as they act in conformity to it now if it has pleased god to confer the holy ghost in ordination confirmation etc only by them and to annex the grace of pardon to the imposition of their hands on returning sinners is it any blasphemy for them to claim and exert their power is the prerogative of god injured because his own institutions are obeyed cannot he dispense his graces by what persons and on what terms he pleases is he deprived of the disposal of his blessings because they are bestowed on persons according to his order and in obedience to his authority if i should affirm that bishops have the sole power to ordain and confirm would this be robbing god of his disposal of those graces that attend such actions is it not rather allowing and submitting to gods own disposal when we keep close to those methods of it which himself has prescribed  pray my lord consider the nature of sacraments are not they necessary to salvation but is god therefore excluded from any power of his own has he for that reason set bread and wine in the eucharist or water in baptism above himself has he put the salvation of men out of his own power because it depends on his own institutions is the salvation of christians less his own act and deed or less the effect of his own mercy because these sacraments in great measure contribute to effect it why then my lord must that imposition of hands that is attended with his grace of pardon and which has no pretense to such grace but in obedience to his order and in virtue of his promise be thus destructive of his prerogative where is there any diminution of his honor or authority if such actions of the clergy are made necessary to the salvation of souls in some circumstances as their washing in water or their receiving bread and wine cannot god institute means of grace but those means must needs be above himself they owe all their power and efficacy to his institution and can operate no farther than the ends for which he instituted them how then is he dethroned for being thus obeyed  my lord you take no notice of scripture but in a new way of your own contend against this power from the nature of the thing yet i must beg leave to say this power stands upon as sure a bottom and is as consistent with the goodness and majesty of god as the sacraments if the annexing grace to sacraments and making them necessary means of salvation be a reasonable institution of god so is his annexing pardon to the imposition of hands by the clergy on returning sinners the grace or blessing received in either case is of his own giving and in a method of his own prescribing and how this should be any injury to gods honor or affront to his majesty cannot easily be accounted for  the clergy justly claim a power of reconciling men to god from express texts of scripture and of delivering his pardons to penitent sinners your lordship disowns this claim as making fallible men the absolute dispensers of gods blessings and putting it in their power to damn and save as they please but my lord nothing of this extravagance is included in it they are only entrusted with a conditional power which they are to exercise according to the rules god has given and it only obtains its effect when it is so exercised every instituted means of grace is conditional and is only then effectual when it is attended with such circumstances as are required by god if the clergy through weakness passion or prejudice exclude persons from the church of god they injure only themselves but my lord are these powers nothing because they may be exercised in vain have the clergy no right at all to them because they are not absolutely infallible in the exercise of them  can you prove my lord that they are not necessary because they have not always the same effect may not that be necessary to salvation which is only effectual on certain conditions is not the christian religion necessary to salvation though all christians are not saved are not the sacraments necessary means of grace though the means of grace obtained thereby is only conditional is every one necessarily improved in grace who receives the sacrament or is it less necessary because the salutary effects of it are not more universal why then must the imposition of hands be less necessary because the grace of it is conditional and only obtained in due and proper circumstances is absolution nothing because if witheld wrongfully it injures not the person who is denied it and if given without due dispositions in the penitent it avails nothing is not this equally true of the sacraments if they are denied wrongfully or administered to unprepared receivers but do they therefore cease to be standing and necessary means of grace  the argument therefore against this power drawn from the ignorance or passions of the clergy whereby they may mistake or pervert the application of it can be of no force since it is as conditional as any other christian institution the salvation of no man can be endangered by the ignorance or passions of any clergyman in the use of this power if they err in the exercise of it the consequences of their error only affect themselves the administration of the sacraments is certainly entrusted to them but will any one say that the sacraments are not necessary to salvation because they may through ignorance or passion make an ill use of this trust  there is nothing in this doctrine to gratify the pride of clergymen or encourage them to lord it over the flock of christ if you could suppose an atheist or a deift in orders he might be arrogant and domineer in the exercise of his powers but who that has the least sense of religion can think it matter of triumph that he can deny the sacraments or refuse his benediction to any of his flock can he injure or offend the least of these and will not god take account or if they fall through his offense will not their blood be required at his hands  neither is there any thing in it that can enslave the layity to the clergy or make their salvation depend upon their arbitrary will does any one think his salvation in danger because the sacraments the necessary means of it are only to be administered by the clergy why then must the salvation of penitents be endangered or made dependent on the sole pleasure of the clergy because they alone can reconcile them to the favor of god if persons are unjustly denied the sacraments they may humbly hope that god will not lay the want of them to their charge and if they are unjustly kept out of the church and denied admittance they have no reason to fear but god will notwithstanding accept them provided they be in other respects proper objects of his favor  but to proceed your lordship says the apostles might possibly understand the power of remitting and retaining sins to be that power of laying their hands upon the sick pagex   is this possible my lord then it is possible the apostles might think that in the power here intended to be given them nothing at all was intended to be given them for the power of healing the sick was already conferred upon them therefore if no more was intended to be given them in this text it cannot be interpreted as having entitled them properly to any power at all    the power mentioned here was something that jesus promised he would give them hereafter which plainly supposes they had it not then but they then had the power of healing therefore something else must be intended here    the power of the keys has always been looked upon as the highest in the apostolical order but if it related only to the power of healing it could not be so for the seventy who were inferior to the apostles had this power    the very manner of expression in this place proves that the power here intended to be given could not relate to healing the sick or to any thing of that nature but to some spiritual power whose effects should not be visible but be made good by virtue of gods promise thus whomsoever ye shall heal on earth i will heal in heaven borders too near upon an absurdity there is no occasion to promise to make good such actions as are good already and have antecedently produced their effects persons who were restored to health to their sight or the use of their limbs did not want to be assured that the apostles by whom they were restored had a power to that end the exercise of which power proved and confirmed it self there was no need therefore of a divine assurance that a person who was healed was actually healed in virtue of it but when we consider this promise as relating to a power whose effects are not visible as the pardon of sins the terms whereby it is expressed are most proper and it is very reasonable to suppose god promising that the spiritual powers exercised by his ministers on earth though they do not here produce their visible effects shall yet be made good and effectual by him in heaven  these reasons my lord i should think are sufficient to convince any one that the apostles could not possibly understand these words in the sense of your lordship  let us now consider the commission given to peter our savior said to him thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven  now my lord how should it enter into the thoughts of peter that nothing was here intended or promised by our savior but a power of healing which he not only had before but also many other disciples who were not apostles i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven that is according to your lordship i will give thee power to heal the sick can any thing be more contrary to the plain obvious sense of the words can any one be said to have the keys of the kingdom of heaven because he may be the instrument of restoring people to health are persons members of christs kingdom with any regard to health how then can he have any powers in that kingdom or be said to have the keys of it who is only empowered to cure distempers could any one be said to have the keys of a temporal kingdom who had no temporal power given him in that kingdom must not he therefore who has the keys of a spiritual kingdom have some spiritual power in that kingdom  christ has told us that his kingdom is not of this world your lordship has told us that it is so foreign to every thing of this world that no worldly terrors or allurements no pains or pleasures of the body can have any thing to do with it yet here your lordship teaches us that he may have the keys of this spiritual kingdom who has only a power over diseases my lord are not sickness and health sight and limbs things of this world have they not some relation to bodily pleasures and pains how then can a power about things wholly confined to this world be a power in a kingdom that is not of this world the force of the argument lies here our savior has assured us that his kingdom is not of this world your lordship takes it to be of so spiritual a nature that it ought not nay that it cannot be encouraged or established by any worldly powers our savior gives to his apostles the keys of this kingdom yet you have so far forgotten your own doctrine and the spirituality of this kingdom that you tell us he here gave them a temporal power of diseases though he says they were the keys of his kingdom which he gave them suppose any successor of the apostles should from this text pretend to the power of the sword to make people members of this kingdom must not the answer be that he mistakes the power by not considering that they are only the keys of a spiritual not of a temporal kingdom which were here delivered to the apostles  i humbly presume my lord that this would be as good an answer to your lordships doctrine as to theirs who claim the right of the sword till it can be shown that health and sickness sight and limbs do not as truly relate to the things of this world as the power of the sword  if this power of the keys must be understood only as a power of inflicting or curing diseases then the words in the proper construction of them must run thus thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church i e a peculiar society of healthful people and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it i e they shall always be in a state of health i will give unto thee the keys of this kingdom of heaven i e thou shall have the power of inflicting and curing distempers and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ie on whomsoever thou shall inflict the leprosy on earth he shall be a leper in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven i e whomsoever thou shall cure of that disease on earth shall be perfectly cured of it in heaven  this without putting any force upon the words is your lordships own interpretation which exposes the honor and authority of scriptures as much as the greatest enemy to them can wish if our savior could mean by these words only a power of healing distempers or if the apostles understood them in that sense we may as well believe that when he said his kingdom was not of this world that he meant it was of this world and that the apostles so understood him too  but however for the benefit and edification of the layity your lordship has another interpretation for them you say if they the apostles did apply this power of remitting sins to the certain absolution of particular persons it is plain they could do it upon no other bottom but this that gods will and good pleasure about such particular persons was infallibly communicated to them  pray my lord how or where is this so plain is it plain that they never baptized persons till god had infallibly communicated his good pleasure to them about such particular persons baptism is an institution equally sacred with this other and puts the person baptized in the same state of grace that absolution does the penitent baptism is designed for the remission of sin it is an ordinance to which absolution is consequent but i suppose persons may be baptized without such infallible communication promised as your lordship contends for if therefore it be not necessary for the exercise of absolution by baptism why must it be necessary for absolution by the imposition of hands  can pastors without infallibility baptize heathens and absolve or be the instruments of absolving them thereby from their sins are they not as able to absove christian penitents or restore those who have apostatized if human knowledge and the common rules of the church be sufficient to direct the priest to whom he ought to administer the sacraments they are also sufficient for the exercise of this other part of the sacerdotal office  but your lordship proceeds thus not that they themselves absolved any  no my lord no more than water in baptism of it self purifies the soul from sin this baptismal water is notwithstanding necessary or the remission of our sins  again you say not that god was obliged to bind and loose the guilt of aden according to their declarations considered as their own decisions and their own determinations page  no my lord whoever ever thought so god is not obliged to confer race by the baptismal water considered only as water but he is considered as his own institution for that end and purpose so if these declarations are considered only as the declarations of men god is not obliged by them but when they are considered as the declarations of men whom he has especially authorized to make such declarations in his name then they are as effectual with god as any other of his institutions whatever  i proceed now to a paragraph that bears as hard upon our savior as some others have done upon his apostles and their successors where your lordship designs to prove that though christ claimed a power of remitting sins himself or in his own person yet that he had really no such power  you go upon these words if we look back upon our savior himself we shall find that when he declares that the son of man had power upon earth to forgive sins even he himself either meant by it the power of a miraculous releasing man from his affliction or if it related to another more spiritual sense of the words the power of declaring that the mans sins were forgiven by god preservative p      the words of our savior which we are to look back upon are these whether is it easier to say thy sins are forgiven thee or to say arise take up thy bed and walk but that ye may know the son of man has power on earth to forgive sins mark      0 as if he had said is not the same divine authority and power required is it not a work as peculiar to god to perform miraculous cures as to forgive sins the reason therefore why i now choose to declare my authority rather by saying thy sins are forgiven thee than by saying arise and walk was purely to teach you this truth that the power of the son of man is not confined to bodily cures but that he has power on earth to forgive sins  this my lord is the first obvious sense of the words and therefore i take it to be the true sense but your lordship can look back upon them till you find that christ has not this power though he claims it expressly but that he only intends a power of doing something or other which no more imports a power of forgiving sins than of remitting any temporal debt or penalty  if our blessed savior had intended to teach the world that he was invested with this power i would gladly know how he must have expressed himself to have satisfied your lordship that he really had it he must have told you that he had not this power and then possibly your lordship would have taught us that he had this power for no one can discover any reason why you should deny it him but because he has in express words claimed and asserted it i hope your lordship has not so low an opinion of our saviors person as to think it unreasonable in the nature of the thing that he should have this power where does it contradict any principle of reason to say that a king should be able to pardon his subjects since there is no absurdity then in the thing it self and it is so expressly asserted in scripture it is just matter of surprise that your lordship should carry your reader from a plain consistent sense of the words to either this or that something or other the origin whereof is only to be sought for in your lordships own invention rather than not exclude christ from a power which he declared he had and declared he had it for this very reason that we might know that he had it our savior has told us that the way to heaven is narrow your lordship might as reasonably prove from hence that he meant it was broad as that he did not mean he could forgive sins when he said that ye may know that the son of man has power on earth to forgive sins  your lordship has rejected all church authority and despised the pretended powers of the clergy for this reason because christ is the sole king sole lawgiver and judge in his kingdom but it seems your lordship notwithstanding thinks it now time to depose him and this sole king in his own kingdom must not be allowed to be capable of pardoning his own subjects  this doctrine my lord is delivered i suppose as your other doctrines out of a hearty concern and christian zeal for the privileges of the layity and to show that your lordship is not only able to limit as you please the authority of temporal kings but also to make christ himself sole king and yet no king in his spiritual kingdom for my lord the kingdom of christ is a society founded in order to the reconciliation of sinners to god if therefore christ could not pardon sins to what end could he either erect or how could he support his kingdom which is only in the great and last design of it to consist of absolved sinners he that cannot forgive sins in a kingdom that is erected for the remission of sins can no more be sole king in it than he that has no temporal power can be sole king in a temporal kingdom therefore your lordship has been thus mighty serviceable to the christian layity as to teach them that christ is not only sole king but no king in his kingdom  this is not the first contradiction your lordship has unhappily fallen into in your attempts upon kingly authority not is it the iast which i shall presume to observe to the common sense of your layity  again in this account of our blessed savior your lordship has made no difference between him and his apostles as to this absolving authority for you say the great commission given to them implied either a power of releasing men from their bodily afflictions or of declaring such to be pardoned whom god had assured them that he had pardoned and this is all that you here allow to christ himself  your lordships calling him so often king and sole king etc in his kingdom and yet making him a mere creature in it is too like the insult and designed sarcasm of the jews who when they had nailed him to the cross writ over his head this is the king of the jews  but to proceed your lordship proves that our savior had not the power of forgiving sins because his way of expression was thy sins are forgiven thee this was plainly to acknowledge and keep up that true notion that god alone forgiveth sins  let us therefore put this argument in form christ has affirmed that he had power to forgive sins but his way was to say thy sins are forgiven thee therefore christ had not power to forgive sins q e d  it is much your lordship did not recommend this to your layity as another invincible demonstration for by the help of it my lord they may prove that our savior could no more heal diseases than forgive sins as thus christ indeed pretends to a power of healing diseases but his usual way of speaking to the diseased person was thy faith has made thee whole therefore he had not the power of healing diseases the argument has the same force against one power as against the other if he did not forgive sins because he said thy sins are forgiven thee no more did he heal diseases because he said thy faith has made thee whole  i have a claim of several debts upon a man i forgive him them all in these words thy debts are remitted thee a philosophical wit stands by and pretends to prove that i had not the power of remitting these debts because i said thy debts are remitted thee what can come up to or equal such profound philosophy but the divinity of one who teaches our savior could not forgive sins because he said thy sins are forgiven thee  but your lordship says the reason why our savior thus expressed himself thy sins are forgiven thee was plainly to keep up that true notion that god alone forgiveth sins therefore my lord according to this doctrine our savior was obliged not to claim any power that was peculiar or appropriated to god alone for if this be an argument why he should not forgive sins it is also an argument that he ought not to claim any other power any more than this which is proper to god and only belongs to him but my lord if he did express himself thus that he might not lay claim to any thing that was peculiar to god how came he in so many other respects to lay claim to such things as are as truly peculiar to god as the forgiveness of sins how came he in so many instances to make himself equal to god how came he to say ye believe in god believe also in me and that men should worship the son even as the father that he was the son of god that he was the way the truth and the life  are not evangelical faith worship and trust duties that are solely due to god does he not as much invade the sovereignty of god who lays claim to these duties as he that pretends to forgive sins did not christ also give his disciples power and authority over devils and unclean spirits and power to heal all manner of diseases now if christ did not assume a power to forgive sins because god alone could forgive sins it is also as unaccountable that he should exercise other authorities and powers which are as strictly peculiar to god as that of forgiving sins as if a person should disown that christ is omniscient because omniscience is an attribute of god alone and yet confess his omnipotence which is an attribute equally divine  but farther my lord did our savior thus designedly express himself least he should be thought to assume any power which was divine then it is certain according to this opinion that if he had assumed any such power or pretended to do what was peculiar to god he had been the occasion of misleading men into error for if this be a plain reason why he expressed himself so as to disown this power it is plain that if he had owned it he had been condemned by this argument as teaching false doctrine  now if this would have been interpretatively false doctrine in christ to take upon himself any thing that was peculiar to god the apostles were guilty of propagating this false doctrine for there is scarce any known attribute or power of god but they ascribe it to our savior they declare him eternal omnipotent omniscient etc is it not a true notion that god alone can create and is governor of the universe yet the apostles expressly assure us of christ that all things were created by him and that god has put all things in subjection under his feet it is very surprising that your lordship should exclude christ from this power of forgiving sins though he has expressly said he could forgive sins because such a power belongs only to god when it appears through the whole scripture that there is scarce any divine power which our savior himself has not claimed nor any attribute of god but what his apostles have ascribed to him they have made him the creator the preserver the governor of the universe the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him and yet your lordship tells us that he did not pretend to forgive sins because that was a power peculiar to god  here is then to speak in your lordships elegant style an immovable resting place for your laity to set their feet upon here is an argument that will last them for ever they must believe that our savior did not forgive sins because this was a power that belonged to god though the scriptures assure us that every other divine power belonged to christ that is they must believe that though our savior claimed all divine powers yet not this divine power because it is a divine power and my lord if they have the common sense to believe this they may also believe that though our savior took human nature upon him yet that he had not a human soul because it is proper to man they may believe that any person who has all kingly power cannot remit or reprieve a malefactor because it is an act of kingly power to do it or that a bishop cannot suspend any offender of his diocese because it is an act of episcopal power to do it all these reasons are as strong and demonstrative as that christ who claimed all divine powers could not forgive sins because it was a divine power  lastly in this argument your lordship has plainly declared against the divinity of christ and ranked him in the order of creatures your lordship says christ did not forgive sins because it is god alone who can forgive sins as plain an argument as can be offered that in your lordships opinion christ is not god for if you believed him in a true and proper sense god how could you exclude him from the power of forgiving sins because god alone can forgive sins it is inconsistent with sense and reason to deny this power to christ because it is a divine power bat only because you believe him not to be a divine person if christ was god then he might forgive sins though god alone can forgive sins but you say christ cannot forgive sins because god alone can forgive sins therefore it is plain that according to your lordships doctrine christ is not truly or in a proper sense god  here my lord i desire again to appeal to the common sense of your laity let them judge betwixt the scriptures and your lordship the scriptures plainly and frequently ascribe all divine attributes to christ they make him the creator and governor of the world god over all blessed for ever yet your lordship makes him a creature and denies him such a power because it belongs only to god  you your self my lord have allowed him to be absolute ruler over the consciences of men to be an arbitrary dispenser of the means of salvation to mankind than which powers none can be more divine and yet you hold that he cannot forgive sins because pardon of sin can only be the effect of a divine power  is it not equally a divine power even according to your lordship to rule over the consciences of men to give laws of salvation and to act in these affairs with an uncontrollable power as to forgive sins  my lord let their common sense here discover the absurdity for i must call it so of your new scheme of government in christs kingdom christ is absolute lord of it according to your self and can make or unmake laws relating to it can dispense or withold grace as he pleases in this spiritual kingdom all which powers are purely divine yet you say he cannot forgive sins though every express power which you have allowed him over the consciences of men be as truly a divine power as that of forgiving sins has not christ a proper and personal power to give grace to his subjects is he not lord over their consciences and are not these powers as truly appropriated to god and has not your lordship often taught them to be so as that of forgiveness of sins is it not as much the prerogative of god to have any natural intrinsic power to confer grace or any spiritual benefit to the souls of men as to forgive sins has not your lordship despised all the administrations of the clergy because gods graces can only come from himself and are only to be received from his own hands the conclusion therefore is this either christ has a personal intrinsic power to confer grace in his kingdom or he has not if you say he has not then you are chargable with the collusion of making him a king in a spiritual kingdom where you allow him no spiritual power if you say he has then you fall into this contradiction that you allow him to have divine powers though he cannot have divine powers that is you allow him to give grace though it is a divine power and not to forgive sins because it is a divine power my lord i wish your laity if there be any to whom you can render it intelligible much joy of such profound divinity or if there are others who are more taken with your lordships sincerity i desire them not to pass by this following remarkable instance of it your lordship has here as plainly declared as words can consequentially declare any thing that you do not believe christ to be god yet profess your self bishop of a church whofse liturgy in so many repeated testimonies declares the contrary doctrine and which obliges you to express your assent and consent to such doctrine my lord i here call upon your sincerity either declare christ to be perfect god and then show why he could not forgive sins or deny him to be perfect god and then show how you can sincerely declare your assent and consent to the doctrines of the church of england  this my lord has an appearance of prevarication which you cannot i hope charge upon any of your adversaries who if they cannot think that to be sincere is the only thing necessary to recommend men to the favor of god yet may have as much or possibly more sincerity than those who do think so  before i take leave of your lordship i must take notice of a resting place a strong retreat a lasting foundation i e a demonstration in the strictest sense of the words that all church communion is unnecessary  your lordship sets it out in these words  i am not now going to accuse you of a heresy against charity but of a heresy against the possibility and nature of things as thus mr nelson for instance thinks himself obliged in conscience to communicate with some of our church upon this you declare he has no title to gods mercy and you and all the world allow that if he communicates with you whilst his conscience tells him it is a sin he is selfcondemned and out os gods favor that notion viz the necessity of church communion therefore which implies this great invincible absurdity cannot be true  pray my lord what is this wondrous curiosity of a demonstration but the common case of an erroneous conscience did the strictest contenders for church communion ever teach that any terms are to be complied with against conscience but its a strange conclusion to infer from thence that there is no obligation to communion or that all things are to be held indifferent because they are not to be complied with against ones conscience  the truths of the christian religion have the same nature and obligation whatever our opinions are of them and those that are necessary to be believed continue so whither we can persuade our selves to believe them or not i suppose your lordship will not say that the articles of faith and necessary institutions of the christian religion are no otherways necessary than because we believe them to be so that our persuasion is the only cause of the necessity but if their necessity be not owing merely to our belief of them then it is certain that our disbelief of them cannot make them less necessary if the ordinances of christ and the articles of faith are necessary because christ has made them so that necessity must continue the same whether we believe and observe them or not  so that my lord we may still maintain the necessity of church communion and the strict observance of christs ordinances notwithstanding that people have different persuasions in these matters presuming that our opinions can no more alter the nature or necessity of christs institutions than we can believe error into truth good into evil or light into darkness i shall think my self no heretic against the nature of things though i tell a conscientious socinian that the divinity of christ is necessary to be believed or a conscientious jew that it is necessary to be a christian in order to be saved but if your lordships demonstration was accepted we should be obliged to give up the necessity of every doctrine and institution to every disbeliever that pretended conscience we must not tell any party of people that they are in any danger for being out of communion with us if they do but follow their own persuasion  your lordships invincible demonstration proceeds thus  we must not insist upon the necessity of joining with any particular church because then conscientious persons will be in danger either way for if there be a necessity of it then there is a danger if they do not join with it and if they comply against their consciences the danger is the same  what an inextricable difficulty is here how shall divinity or logic be able to relieve us  be pleased my lord to accept of this solution in lieu of your demonstration  i will suppose the case of a conscientious jew i tell him that christianity is the only covenanted method of salvation and that he can have no title to the favor of god till he professes the faith of christ what replies he would you direct me to do if i embrace christianity against my conscience i am out of gods favor and if i follow my conscience and continue a jew i am also out of his favor the answer is this my lord the jew is to obey his conscience and to be left to the uncovenanted unpromised terms of gods mercy whilst the conscientious christian is entitled to the express and promised favors of god  there is still the same absolute necessity of believing in christ christianity is still the only method of salvation though the sincere jew cannot so persuade himself and we ought to declare it to all jews and unbelievers whatsoever that they can only be saved by embracing christianity that a false religion does not become a true one nor a true one false in consequence of their opinions but that if they are so unhappy as to refuse the covenant of grace they must be left to such mercy as is without any covenant and now my lord what is become of this mighty demonstration does it prove that christianity is not necessary because the conscientious jew may think it is not so it may as well prove that the moon is no larger than a mans head because an honest ignorant countryman may think it no larger  is there any person of common sense who would think it a demonstration that he is not obliged to go to church because a conscientious dissenter will not could he think it less necessary to be a christian because a sincere jew cannot embrace christianity could he take it to be an indifferent matter whether he believed the divinity of christ because a conscientious socinian cannot yet this is your lordships invincible demonstration that we ought not to insist upon the necessity of church communion because a conscientious disbeliever cannot comply with it  a small degree of common sense would teach a man that true religion and the terms of salvation must have the same obligatory force whether we reason rightly about them or not and that they who believe and practice according to them are in express covenant with god which entitles them to his favor whilst those who are sincerely erroneous have nothing but the sincerity of their errors to plead and are left to such mercy of god as is without any promise here my lord is nothing frightful or absurd in this doctrine they who are in the church which christ has founded are upon terms which entitles them to gods favor they who are out of it fall to his mercy  but your lordship is not content with the terms of the gospel or a doctrine that only saves a particular sort of people this is a narrow view not wide enough for your notions of liberty particular religions and particular covenants are demonstrated to be absurd because particular persons may disbelieve or not submit to them  your lordship must have doctrines that will save all people alike in every way that their persuasion leads them to take but my lord there needs be no greater demonstration against your lordships doctrine than that it equally favors every way of worship for an argument which equally proves every thing has been generally thought to prove nothing which happens to be the case of your lordships important demonstration  your lordship indeed only instances in a particular person mr nelson but your demonstration is as serviceable to any other person who has left any other church whatever the conscientious quaker muggletonian independent or socinian etc have the same right to obey conscience and blame any church that assumes a power of censuring them as mr nelson had and if they are censured by any church that church is as guilty of the same heresy against the nature of things as that church which censured mr nelson or any church that should pretend to censure any other person whatever  i am not at all surpised that your lordship should teach this doctrine but its something strange that such an argument should be obtruded upon the world as an unheard of demonstration and that in an appeal to common sense suppose some body or other in defense of your lordship should take upon him to demonstrate to the world that there is no such thing as color because there are some people that cannot see it or sounds because there are some who dont hear them he would have found out the only demonstrations in the world that could equal your lordships and would have as much reason to call those heretics against the nature of things who should disbelieve him and insist upon the reality of sounds as your lordship has to call your adversaries so  for is there no necessity of church communion because there are some who dont conceive it then there are no sounds because there are some who dont hear them for it is certainly as easy to believe away the truth and reality as the necessity of things  some people have only taught us the innocence of error and been content with setting forth its harmless qualities but your lordship has been a more hearty advocate and given it a power over every truth and institution of christianity if we have but an erroneous conscience the whole christian dispensation is cancelled all the truth and doctrines in the bible are demonstrated to be unnecessary if we do not believe them  how unhappily have the several parties of christians been disputing for many ages who if they could but have found out this intelligible demonstration from the case of an erroneous conscience would have seen the absurdity of pretending to necessary doctrines and insisting upon church communion but it must be acknowledged your lordships new invented engine for the destruction of churches and it may be expected the good christians of no church will return your lordship their thanks for it  your lordship has thought it a mighty objection to some doctrines in the church of england that the papists might make some advantage of them but yet your own doctrine defends all communions alike and serves the jew and socinian etc as much as any other sort of people though this sufficiently appears from what has been already said yet that it may be still more obvious to the common sense of every one i shall reduce these doctrines to practice and suppose for once that your lordship intends to convert a jew a quaker or socinian  now in order to make a convert of any of them these preliminary propositions are to be first laid down according to your lordships doctrine  some propositions for the improvement of true religion  proposition i that we are neither more or less in the favor of god for living in any particular method or way of worship but purely as we are sincere preserv page  0  propos ii that no church ought to unchurch another or declare it out of gods favor preserv p     propos iii that nothing loses us the favor of god but a wicked insincerity ibid  propos iv that a conscientious person can be in no danger for being out of any particular church preserv page  0  propos v that there is no such thing as any real perfection or excellency in any religion that can justify our adhering to it but that all is founded in our personal persuasion which your lordship thus proves when we left the popish doctrines was it because they were actually corrupt no the reason was because we thought them so therefore if we might leave the church of rome not because her doctrines were corrupt but because we thought them so then the same reason will justify any one else in leaving any church how true soever its doctrines are and consequently there is no such thing as any real perfection or excellency in any religion considered in it self but it is right or wrong according to our persuasions about it preserv page     propos vi that christ is sole king and lawgiver in his kingdom that no men have any power of legislation in it that if we would be good members of it we must show our selves subjects of christ alone without any regard to mans judgment  propos vii that as christs kingdom is not of this world so when worldly encouragements are annexed to it these are so many divisions against christ and his own express word sermon page     propos viii that to pretend to know the hearts and sincerity of men is nonsense and absurdity sermon page     propos ix that gods graces are only to be received immediately from himself sermon p     these my lord are your lordships own propositions expressed in your own terms without any exaggeration  and now my lord begin as soon as you please either with a quaker socinian or jew use any argument whatsoever to convert them and you shall have a sufficient answer from your own propositions  will you tell the jew that christianity is necessary to salvation he will answer from propos i that we are neither more or lesas in the favor of god for living in any particular method or way of worship but purely as we are sincere  will your lordship tell him that the truth of christianity is so well asserted that there is no excuse left for unbelievers he will answer from propos v that all religion is founded in personal persuasion that as your lordship does not believe that christ is come because he is actually come but because you think he is come so he does not disbelieve christ because he is not actually come but because he thinks he is not come so that here my lord the jew gives as good a reason why he is not a christian as your lordship does why you are not a papist  if your lordship should turn the discourse to a quaker and offer him any reasons for embracing the doctrine of the church of england you cannot possibly have any better success any one may see from your propositions that no argument can be urged but what your lordship has there fully answered for since you allow nothing to the truth of doctrines or the excellency of any communion as such it is demonstrable that no church or communion can have any advantage above another which is absolutely necessary in order to persuade any sensible man to exchange any communion for another  will your lordship tell a quaker that there is any danger in that particular way that he is in  he can answer from propos lst  d and  th that a conscientious person cannot be in any danger for being out of any particular church  will your lordship tell him that his religion is condemned by the universal church  he can answer from propos  d that no church ought to unchurch another or declare it out of gods favor  will you tell him that christ has instituted sacraments as necessary means of grace which he neglects to observe  he will answer you from propos ix that gods graces are only to be received immediately from himself and to think that bread and wine or the sprinkling of water is necessary to salvation is as absurd as to think any order of the clergy is necessary to recommend us to god  will your lordship tell him that he displeases god by not holding several articles of faith which christ has required us to believe  he can reply from propos iii that nothing loses us the favor of god but a wicked insincerity and from propos v that as your lordship believes such things not because they are actually to be believed but because you think so so he disbelieves them not because they are actually false but because he thinks so  will your lordship tell him he is insincere  he can reply from propos vi that to assume to know the hearts and sincerity of men is nonsense and blasphemy  will your lordship tell him that he ought to conform to a church established by the laws of the land  he can answer from propos viii that the very establishment is an argument against conformity for as christs kingdom is not of this worl so when worldlyencouragements are annexed to it the are somany decisions against christ and his own express words and from propos vii that seeing christ is sole king and lawgiver in his kingdom an no mn have any power of legislation in it they wh would be good members of it must show themselves subjects to christ alone without any regard to mans judgment  i am inclined to think my lord that it is now demonstrated to the common sense of the laity that your lordship cannot urge any argument either from the truth the advantage or necessity of embracing the doctrines of the church of england to either jew heretic or schismatic but you have helped him to a full answer to any such argument from your own principles  are we my lord to be treated as popishly affected for asserting some truths which the papists join with us in asserting is it a crime in us not to drop some necessary doctrines because the papists have not dropped them if this is to be popishly affected we own the charge and are not for being such true protestants as to give up the apostles creed or lay aside the sacraments because they are received by the church of rome i cannot indeed charge your lordship with being well affected to the church of rome or of england  the jews the quakers or socinians but this i ave demonstrated and will undertake the dence of it that your lordships principles equally rve them all alike and dont give the least adantage to one church above another as has fficiently appeared from your principles  i will no more say your lordship is in the inerest of the quakers or socinians or papists han i would charge you with being in the inerest of the church of england for as your dotrines equally support them all he ought to ask our lordships pardon who should declare you ore a friend to one than the other  i intended my lord to have considered another very obnoxious article in your lordships doctrines concerning the repugnancy of temporal encouragements to the nature of christs kingdom ut the consistency and reasonableness of guardng this spiritual kingdom with human laws as been defended with so much perspicuity and strength of argument and your lordships objections so fully confuted by the judicious and learned dean of chichester that i presume this part of the controversy is finally determined  i hope my lord that i have delivered nothing here that needs any excuse or apology to the laity that they will not be persuaded through any vain pretense of liberty to make themselves parties against the first principles of christianity or imagine that whilst we contend for the positive institutions of the gospel the necessity of church communion or the excellency of our own we are robbing them of their natural rights or interfering with their privileges whilst we appear in the defense of any part of christianity we are engaged for them in the common cause of christians and i am persuaded better things of the laity than to believe that such labors will render either our persons or professions hateful to them your lordship has indeed endeavored to give an invidious turn to the controversy by calling upon the laity to assert their libertys as if they were in danger from the principles of christianity  but my lord what liberty does any layman lose by our asserting that church communion is necessary what privilege is taken from them by our teaching the danger of certain ways and methods of religion is a man made a slave because he is cautioned against the principles of the quakers against fanaticism popery or socinianism is he in a state of bondage because the sacraments are necessary and none but episcopal clergy ought to administer them is his freedom destroyed because there is a particular order of men appointed by god to minister in holy things and be serviceable to him in recommending him to the favor of god can any persons my lord think these things breaches upon their liberty except such as think the commandments a burden is there any more hardship in saying thou shall keep to an episcopal church than thou shall be baptized or in requiring people to receive particular sacraments than to believe particular books of scripture to be the word of god if some other advocate for the laity should out of zeal for their rights declare that they need not believe one half of the articles in the creed if they would but assert their liberty he would be as true a friend and deserve the same applause as he who should assert the necessity of church communion is inconsistent with the natural rights and liberties of mankind  i am my lord your lordships most humble servant william law  postscript i hope your lordship will not think it unnatural or impertinent to offer here a word or two in answer to some objections against my former letter  to begin with the doctrine of the uninterrupted succession of the clergy  i have as i think proved that there is a divine sommission required to qualify any one to exercise the priestly office and that seeing this divine commission can only be had from such particular persons as god has appointed to give it therefore it is necessary that there should be a continual succession of such persons in order to keep up a commissioned order of the clergy for if the commission it self be to descend through ages and distinguish the clergy from the laity it is certain the persons who alone can give this commission must descend through the same ages and consequently an uninterrupted succession is as necessary as that the clergy have a divine commission take away this succession and the clergy may as well be ordained by one person as another a number of women may as well give them a divine commission as a congregation of any men they may indeed appoint persons to officiate in holy orders for the sake of decency and order but then there is no more in it than an external decency and order they are no more the priests of god then those that pretended to make them so if we had lost the scriptures it would be very well to make as good books as we could and come as near them as possible but then it would be not only folly but presumption to call them the word of god but i proceed to the objections against the doctrine of an uninterrupted succession  first it is said that there is no mention made of it in scripture as having any relation to the being of a church  secondly that it is subject to so great uncertainty that if it be necessary we cannot now be sure we are in the church  thirdly that it is a popish doctrine and gives them great advantage over us  i begin with the  st objection that there is no mention made of it in the scriptures which though i think   have sufficiently answered in this letter i shall here farther consider  pray my lord is it not a true doctrine that the scriptures contain all things necessary to salvation but my lord it is no where expressly said that the scriptures contain all things necessary to salvation it is no where said that no other articles of faith need be believed where does it appear in scripture that the scriptures were writ by any divine command have any of the gospels or epistles this authority to recommend them are they necessary to be believed because there is any law of christ concerning the necessity of believing them  may i reject this uninterrupted succession because it is not mentioned in scripture and may i not as well reject all the gospels produce your authority my lord mention your texts of scripture where christ has hung the salvation of men upon their believing that st matthew or st john wrote such a book seventeen hundred years ago these my lord are niceties and trifles which are not to be found in scripture and consequently have nothing to do with the salvation of men  now if nothing be to be held as necessary but what is expressly required in so many words in scripture then it can never be proved that the scriptures themselves are a standing rule of faith in all ages since it is no where expressly asserted nor is it any where said that the scriptures should be continued as a rule of faith in all ages is it an objection against the necessity of a perpetual succession of the clergy that it is not mentioned in the scripture and is it not as good a one against the necessity of making scripture the standing rule of faith in all ages since it is never said that they were to be continued as a standing rule in all ages if things are only necessary for being said to be so in scripture then all that are not thus taught are equally unnecessary and consequently it is no more necessary that the scripture should be a fixed rule of faith in all ages than that there should be bishops to ordain in all ages  again where shall we find it in scripture that the sacraments are to be continued in every age of the church where is it said that they shall always be the ordinary means of grace necessary to be observed is there any law of christ any text of scripture that expressly asserts that if we leave the use of the sacraments we are out of covenant with god is it any where directly said that we must never lay them aside or that they will be perpetually necessary no my lord this is a nicety and trifle not to be found in scripture there is no stress laid there upon this matter but upon things of a quite different nature  i now presume my lord that every one who has common sense plainly sees that if this succession of the clergy be to be despised because it is not expressly required in scripture it undeniably follows that we may reject the scriptures as not being a standing rule of faith in all ages we way disuse the sacraments as not the ordinary means of grace in all ages since this is no more mentioned in the scriptures or expressly required than this uninterrupted succession  if it be a good argument against the necessity of episcopal ordainers that it is never said in scripture that there shall always be such ordainers it is certainly as conclusive against the use of the sacraments in every age that it is no where said in scripture they shall be used in all ages  if no government or order of the clergy be to be held as necessary because no such necessity is asserted in scripture it is certain this concludes as strongly against government and the order it self as against any particular order for it is no more said in scripture that there shall be an order of clergy than that there shall be any particular order therefore if this silence proves against any particular order of clergy it proves as much against order it self  should therefore any of your lordships friends have so much churchzeal as to contend for the necessity of some order though of no particular order he must fall under your lordships displeasure and be proved as mere a dreamer and trifler as those who assert the necessity of episcopal ordination for if it be plain that there need be no episcopal clergy because it is not said there shall always be episcopal clergy it is undeniably plain that there need be no order of the clergy since it is no where said there shall be an order of clergy therefore whoever shall contend for an order of clergy will be as much condemned by your lordships doctrine as he that declares for the episcopal clergy  the truth of the matter is this if nothing is to be esteemed of any moment but counted as mere trifle and nicety among christians which is not expressly required in the scriptures then it is a trifle and nicety whether we believe the scripture to be a standing rule of faith in all ages whether we use the sacraments in all ages whether we have any clergy at all whether we observe the lords day whether we baptize our children or whether we go to public worship for none of these things are expressly required in so many words in scripture but if your lordship with the rest of the christian world will take these things to be of moment and well proved because they are founded in scripture though not in express terms or under plain commands if you will acknowledge these matters to be well asserted because they may be gathered from scripture and are confirmed by the universal practice of the church in all ages which is all the proof that they are capable of i dont doubt but it will appear that this successive order of the clergy is founded on the same evidence and supported by as great authority so that it must be thought of the same moment with these things by all unprejudiced persons  for my lord though it be not expressly said that there shall always be a succession of episcopal clergy yet it is a truth founded in scripture it self and asserted by the universal voice of tradition in the first and succeeding ages of the church  it is thus founded in scripture there we are taught that the priesthood is a positive institution that no man can take this office unto himself that neither our savior himself nor his apostles nor any other person however extraordinarily endowed with gifts from god could as such exercise the priestly office till they had gods express commission for that purpose now how does it appear that the sacraments are positive institutions but that they are consecrated to such ends and effects as of themselves they were no way qualified to perform now as it appears from scripture that men as such however endowed were not qualified to take this office upon them without gods appointment it is demonstratively certain that men so called are as much to be esteemed a positive institution as elements so chosen can be called a positive institution all the personal abilities of men conferring no more authority to exercise the office of a clergyman than the natural qualities of water to make a sacrament so that the one institution is as truly positive as the other  again the order of the clergy is not only a positive order instituted by god but the different degrees in this order is of the same nature for we find in scripture that some persons could perform some offices in the priesthood which neither deacons nor priests could do though those deacons and priests were inspired persons and workers of miracles thus timothy was sent to ordain elders because none below his order who was a bishop could perform that office peter and john laid their hands on baptized persons because neither priests nor deacons though workers of miracles could execute that part of the sacerdotal office  now can we imagine that the apostles and bishops thus distinguished themselves for nothing that there was the same power in deacons and priests to execute those offices though they took them to themselves no my lord if three degrees in the ministry are instituted in scripture we are obliged to think them as truly distinct in their powers as we are to think that the priesthood it self contains powers that are distinct from those of the laity it is no more consistent with scripture to say that deacons or priests may ordain than that the laity are priests or deacons the same divine institution making as truly a difference betwixt the clergy as it does betwixt clergy and laity  now if the order of the clergy be a divine positive institution in which there are different degrees of power where some alone can ordain etc whilst others can only perform other parts of the sacred office if this as it plainly appears be a doctrine of scripture then it is a doctrine of scripture that there is a necessity of such a succession of men as have power to ordain for do the scriptures make it necessary that timothy or some bishop should be sent to ephesus to ordain priests because the priests who were there could not ordain and do not the same scriptures make it as necessary that timothys successor be the only ordainer as well as he was in his time will not priests in the next age be as destitute of the power of ordaining as when timothy was alive so that since the scriptures teach that timothy or persons of his order could alone ordain in that age they as plainly teach that the successors of that order can alone ordain in any age and consequently the scriptures plainly teach a necessity of an episcopal succession  the scriptures declare there is a necessity of a divine commission to execute the office of a priest they also teach that this commission can only be had from particular persons therefore the scriptures plainly teach there is a necessity of a succession of such particular persons in order to keep up a truly commissioned clergy  suppose when timothy was sent to ephesus to ordain elders the church had told him we have chose elders already and laid our hands upon them that if he alone was allowed to exercise this power it might seem as if he alone had it or that ministers were the better for being ordained by his particular hands and that some persons might imagine they could have no clergy except they were ordained by him or some of his order and that seeing christ had no where made an express law that such persons should be necessary to the ordination of the clergy therefore they rejected this authority of timothy lest they should subject themselves to niceties and trifles  will your lordship say that such a practice would have been allowed of in the ephesians or that ministers so ordained would have been received as the ministers of christ if not why must such practice or such ministers be allowed of in any afterages would not the same proceeding against any of timothys successors have deserved the same censure as being equally unlawful if therefore the scripture condemns all ordination but what is episcopal the scriptures make a succession of episcopal ordainers necessary so that i hope my lord we shall be no more told that this is a doctrine not mentioned in scripture or without any foundation in it  the great objection to this doctrine is that this episcopal order of the clergy is only an apostolical practice and seeing all apostolical practices are not binding to us sure this need not  in answer to this my lord i shall first show that though all apostolical practices are not necessary yet some may be necessary secondly that the divine unalterable right of episcopacy is not founded merely on apostolical practice  to begin with the first the objection runs thus all apostolical practices are not unalterable or obligatory to us therefore no apostolical practices are this my lord is just as theological as if i should say all scripturetruths are not articles of faith or fundamentals of religion therefore no scripturetruths are is not the argument full as just and solid in one case as the other may there not be that same difference between some practices of the apostles and others that there is betwixt some scripturetruths and others are all truths equally important that are to be found in the bible why must all practices be of the same moment that were apostolical now if there be any way either divine or humane of knowing an article of faith from the smallest truth or most indifferent matter in scripture they will equally assist us in distinguishing what apostolical practices are of perpetual obligation and what are not but it is a strange way of reasoning that some people are fallen into who seem to know nothing of moderation but jump as constantly out of one extreme into another as if there was no such thing as a middle way or any such virtue as moderation thus either the church must have an absolute uncontrollable authority or none at all we must either hold all apostolical practices necessary or none at all  again if no apostolical practices can be unalterable because all are not then no apostolical doctrines are necessary to be taught in all ages because all apostolical doctrines are not and we are no more obliged to teach the death satisfaction and resurrection of jesus christ than we are obliged to forbid the eating of blood and things strangled if we must thus blindly follow them in all their practices or else be at liberty to leave them in all we must for the same reason implicitly teach all their doctrines or else have a power of receding from them all  for if there be any thing in the nature of doctrines in the tenor of scripture or the sense of antiquity whereby we can know the difference of some doctrines from others that some were occasional temporary determinations suited to particular states and conditions in the church whilst others were such general doctrines as would concern the church in all states and circumstances if there can be this difference betwixt apostolical doctrines there must necessarily be the same difference betwixt apostolical practices unless we will say that their practices were not suited to their doctrines for occasional doctrines must produce occasional practices  now may not we be obliged by some practices of the apostles where the nature of the thing and the consent of antiquity show it to be equally necessary and important in all ages and conditions of the church without being tied down to the strict observance of every thing which the apostles did though it plainly appears that it was done upon accidental and mutable reasons can we not be obliged to observe the lords day from apostolical practice without being equally obliged to lock the doors where we are met because in the apostles times they locked them for fear of their enemies  my lord we are to follow the practices of the apostles as we ought to follow every thing else with discretion and judgment and not run headlong into every thing they did because they were apostles or yet think that because we need not practice after them in every thing we need do it in nothing we best imitate them when we act upon such reasons as they acted upon and neither make their occasional practices perpetual laws nor break through such general rules as will always have the same reason to be observed  if it be asked how we can know what practices must be observed and what may be laid aside i answer as we know articles of faith from lesser truths as we know occasional doctrines from perpetual doctrines that is from the nature of the things from the tenor of scripture and the testimony of antiquity  secondly it is not true that the divine unalterable right of episcopacy is founded merely upon apostolical practice  we do not say that episcopacy cannot be changed merely because we have apostolical practice for it but because such is the nature of the christian priesthood that it can only be continued in that method which god has appointed for its continuance thus episcopacy is the only instituted method of continuing the priesthood therefore episcopacy is unchangeable not because it is an apostolical practice but because the nature of the thing requires it a positive institution being only to be continued in that method which god has appointed so that it is the nature of the priesthood and not the apostolical practice alone that makes it necessary to be continued the apostolical practice indeed shows that episcopacy is the order that is appointed but it is the nature of the priesthood that assures us that it is unalterable and that because an office which is of no significancy but as it is of divine appointment and instituted by god can no otherways be continued but in that way of continuance which god has appointed  the argument proceeds thus the christian priesthood is a divine positive institution which as it could only begin by the divine appointment so it can only descend to after ages in such a method as god has beenpleased to appoint  the apostles and your lordship owns christ was in all that they did answer to dr snape instituted episcopacy alone therefore this method of episcopacy is unalterable not because an apostolical practice cannot be laid aside but because the priesthood can only descend to afterages in such a method as is of divine appointment  so that the question is not fairly stated when it is asked whether episcopacy being an apostolical practice may be laid aside but it should be asked whether an instituted particular method of continuing the priesthood be not necessary to be continued whether an appointed order of receiving a commission from god be not necessary to be observed in order to receive a commission from him if the case was thus stated as it ought to be fairly stated any one would soon perceive that we can no more lay aside episcopacy and yet continue the christian priesthood than we can alter the terms of salvation and yet be in covenant with god  i come now my lord to the second objection that this uninterrupted succession is subject to so great uncertainty that if it be necessary we can never say that we are in the church  i know no reason my lord why it is so uncertain but because it is founded upon historical evidence let it therefore be considered my lord that christianity it self is a matter of fact only conveyed to us by historical evidence  that the canon of scripture is only made known to us by historical evidence that we have no other way of knowing what writings are the word of god and yet the truth of our faith and every other means of grace depends upon our knowledge and belief of the scriptures must we not declare the necessity of this succession of bishops because it can only be proved by historical evidence and that for such a long tract of time  why then do we declare the belief of the scriptures necessary to salvation is not this equally putting the salvation of men upon a matter of fact supported only by historical evidence and making it depend upon things done seventeen hundred years ago cannot historical evidence satisfy us in one point as well as in the other is there any thing in the nature of this succession that it cannot be as well asserted by historical evidence as the truth of the scriptures is there not the same bare possibility in the thing it self that the scriptures may in some important points be corrupted as that this succession may be broke but is this any just reason why we should believe or fear that the scriptures are corrupted because there is a physical possibility of it though there is all the proof that can be required of the contrary why then must we set aside the necessity of this succession from a bare possibility of error though there is all the proof that can be required that it never was broken but strictly kept up  and though your lordship has told the world so much of the improbability nonsense and absurdity of this succession yet i prormise your lordship an answer when ever you shall think fit to show when or how or where this succession broke or seemed to break or was likely to break  and till then i shall content my self with offering this reason to your lordship why it is morally impossible it ever should have broken in all that term of years from the apostles to the present times  the reason is this it has been a received doctrine in every age of the church that no ordination was valid but that of bishops this doctrine my lord has been a constant guard upon the episcopal succession for seeing it was universally believed that bishops alone could ordain it was morally impossible that any persons could be received as bishops who had not been so ordained  now is it not morally impossible that in our church any one should be made a bishop without episcopal ordination is there any possibility of forging orders or satealing a bishopric by any other stratagem no it is morally impossible because it is an acknowledged doctrine amongst us that a bishop can only be ordained by bishops now as this doctrine must necessarily prevent any one being a bishop without episcopal ordination in our age so it must have the same effect in every other age as well as ours and consequently it is as reasonable to believe that the succession of bishiops was not broke in any age since the apostles as that it was not broke in our own kingdom within these forty years for the same doctrine which preserves it forty years may as well preserve it forty hundred years if it was equally believed in all that space of time that this has been the constant doctrine of the church i presume your lordship will not deny i have not here entered into the historical defense of it this and indeed every other institution of the christian church aving been lately so well defended from the ecclesiastical records by a very excellent and dicious writer  original draught of the primitive church we believe the scriptures are not corrupted because it was always a received doctrine in the church that they were the standing rule of faith and because the providence of god may well be supposed to preserve such books as were to coney to every age the means of salvation the ame reasons prove the great improbability that his succession should ever be broke both because it was always against a received doctrine  break it and because we may justly hope e providence of god would keep up his own nstitution  i must here observe that though your lordship often exposes the impossibility of this succeson yet at other times even you your self and our advocates assert it thus you tell us that the papists have one regular appointment or unterrupted succession of bishops undefiled with the uch of layhands preserv p  0   is this succession then such an improbable impossible thing and yet can your lordship assure  that it is at rome that though it beseventeen undred years old there yet that it is a true ne is it such absurdity and nonsense and every thing that is ridiculous when we lay claim to it and yet can your lordship assure us that it is not only possible to be but actually is in being in the church of rome what arguments or authority can your lordship produce to show that there is a succession there that will not equally prove it to be here  you assert expressly that there is a true succession there you deny that we have it here therefore your lordship must mean that we had not episcopal ordination when we separated from the church of rome and here the controversy must rest betwixt you and your adversaries whether we had episcopal ordination then for as your lordship has expressly affirmed that there is this uninterrupted succession in the church of rome it is impossible that we should want it unless we had not episcopal ordination at the reformation  whenever you lordship shall please to appear in defense of the naggshead story or any other pretense against our episcopal ordination when we departed for rome we shall beg leave to show our selves so far true protestants as to answer any popish arguments your lordship can produce  here let the common sense of the laity be once more appealed to your lordship tells them that an uninterrupted succession is improbable absurd and morally speaking impossible and for this reason they need not trouble their heads about it yet in another place you positively affirm that this true uninterrupted succession is actually in the church of rome that is they are to despise this succession because it never was or ever can be yet are co believe that it really is in the romish church my lord this comes very near saying and unsaying to the great diversion of the papists must they not not laugh at your lordships protestant zeal which might be much better called the spirit of popery must they not be highly pleased with all your banter and ridicule upon an uninterruped succession when they see you so kindly except theirs and think it only nonsense and absurdity when claimd by any other church surely my lord they must conceive great hopes of your lordship since you have here rather chse to contradict your self than not vouch for their succession for you have said it is morally impossible yet affirm that it is with them  the third objection against this uninterrupted succession is this that it is a popish doctrine and gives papists advantage over us  the objection proceeds thus we must not assert the necessity of this succession because the papists say it is only to be found with them i might add because some mighty zealous protestants say so too  but if this be good argumentation we ought not co tell the jews or deists etc that there is any necessity of embracing christianity because the papists say christians can only be saved in their church  again we ought not to insist upon a true fait because the papists say that a true faith is on in their communion so that there is just  much popery in teaching this doctrine as  asserting the necessity of christianity to a  or the necessity of a right faith to a socinian etc  i shall only trouble your lordship with a wor or two concerning another point in my forme letter i there proved that your lordship ha put the whole of our title to gods favou upon sincerity as such independent of ever thing else that no purity of worship no excellence of order no truth of faith no sort o sacraments no kind of institutions or any church as such can help us to the least degree of gods favor or give us the smallest advantage above any other communion and consequently that your lordship has set sincere jews quakers socinians muggletonians and all heretics and schismatics upon the same bottom as to the favor of god with sincere christians  upon this my lord i am called upon to prove that these several sorts of people can be sincere in your account of sincerity to which my lord i make this answer either there are some sincere persons amongst jews quakers socinians or any kind of heretics and schismatics or there are not if there are your lordship has given them the same title to gods favor that you have to the sincerest christians if you will say there are no sincere persons amongst any of them then your lordship damns them all in the gross for surely corruptions in religion professed with unsincerity will never save people  i have nothing to do to prove the sincerity of any of them if they are sincere what i have said is true if you will not allow them to be sincere you condemn them all at once  again i humbly supposed a man might be sincere in his religious opinions though it might be owing to some ill habits or something criminal in himself that he was fallen into such or such a way of thinking bus it seems this is all contradiction and no man can be sincere who has any faults or whose faults have any influence upon his way of thinking  your lordship tells all the dissenters that they may be easy if they are sincere and that it is the only ground for peace and satisfaction but pray my lord if none are to be esteemed sincere but those who have no faults or whose faults have no influence upon their persuasions who can be assured that he is sincere but he that has the least pretense to it the proud pharisee if your lordship or your advocates were desired to prove your sincerity either before god or man it must be for these reasons because you have no ill passions or habits no faulty prejudices no past or present vices that can have any effect upon your minds my lord as this is the only proof that any of you could give of your own sincerity in this meaning of it so the very pretense to it would prove the wane of it  finis books printed for and sold by w innys at the princes arms in st pauls churchyard physicotheology or a demonstration of the
