elegy is with the greatest respect inscribed by his lordships obliged and humble servant  the author  the nun with each perfection dawning on her mind all beautys treasure opening on her cheek each flattering hope subdued each wish resigned does gay ophelia this lone mansion seek say gentle maid what prompts thee to forsake the paths thy birth and fortune strew with flowers through natures kind endearing ties to break and waste in cloistered walls thy pensive hours let sober thought restrain thine erring zeal that guides thy footsteps to the vestal gate lest thy soft heart this friendship bids reveal like mine unblest should mourn like mine too late does some angelic lonelywhispring voice some sacred impulse or some dream divine approve the dictates of thy early choice  approach with confidence the aweful shrine there kneeling at yon altars marble base while tears of rapture from thine eyelid steal and smiling heaven illumes thy soul with grace pronounce the vow thou never can repeal yet if misled by falseentitled friends who say  that peace with all her comely train from starry regions to this clime descends smooths every frown and softens every pain that vestals tread contentments flowery lawn approved of innocence by health carest that robbed in colors bright by fancy drawn celestial hope sits smiling at their breast suspect their siren song and artful style their pleasing sounds some treacherous thought conceal full often does pride with sainted voice beguile and sordid interest wear the mask of zeal a tyrantabbess here perchance may reign who fond of power affects the imperial nod looks down disdainful on her female train and rules the cloister with an iron rod reflection sickens at the lifelong tie backglancing memory acts her busy part its charms the world unfolds to fancys eye and sheds allurement on the wishful heart lo discord enters at the sacred porch rage in her frown and terror on her crest even at the hallowed lamps she lights her torch and holds it flaming to each virgin breast but since the legends of monastic bliss by fraud are fabled and by youth believed unbought experience learn from my distress oh mark my lot and be no more deceived three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled when i was torn from every weeping friend a thoughtless victim to the temple led and blush ye parents by a fathers hand yet then what solemn scenes deceived my choice the pealing organs animating sound the choral virgins captivating voice the blazing altar and the priests around the train of youths arrayed in purest white who scattered myrtles as i passed along the thousand lamps that poured a flood of light the kiss of peace from all the vestal throng the golden censers tossed with graceful hand whose fragrant breath arabian odor shed of meekeyd novices the circling band with blooming chaplets wove around their head  my willing soul was caught in raptures flame while sacred ardor glowed in every vein methought applauding angels sung my name and heavens unsullied glories gilt the fane this temporary transport soon expired my drooping heart confessed a dreadful void ever since alas abandoned uninspird i tread this dome to misery allied no wakening joy informs my sullen breast through opening skies no radiant seraph smiles no saint descends to sooth my soul to rest no dream of bliss the dreary night beguiles here hagard discontent still haunts my view the sombre genius reigns in every place arrays each virtue in the darkest hue chills every prayer and cancels every grace i meet her ever in the chearless cell the gloomy grotto and unsocial wood i hear her ever in the midnight bell the hollow gale and hoarseresounding flood this caused a mothers tender tears to flow the sad remembrance time shall never erase when having sealed the irrevocable vow i hastened to receive her last embrace fullwell she then presaged my wretched fate the unhappy moments of each future day when locked within this terrorshedding grate my joydeserted soul would pine away yet never did her maternal voice unfold this cloistered scene in all its horror dressed nor did she then my trembling steps withhold when here i entered a reluctant guest ah could she view her only child betrayed and let submission over her love prevail the unfeeling priest why did she not upbraid forbid the vow and rend the hovering veil alas she might not  her relentless lord had sealed her lips and chid her streaming tear so anguish in her breast concealed its hoard and all the mother sunk in dumb despair but thou who ownst a fathers sacred name what act impelled thee to this ruthless deed what crime had forfeited my filial claim and given oh blasting thought thy heart to bleed if then thine injured child deserve thy care oh haste and bear her from this lonesome gloom in vain  no words can sooth his rigid ear and gallias laws have riveted my doom ye cloistered fair  ye censurebreathing saints suppress your taunts and learn at length to spare though mid these holy walls i vent my plaints and give to sorrow what is due to prayer i fled not to this mansions deep recess to veil the blushes of a guilty shame the tenor of an illspent life redress and snatch from infamy a sinking name yet let me to my fate submissive bow from fatal symptoms if i right conceive this stream ophelia has not to flow this voice to murmur and this breast to heave ah when extended on the untimely bier to yonder vault this form shall be conveyed thou wilt not refuse to shed one grateful tear and breathe the requiem to my fleeting shade with pious footstep join the sable train as through the lengthening isle they take their way a glimmering taper let thy hand sustain thy soothing voice attune the funeral lay behold the minister who lately gave the sacred veil in garb of mournful hue more friendly office bending over my grave and sprinkling my remains with hallowed dew as over the corse he strews the rattling dust the sternest heart will raise compassions sigh even then no longer to his child unjust the tears may trickle from a fathers eye finis
