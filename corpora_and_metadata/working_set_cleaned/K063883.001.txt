curll at the dial and bible against st dunstans church in fleetstreet      price five shillings  the preface the public having given a general approbation of the late trial between the marquis de gesvres and his lady as indeed so nice and curious a subject deserved i was inclined to search our own law books and historians to see what adjudgd cases and precedents we had of the same nature  that which is the most considerable in our english history was the case of the earl of essex and the lady howard a case that engaged the politics of the greatest statesmen and the casuistry of a monarch himself there has as yet been a great defect of information concerning this case which the reader will now find supplied from an original manuscript of archbishop abbots written in his own hand this manuscript contains an exact account of all the artifice and stratagem used in that affair and is not only very full and particular upon the case but lets us into a considerable part of the secrets and politics of king jamess reign i must assure the public that it is faithfully printed from the original which is now in the hands of a learned lawyer  to make a collection of this nature as perfect as i well could there is added the lord audleys trial and the proceedings upon the duke of norfolks bill of divorce which as they bear some relation to this subject so they are now very rare and valuable the duke of norfolks case in particular employed some of our greatest lawyers who have made since very eminent figures in their profession and contains all that can be said upon the article

touching the nullity between the earl of essex and his lady pronounced sept         at lambeth and the difficulties endured in the same being at the court at white hall on the   th of may      or thereabouts his majesty moved me that i would be a commissioner in a controversy to be begun between the earl of essex and his lady for the separating of them and when his majesty had ended those few words with me my lord chamberlain who was then in the gallery spoke also unto me to that purpose it was unto me a matter very strange having heard before of some discontentments between that noble couple but never imagining that matters were come to that head my answer was alike to both that i did not know the ground whereupon they intended to move but that if i were to be a judge in any such question i would pray that other bishops being near the town and court might be joined with me the persons that were named then were my lord of london my lord of ely and my lord of litchfield for at that time was my lord of bath with the queens majesty at bath besides i prayed both the kings majesty and my lord chamberlain that before any such thing were entered into i might speak privately with my lord of essex for the satisfying of mine own mind which by both was permitted unto me the day after i sent for the earl and having private speech with him only about the ability of his body and nothing else i found him generally much reserved in talk but only avowing the ability of himself for generation and that he was resolved never to lay any blemish upon himself that way i knew not well what to make of this for i did not then understand that some lords had met before at white hall on both parts the lord privy seal the lord chamberlain the earl of southampton and the lord knowles as afterward i heard to settle an order by consent how this prosecution should be that is to say that a separation should be made and my lords honor every way preserved  within a day or two coming to white hall i had speech with the lord chamberlain in the gallery going toward st jamess park i might not reveal all particulars of that which passed in private but yet i told his lordship that i had spoken with the earl of essex and i perceived it was like to be a matter of great difficulty and therefore wished his lordship to be well advised before any thing was brought into public i told him that he must proceed either upon confession or proof that it was probable the earl would not confess his own impotency for then he blemished himself that my ladys oath in that case was not sufficient and how other proofs might be had i could not conceive that the earl in open estimation was to be thought an able man that his father was not thought in that kind unsufficient the lord chamberlain replied that perhaps the fathers sin was punished upon the son that it was truth that the earl had no ink in his pen that himself had confessed that he could not know a woman and that before diverse noblemen and some of them his own friends naming as i remember the earls of northampton and worcester and the lord knowles all this while i never dreamed of impotentia versus hanc but conceived that they would charge the earl simply with disability the lord chamberlain then seemed unto me fully resolved to procceed and told me whom he would have in the commission the bishops of london ely and litchfield the two chancellors of the exchequer and duchy my judges for so he called them sir daniel dun sir john bennet dr james and dr edwards i told his lordship that i liked the persons very well the next news i heard was about a day or two after that the commission was out under the great seal which i wondered at by reason that i thought that my words to the lord chamberlain being well weighed would have moved some longer consideration well the commission is brought it is accepted and proceeding decreed the earl of essex is called the libel is put in when we saw it and that it contained impotentia versus hanc most of us who were not acquainted with the project before were much amazed at it i told the council for my lady that they had laid a very narrow bridge for themselves to go over so said my lord of london and diverse of the rest only my lord of ely was still silent my lord of litchfield two several times uttered speeches as much grieving and repining at this controversy that he was ordinary to the earl of essex and had been in his house at chartely which he saw to be well governed and the earl did bear himself most religiously therein to his great comfort that his wife had the honor to be cousin germain to the countess of suffolk and therefore he had no reason but to wish well to the earl of essex and his lady both yet if he had been worthy to be consulted withal he should have thought that seven years had been little enough to have deliberated whether it were fit to bring such a business into question before the world another time he told us that it was very good that we should proceed with great wariness in this cause for says he the world looks on us what we do and there were not more eyes upon the earls father losing his head than there be upon the earl now losing his wife he told me afterward that he had ill will for those speeches and complained that some among us did tell tales of all that was said and done and so it appeared afterward that sir j caesar and sir daniel dun did sir thomas parry in all his speeches privately murmured against this nullity till he came to windsor where the day that the king heard us the lord chamberlain in my presence spoke privately with him and sir julius caesar about this matter and from that time forward mr chancellor of the duchy was altered my lord of ely also for a great while was in dislike of the separation as i have credibly heard he opened himself to sir henry savile until such time as the king spoke with him and then his judgment was reformed but truth it is that among us he said nothing  now the earls answer is taken which appears in it there were diverse things very observable he used no ill speech of his lady for which we all much commended him i gave him so strict a charge to speak the truth requiring him as he would answer me before god at the last day to deliver nothing for favor or affection but to inform us in the verity that it wrung from him something which i supposed he intended not to speak so plainly he gave the reason of his having no motions to know his lady carnally and of his thinking that he never should when i came out of france i loved her i do not so now neither ever shall i when he was to answer to the article that she was virgo incorrupta he smiled and said she says so and she is so for me sir daniel dun caught these words and bid the register set down then credit articulum esse verum these things gave me no great encouragement to the business but yet being at very little leisure i let matters go on and in mine own part resolved nothing then the witnesses were deposed but not published the inspectresses were chosen who came most unwillingly unto it and howsoever sir julius caesar and sir daniel dun whom we never suspected to be as parties in the cause as afterward they appeared to be made all clear and fair weather yet my lord of london told us openly that he being with them found that the ladies knew not well what to make of it that they had no skill nor knew not what was the truth but what they said was upon the credit of the midwives which were but two and i knew not how tampered with then came the lady francis to take her oath with the seven compurgators i noted therein some things a paper was brought containing verbis praecisis what her ladyship would swear we saw it and considered it and found it too bare and slight to enforce any thing the commissioners advised that it should be more full dr steward accordingly drew it but he must go forth to the lady to know whether she would swear it at last it was agreed unto when she came to subscribe it after the oath taken one or two of her brothers standing at her back put her in mind that she must not write her name francis essex which she most willingly remembered and subscribed francis howard we saw my lord of litchfields wife to be one of the seven we were afterward informed very credibly that the lady knevet had declared her sorrow that she was used in such an action and said that she wept all the day about it these things pleased me little that nobody took comfort in the business  things go on in a course till midsummerday then did the king deal with me privately as if he had received diverse complaints against me the first was that we delayed the proceeding in as much as the meeting was put off from the    th of june till the   d or   d of july my answer was we had rather gone too fast we had sat forenoon and afternoon the term now grew to an end and we had many businesses to dispatch of the kings that the commissionday for causes ecclesiastical was put off for a week by reason of midsummerday falling on a thursday and consequently that our proceeding in this cause which commonly attended the other commission was of necessity to be deferred but my principal answer was that we could not shorten it for the council on both parts bad agreed upon that day in july and so it was upon the acts howsoever therefore the council for my lady moved openly in court to abreviate the time yet the council for my lord would not renounce nor alter their term probatory but kept them close unto it another objection was that i acquainted not the king from time to time how matters did go i answered that i knew not my self for as yet there was no publication of witnesses when any thing came to my knowledge his majesty should understand it it was added that diverse persons repaired unto me who wished not well to the business belike said i they mean the earl of southampton who came in the other day when we were all sitting together but his coming was about john cotton s cause and i never had a word with him in all my life touching this business no said the king and smiled it is sir henry nevile indeed quoth i he was with me the other day and this very morning but your majesty well knows what was the reason it was touching that cause which your majesty commanded me to send for him about i delivered him your mind the one day and he gave me an answer the other at this time his majesty cast out some words as if he wished well to the nullity but it was so obscurely that i did not conceive that earnestly he desired it after this day the complaints were many which were made to the king against me and many threats were used and diverse tricks were played to urge me to yield to the nullity one was that i should suffer the earl of essex to go out of town i answered he had made his answer and had his proctor and it was our custom then not to stay men his majesty commanded me to enquire if his presence were not necessary and if it were then i should stay him i sent to sir daniel dun to sir john bennet and to dr steward and they all agreed that there was no need of his lordships being in town and of this i sent word to the lord chamberlain and my lord of essex was permitted to depart one while it was given out that i was moved by the queen to cross them when in truth i had not spoke with her thereabout another while that i had spoke with the earl of essex at first and hence his lordship grew less pliable when they knew what about it was and were told of it before and it was not forgotten that when i gave charge to the earl of essex to answer truly to the positions in the libel i named the case of my lord of devonshire and the lady rich as if i had compared this cause unto theirs when afterward the earls council took exception to the libel it was given out that they were animated by me to oppose whereas i never spoke with them nor knew any thing of their purpose and ever that was one that there were delays used yea it was to my face delivered as a threat that archbishop grindall had been overthrown for not giving consent to the divorce of dr julio as implying that the same would be my case  about this time the lords and the rest of the feofees were to meet at mr suttons hospital about the settling of it the day that we were to come thither my lord chamberlain in the privygallery at white hall showed his anger toward me that we had not sent for the keys to his lordship and that he might deliver over the cause but when i came to the charter house there was delivered me a letter written all with my lords own hand and directed to the lord archbishop the lord chancellor and the lord privy seal wherein he did twice take exception to me by name and in a sort braved me that so he might pick a quarrel to me whereunto i replied not but bore it with patience  a little before whitsontide his lordship was very kind to me and of his own accord proffered me a chamber at greenwich which my lord my predecessor had but after twice proffering of it and my accepting of the same his lordship fell off strangely and i never spoke of it more these complaints and threats made me to suspect all was not well for what needed these things to me in a matter of justice  the time now grew on that his majesty was to go abroad in progress on a sunday which was the day before the council for my lord were to put in their answers and exceptions to the libel the lord privy seal showed me a letter of the kings to his lordship wherein he was to expostulate with me for delaying the business i gave his lordship answer what was done and he professed that his lordship was satisfied and that no man could do more than i did on the monday the council for my lord put in their answer which was round and picquant the lord chamberlain had notice of it and complained thereof to the king i sent his majesty the copy thereof and received from the king a letter written all with his majestys own hand showing dislike thereof at that time sir william button threatened sir daniels servant hard for that answer as the said sir daniel diverse weeks after told me the commissioners considered of the answer and disallowed it giving order that no record should remain of it but that it should be utterly defaced this was very well accepted and now my lord of canterbury was a very honest man but till this was done their followers gave out that the king had in two letters so schooled the archbishop as he was never schooled in all his life  things now being quiet i called sir william button one commissionday unto me and spoke thus to him sir william button you have followed this business from the first and have been present at the acting of all things have you ever seen me in word or deed done any matter that does not become me for indeed hitherto i had no way declared my self because we were not come to consider of the proofs what is then the cause that i am thus complained upon that i cannot one day be quiet his answer unto me was that the lord chamberlain was every way a kind father to his children but in this of his daughter he was so passionate till it had an end that he lay as on a gridiron broiling till the matter were accomplished quoth i it shall not be delayed by me now the council on both sides grew on to inform us wherein i noted that whereas the libel was laid in nature of maleficium versus hanc my ladys council upon the shutting up of the cause would not apply themselves thereunto neither would they willingly hear of it which seemed strange since all the books which they brought particularly to the cause did mention that and doctor steward had publicly and expressively said that it was that which they did mean this troubled me somewhat because i perceived that they themselves could not tell what to make of it but afterward fell out another matter which very much alienated my judgment from the cause it appeared that sentence could not be given till the time that the king entering his progress was gone as far as windsor and then his majesty was soon to depart to farnam sir daniel dun told us that he was to attend the king in progress that he must be at farnam that he was old and lame that it would be too great a trouble for him to come back again at the day of sentence he therefore prayed that we would hear him deliver his judgment of the whole matter this proffer seemd wondrous strange to most of us and putting it by handsomely we resolved not to trouble him therewith and in this opinion we arose but afterward my lord of litchfield comes to my study door where i and my lord of london were about another business and tells us that my lord of ely and mr chancellor of the exchequer were very desirous to hear sir daniel speak and that he for his part was of the mind that it would do very well and therefore he importuned us both to give consent unto it we imagining no great harm could come thereby assented and the next day is appointed for that purpose there sir daniel comes with a formal declaration divided into six parts to every one of which he spoke so largely that with a little replying of ours it spent a whole afternoon matters which i most observed therein were these he told us that by our commission we might hear this cause summarily he brought a book that he who has power to hear a matter summarily is in nature of an arbiter chosen by both parties and therefore may judge in discretion as he shall think fit and more to that purpose i thought with my self that this was strange doctrine in a matter of marriage that as arbitrators we might adjudge a wife to her husband or not adjudge her according to our discretion in his discoursing of my lords impotency versus hanc he beat upon the matter of maleficium and yet by no means he would have it to be that apparently he insisted much that the sentence was to be given in general terms not naming any particular impotency i told him in such a sentence the world look that we should yield a reason of that which we did he replied that it was fit to give no reason and here said mr chancellor of the exchequer a judge is not to give a reason of his sentence but only to god i would give no reason to any prince in the world i was once called before queen elizabeth about a sentence which i gave and she demanded of me the reason thereof i told her a judge was bound to give no reason of that which he pronounced but only to god i marvelld much at these things and at last replied well let it be we acquaint not the world with the reason of that which we do yet is it not fit that i who am the judge and must pronounce the sentence know the ground of that which i am to pronounce here after a little pausing one of them said yes for you may see that in the books and depositions quoth i but i cannot see that there which may satisfy me but mr chancellor said i and sir daniel dun commissioners you perhaps be not driven to it yet i shall be forced of necessity to tell men the reason of the sentence for as soon as this cause is sentenced every man who is discontented with his wise and every woman discontented with her husband which can have any reasonable pretense will repair to me for such nullities if i yield unto them here will be strange violations of marriages if i do not i must not tell them that it was fit for my lord of essex but it is not so for you for the law knows no persons but is indifferent to all if i then repel them i must show a reason your case is not like that of my lord of essex for his case was thus yours is thus and so must i deliver the reason or men will not be answered in this time of debating i askd sir daniel dun i pray you master of the requests what examples have we of any nullity in england pronounced in this kind might a man see any precedent of it for i would be loath to do a thing that never was done before yes says he there be precedents thereof in anne of cleves case we have an example and another in one berry which i have here in my book and thereupon out of a notebook of his own he read now a line or two and then two or three other lines in another place and so forward my answer was i did not think that king henry s separation from anne of cleve was for any such matter but upon a precontract i said king henry the viiith was a strange prince in that kind he put himself into many marriages and when he began that with anne of cleve he feared least the emperor and king of france should combine with the pope against him and therefore he was desirous to strengthen himself with the protestant princes in germany and for that he thought this marriage was much behoveful but afterward growing into peace with one or both of those princes he grew soon weary of the marriage because he liked not the woman but then i promised to consider further of these two cases this was the end of that days labor which when at night i had recounted with my self i thought it was an audacious part for such a one as sir daniel was to teach us out of such poor grounds both what to do and how to do i found by my observation that it was a set match that thus he should be heard that he was prepared for the purpose for no man upon the sudden or one days warning could deliver so much and so digested and now i began to assure my self that he did not show himself a judge but was a stickler for the nullity i much suspected the conscience of the man knowing him reasonably well before both out of mine own estimation of him and out of the judgment of my two predecessors the lords whitgift and bancroft who held him for a man most corrupt yet the next day i sent unto him for his notebook and i caused the record of anne of cleve to be brought unto me reading over all the latter i found not one word tending to the present case good lord thought i how does this man deceive me perusing his own book for that of berry i found it to be nothing but the pleadings of advocates on both sides when about the  0 of eliz there was some question in the common law courts about berrys land berry himself being dead many years before but i saw more in this book against the cause now in hand than for it and by some other writings in my house i discovered that berrys divorce anno      was for want of his stones which dr steward also being now of council for my lady and who formerly stood for berrys brother against the supposed son publicly acknowledged these things made me in my heart much dislike the cause and procured in me a hard opinion touching sir daniel dun who should not have wronged me being my officer as dean of the arches  within few days after the message comes to us that we were all to attend the king at windsor this accordingly was done the morning before the hearing the lord chamberlain in my presence spoke first earnestly with the chancellor of the exchequer and afterward with the chancellor of the duchy who that day fell from us as appeared by the few words that he had before the king some few days before that had sir john bennet by sir william button and dr edwards been otherwise dealt withal earnestly to give consent to the nullity but that day we dealt in it more than three hours his majesty propounding the matter asked how things did stand sir julius caesar said that sir daniel dun was best able to speak unto it and then ex composito sir daniel begins and tells a great tale and especially insisteth upon non potnit when he had done i answered him and showed the want of ground for that conclusion out of other the earls evident answers that the non potuit was for lack of love and not for want of ability i challenged sir daniel for abusing the king with a false report and especially for his two precedents of berrys case and that of anne of cleve amongst us was diverse ways showed the insufficiency of the proofs that the libel was laid short of the cause and the proofs were short of the libel that we had very many times called upon the council for my lady that they should look that they rightly laid their matter and made their proof strong that in the end they complained not of the judges when the fault was in themselves where my lord of litchfield added that himself fearing the worst had gone to the doctorscommons and warned the council for my lady that they should look to it among other things there uttered sir daniel dun said what a disgrace will this be to my lord chamberlain and his daughter if it should not now go forward my answer was they should have looked to that before they did begin it we were not the men that set the matter on foot if it were a disgrace they put it on themselves but quoth i must i to save any man from disgrace send my soul unto hell to give a sentence whereof i saw no ground i will never do it my lord of london sir john bennet and dr edwards did carry themselves well that day although sir john bennet had much opposition from the king himself when we saw the king earnest i fell down on my knee and with tears in mine eyes i said i beseech your majesty if ever i have done you any service whom i do serve with a faithful heart or may do you any service rid me of this business i had said before that i was the unfittest man that might be to judge of such a cause i was no married man i was no lawyer and i had not had the time by reason of my infinite businesses to read so much of that matter as other men had i observed that day many things in his majestys carriage of the matter he was earnest but gracious and moderate he found fault with the libel and said that complaints were made that we went too slow but he perceived we went too fast he marvelld that my lord of worcester and the lord knowles were not examined as witnesses he constantly professd that he believed that my lord of essex was impotent for a woman he told us that some of the earls friends had put a woman to him and he would not touch her his majesty said that the earl was once purposed to have gone to poland to have tried whither he might be unwitched to which things my reply was i would to god we might see these things legally proved that his majesty much disliked that course and therefore he set the course now in prosecution and therefore if there were any error in it he had done the lord chamberlain wrong and he must take it upon him in sum i found his majesty much troubled what to do as i gathered especially by these words if my lord of canterbury and my lord of london have a negative voice we must either begin all again and have a new libel or we must have a new commission and put other adjuncts the conclusion from his majesty was that we should all meet at lambeth on the morrow and if we could unanimously consent then go to the sentence if not we should put it off unto another day and certify him of it and so farther understand his pleasure when the king was risen from his chair he fell to inveighing against these marryings of young couples before they be acquainted one with another he told us the inconvenience of it how he knew in scotland a father who married his only child to a man against her will that she withstood it yet her father forced her to marry him that being gone home with her husband after a very few days she came run away from him that her father jerkd her and sent her home again that not long after she poisoned her husband and was burnt for it while the king was in scotland after his majestys going out i followed him and told him i evidently perceived that it was in the earl of essex vitium animi non corporis his majesty swore he thought so there passed some other speech from the king to me touching his own lying with the queen the first night that he married her but at the last i kissed his hand and departed after i was gone the lord chamberlain speaking somewhat against me the king replied the archbishop has so adjurd me to be rid of this matter that i cannot tell what to say to him this did sir julius caesar tell me that day at dinner at eaton college letting me know that the king found no fault with me but afterward the king coming to dinner after his meat had stayed for him on the table more than a quarter of an hour he sat him down in his chair and casting his leg over one side of it he eat no meat for a great space of time neither said he any word but sat musing to himself which every man observed and it was given out by some in the court that i was gone away in the kings displeasure within some few days after it was also more ways than one brought credibly to my ears that the archbishop and my lord of london should be hereafter kept to their spiritualities and should meddle no more in temporal matters and within a while it came so far as that they should have their temporalities taken from them sir john bennet was at windsor moved by sir thomas lake in the lord fentons name and afterward by the lord fenton himself that he should alter his opinion and make his peace with the king for his majesty was not well pleased with him  as i came homeward from windsor in my coach and all that same night two things did run much in my mind the one of them was what a strange and fearful thing it was that his majesty should be so far engaged in that business that he should profess that himself had set the matter in that course of judgment that the judges should be dealt withal before and in a sort directed what they should determine that the like example had not been seen that his majesty did win himself much honor in the case of suttons hospital that notwithstanding all importunity he had suffered the judges to do their conscience this strange moving to the contrary did make me marvelously suspect that it was no direct matter and as a dutiful servant to my most gracious master i wished in my heart that his majestys hand might be taken off the business the other point was that we had all this while in our debatings never or very little meddled with points of divinity and i thought with my self that much might be said therein against maleficium and the nullity to be pronounced thereupon versus hanc for out of this we could never get in all our talking though they would never cleave fast to it i therefore having formerly revolved some such things in my mind rose early on the day that we were to debate things at large and set down my mind in writing out of something in divinity the copy of this appears the day after we came from windsor being tuesday we met and all the forenoon we insisted on that which i had briefly written but to deliver my conscience freely before god i received no kind or show of satisfaction my lord of ely sat little less than dumb as if he had never dreamed of any such matter diverse of the commissioners wondered at him that he who had spent so much time in reading of the canonists touching this question should not think upon divinity briefly up and down by others somewhat was said but nothing to contentment after dinner sir john bennet propounded reasons out of the law but without any satisfaction i observed two special points that afternoon the one was that we all thought my lord of essex his answer to the libel was neither plain nor sufficient and now it was remembered that my lord of litchfield had put to him certain questions that four things were necessary to generation membrum virile erection penetration and ejaculatio seminis which although they were then smiled at and since that time much sport had been made at the court and in london about them yet now our married men on all hands wished that punctually his lordship might have been held to give his answer unto them this instructed me that the proofs were not full a second thing was that when toward the evening i wished that a reconciliation might be labored between my lord and my lady that it should best become us my lord of ely who from the first beginning of the process had been always very silent spoke home about that much disliking that any such thing should now be sought that it was too late that it might be the cause of poisoning and destroying one of another to bring them together again well when we could not agree upon our conclusion we were enforced to put all off unto a longer day and as the king commanded i was to certify his majesty of it i wrote a letter to the king praying humbly that i might be freed from the trouble of this cause or at least give no sentence in it till i were a married man and so might better understand the business i enclosed also six reasons of sir john bennets taking exceptions in law against the nullity and withal i joined mine own reasons in divinity of which i said in my letter that i knew not where to seek an answer to them meaning that the commissioners had given me none these reasons afterward cost me a great deal of trouble  the next progress in this controversy was that i was advertised that it was his majestys pleasure that the cause should be put off until the   th of september and withal there was brought a new commission of adjuncts whereinto my lords of winchester and rochester were put the day that i perceived this acquainting the two chancellors of the exchequer and duchy therewith in the gallery at lambeth i told them that i hoped now that for my part i should be freed from any trouble therein farther for i did desire to be rid of it they both answered me that they desired in like sort to be quit of the matter a good business thought i that no body takes comfort of it unless it be sir daniel dun of whom i forgot before to note that on the day of meeting next after our coming from windsor he with a great deal of insolency challenged me for my speech before his majesty the day before do not abuse the king sir daniel dun i remembered it was in mine own house and if i had rattld him according to his deserts my lord chamberlain would have said it had been done for his sake and in the progress sir daniel having the kings ear would have made things worse than they were and i therefore forbore him with such patience that some of the commissioners told me afterward that they wondered how i could endure those behaviors at the hands of a man of his quality but yet they commended me for it now grew i to consider what were the reasons why these two commissioners were joined to us and therein i had many advertisements from diverse friends diverse ways we resolved for my lord of winton that it was supposed that there was no great amity between him and me that when i was dean there there was some disagreement between us which they supposed yet continued that he had an old grudge to me for having the archbishopric which his lordship so much desired besides it was some tickling unto him that his gravity and learning should either win in the archbishop or lay some blemish upon him if he stood out certain it is that sir william button was with him and doubtless would tell him how acceptable this service would be to his majesty i heard of good credit and secretly that he was put in hope to be made a privycounsellor and the fame was general that for the fathers labor the son should be made a knight it seems at the first that he had no great fancy unto it but being wrought upon he consented so that he might be required by his majesty to be present this was done by a letter from salisbury which at his being at lambeth he showed me that i should take notice that he had not come unless he had been commanded i leave him for the time only signifying that in the vacation he sent for diverse books from london and had dr steward much with him to inform him in all particulars yet i may not forget that while he held off his consent some hard opinions were raised of him at court as i found by a letter from my lord of litchfield to me for there he was found fault with that he attended not the king at farnham or at andover and there blame was laid that mr love who was so great with my lord of winton was like to get the wardens place at winchester dr harmar being reported to be dead concerning the bishop of rochester it was well known that he had opened himself before the kings going in progress that he liked well of the nullity coming once or twice while we were about it he with some in my house disputed earnestly for it he was a great dependant of my lord of litchfield this was a way to make him well esteemed and to arise high in preferment but in truth he should not have verified the report which archbishop bancroft on his deathbed gave of him together with butler and carrier to the king by a message unless he did some such thing when he was put into the commission he in diverse places seemed to be much offended that he was made one his grief was that he was set in opposition against me he would never give his voice to it unless i consented these and the like things he spoke as elsewhere so to some of my servants in my house at croydon for under another color he came three times in the vacation to me but i never spoke a word with him about that matter as knowing it would be an argument against me that i labored to draw away the kings commissioners and the end showed that i had no great reason to trust him besides these two adjuncts the new commission it self seemed very strange unto me there were eight made of the quorum and it was so laid that if three of them with two other consented the sentence might be given so that by the words thereof if seven had denied five might have pronounced and prevailed a matter so uncooth that as i credibly heard my lord of winton himself found much fault therewith again there was a clause legibus statutis ordinationibus constitutionibus quibuscunque non obstantibus so resolved they were to have it dispatched every thing now stood at a pause and my lord of ely who at first delivered his judgment against it to sir henry savile as i heard it avowed upon good credit but afterward said he was better instructed by the king began to hearken what men said of the matter as appeared by speech which he had with sir john paiton to whom notwithstanding he told some things of the insufficiency of my lord of essex the weather grew fair he hoped the overflowing of the isle of ely would cease he would go down in his visitation he came and took his leave of me but not one word of the nullity  now was his majesty abroad and i had more leisure to consider of this question i read what i could i conferred with many men about diverse circumstances so to inform my self the better i prayed frequently to god to direct me aright i often perused the depositions but i found little satisfaction i perceived most of the lords had a great dislike of this proceeding that the better sort of men had generally a detestation of it that the judges and lawyers much condemned it i heard many strange stories of the ladys carriage something was freely spoken of a woman arraigned at bury and how to shut that up and so to free the earl this course was consented upon  these things though out of charity i entertained not as absolutely true yet the concurrence of them from so many made me that i could not contemn them besides now grew the rumor strong that a new husband was readily provided for her whereof i called to mind the opinion of sir henry nevile delivered to me at windsor and i did not forget a speech of overburys once to me in that kind i understood that at christmas last there was a reconciliation wrought between the earl and his lady howsoever it fell out yea that when the lords met at white hall about the manner of separation there was three times that day a likelihood to make them friends which we thought implied no disability of my lord of essex even in their own opinion i farther understood that whereas it was whispered among us the commissioners that at christmas last my lord of essex being in bed with his lady should labor a quarter of an hour carnally to know her and in the end should say frankey it will not be and so kissed her and bid her good night that this was not true but that the earl the night before his going from london at the end of trinity term said with tears in his eyes that when he went to bed to her at christmas last he had forgiven all things as clearly as he wished that god should forgive him his sins but when they were alone she reviled him and miscalled him terming him cow and coward and beast and he added that she was as bitter a woman as any was in the world which things so cooled his courage that he was far from knowing or endeavoring to know her these matters together with the small joy which the commissioners had to deal in the business made me have no great fancy unto it on the other side i heard that my lord chamberlain or his followers gave out that what was done was performed by the kings direction otherwise it had not been begun and therefore they expected that his majesty should see it effected that they rested themselves on him i was much grieved that they had this advantage on my master who being so engaged as i thought could not well go backward or forward and to increase my sorrow i was privately advertised from court that his majesty did mean himself to give an answer to my reasons abovementioned i heard another way that his majesty in the progress wrote much with his own hands from another friend i was told that the king with his answer to the reasons had written to me a sharp letter yea by another i learned the contents of the letter which was full of sharpness  these things in the summer kept me full of expectation of some great coffeehouse yet my heart still assured me that i was guilty of no wickedness i found all persons with whom i spoke of my mind for the dislike of the nullity in many businesses to and from the king by letters i found nothing but well his majesty sent me warrants for three bucks as formerly he had done and with some kindness joined  thus i was tossed in my thoughts and in all my troubles i had recourse to god in prayer  by this time the   th of september draws nigh and i am informed that my lord of winchester the tuesday before was come to town and that besides my ladys council sir julius caesar and sir daniel dun did at st mary overys house daily attend his lordship i expected no great good of this only from the king i heard nothing but well for some few days before his majesty had been at white hall where i kissed his hand and he did not only look merrily upon me but he gave me promise of the bishopric of lincoln for my brother as i understood it some other matters also passed quietly in speech and i found no disturbance but on the   th of september the day before our new meeting at lambeth my lord of litchfield being sent from the king brings diverse papers unto me sealed up i opened them and found there my reasons first secondly an answer to them and thirdly a letter all written with the kings hand unto me i read them all presently without any abatement whereunto i was helped by my foreknowledge that such things would come i said little unto it only i asked my lord of litchfield whether he knew what those papers contained he told me that the king had read unto him the answers to the reasons and had given him the letter to seal up in a paper but in reverence to his majesty he held it not his duty to look into it growing afterward in some speech of our next days business i told him plainly that having spent much time in this vacation in perusing the books i could not find any where but especially in the answer of my lord of essex that which would give me contentment i read the places and my lord confessed with me that there was not enough he told me also that unless i gave my consent to the separation that he would never give his so much reverence in him did i find both then and diverse times before against this divorcement at last he mentioned one thing which pleased me wondrous well and that was that we should call for my lord of essex again and new examine him upon some points to be farther declared ad informandum animum judicis for hence either we should know so much as might persuade us to decree a separation or the world might be satisfied that we had no reason for it these things thus settled his lordship separateth then i withdrew my self to my study and read over again and again the papers from the king i found them very sharp and perceived by the time that they arrived unto me that they were detained till that day that i might be overwhelmed with them on the sudden and have no time to deliberate before we were to come the second time to sit in judgment these things did much trouble me so that i did sleep but a little that night i revolved many things and much tumbling i had in my miud it grieved me infinitely that the king should make himself a party therein that some unthankfulness and other matters were little less then reproaches unto me methought my faithful heart to my master deserved no such sharpness i devised how i might give the king contentment and it was some comfort to me that we had thought upon a course of new examining my lord of essex but as things stood i could not force my conscience which cried upon me that it was an odious thing to god and men to give such a sentence without better warrant i here cast what might befall to the church in my disgrace how papists would scorn at it how it might be my own ruin and that diverse ways a hazard to my friends and to the commissioners which were of my mind how my lord of london had a wife and children which might all be overthrown at one blow but after midnight sleeping toward the morning i considered on the other side that my conscience was more unto me than all the world that it was a fearful thing in place of judgment to give a sentence against mine own heart that olivarius the chancellor of france upon such an occasion grew mad and died in it that the manner of our sentence must be solum deum prae oculis babentes a rei veritate inspecta all which and the like meditations did much preponderate with me then i slept again and now rising i found my heart much settled to persist in that which i held to be truth i poured out earnestly my prayers to god and was now strongly resolved to leave all to god remembering that he had preserved me from my mothers womb that he had from time to time rid me out of all my troubles that his power was the same still that he would never forsake me if i turned not from him i forgot not that the hearts of kings were in the hand of the lord that i had experience of the graciousness both of god and the king the year before when standing earnestly in a good cause that prince henry should not marry a papist i received some sharp words from the king for my labor but the next day his majesty used me very kindly again to this i added that poverty imprisonment death it self were things contemptible to a resolved mind that some of my predecessors as archbishop cranmer and my lord grindal had given good examples of these sufferings and they were recorded in the catalogue of the righteous these thoughts thus revolved i read again the letter from the king and drawing out into a paper all the sharp words i considered them again and again and methought they were not altogether so bitter as i apprehended them that they were wrung from his majesty by my lord chamberlains importunity that my master had deserved at my hands that i should bear patiently twenty times more and that all was nothing so the clearness of my conscience might be preserved with these resolutions on the saturday i came to lambeth where i met with the news of overburys death and the sound of some fearful apprehensions thereupon bruted about the city i made trial of my lord of londons constancy telling him aut cidendum aut cadendum i found him most resolved avowing unto me that if he should pronounce for the dissolution of the marriage he thought the devil would that night fetch away his soul yea he was earnest on me to persist where i began telling me that the eyes of the whole church of england were upon me and expected of me that i should show my self a worthy man at last we came to sit where my lords of winchester and worcester took their places the commission was read the fact and manner of the process was opened and nothing notable done saving that my lord of london proposing that it was fit that my lord of essex should be called to explain himself farther for the fishing out of the truth all the commissioners most willing assented thereunto yea my lords of winchester and worcester expressly saving sir julius caesar who softly declared his dislike thereof in my hearing when the court was risen i spoke with my lord of litchfield and not thinking fit to return any thing to the king in writing i prayed him to acquaint his majesty how things stood and to tell him that upon this course of new calling my lord of essex i hoped in the end we should give his majesty satisfaction the sunday i spent at croydon and preached on that text of christs raising the widows son of naim to the great comfort of mine own heart that day i conferred with a friend and settled some courses if any trouble should befall unto me i was also by a good friend informed that my lord of essex on that sunday morning having five or six captains and gentlemen of worth in his chamber and speech being made of his inability rose out of his bed and taking up his shirt did show to them all so able and extraordinarily sufficient matter that they all cried out shame of his lady and said that if the ladies of the court knew as much as they knew they would tread her to death  on the monday we met at lambeth again and information was given on the part of my lady these things passed quietly when the court was risen my lord of litchfield told me that he had made his majesty acquainted with our proposition on saturday but that his majesty was strongly against it my lord of essex should any more be called and that by no means he would endure it for that peradventure the said earl either being provoked by the late challenge between him and mr henry howard or otherwise instigated by the earl of southampton might speak somewhat which might mar the business this made me still suspect that all was not right and i replied to my lord if that be denied us and we have no farther proof i shall never give sentence for the nullity as good declare my mind at first as at last and i pray you so acquaint his majesty when i went homeward i much revolved this in my heart thinking good lord what a case is this shall any truth be kept from us are they afraid to have all out do they only look to attain their own ends and care not how our consciences be entangled and ensnared on the wednesday we met again and now dr james is come to us and by and by comes in my lord of ely who as it seemed had meant to have kept him away but the king sent an express messenger for him requiring him by a letter to be there on the tuesday night now are we plena curia before we sat down sir thomas lake delivers a message unto me from the king that his majesty desired a speedy end of this business that it had hung long and the world was in expectation of it that the term grew on which would be full of businesses that his majesty on monday was to go to windsor to meet the queen and my lord chamberlain with him that therefore he would have us to fall close to our work not to trouble our selves on the morrow to come see the king who would come late to white hall because some ceremonies were to be performed as upon the last day of hunting that we should not attend his majesty till friday but that the sentence must be given on saturday my answer was publicly that there should be no stay in me and that therefore on the morrow we would sit forenoon and afternoon if the commissioners so pleased and if they thought good is would not refuse to sit until midnight but in mine own heart i perceived that all the care was that the matter might be dispatched before the queen spoke with the king whom they supposed not to wish well to the business we go to our court and sir thomas lake stayed to hear the information on my lords part it was strange to see how my lord of winchester carried himself that day partly to play his prizes before sir thomas lake who might make report of it to his fame and partly to show his ludimagisterial disposition he snappd up my lords council that they could not speak a word but he caught it before it was out i know what you will say when indeed he knew not neither was it any such matter as he imagined god almighty will tell you a tale for that i tell you doctor bennet i have as much law as you i am as good a lawyer as you are he fell diverse times on my lord of london personally and would needs know of him openly how many times in a year a man was bound carnally to know his wife in a word with scoffs and imperious behavior he played the advocate all that day to the great offense of the standers by so that it was publicly spoke of in london which i think came to his ears so that ever afterward he carried himself more tractable i was forced to bear it because of avoiding new complaints  the point most observable that day was that both my lord of winchester and my lord of ely did deny maleficiation so that by no means they would have this question to proceed in that nature which i openly did thank them for and bound it upon before all the commissioners and standers by telling them that the same was my opinion but i asked my lord of winchester who sat by me what be then held it to be he told me privately that he held it to be a natural impotency which was before the marriage i asked him what that might be and whence he gathered it he answered i have heard diverse particulars which are enough to persuade me if they be true yea my lord said i if they be true i have heard as many to the contrary i wish that we might examine whether they be true or no that were fair proceeding it is my grief that it is not permitted unto us to try whether all these matters be so or not this might satisfy a mans conscience so we parted that night  on the thursday at ten of the clock we met in lambethhall where my ladys council took on them to answer some scruples objected by dr ferrand but dr martin when no body spoke of it fell to wipe away that objection that my lord had not sworn cum septima mann upon his speech the commissioners took hold of it and it then being urged strongly my ladys council stood at first as if they had been blasted with lightning afterward they grew extreme angry with dr martin that he had proposed it but the issue was there could no answer be given unto it but in the sight of all the standers by this was broke off with shame and confusion of faces we dined not that day but about one or two of the clock we withdrew our selves privately into the parlour i had thought there to have had dr edwards and the rest who liked not of the nullity to propound their doubts and so in order and last of all i would have spoken but there i found a contrary course resolved which my lord of winchester seemed much to dislike but my lord of litchfield sir julius caesar and sir daniel dun had set the clock and they must have their will the six reasons are produced which sir john bennet had delivered the day after we came from windsor and the copy whereof was by me sent to the king all these must in their order be debated one was about the unperfectness of the libel in which we all received satisfaction that the libel was well to so much purpose as now they declared they would have it the other five my lord of london sir john bennet dr james and dr edwards maintained i allowed of three of them absolutely and the other two that was inspection of my lords body and a time to be assigned by the judge to try whether they might carnally know one another i held to be fit when those reasons were proposed but now such flames and quarrels were arisen i thought not amiss now to be forborne my lord of litchfield with a pen did note what every man resolved but principally my words with a purpose to show them to the king as i conceived and afterward i found it to be so i was desirous therefore that his majesty might see i was not obstinate but settled to yield to reason and again i supposed that this candor of mine would make some of them yield to us where they saw there was unevitable truth but i found it far otherwise for our afternoons work was that they gave shuffling and shifting answers to the objections such as themselves had studied all the vacation but no care was whither they were true and satisfactory or not and to what sir daniel proposed all seven of them consented without sticking or scruple so that i might imagine it was a set play upon the first scruple debating sir julius caesar finding the difference of opinions and that our lawyers stuck strongly unto it let us says he put it to the question and let the major part of voices determine it when i saw this to be the proceeding the lord thought i deliver me from such judges but yet observing their manner i possessed my soul in patience when it grew to be dark that the king might understand that i was willing to allow time to all that might be said i remembered sir john bennet to read the sentence of the rota romana where in the popes own consistory about the year      a judgment was reversed which an archbishop in spain had given for a nullity in a case being ours altogether because after the triennial cohabitation he had not assigned a time for the married couple to make trial again and to use fasting and prayer this repeal was read at large and so was another of the rota in the same kind but both these were slighted as matters of nothing and so i think had st paul been if he had been there i urged that of alexander iii that even in france it self no nullity had been allowed but that it was consuetudo generalis ecclesiae gallicanae and that ecclesia romana did know or practice no such thing this was slighted like the former and i perceived it was but in vain to speak to them for they were resolved and be it good or be it bad the matter should be done  on the friday morning i went to white hall and looking somewhat heavily the king comes to me and to my lord chancellor and offers us both his hand to kiss he might perceive by my countenance that i was not a little troubled and that was perceived by diverse of the lords who privately let me know their minds that we had a foul and strange matter in hand at lambeth at last the king takes me aside and after propounding three or four businesses walking he took me to the window and asked me how that great cause did go forward i told his majesty that i had no liking of it that i had received a letter and writing from him which very much troubled me for i knew my self to be his dutiful servant and had not deserved ill of him that it was nothing to me whether she remained wife to the earl of essex or were married to another man but that i might not give sentence where i saw no proof that i had lived fifty one years almost and had my conscience uncorrupted in judgment that i knew not how soon i was to be called before god and i was loath against that time to give a wound to mine own soul that all my grief was that his majestys hand was in it that for other men i cared not that i chose rather to die an honest man than a wise man that he must never afterward expect true service of me for how could i be true to him who was false unto god that if he marked it well this was no time to disgrace his good servants i told him that if his majesty pleased to let the matter alone as he did all other causes i would make good my part against all england on the peril of my head the king answered that i would have no lawyers i replied yes enough there is not an honest lawyer in england that would not be on my side his majesty asked me whether the rest of the commissioners yesterday did not persuade me i told him no but their dealing rather drove me the contrary way for said i i came thither ingeniously to yield to any truth that should be showed me but they on the contrary part in a factious course went wholly together and what one said another said be it well or be it ill without any scruple to my speech that it was an example that never had been in england the king said yes berry s case i beseechd his majesty that he would not believe that cause to be any such matter for if he would pardon me it should not be long before that i would show that his separation was for lack of his stones in this debating the king was very desirous to know what should be the reasons whereupon i stood that i might have satisfaction my answer was that when i was in place of judgment i would not conceal the reasons of my sentence but it was to no purpose to speak them now it would but put his majesty to a new trouble to hear them and then some man must answer them who looked to his own end and to make a plausible answer which would not content me without ground of truth a great part of the time that i had this speech with the king my eyes were full of tears which i saw much moved my gracious master and especially my earnest desire that i might do my conscience i perceived the king was much overcome by this my honest dealing and then whilst his majesty went to speak with my lord privy seal and my lord chamberlain who stood all this while at the farther end of the gallery and to whom i conceived the king told much of that which i had spoken i went my ways to lambeth to dinner now grew i confident to do my conscience right whatsoever came of it that day i dined privately but yet my lord bishop of bath was with me whom when i had acquainted with so much of the cause as i thought fit i received no discouragment from him my heart was much eased and now i thought i should no more be troubled yet between three and four a clock after dinner my lord of litchfield comes to me from the king and brings a written treatise upon the present argument which was the work of a scotchman i know not who i received it and promised that night to read it as indeed i did riding in my coach to croydon for thither i thought fit to withdraw my self though it were late for avoiding of more perturbation this treatise no way pleased me but i thought it the work of some hungry fellow who lacked twenty shillings to buy food to his belly here finding it the day of the end of my quarter i settled much of my domestic business i forgot not to commend my self and the whole cause to god by prayer i meditated many things in my bed in the morning i rose early and before day in my study i set down some heads what i would speak unto then went i early to lambeth and there supplied my brief notes digesting my matter of sentence into order being resolved to speak large and home to the cause without touch of any person more than i must needs by this time most of the commissioners were come i sent for my lord of london sir john bennet dr james and dr edwards singly and severally into my study i required them before god not to speak any thing for respect to me but to do that which in their learning and conscience they thought to be just and to speak that intrepid without blemish to any man but soundly to the matter i found them all avowing that in their souls they found no warrant for the nullity i then wished severally dr james and dr edwards to deliver their sentence with some reasons adjoined not many but of the strongest i told sir john bennet that this day i expected he should show himself a worthy man that he should deliver his judgment per extensum that they had labored to blemish his skill and to slight his learning especially therefore both for his conscience and his credit he should show what was in him to maintain an honest cause if sir daniel dun and sir julius caesar who came after him should bespatter him in their choler or lay any imputation upon him he should find that some of us would take it off him to my lord of london i said we have three that speak first who i trust will lay such a foundation in the heart of the hearers as shall not be removed but the other side have this advantage over us they are seven of them lawyers and bishops to answer what our three have said and perhaps with weak men such a stream of such persons may much prevail but let not that dismay you my lord only take this course deliver first your own meditations and then having taken with your pen some of the absurdities which in the sentence some of them will deliver blast those and let the auditors see that by you the stream is turned then leave it to me and i doubt not in almighty god but to batter their nullity to dust that though they have it by the major part of voices yet the world shall see what the cause is and they shall have little comfort by it i am very well provided i am no way afraid and you shall see i will not be tonguetyd so confident was i in the honesty of the cause and in the helps of almighty god that i was not now afraid of ten thousands of people but did long to be at the business as the lord truly knows  when now i was alone revolving my meditations sir j caesar comes into my study to me tells me that he wondered that my lord of winchester was not come that it was even ten a clock that therefore it was fit that the hour should be continued from ten to twelve i assented thereto and by some of the commissioners the time was prorogued then comes in sir thomas lake with a message from the king which he must not deliver till all the commissioners were come together so he was forced to stay between ten and eleven comes in my lord of winchester who as afterward found had been all the morning at the court i told him we had stayed for him two hours and a half his lordship slightly excused it then in the gallery sir thomas lake told us that his majesty had sent him unto us to deliver two things the one was that in our sentence we should take heed of gauling of any person my answer was that from the beginning of this process we had ever been wary not to offend in that kind and that he should be much to blame who in the conclusion would transgress that way and so said the rest the other was that we should not in any long manner but compendiously deliver what we had to say i prayed sir thomas lake to explain that farther whether we were only to say yea or or no and no more for i would obey the kings commandment  tu regina jube mihi jussa capessere fas est he answered that he could not say so but that we were to speak briefly yea but said sir julius caesar i know the kings mind for i was yesterday with him and he told me that he expected that we should go no farther than yea or nay for of reasons there would be no end yea says he the king told me he was promised so much by whom said i i think quoth he by your grace not so said i but i said indeed let every man deliver his own conscience i will not perturb the sentence no more indeed will i then he replyeth i know the king expects we should say no more than i do like this sentence or i do not like it and that you know sir daniel dun is the manner of the delegates and not to go farther it is so says sir daniel upon this the bishops all said we were best to proceed in that fashion to which i replied i will not be willful but if it be agreed upon and it be the kings pleasure i will obey but look you to it for if any man give a reason i am no more bound than he but that i will return the reason of my opinion and judgment they all said they would be observant of it thus sir thomas lake was dismissed then we called for the sentences on both sides which the counsel had ready they disliked that which was absolutory of the earl of essex and we approved it we found fault with the other sentence anullatory both for the whole and because some parts in it in our judgment were apparently false but they persisted in their intention so we went into the hall where my self my lord of london sir john bennet dr james and dr edwards freed my lord of essex the bishops of winton ely litchfield and rochester together with the two chancellors and sir daniel dun pronounced for the nullity and subscribed the sentence my lord of winton pronouncing it we perceived that they were afraid we should at large speak our reasons openly being the last who were to speak  the three bishops of winton ely and litchfield went immediately to the court hoping to receive great thanks for their service but they waited a full hour ever they could speak with the king however they sped afterward and we were glad that we were freed of the trouble and now i who would not have given the sentence for all the gold in india do expect gods pleasure what will become of this business hereafter and submit my self to gods providence who ever preserves those that trust in him  this narration is wholly written with mine own hand and was finished the second of october      being the eighth day after the giving of the sentence and i protest before almighty god that i have not willingly written any untruth therein but have delivered all things fairly to the best of my understanding helping my self with such memorials and notes as i took from time to time that if there were occasion i might thus at large set down the truth to posterity when this case shall be rung from rome gates or the fact hereafter be questioned george canterbury  some observable things since sept         when the sentence was given in the cause of the earl of essex continued unto the day of the marriage december         the sentence being given for the nullity the minds of men in their several places were wonderfully distracted and every one spoke according to their fancies but for the most part there was a detestation of the thing and a great dislike of those that gave the sentence which was expressed by all courses that men durst adventure upon on the other side there was a strange applauding and commending of those who withstood the separation and from all parts a testimony came unto them that they had done like honest men albeit the only scope which they aimed at was the discharge of their conscience and not vain popular applause the archbishop the day after the sentence went to the court to white hall and waited on the king to chapel standing also by him in the closet where he was strangely looked on by the king as he was also by some of the lords but nothing being said unto him he took no notice of it but bore all patiently this strangeness of the king held on at hampton court and elsewhere and it came to the archbishops ear that the king spoke diverse times hardly of him but much magnified them of the affirmative part and especially my lord of winchester as the worthiest man in the kingdom some things were done also in recompense to diverse of them as sir julius caesars son was made a knight my lord of wintons son also had the same reward which some merry fellow blighted with the name of sir nullity hilson and the bishop of litchfield must remove to lincoln and as for litchfield it must be bestowed on mr dean of st pauls that so doctor carry might be preferred to the deanery of pauls for which it was generally supposed he should pay well but now it run current that the archbishop must no more have to do with naming any to church livings but some lords in court should dispose of all and principally it must be provided that  abbot must never be preferred no not so much as to litchfield so far was he from lincoln which was formerly promised unto him these things grew detestable to the people who feared that even religion would smart for it but the parties most malignd were silent and patient expecting gods leisure and malice enough from some other men the first thing of bitterness that appeared was a letter from royston under the kings hand and signet directed to the commissioners in the former sentence but brought to the archbishop about three weeks after the sentence this was a most sharp letter complaining that they of the negative part for so they were styled had hindered the act to be made upon the sentence had solemnly protested against that which was done had given unto themselves other titles than were in the kings commission had glorified themselves in that which was done by which they laid an imputation upon the kings conscience who had declared himself for the divorce and other things of the like nature this letter being read to the commissioners the archbishop said that he knew not what it meant for he understood of no man that protested nor knew nothing of any mans arrogating of titles to him or glorifying himself and as for the act he supposed it to be made up in common form and never heard ought to the contrary neither meddled with any thing therein but left it to the register and what he had done with it he could not tell furthermore he asked all the commissioners particularly if they knew what this meant or if any of them were able to charge those of the negative with the points quarrelled at who all with one consent denied that they could and expressly averred that there was no such thing done at the time of the sentence as had been complained upon when standing thus in admiration sir daniel dun took upon him to understand the matter and said that if the register were called it would appear there was something in it barker the register is sent for and being demanded whether he had made up the act he said that he had drawn it up in a form that he liked but some other of the commissioners did dislike it and thereupon he showed two forms the one more large the other more brief but both of them having in it that the archbishop and the rest of the negative party protested against the sentence here every man wondered at him out of what ground he should do this and all the commissioners with one consent very much rebuked him professing that there was no such protestation used for the rest of the charge in the kings letter barker freed all in all things save only dr edwards who was absent by reason of his sore eyes the archbishop upon this desired the commissioners to suspend their judgment touching dr edwards till he might answer for himself saying that honor justice and charity required so much in his behalf and adding withal that he doubted not but it would prove some mistaking of the registers part to whom it was apparent that small credit was to be given since he had so grossly set down of them that they protested when all the commissioners could witness the contrary moreover he desired mr chancellor of the exchequer and sir daniel dun to certify the lord chamberlain how free and innocent from those aspersions the rest were found and that from top to toe it was nothing but misprision before this truth was discovered it was known that a gentleman of the earl of northamptons had said to sir john levison and that as from his lordship that there was something descried which would break the archbishops back such account was made of his business  thus things passed silently until the next week when upon the thursday being high commission day dr edwards being amended repaired to lambeth his coming was watched and then was delivered to the archbishop a second letter from the king commending the concurrence of all to the act to be made up in common form but requiring the commissioners to convene dr edwards and the register before them and to charge them with all the forerememberd matters and to learn where the fault did lie it was also commanded that they should require the said doctor and register to set down in writing what had passed between them and if it were found that dr edwards were to blame he should be suspended till the kings pleasure were farther known  these things are fallen upon and dr edwards showed that the register had wronged him and that no part of the accusation was true in modo and forma appealing to the commissioners what faith might be given to barker contesting against him when it had been manifestly proved that he had forged the matter of protestation against my lord of canterbury my lord of london and the rest time is assigned to them to deliver in their writings and accordingly about two days after dr edwards brings to the archbishop his answer denying the points whereon he was accused but barker brought nothing till a fortnight after and then by candlelight when the high commission was risen and the commissioners were departed he delivers a long writing to the archbishop who could not read it that night but reproved him for detaining it so long  on the morrow my lord of canterbury perused this declaration as as he found it to be uncertainly and diffidently set down for some other circumstances so he discovered there one thing much to be observed and that was that barker delivered that some few days after the sentence the lord chamberlain sent for him finding fault that the act was not made up and there speech was that some desired to have their titles put in as well as the titles of others and for that barker named sir john bennet whereunto the lord chamberlain said i know no title that he has yes said barker he is judge of the prerogative court of canterbury but barker concludes the narration that himself finding that he had named sir john bennet unjustly therefore was in mind to excuse him and was about to say that he had done him wrong but the lord chamberlain was so angry that he could not bring it forth but went his way leaving the lord in that opinion  by this it was descried that in the first letter sir john bennet was aimed at as well as dr edwards to put some disgrace upon him which made men wonderously marvel at the vindicative mind of some men who sought for an occasion to do other men disgrace the end of the matter was that no man could be touched and therefore the archbishop taking sir julius caesar with him acquainted the king who was now returned from royston with the state of the whole matter informing his majesty that fault fell on no man save the register and therefore if his highness were pleased to have him punished it might be so but for the thing itself since the report was more than there was cause mr chancellor of the exchequer said it was better to let it die and stir in it no farther to this the king assented being not willing that any punishment should be laid on the register whereby it appeared that the intendment was in the stirring of these coals to have burnt some greater persons than barker the register  all this while it was confidently given out that because the sentence had been opposed there should a book be written in the defense of it and one while it should be by a divine and that sometimes was my lord of winton and sometimes my lord of ely and it was said they were earnestly about it another while it should be by a civilian and then sir daniel dun must do it but at other times it must be by a scotchman who had written somewhat of that argument before the sentence and other while two scotchmen must join together about it and to make the thing the more probable the lord felton sent to the archbishop for the copy of the scotchmans writing which was sent unto him and after copying of it out it was returned to my lord of canterbury again this speech of a book continued about nine weeks in all but at last dr stuart and dr bird were sent for to the lord chamberlain and their judgment was asked concerning that point their advice was that it should by no means be meddled withal but that things should die of themselves but no questioning by writing for so it might go on to the worlds end for one book might breed another and so they whom it concerned should never be in rest this was resolved on and afterward there was no more speech of writing saving only faintingly and whisperingly but nothing to the purpose it seemed that the commissioners who were for the nullity had enough of it and desired no more to bring themselves on the stage being so by all men exclaimed upon for that which they had done  the bishop of winton after the sentence went down with great jollity full of hope and glory but within a while after he grew much daunted as some about him and namely his own daughter reported for he heard many ways of the strange detestation which the world had of the deed and the nicknaming of his son much affected him but his advertisements from sir richard norton his soninlaw did much trouble him for sir richard wrote diverse times from london to his wife that he could come in no place but his fatherinlaw was railed upon that men told him that he thought he had a wife but it was no longer than my lord of winton pleased for whenever he offended him he could make a nullity between them besides the said sir richard told mr john more of lincolns end diverse times that it was such a disgrace unto him to hear how the world talked of that sentence that although my lord of winton promised to give him his wife and family their diet and entertainment so long as he lived yet he would get him to his own house and live there where he had means sufficient and not be subject to that perpetual scorn which would follow him so long as he remained in his fatherinlaws company  by these and the like passages it was guessed that the rest of the commissioners who were for the sentence had little comfort in themselves of that which they had done on the other part the archbishop and those who stood with him had their honesty and justice sounded out every day more and more and many messages were brought them and diverse letters written unto them or showed them by some friends from sundry of the bishops in the land from the universities from many godly preachers out of all parts which was an exceeding consolation unto them among the many frowns which they did bear that there was an universal concurrence of all honest men to approve that which they had done and the archbishop had privately from many great ones in court and nobles and worthy personages elsewhere such significations of their good acceptance which he did that it cheered him much inwardly and he was nothing dismayed  now about the middle of november the wheel was turned about for since nothing could be gained by speaking hardly of the negative part they thought they would make use of them another way and that should be by making the world believe that they had now given approbation of the fact and thereupon it was in court and london asseverantly given out and the fame of it went far and near that the archbishop and the rest after more mature deliberation had testified their concurrence with the rest of the commissioners and all now were of one mind men did not hastily believe this but yet diverse of good rank came and sent to the archbishop and the rest to know whether those things were so or no and when it was found to be but a jargon it gave a great deal of contentment and removed away much scandal which formerly was taken yet again afterward it was bruted the second time that my lord of canterbury had given the king satisfaction in the matter and my lord of london on such a sunday had come and submitted himself to my lord chamberlain and the rest had relented nay it went so far that in yelverton the kings solicitor and a great dependent upon the house of suffolk told mr pie the counselor and mr cholmeley the earl of essexs solicitor coming unto him about books to be drawn up for passing back the jointure of the lady francess part and the portion of the earl of essexs part that the gainsaying commissioners were now consenting and the great man beyond the water was come over which he knew so assuredly that he had seen it ratified by the subscription of the archbishop and the rest yea farther he added that there was great reason at the first wherefore my lord of canterbury and the others should stand against the separation for they had just cause at the first to fear that this fact might be drawn into example and so marriages ordinarily be violated but now it was resolved that no more such should be permitted and thereupon they assented these things were enforced to be endured with silence for the avoiding of clamor and making of trouble  but now behold an admirable device of the bishop of litchfield which shows what his own opinion was of the validity of the sentence i will set it down as it came to be acted  on the   th of november searle the proctor comes to my lord of canterbury at lambeth and brings with him a writ of certiorari out of the chancery directed to the commissioners in the cause between the lady frances and the earl of essex the archbishop was prayed to open it and so he did and there found that four of them sub sigillis vestris were required to certify recordum sententiae into the chancery the arch bishop asked searle if this were an usual thing who answered no he had not known any such thing before it is replied what then should be the reason thereof answer was made that since the matter was controversed in the sentence least there should be question of the marriage afterward the earl of somerset would have the sentence lying by him under the great seal of england ratified the archbishop thought that to be but a weak hold yet charged searle to see such an instrument drawn and a certificate should accordingly be made on the wednesday after barker the register comes to lambeth and shows a form of a draught in paper how the certificate should be returned in the names of all the commissioners specially put down the archbishop in the reading of it found five or six lines having a black line drawn under them and thereupon the more marking the words contained in them found that which he liked not thereupon he asked barker who lined those words barker said he himself did the other asked what was the reason of it and it was answered because sir john bennet and some other of the doctors with him had disliked that sentence quoth the archbishop and they had reason for it who put them first in barker said none but himself quoth the archbishop then may not the certificate stand as well without those words as with them to which barker answered yes then said the archbishop let them be stricken out here the register with somewhat ado faintly made answer that the commissioners on the other side would by no means have them out the archbishop said then i perceive it is a device to entangle us i am ready to certify the sentence as the writ requires but i will none of this barker i am first in the commission and for my place sake i would have looked that i should have been conferred withal what had been fit to return and not to have had this trick put upon me that either i must certify that which crosses my judgment at the time of giving the sentence or i must be forced not to certify at all so barker departed and all was quiet until the monday after at which time the archbishop was early at white hall the council sitting that morning there in the waiting chamber at the end of the privygallery the bishop of litchfield comes to him and says my lord we have received a writ of certiorari out of the chancery to certify the sentence for the nullity yea says the archbishop and i am ready to certify it but says the bishop he who framed the writ has made it sub sigillis vestris and does not know that there is a seal of office for the delegates it should have been sub sigillo communi before the archbishop could reply in comes the lord chancellor and to him comes out of the next chamber the lord chamberlain and then those two lords together with the bishop of litchfield drew themselves to a window and there had they secret communication about the altering of the form of the writ as the effect declared for that afternoon a cause being to be heard touching alimony from sir pexal brocas to his lady and the committees in it being the bishop of litchfield and mr chancellor of the duchy and my lord of canterbury being umpire before mr chancellor was come bembo deputy to the clerk of the crown came into the parlour at lambeth and had private speech with the bishop of litchfield the archbishop going out into the garden litchfield followed him and told him that mr bembo had brought another form of a writ and thereupon showed him the words sub communi sigillo the archbishop bid him do as he thought good and withdrew himself into the low stonegallery whither litchfield followed him and used these words my lord here is a form of a certificate which has been thought fit to use in the business of my lord chamberlain and i hear your grace takes exception to some things in it then he pulled out the very paper which barker formerly had showed the archbishop answered my lord have i not reason to take exception to these words that post omnimodam veritatis disquisitionem post probationes idoneas and de jure requisitas we gave such a sentence for to subscribe this were to proclaim my self a dishonest man upon record for if these things be true why did i deny to join in the sentence quoth litchfield this here is true for it cannot be denied but some probationes idoneae and de jure requisitae were used and we do not say that all were the archbishop answered you shall do well therefore to certify post probationes aliquas and i will join with you but as it stands now indefinitely it will be taken as if all had been used i pray you therefore to alter the certificate and make things plain my lord quoth litchfield i will deal plainly with you because the words were in and doubt was made whether they should pass or no the kings majesty has been acquainted with the business and he by a letter from sir thomas lake has sent word expressly that he will have them in the archbishop said let them then certify who will avow those words for i cannot condescend unto them and has not that person done a good office who has informed the king hereof that distraction may still be among the commissioners and there may never be an end of difference the bishop said my lord i could wish that you would yield unto the king and so give him satisfaction the archbishop answered what would you have me do i gave the sentence as i was persuaded in conscience and since that time i have been silent and meddle no way in the matter i did what i did upon long deliberation and i may not in private upon no ground since appearing to me cross that which i have done in public it was farther added that there was reason to suspect that they did ill offices who held those things still on foot that there never was any man who sought to grace himself by disgracing others but it met him at the lanes end at one time or another these things passed then and after the cause heard between sir pexal brocas and his wife the bishop of litchfield said to the archbishop at his parting my lord you will give us leave to certify then as we purpose to which the archbishop answered yea with all my heart  the next morning the archbishop remembered that by the carriage of things in such fashion as was pretended he might be tricked for if the names of all the commissioners were put into the certificate and four of them might certify under a common seal it should not be known hereafter but that he and his fellows concurred therein and that with the words which were excepted against he therefore sent for barker and in the presence of sir john bennet and two servants being public notaries he expostulated with barker as serving mens turns rather than caring for peace and then punctually he delivered these things  first the writ requires me to certify the sentence and i am ready to do it  secondly if the whole process be desired i am willing to certify that also  thirdly for the words in question because they were put in without my privity and they may as well be left out as put in by your own saying i pray to be forborne for returning of them  fourthly i require you to conceal these things as much as you may that the world take no new alarm of any difference between the commissioners  the archbishop spoke of returning the whole process because he had heard that at the first it was meant it should be so but dr stuart and perhaps some other of the civilians dissuaded that by all means least if the whole were on record in the chancery every man that list hereafter might censure that sentence and sift the grounds whereon the commissioners proceeded it was good therefore to take away that occasion  when matters were thus resolved the bishop of litchfield who meant to play his prizes in this service speaks to bembo to draw some preface or conclusion to add to the certificate that it might not only be signed with the great seal as after the form of an inspeximus but that his majesty might add a confirmation to it and when mr bembo as unacquainted with this fashion did not fit the bishops humor his lordship took on him to do it himself he drew up therefore a strange writing as was informed by a credible person that saw it containing barbarous latin and no good congruity of sense but the matter of it was that his majesty having the authority of the pope now in himself and in scrinio pectoris having power to ratify did ex plenitudine potestatis confirm that divorce to all intents and purposes in an evening dr martin was sent for to the lord chamberlain and there was the bishop with his papers the doctor as it has been eredibly delivered being showed that writing and his opinion thereupon being asked did utterly dislike it and said that the king claimed nothing of the popes power but took that as his own which the pope had usmped that the king had spoke before by his judges delegate and had nothing more to do that if the sentence were not good already no confirmation could make it good and when the bishop was earnest in defense of his device there was a little heat stricken between the doctor and him so that these words passed from the said doctor you do as much as in you lies spit in the face of the king our master by laying on him all the matter whereas the scandal that has already been is this that his majesty is said to deal so much in the matter my lord you are to blame to enter into these things without advice of men skilful in the law has dr stuart or dr bird been acquainted herewithal the bishop says no but for this matter i know as much law at the best of you all dr martin replied no your lordship thinks that because you have read two or three chapters of the canon law about this late business you know as much as we do who have spent all our lives in that profession i tell your lordship i have studied the law these two and thirty years and therefore you shall give me leave to believe that i know more therein than you can i am the kings advocate and therefore may suffer nothing with my consent to pass dishonorable to my master  upon these contestations the lord chamberlain was much troubled saying what a matter is this that men should be of such contrary opinions what shall we do when the bishop murmured much that his conceit was not followed dr martin said thus my lord in a business of this importance i will not wish your lordship to follow my single advice but let this be done to morrow let sir william button in your lordships name come to doctorscommons and let him get together sir daniel dun dr stuart and dr bird and i will attend them and then we will consult jointly what is fit to be done  this advice was much liked and on the morrow being friday they all assembled and for two hours all points were debated but the conclusion was that there should be no farther confirmation for this was to proclaim that the sentence was defective in itself which would make a great buzz in the world and therefore the counsel was in general that too much had been done and for the time to come the care must be how to lay it asleep fairly  this resolution being taken the next knack was that so many of the commissioners as were for the sentence should be called together and they should be made acquainted with this that the bishop might be fairly put off on the saturday night therefore in the dark at sir julius caesars house in the strand met the bishops of ely litchfield rochester the two chancellors of the exchequer and duchy and sir daniel dun and well near for an hour they privately debated what they thought fit but as it seems resolved as before and so departed  a friend being the next day with the lady caesar and knowing of the meetting asked her what about it was she answered it is something about the late nullity but what it is i do not know it seems that they who were the doers in it think somewhat is amiss they suppose all is not well about it and i for my part think so also  a man would have supposed that all these things should have contented the bishop of litchfield but he was so far in love with his own invention that yet he would not be beat off and therefore to merit the more he once again moves the lord chamberlain to send to sir francis bacon and to mr yelverton being of the kings learned council to know their opinion which being done and they two for the reasons above named concurring with the civilians the bishop as it has been credibly related said of them together with the rest they are all fools and so ended this stratagem but the worker thereof was not yet for an end  from the beginning of this whole question of the nullity the bishop of litchfield had carried himself variously sometimes being vehement in words publicly against the separation and other times in deed giving furtherance to it many speeches he had privately with the archbishop making show of much honesty and respect to him which the archbishop ever warily observed thinking notwithstanding that these had been testimonies of the working of his conscience conflicting in it self but not resolved what to do in the mean time from the court from london and out of the country the archbishop was still called upon by diverse worthy friends that he should take heed of that bishop that he was ever and in all things naught that he did all the worst offices that possibly he could and was still stirring the coals to procure to himself a reputation that he was zealous of the house of suffolk the archbishop forgot not those many warnings but carried himself very warily toward him yet out of charity it still came in his mind he is a bishop i know no evil of him i ought not to condemn a man upon a generality i have no particular proof of his misbehaviour in this behalf although he dealt ill with the late lord treasurer and most falsely with the archbishop bancroft in his lifetime and after his death and for that cause was detested by both of them yet an honest man may think that experience has reformed him and now he is amended yet it much affected the archbishop that all men spoke so ill of him and one speech of an old courtier a very honest knight entered far with him for about a fortnight before the marriage the said courtier speaking privately with the archbishop among other words he used this i know not what the bishop of litchfield does among you but he has made a shift to be taken for a knave generally with us in the court now whether the next prank will verify so much or no let the reader judge eight days before the marriage on a saturday morning that bishop comes to lambeth and in private conference with the arch bishop he tells him that out of his love and respect to his grace he was come voluntarily as of himself to know his mind about one matter and it was this on st stephens day says he the lord chamberlain means to have this great marriage go forward now it may perhaps be desired that a license should be given by you that the banes may not be asked which if you like not to grant i may be the means to free you from being moved to it the archbishop said what have i to do with granting of a license it belongs not to me but wherefore should there be any need of a license the marriage is intended to be public masks and shows are made for the same all england takes notice of it and therefore it were good that the banes were openly asked as the manner is of such marriages as are made in the kings chapel yea the lady elizabeth herself had her banes asked my lord says litchfield there is some cause why it should be done without publishing the banes for peradventure some dy may step up and make a disturbance you know what a mad naked fellow came in to st jamess after the death of the prince if such a one should come in now what a work would it make the archbishop wondered within himself to hear such a reply and thought surely that it was no mad body that they should need to stand in fear of but they suspected somewhat else but his answer was my lord there come no such into the kings chapel there be doors and officers to keep such out but if it should be suspected that any would oppose it is best the banes be asked for then there will be some warning of the gainsaying whereas otherwise if at the time of the marriage one should suddenly start up it would make a greater trouble notwithstanding the bishop went on that a license would cut off all the doubt the archbishop answered but what have i to do with granting a license in the kings chapel it belongs to the ordinary of the place and that is my lord of bath as dean of the chapel litchfield replied he never granted any and he has no seal for that office it was answered he never granted any because no body ever desired it but the manner was that the banes were published but as for the seal of the office who does not know that any seal will serve and none better than his bishops seal it being said datum sub sigillo nostro episcopali quo in hoc casu or hoc tempore utimur king james at the first did use the seal of queen elizabeth till a new one was made the bishop proceeds yet it would be fit that you granted the license if it be requested to this the archbishop said i shall do that which never any of my predecessors did yes quoth litchfield if you would seek your records you should find some so granted the arch bishop answered i have inquired of my officers and they tell me that no such thing was heard of in omni hominum memoria but my lord i know that my lord of bath has it under the great seal of england exclusively to the archbishop so that in direct words there is a restraint that he may not meddle there yea but quoth litchfield you have an act of parliament enabling you to grant dispensations to the king and his children and therefore it belongs to you said the archbishop do not you think that i understand the act of parliament as well as you my lord do you think that that statute was made for these ordinary graces and dispensations why is not your lordship able within your diocese to grant a license that a marriage may be solemnized and not the banes asked yes says he i may nay every archdeacon may do it within his jurisdiction then my lord quoth the archbishop must an act of parliament be made to grant the archbishop power to do that which every archdeacon may do within his precinct there is surely some other matter in it but i marvel my lord that you are now so earnest for the archbishops licenses when as i have heard in the days of my predecessor when you were bishop of rochester you would not suffer the archbishops licenses to pass within your diocese no says he it was for westminster that i did strive not for the diocese of rochester and it is true that there be records in that church that the monks did contend with the king about diverse questions i had reason therefore to stand for the privileges of my church it was answered so has my lord of bath to stand for the rights of the kings chapel the archbishop seeing how earnest the man was in so unreasonable a thing said farther my lord you have mine answer but let me now tell you one thing it is six weeks agone that i heard from the court and many times since i have had it reiterated that such a trick should be put upon me that although it needed not yet i should be moved for granting this license because thereby i should be constrained either to grant it and so cross my former sentence and involvedly give my consent to the nullity or i should deny it and so grate once again upon the kings displeasure you see now i have given you a fair answer which may free me from both but my lord i pray god you do good offices in this business i fear you put your self into many things which may be better forborne but let me tell you there was never any man who sought to raise himself by wronging another but at one time or other he had enough of it it is now almost three months since this sentence is given and since that time i have not meddled with the matter for offending the king i am silent and no way oppose and men have their end yet cannot i be quiet i would have you know that god beholds these things and remembereth them and for my part i am not blind i see well what is done and i shall not always be silent the time will come that i must speak and it shall appear i am not tonguetyd this made the bishop not so forward as before but occasion of a farther speech being offered the archbishop went on and said the sentence which i gave was in the fear of god and according to my conscience and if that had been done which was convenient and we called for there needed not to have been any division in judgment for my lord you may remember when you came to me at croydon and brought these papers from the king after the reading whereof i slept little that night how desirous i was to give his majesty satisfaction and therefore prayed you fetching out the process unto you to tell me whereupon i should ground my sentence you showed me one article that he had not known her nor he thought that he never should i told you then yea that was for want of love for he said when i came out of france i loved her i do not so neither ever shall i it is want of love to this the bishop said yea and the earl added that he had done his best oftentimes carnally to know her but he found an imperfection in himself the archbishop replied to this oh my lord never say so for his lordships answers upon his oath are to the contrary he found no defect or impediment in himself and if i shall speak my private opinion although i would not have you believe it i think the earl as able a man for a woman as any is in england and i think to the contrary quoth litchfield the archbishop went on but my lord when your lordship and i had these difficulties in our mind at croydon you told me of one thing which i embraced as an oracle from heaven and that was that to rid our selves of these distractions we had no other way but to call the earl of essex again upon his oath that so giving us a fuller answer we might either have good ground to pronounce for the nullity or matter to give reason why we might not condescend unto it i approved this and you know how the next day in public court it was moved and my lords of winchester ely rochester and your self gave very good liking to it and no man said any thing against it except mr chancellor of the exchequer who softly spoke i know not whether that will be permitted but you may remember you were entreated to deliver this to the king at theobalds from whom you brought word that it should not be granted because the earl of essex being partly provoked by his falling out with mr henry howard and partly being counseled by the earl of southampton would speak all things to hinder the nullity my answer then was that he was to speak upon his oath and we would most strictly examine him when that was denied which should have led us to the truth i must confess i had never any mind to pronounce for the separation the bishop seemed to take no great pleasure to hear these things thus repeated but fared as if he could have wished that they all had been forgotten the conclusion of all was that the bishop seemed to be well satisfied that no license was given and promised the archbishop to take care that he should no farther be troubled with it assuring him that he did ever good offices to him whereof the king could give witness and would and he would ever make the best of things to which the archbishop said if he did he would take it for a kindness at his hands and so he departed  accordingly the next day the banes were asked in the chapel and there was nothing but fair weather the archbishop attending the king in the closet on the monday the king went to hampton court and that day the bishop of bath and wells came to lambeth he told the archbishop that he had a direct message unto him from the king and that was that his majesty did much marvel that he spoke not with him about the sentence that the king expected satisfaction and submission his lordship added that he perceived that the king had some scruple in his mind which he wished should be removed before his going to the communion on christmas day the archbishop knew not that the bishop of litchfield had dealt any way treacherously with him and therefore was constrained to answer in general that he knew not what to say to his highness he persuaded himself that in giving of the sentence he had done his duty and therefore could not tell how to make a submission where he conceived no fault if in any circumstance he had erred he was ready to testify his sorrow for it but he knew no such thing yet if his majesty was displeased at him to signify his obedience to his king and sovereign to whom he was so much bound he would not refuse if the king were pleased to restrain him of his liberty and lay him in the tower all the days of his life to submit himself unto it patiently without murmuring  furthermore he prayed the bishop of bath and who on the morrow was to go to hampton court to signify humbly to his majesty that he had nothing in this world more precious than his life and that he wished that he had given that life as a redemption that the kings hand had never been in that business and withal he said that at the coming of the king he would attend his majesty  on wednesday night the king came to white hall and on the thursday after dinner my lord of canterbury went to the court where they were all busy about plate and jewels against the marriage notwithstanding he had hastily speech of diverse matters with the king and in the end he said privately unto his highness may it please your majesty i understand by my lord of bath and wells that your majesty expects that i should give you an account about the matter of the lord of essex and the lady frances i can say nothing more than this that i was put into the commission as a judge and at the time of sentence i did my conscience and since i have not meddled with the matter yes says the king i hear you denied a license to be granted for not asking of the banes which i wonder you would do since the sentence was passed no said the archbishop i denied no license but i advised that the best course was that the banes should be asked according to the custom used in the chapel  secondly i said that if any license should be granted it belonged not to me to give it but to the ordinary of the place the dean of the chapel who has it under your majestys great seal exclusive to the archbishopric yea said the king my lord of bath said so but i am told it is otherwise the archbishop replied nay it is so indeed  and thirdly said he my answer was that never any of my predecessors granted license for any thing done in the kings chapel i have received information so from my officers it had then been presumption in me to attempt that which belonged not unto me this is another there matter says the king were these your answers i was told otherwise but i will take some other time to speak with you the archbishop after this attended half an hour and nothing being said he departed  the same night a friend coming to lambeth told my lord that he had been that day with the lord knowles where he found that the bishop of litchfield had exceedingly wronged my lord of canterbury for he had reported all the speech about the license in a spiteful manner said it was absolutely denied that the archbishop gave out that the earl of essex was very potent for a woman and that he intended to question this new marriage at one time or other that it should never take effect  this said the gentleman made a great stir among them and the archbishop was much blamed that he would never make an end but they were much troubled at it as fearing themselves that all was not sure but quoth he when i had told them that this was some ill office of the bishop of litchfield who had every day new inventions to puzzle them that he might so much the more indear himself unto them by signifying his zeal for them and that i knew how fairly my lord of canterbury had answered him for so indeed he did and that he was so far from disturbing the marriage that he intended to be present at it they were not only appeased but seemed much content that his grace would be there and this i assure you to be true  when the archbishop heard this he was now satisfied that the man who had done him all the wrong was the bishop of litchfield from whom he resolved afterward to be very wary how he trusted him yet professing that he forgave him with all his heart on the christmas day he attended the king and received the communion with his majesty and so coming home to dinner sir charles cornwallis came along with him this gentleman is one to whom for his love the archbishop was much beholden and after dinner they grew privately into speech of all these forerememberd stirs where the knight found much fault that so many tricks were put upon the archbishop blamed infinitely the bishop of litchfield promised to acquaint some of his great friends with his qualities and assured to make things be rightly understood and took away with him that report wherein he seemed much to joy that the archbishop would be at the marriage  on the morrow being st stevens day the archbishop went to the court attended the king to chapel went down to the marriage where not the king but the lordchamberlain gave the bride had a pair of weddinggloves and so came home to dinner where he sat with much comfort as being glad that since things must be so they were come to an end and so prayed god to bless his church the king and kingdom and himself that he might be free from so many vexations as for a long space undeservedly had followed him  the speech intended to be spoken at lambeth september         by the archbishop of canterbury when it came to his turn to declare his mind concerning the nullity of marriage between the earl of essex and the lady frances howard seven of the commissioners having before declared themselves that they would sentence for a nullity and great reason being to think that the bishop of london sir john bennet dr james and dr edwards would give voices against the nullity my lords and you the rest of the commissioners i have had a great contention and deliberation within my self in what manner i should utter my judgment in this present cause since after the speech of those three who first began so great a stream and concurrence together of the rest my lord excepted who spoke last have given their opinions for the annulling of the marriage but yet i hold not my self concluded thereby but that i may declare my judgment having learned that suffragia among wisemen are as well appendenda and ponderanda as numeranda and it was no shame for phocion in athens upon good ground to contradict the whole city neither was paphnusius in the council of nice the less respected when he stood against the whole synod nay it was his honor that by delivering of his sentence he altered the resolution which that whole assembly had intended to take which i freely acknowledge i have no hope to affect at this time and yet though i have not that hope but might very well spare this labor yet my conscience tells me that it becomes me to speak in a matter of this importance because not only deum timeo i fear god which i doubt not but all of this company does but i am afraid of god least he should be angry with me if in this case i be silent and i think it is expected of me since i am here present that i should not sit as an idol and only fill a room for that were to lay an imputation on my self that i had undertaken a cause which in public i durst not offer to maintain  i must acknowledge that in delivering of my mind in this business of so great weight i do find two defects that i cannot so pertinently speak unto the purpose as diverse of the judges here the one is that i am no lawyer and the other is that i am no married man by both which i am disabled that i cannot speak with that confidence concerning some particulars as most of you the commissioners are able to do but in lieu thereof i have endeavored to furnish my self some other way concurrent to this purpose as by reading by conferring with some whom i do trust with pondering thereupon so that it has lost me much sleep at several times with frequent prayer unto god that he would direct me aright which i have more begged of god in this cause than ever in any that was before me in judgment and besides i bring with me animum candidum a mind devoid of passion or any perturbation which inclines to no part for fear or for favor for spleen or for hatred from which i thank god in pronouncing of sentence i ever have been free remembering that judges are in the place of god and as jehosophat said   chronicles    non hominis judicia exercetis sed domini and quicquid judicaveritis in vos redundabit he then who sits in the place of god and in pronouncing of sentence will vary from justice he leaves god and shows himself worthy to lie in the flames of hell for abusing of the trust which is committed unto him which i hope i shall not do and cui boni to what end should i transgress in judgment for either side when i have no reason to be partial for either since it is indifferent to me in any particular whether this question receive one or other determination  where least i should be mistaken i think it not amiss as publicly i have done diverse times before to let the world know what my judgment is concerning the impotency of a husband toward his wife that since marriage in young couples is for carnal copulation and procreation thereupon and that it is the intendment of those which contract matrimony to receive satisfaction in that kind that if this nobleman be not able to perform those marital rights unto his lady he does unto her a very great injustice to retain her as his wife and we shall perform a great part of injury and cruelty toward her if we do not free her from this burden and yoke we are bound in conscience to do it since it is in truth no marriage but a pretended matrimony that consummation being wanting which was one of the first things in intention when they two came together for impossibilitas officii by a received maxim solvit vinculum conjugij but the point is that before this separation be pronounced it must appear unto the church that there is good cause for the same which must not be upon light surmises or questionable suggestions but upon evident declarations and proofs which may give full contentment to the conscience of the judge the marriage was overt and in the face of the church whereby they were joined into one let the reason of separation be as clear as that was if it possibly may be or let it be so apparent that the church may well know that there is ground to stand upon for pronouncing of a nullity now this is it which i doubt will not fall out in this case of my lord of essex there is not proof sufficient to inform the minds of the judges that this knot should be dissolved and themselves set at liberty the one from the other and then you understand what the general rule is quod dubitas ne feceris and in this controversy there seems in my judgment many reasons of doubting that the separation desired ought not to be granted you shall hear some few of them    the first scruple which arises in my mind is from the uncertainty of that proceeding which we have had in this busisiness for in the handling of it formerly we had it propounded that there must be a nullity propter maleficium versus hanc that was it which we debated and for the which we turned our books that the counsel for my lady did still insist upon not naming the words indeed but by a periphrasis or circumlocution describing the same and it cannot be forgotten how dr stuard being told by one or more of the commissioners sitting then in court that his whole speech did still point out maleficium he answered it is true that is it which we intend the authorities always brought out of the canonists were in direct terms upon maleficium the proofs intended nothing else and we all understand that to have an impotency unto a mans own wife and an ability unto other and that incurably and that for some latent reason which cannot be known is the case of maleficium and that is the matter alleged in the libel and whereupon my lord is examined and yet now since we sit upon the second commission maleficium is disclaimed one of my lords my lord of winchester has avowed it that he dislikes that maleficium that he has read delrio the jesuit writing upon that argument and does hold him an idle and fabulous fellow that he rather supposes it to be gods own handy work than any thing from the devil another of my lords my lord of ely has assented thereunto and maleficium must be gone now i for my part will not absolutely deny that witches by gods permission may have a power over men to hurt all or part in them as by god they shall be limited but how shall it appear that this is such a thing in the person of a man the question is an factum sit and how it shall be discovered but to make it a thing ordinary as the romish writers do beyond the seas i take it to be a fable acknowledging that for truth which a bishop well versed in that argument did lately write that maleficiation is the very garbage of popery a thing so base that we who have learned christ aright should despise and contemn allowing it no place amongst us which course it were a shame if we should not observe since the papists themselves grow very weary of it and that even in france where there has been more ado with this maleficiation than in any other country for there the common sort at the time of their marriages were wont to be afraid to have the words of conjunction in matrimony to be spoken aloud quos deus conjunxit nemo separet or the benediction to be publicly given lest some witch or sorcerer in the same instant should tie a knot upon a point or play some other sorcering trick whereby the new bridegroom so long as that knot lasted should be disabled from actual copulation with her whom he had married and for avoiding of that hazard they had therefore their matrimonies celebrated in the night time and in some private place where none came but such friends as they dared to trust this superstition grew so common and men were so abused by the fright that came thereof that the prelates of france about thirty years since in a council at rheimes made this decree against it bochellus in decret eccles gallic lib   tit   cap     anno      peccare graviter admonemus eos qui noctu vel clanculum benedictionem nuptialem sibi dari procurant propter metum maleficij maleficium enim se vitare posse credere debent si eo pietatis affectu ad conjugium accedant qui praescribitur in sacris literis videlicet ut cum timore domini and amore filiorum magis quam libidine impulsi copulentur devote susceptis paenitentiae and eucharistiae sacramentis and the year after that another council in that kingdom does speak yet more plainly idem lib   tit    cap   ex concilio bituricensi anno      et quia christiano nomine indignus error nostro seculo inolevit ut signationibus consignationibus vinculis and nexibus matrimonia impediantur haec synodus communione ecclesiae interdicit omnes eos qui hujusmodi superstitionibus utuntur monetque fideles ne hujusmodi commentis fidem habeant sed in deo fiduciam certam constituant nec id circo matrimonia noctu fiant sed in luce and frequentia hominum if it be rotten ripe in france if it be error indignus christiano nomine if men must not fidem habere hujusmodi commentis what do we with it here in england let it be cast away as a rotten rag of popery and yet i do now find that in the very sentence which is this day to be given it falls directly upon the description of maleficium versus hanc so that what should i think of this case of my lords which is built on such a foundation as no man will stand to we are on it and off it and avow it we dare not yet fly from it we will not this moves scruple in me how i should assent to that whereof i can learn no certainty from the council of my lady nor from you that be the judges who speak for this nullity i dare not rest my building on such a sandy foundation    another matter which troubles my mind is the novelty of that which is now set on foot a thing unheard of in our church and unknown in our kingdom we have many stories old and new of things done in this land we have registers extant in every diocese we have acts and records which specify those accidents which have fallen out in the days of our forefathers i have caused search in many places to be made and so i know have some of you the commissioners and i have called upon you for the same but i can have no precedent of any such example that has passed in our kingdom no memory of man can express unto me the name of that person whose marriage was annulled for impotency toward his wife when he found an ability of carnal copulation with any other woman it is this year      that has set abroad this present imagination for the former ages knew it not it is safe walking in the ways which are treaded out unto us we have great reason for our doings in these human actions when we do those deeds which formerly were done by our predecessors i have had many worthy men which have gone before me in the place which i now hold men learned men judicious great discoverers of impostures men that have done great services for the nation where we live but of them never any had such a case before them they never gave sentence for a nullity of marriage upon such an inability i know not whether it be a happiness or unhappiness that i must be the first to sit in a commission for determining such a controversy  i know to meet with this objection it is whispered sometimes that there is an example and that is burys case which is urged as a precedent unto this now in question but indeed that is no pattern of this the dissimilitude is great between the one case and the other for bury had his stones stricken off with an horse that nothing but a little part of one of them remained i will read you the very case which if any man doubt of shall be avowed unto him thus then it does follow  john bury esquire was lawfully seized in his demeanes as of fee of and in diverse manors lands and tenements within the county of devon the said john bury did the  0th day of november in the first year of queen mary marry one willimot gifford and they lived together three years and the said bury could not carnaliter cognoscere dictam willimotam  afterward viz the   th of may      the said willimot called the said bury before the ecclesiastical judge and charged him to be impotentem ad coeundum cum dicta willimota propter vitium perpetuum and incurabile impedimentum ad generationem and ejus inhabilitatem etc and thereupon desired to be divorced in the proceeding before the judge it was proved by diverse witnesses of which two were physicians that the said bury had but one little stone and that no bigger than a bean it was also deposed by diverse matrons that the said willimot gifford remained a virgin and incorrupt and the said bury confessed no less upon which proof and confession of john bury the ecclesiastical judge pronounced sentence of divorce and did thereby separate them  afterward the said john bury took to wife one philip monjoy his first wife willimot gifford being then alive and the said philip had a son in the time of their continuing together john burys first wife being alive  afterward the said willimot being still living the said monjoy of her own accord without any sentence of divorce forsook the said john bury and married one langeden with whom she continued the said john bury and his first wife willimot died the said monjoy and langeden then living married together  the question is whether john bury being divorced from willimot gifford for impotency the second marriage solemnized between the said john bury and monjoy during which time the issue male was born be in law a marriage or not  it appears by the process made in the cause and the words of the sentence grounded upon the same process that the first marriage was pronounced to be void propter defectum and vitium testiculorum which made the said john bury impotentem and ineptum ad actum generandi and coitum conjugalem and so in all respects this second marriage with monjoy is void and of no effect for either this cause of the dissolution of the first matrimony is true which is always to be presumed until the contrary do appear and then the same cause does make the second marriage void also or else if it any ways appear this cause of the dissolution of the first marriage to be false et ecclesia erat decepta quia satis potens ad generandum and quod in ipsa generavit and in that case the first marriage is good in law and debet redire ad priora connubia and so the second marriage is utterly void  we are of the opinion above laid down  john loyde henry jones john hone nicolas stuard edward crompton robert fourth william farrand whether this be true or no i appeal to dr stuard who is here in presence and of counsel for my lady who i know will affirm it because not long since being asked by me of it he confessed the same and here is dr farrand now of counsel for my lord who was used  for his advice in this case of bury and dr hone is yet living who can testify the same for i will suppose that a man cannot forget such a famous case as that was wherein himself was employed but if all these were dead i know where records be which still will continue if this then were the matter in question touching bury defectus testiculorum what is this to the great controversy now depending before us and if this be the only precedent that should be the inducement that the sentence to be given in this cause is not new but the like has been heard of before i am where i was we are now to act a novelty a thing strange and unheard of in this church of england whereof let other men be the managers i may have no hand in it  but perhaps it will be said that in some other countries and especially in france these things are well known and the examples of one kingdom especially being so near unto us may be an inducement for us to do the like since the reason is the same my answer thereunto is that i that live in england am to frame my self to those things which i find in the church of england whereof i see no reason but there should be as great esteem as of any church in the world in the days of our forefathers as our nation was held a very noble nation so was the church of england held a very famous church ecclesia anglicana as might easily be showed out of matthew paris and by diverse things in some later general councils did carry a greater sway and why should we at this time in any thing yield unto any church in the world since it is a thing well known that the knowledge of divinity does abound here beyond all other nations and men of this land have beat down the power of the pope and made evident diverse quesions in matters of theology beyond all the parts of christendom but beyond this i do know that the customs of churches even by the determination of the pope himself ought to be the rule of judgment in this nature we have a famous place interserted into the body of the law written by pope alexander the  d unto the bishop of amiens in france it is worth your hearing de frigidis and maleficiatis cap   in supplemento quod sedem apostolicam consuluisti super his quae tibi dubia existunt gratum gerimus and acceptum and tua exinde fraternitas non parum commendanda videtur ex tua siquidem part nobis est intimatum quod quaedam mulier tui episcopatus cuidamviro nupserit asserens quod os utriusque inguinis rupturam genitalia ejus abscissa fuissent nec dum ab eo cognito fuisset qui utique factus leprosus se pariter and sua domui reddidit infirmorum mulier vero ad domum patris reversa sicut asseris invenis alii viro nubere desiderat and conjugali affectu conjungi vnde licet romana ecclesia non consueverit propter talem infirmitatem vel propter alia maleficia legitime conjunctos dividere si tamen consuetudo generalis gallicanae ecclesiae habet ut hujusmodi matrimonium dissolvatur nos patienter tolerabimus si secundum eandem consuetudinem eidem mulieri cui voluerit nubendi in domino concesseris facultatem by this we do find that the church of rome it self does grant no separations in matters of matrimony where the church of france does and if the pope permit in france it self that a divorce should be made it is but a toleration and not this neither but where it is consuetudo generalis ecclesiae gallicanae which if you will apply unto this cause in question you must show me that in england it has been a general custom that a nullity in marriage may be pronounced propter impotentiam versus hanc which if you cannot show as indeed you cannot nor give any true example that ever has been of any such separation within this church i may both in law and conscience conclude that i dare not introduce any novelty and so consequently pronounce for the nullity of this marriage many things are done in france whereof if we in england had the examination we should peradventure find the fact different from that which they conceived or if we agree in the fact we should give another sentence it is not unknown how within the space of one year there has been much ado in france about two women magdalen and louyse pretended to be possessed with a great many devils and how verrine a principal spirit in one of them has avowed and maintained the mass invocation of saints adoration of images and a great many other points of the grossness of popery and a book hereof has been printed and reprinted in paris with approbation of the state and allowance of learned men in which the church of england would certainly dissent and proclaim the whole business to be but an imposture as the very like was in the days of queen elizabeth when the devils of denham were said to possess sarah williams and her sister and some other persons and much ado was made of it and diverse fond people believing those knacks turned papists thereupon yet the issue of all was that it proved no better than a shameful delusion and a great abusing of credulous and lightbelieving persons    but now to proceed farther if it shall be said it is not the novelty nor the want of custom here in england which should prejudice the truth valeat veritas wheresoever or whenever it appears the proofs are evident whereupon we do stand and that will enforce the sentence my answer thereunto is let that be made manifest and clear and perspicuous unto the conscience of an understanding man and i shall concur with you but how shall i find this in a matter of this quality because it is nothing else but truth which we do aim at it were fit that all probations if not which are possibly yet at the least which reasonably may be had should be got together to enforce a conclusion of this consequence my books tell me in valor matrimonii investigando quaecunque probationes possibiles adhibendae sunt and potius debent esse superfluae quam diminutae it is solomons saying prove    it is the honor of a king to find out a thing and wherein can judges bestow their time better in a point of difficulty than to search and search again by all honest and good means to know what is the bottom of that which lies secret that so they may satisfy their own conscience and the conscience of others in the sentence which they give and leave no kind of scruple which may trouble their own thoughts whether these things have been done in this present case i appeal to your own consciences whether the writers do not mention diverse things whether the council for my lord have not spoke of sundry matters whether we that be the judges have not thought of diverse courses convenient to be held of all which no piece or parcel has been permitted unto us the proofs then which we have had do arise only out of the depositions and if there be not proof sufficient where shall we seek for it let us then consider them i will tell you my opinion of them i find nothing in them all which is not in substance contained in the answers of my lord of essex a noble personage says that in the hearing of diverse things the earl has said that he was not able to know his lady carnally the earl thinking this to be true but this is but a relation of wonder spoken extrajudicially and therefore for the understanding of the truth therein we are to have recourse unto that which by the said earl is judicially deposed diverse witnesses do speak that the earl and the lady have lived and lain together for diverse years my lord does acknowledge it in his answer the matrons and midwives do declare that in their judgment my lady is a virgin and therefore that she was never known carnally by the earl himself confesses that he did never know her so that now all in substance depending upon his lordships answer it ought to be our labor to scan that exactly and to judge of it circumspectly does not he then say in responsione ad quartum that though diverse times in the first year of their cohabitation he did attempt to know her which diverse times may be twice or thrice and no more yet in the two latter years he did never attempt it but does he not say plainly in responsione ad tertium that since the time of his marriage he had not nor has any sickness or impediment to hinder him but that he might have had and may have carnal knowledge with a woman this is for the general that he has no impediment but in responsione ad quintuni does he not descend more particularly unto his own lady that it is true that he did never carnally know the said lady frances mark now what follows but that to the act of carnal copulation he did not find any defect in himself indeed he was not able to penetrate into her body but he lays the faults of that upon her as may be seen in his answer unto the  th article and it may not be forgotten that in the end of the answer to the  th article he says that sometimes she refused him these things are evident and cannot be denied the only matter which makes show against this is that he acknowledges that he has lain by her and has had no motion to have carnal knowledge of her but especially that in the end of his answer unto the  th article and believes he never shall these words are the shield and buckler of the contrary part but how easily do they vanish away or fall to the ground for i appeal unto you all who were present at the examinations and those were ten of us in number who now sit here present whether the earl did not openly subjoin that to his answer when i came out of france i did love her but i do not so now neither ever shall i i appeal unto the conscience of you all except my lord of winton and my lord of rochester who were not then commissioners whether this be so or no here then is the matter it is the want of love which restrains all motions of carnal concupiscence and not any impotency it is defectus voluntatis and not defectus potestatis let coffeehouse be removed and there will be an end of all the inability married men best know these things but out of common reason there can be no great longing where there is no great liking many things they say fall out between man and wife that for some good space of time there is no carnal conjunction and yet no impotency concluded thereby may be the case is famous of pulcheria sister unto the emperor theodosius the younger who having vowed virginity was notwithstanding afterward for great reason of state thought fit to be married unto martianus who thereupon was chosen emperor she would not condescend thereunto till she had promise from him that her virginity should be preserved and with such a promise he did marry her so that they lived together in show as man and wife but indeed as a brother and a sister our stories do make mention that he who was called saint edward in england i mean king edward the confessor did marry a lady the knowledge of whose body he never had neither did this wedded couple ever endeavor to break their virginity the writers do declare no other reason hereof but that they had an opinion that to live in virginity was the more meritorious according to the superstition of those times now were it not a strange argument to conclude in this manner that because martianus had not conjugal copulation with pulcheria therefore he was a man impotent or because king edward had not carnal knowledge of his wife therefore he could not know her i know the circumstances of this present question do differ from those but the ground of the argument is the same want of act upon private reason will never enforce a want of power and this is our case as i understand it which makes me unwilling to consent to this nullity    there follows now another argument which i shall deliver briefly we have always agreed that the chapter in the law which contains our case is the chapter litera de frigidis and maleficiatis for if it be not there it is no where to be found when we have delivered many things appertaining to this cause out of the best writers of the former ages or of our own time as that my lord should be inspected or that physicians should use their art to discern and remove impotency if any were to be found or that fasting prayer and alms should be exercised to overcome this evil and diverse other points of like nature it has still been answered to us to say the interpreters but it is not in the law or it is in the decrees which bind not but it is not in the decretals or it is a council and exhortation but it is no mandate or injunction i now therefore mention some things which is in the law and in the very body of this law and it is the popes mandate and that is that my lord should have given his juramentum cum septima manu as well as my lady for want whereof the whole proceeding is annullated this is the popes commandment quocirca mandamus and it requires the oath of both ipsis cum septima propinquorum manu firmantibus juramento se commisceri carnaliter nequivisse then proferatis divortii sententiam inter eos this is a thing so clear that when on thursday last by chance there fell mention of it the council for my lady dr stuard dr bird were so far from giving answer to it that to speak plainly they stood as men blasted or blighted with a lightning and knew not which way to turn them as was manifest not only unto us but to all the standers by which i do not utter to do them any wrong for they are worthy men both learned and faithful to the cause which they undertake but the note is that this objection can receive no true answer i know that since that time there has been labor made to give a salve to this sore but no mans wit can do it i said and say still that no mans loquence neither any mans eloquence can persuade me that ipsis firmantibus juramento is of the singular number i know there has been tumbling and turning of books to find some show to meet with this objection but nothing can be found which will hold out this water the proceeding therefore does appear to be unperfect and defective in that which is mainly required by the law which makes me to conclude in this fashion against some unperfect speech touching my lord of essex his affirming or denying of his own inability toward my lady that either he does confess it or deny it if he do acknowledge it where is then his oath cum septima manu which the law imposes if he do deny it where is then your proof of his inability since you ground the whole substance of the nullity upon his lordships answer that he could not know her carnally  i must yet crave patience to go a little farther one other exception which i take unto this nullity is the manner of the sentence which by us is to be given which has ever been resolved should be in general not expressing any reason particular wherefore we do give it to say that my lord is impotens in genere versus hanc and not to tell wherein is to propound a riddle to the world which no man understands it were a strange thing in learning to say that such a creature is animal and not to tell whither it be a man or a horse or a fish or a bird and although it has been said and strongly maintained sir julius caesar sir daniel dun that it is enough in a sentence to pronounce a thing in general and that the judge is bound to give no reason of it yet i would be glad to know whether howsoever i will conceal the particular reason from the hearers or standers by yet were it not fit that i who am the judge and must give the sentence or at least consent unto it should know the ground whereupon i do give it give me leave to speak my conscience i think such a sentence that propter latens aliquod impedimentum which is perpetuum and incurabile versus hanc is nothing but a device to serve a present turn which we must deliver in such obscure words to blind posterity that comes after and to amuse those which will inquire into it as if we had known something which we held not fit to utter when in truth we know nothing i find the texts of the law do still set down the reason and give a case particular as frigidity or section or unfitness of the generative part or some such other matter but for an inability propter latens impedimentum my dullness is such that in the whole book i cannot discover it and it is a mystery that cannot enter into me how a man should be potent unto other women and impotent to his wife if it be not in case of phrensy which is not latens impedimentum and which also finds lucida intervalla cap litterae it was the assertion of him in the law that he did not know his wife but that he had a power to know other women but what wise man does believe him or what is there in the text which does declare it to be true i will end this point with that of our savior in the   th of st matthew that there are three sorts of eunuchs or men unfit to marry the one is of gods making the second is of mens making and the third is of their own making the first are they that are past from their mothers belly who either are frigidi or such as have not members fit for generation or some apparent debility the second are those who are castrated by men or by some violence have that hindered in them whereunto by nature they are fit in respect of procreation i will not here dispute that idle maleficium because your selves are flown from it the third has no coherence with this nobleman let me know then in which of the former two you do place it is he past from his mothers womb why then do you give him leave to marry again that he who has deluded and frustrated one may also delude another if he be in the second rank why do you not tell us what the violence is which he has sustained from men or from any other creature let us have i pray you some kind of satisfaction and let not this aenigma in general blind us least the world should say that wilfully we shut our eyes against the truth    one reason i have more why i yield not to this nullity and then i have done it is drawn from the inconveniences which will follow thereupon if we dissolve the matrimony in such case as is now desired i look first on the detriment and harm which will follow if the marriage do continue in force and in vigor and i do find that all the inconvenience does redound but to one person between a lady and her husband there is some coffeehouse which time and gods grace may easily remove there is then an end of that controversy or if the disagreement shall never be appeased it is no more but one lady does want that solace which marital conjunction would afford unto her which many a good woman is enforced to endure and yet commits no sin neither labors to violate the laws of the church for suppose the husband be sick of some long disease or languishing weakness must not the wife sustain it with patience and quietness suppose the husband be captive in some foreign nation or prisoner in his own country whereby occasion of marital complexion is taken from the wife no divine will pronounce that a separation is in this case to be sought let a woman do that in modesty which others are enforced to do out of necessity and let her expect gods leisure in fasting and in prayer and in other humiliation this is all the inconvenience which arises to one person if she have not the performance of conjugal duty  but look on the other side what are the incongruities or rather absurdities which will easily follow if such dissolutions of marriages be permitted i will name only two the first is the hazard of violating and annulling of marriage by an ordinary practice for if the gap be open who will not run in and the judge must dispense the law indifferently to all if the proofs be accordingly for we may not say that it is for noble personages and great peers in the state and not for others of inferior rank whatsoever couple therefore have no children and live discontented come presently to take part of this general jubilee and albeit they know in their consciences that it which they attempt is unlawful yet to satisfy their fancy they will collude the one with the other and enter a prosecution secretly agreed upon howsoever in open show they seem to differ the one from the other and who can doubt but for money or favor they may procure witnesses and others who are to be used by the formality of the law to testify and depose so much as serves the turn by which means we are at a fair pass when not only the marriage bed shall be defiled and adulteries made frequent which is against the second table of the law but perjury shall be committed and gods name taken in vain which is repugnant unto the first table  a second inconvenience is the danger least both parties which are freed from their matrimony should diverse years after be returned to it again when perhaps the husband by a second wife has children and the wife by a second husband has store of issue also for there is no doubt in the law but if a man supposed to be frigidus and therefore divorced shall afterward marry and by begetting of children show himself not to be impotent but apt for generation this man is to be taken from his second woman and returned to his first wife and the woman for whose marriage a nullity was pronounced in respect of the insufficiency of her mate must be now taken from her second companion and returned to the first of this the reason is apparent quia decepta est ecclesia they adjudged him to be impotent upon wrong information whom experience and truth has declared to be potent and what man can foretell how variety of times may produce other judgments there may be question of land or inheritance of legitimation or illegitimation and a wise man would be unwilling to bring it on the stage when he is dead and gone and to make it the fable of the world whether his children be born lawfully or to be reputed in the rank of bastards the world is subject to much mutability and judges of future times may peradventure be led with the power of some great persons and perhaps may think upon other considerations that it is but a conceit that a man should be potent unto another woman and impotent to his wife or that the common law does not know any maleficium or that they do not believe that there may be latens impedimentum perpetuum and incurabile versus hanc when they see that the husband is in show of the world a lusty able man and has well proved his potency by begetting three or five or seven or ten children upon another woman these are pretty things if a man do well consider them and will serve to make distraction between kinsman and kinsman and make work for the lawyers and keep the courts at westminster that they shall not be idle which if we could not learn otherwise yet burys case before remembered does teach us who was divorced from his wife in the  d or  th year of queen elizabeth and when his brother had enjoyed his land until the  0th year of the said queen then was he thrust out of it and the questioned son or his heir was put into possession of it by trial of law a great deal of money being spent in that contention and both civilians and common lawyers in great numbers were entertained of both sides and yet the controversy was not so appeased but that of my certain knowledge within these three years it had been raised again and a strong device was laid how to bring this about again only my self withstood it and would not give way unto it when i was diverse times consulted thereabout conceiving very well that it would not be long before some prohibition would come out of some of the kings courts because the common law disliked that mens inheritance especially after judgments should be disturbed when the parties whom most of all it concerned are dead long before and cannot answer for themselves whereas peradventure if themselves had been living they could have answered that for themselves which other men know not and there ought to be a settled course in all things appertaining to inheritance  by this time i hope you see that it is not out of willfulness or prejudicate conceit that i have impugned this nullity but out of ground of reason and out of scruple of conscience which is it that must accuse me or excuse me before the everliving god i know you have heard what other men have said and they have answered for themselves upon all which grounds i make this conclusion that howsoever this matter of separation with great earnestness has been persued yet it is the surer and the safer way to leave it as we find it and in no case to dissolve it i often remember that saying which is frequent among the canonists tolerabilius est aliquos contra statuta hominum dimittere copulatos quam conjunctos legitime contra statuta domini separare that concerns us who be the judges and for the parties themselves who perhaps can be content to be severed and to marry elsewhere let them know this from me that they may best expect a blessing from god when they live in that state where fewest scruples shall arise in their mind from which whether they shall be free in leaving their old conjunction and betaking themselves unto a new i refer to their wiser thoughts when in all probability if any cross or thwart shall arise in their new intended matrimony this perplexity and anguish will still follow their souls that they have done that whereof in their truest meditations they have no ground of conscience and therefore that it is the hand of god upon them who gives not a blessing unto that which was unduly sought  you have thus at large heard my opinion against the annullation of this marriage now if you ask me what would you then have done concerning this couple of noble personages my answer is that i would have a reconciliation by all means to be labored and although that be difficult to bring about yet it is the more honor when it is effected charity will forgive and forget the highest offenses it is st augustines judgment that in the greatest breaches between man and wife reconciliation is the best and the worthiest pains that can be bestowed is to bring that about there wants only one or more good mediators and then great things will be compassed the disagreement was inconceivable between god and man yet christ that great mediator did take it away the breach was very bitter between england and spain yet our most blessed sovereign as a gracious intercessor did give an end unto it let divines be used now as much as lawyers have been used heretofore take the godly counsel of the one which will be given freely as you have taken the advice of the other with much expense of money this i wish for this i pray for and if my counsel had been used before things grew to this height i would have used my best means to have wrought an atonement but because there is no hope thereof and this does expect a legal decision proceed you that please unto this separation give your sentence in scriptis as you have declared your opinion in verbis five might have served the turn by the words of the commission if seven had dissented but you have seven suffrages and therefore proceed only this i crave of the register that he do make his act that this sentence is given joanne episcopo london d joanne bennet milite d francisco james d thoma edwards dissentientibus potissimum vero georgio archiepiscopo cantuariensi renitente    this is the substance of that matter which the archbishop of canterbury out of certain notes which he had drawn up was ready to have uttered and no one material point is added thereunto as appears unto me the writer hereof comparing it with the notes at such time as i ended the writing of this which was on the   th of september      three days after the time when it should have been spoken  the kings letter to the archbishop of canterbury my lord after i had received and read your papers which the bishop of litchfield brought me i found it very necessary that i should make answer thereunto at my first leisure for whereas before at my last meeting with you ye seemed to me to be only as yet unresolved what sentence to give in this business till you had heard it thoroughly disputed that by that means ye might be fully informed of the state of the cause it appears now by these papers that you have after your last days consultation put on a negative resolution grounded upon fundaments of divinity and conscience as you think which has moved me to send you herewith my judgment upon your arguments in regard that i did ever hold it necessary that in a matter of this weight all my commissioners should be as near of one mind as might be and therefore i would be sorry that your private conceits should so blind your judgment as to make you and your followers draw the perplex or torment catharrows against your yokefellows for that i may now open plainly my heart unto you at my first reading of your papers from the bishop i chance to cast mine eye first upon the paper of your arguments before i had looked upon your letter and lighting upon your first words in as much as we do firmly believe etc i protest i thought it had been some strange confession of faith that you had intercepted amongst some of the sectaries but when i had read out the rest of that first article god is my judge i thought that paper had been some pasquil made against this divorce which coming to your hands ye had sent me and therefore without reading any farther therein i looked upon your letter which resolved me of all these doubts but after that i had fully perused and rightly considered of all your papers i found your principles so strange and your doubts so far sought that i thought it necessary as i have already said to set down unto you my observations upon them but to conclude my letter with that plainness that becomes one of my quality i must freely confess that i find the grounds of your opposition so weak as i have reason to apprehend that the prejudice you have of the persons is the greatest motive of breeding these doubts into you which prejudice is the most dangerous thing that can fall in a judge for misleading of his mind and the reason moving me to this apprehension is partly grounded upon your last words to me at your parting from windsor and partly upon a line scraped out in your paper of doubts for i am sure you think me not so blunt a secretary but that i can read a line so scraped out in your last speeches with me you remember you told me what assurance you had of the earls ability out of his own mouth which you said you could not but trust because he was so religious a nobleman but when i told you of the other partys contrary affirmation you remember how you used the word of iniquity and how far your interlined line seems to have a harmony with this word your self can best judge now then if i would ask you what proof you have of the ones religion more than the others you must answer me by judging upon the exterior and how deceivable that guess is daily experience teaches us but with a holy protestation that i never knew any thing but good in the young earl was not this the ground of master robert bruses incredulity because he knew the earl of gowry to be truly religious and did not beg a register bothwel in his preface of his book de viris illustribus and as for your judgment of the other party christs precept is the best answer unto you nolite judicare but if the question were to judge of the earls inclination whether is it likely that you or i could best judge of it i he having been bred with my late son and served him so long or you that never spoke with him but once or twice in your life and never knew either good or evil of him but out of his own mouth i will conclude therefore with inverting the argument that if a judge should have a prejudice in respect of persons it should become you rather to have a kind of faith implicit in my judgment as well in respect of some skill i have in divinity as also that i hope no honest man doubts of the uprightness of my conscience and the best thankfulness that you that are so far my creature can use toward me is to reverence and follow my judgment and not to contradict it except where you may demonstrate unto me that i am mistaken or wrong imformed and so farewell  james r  the libel promoted by the lady frances howard against robert earl of essex before the kings delegates authorized under the broad seal ann      viz george archbishop of canterbury john bishop of london lancelot bishop of ely richard bishop of litchfield and coventry sir julius caesar lld sir thomas parrey lld sir daniel dunn lld john bennet lld francis james lld thomas edwards lld  i first that she and robert earl of essex were married by public rites and ceremonies of the church on the  th day of january   0   ii that she at that time was full thirteen years old and is at this present about twenty two or twenty three  iii that the foresaid robert at the time of the pretended marriage was about fourteen years old and is at this present about twenty three or twenty four and at that time and ever since and at this present is a man as far forth as a man can judge and has been in good health and perfect estate of body not any way hindered by any ague or sickness but that he might have carnal copulation with a woman  iv that since the pretended marriage at least by the space of whole and continuate three years after the said robert had fully attained to the age of eighteen years as time and place did serve after the fashion of other married couples the said frances howard in hope of lawful issue and that she might be made a mother lived together with the said robert at bed and board and lay both naked and alone in the same bed as married folks use and desirous to be made a mother from time to time again and again yielded her self wholly to his power and as much as lay in her offered her self and her body to be known and earnestly sought and desired conjunction and copulation  v and also the said earl in the aforesaid time very often again and again did try to have carnal copulation as with his lawful wife which she refused not but used the best means she could notwithstanding all this the said earl could never carnally know her nor have that copulation in any sort which the married bed allows  vi yet before the said pretended marriage and since the said earl has had and has power and ability of body to deal with other women and to know them carnally and sometimes has felt the motion and prick of the flesh tending to carnal copulation as he says and believes and peradventure truly but by a perpetual and natural impediment has been hindered all the former time and is at this present that he can have no dealing or copulation with the foresaid lady frances  vii furthermore the said lady frances has been and is a woman fit and able to have copulation with a man and such an one as may be carnally known neither has in this regard any impediment  viii moreover the said lady frances remains and is at this present a virgin  ix besides at the time of the pretended marriage the said lady frances was utterly ignorant and unacquainted with the said earls unability and impediments formerly mentioned  x also the foresaid earl long before this suit commenced has very often and at sundry times confessed in good earnest before witnesses of credit and his friends and kinsfolk that although he did greatly desire and did his best endeavors yet he never could nor at this present can have carnal copulation with the said lady frances no not once  xi lastly in regard of womanish modesty the said lady frances has concealed all the former matters and had a purpose for ever to conceal them if she had not been forced by false rumors of her disobedience to the foresaid earl to reveal them she requires that since this pretended matrimony is but in facto and not in right it may be pronounced declared and adjudged as void and of no force and that she may be freed and quit from all bonds and knots of the same by your sentence and authority  the earl of essex replieth july        i ii he answers to the first and second articles affirmatively  iii he thinks that at the time of his marriage he was full fourteen years old and is now twenty two and upwards neither since has had or now has any sickness or impediment to hinder him but that he might have had carnal knowledge of a woman save in the time of his sickness of the small pox for two or three years after his marriage which continued a month or six weeks and that at another time when he had some fits of an ague  iv he affirms that for one year he diverse times attempted and that the two other years he did lie in bed most commonly with her but felt no motion or provocation and therefore attempted nothing the first year when he was willing sometimes she showed her self ready some other times refused  v he says he never carnally knew her neither found he any defect in himself but confesses that he was not able to penetrate into her womb nor enjoy her  vi he believes that before and after the marriage he has had an ability of body to know any other woman and has often times felt motions and pricking of the flesh tending to carnal copulation but for perpetual and natural impediments toward the lady frances he knows not what the words mean but that he has lain by her two or three years now last past and had no motion to have carnal copulation with her and believes he never shall  vii he believes not that the said lady frances is a woman apt and fit for carnal copulation because he has not found it  viii ix he believes to be true  x he believes that once before some witnesses of good credit he did speak to this purpose that he had often times endeavored carnally to know her but that he did not nor could not  doubts conceived out of the fact and process in the suit between the lady frances howard and the earl of essex i whether the libel be defective especially in the fourth article where it is said that dominus comes essex pluribus and iteratis vicibus which may be verified and satisfied in two or three times dictam dominam franciscam ejus uxorem praetensam cognoscere tentavit etc  ii whether the answer of my lord of essex to the said fourth article in that behalf being but thus  that he did diverse times attempt etc be full certain and sufficient  iii whether in this case my lord of essex his oath  cum septem manu propinquorum be not by law requisite as well as my ladies  iv whether my lord of essex should be inspected by physicians to certify so far as they can by art the true cause and nature of the impediment  v whether by triennial cohabitation there having been no carnal copulation between them  impedimentum maleficii being accidental presumatur praecessisse vel potius subsecutum fuisse matrimonium contractum and solemnizatum  vi whether they ought post praeceptem judicis notwithstanding their triennial cohabitation before the suit began to cohabit together saltem per aliquod temporis spatium arbitrio judicis moderandum for farther trial etc  the lord archbishop of canterburys reasons against the nullity in as much as we do firmly believe that the scripture directly or by consequence does contain in it sufficient matter to decide all controversies especially in things appertaining to the church and that marriage amongst christians can be no less accounted than a sacred thing as being instituted by god in paradise honored by the presence of our savior himself declared by st paul to be a figure of the spiritual conjunction between christ and his church i would be glad to know by what text of scripture either of the old or new testament a man may have a warrant to make a nullity of marriage solemnly celebrated in facie ecclesiae propter maleficium versus hanc which i do the rather ask because i find warrant expressly in scripture to make a nullity of marriage propter frigiditatem by the words of our savior mat       for there are some chaste or eunuchs which were so born of their mothers belly and there be some chaste which be made chaste by men and there be some chaste which have made themselves chaste for the kingdom of heaven  i would also know gladly what ancient father either amongst the greeks or latins by occasion of interpretation of scripture or any disputation has mentioned maleficium versus hanc or declared it to be a cause of nullity in marriage  the like i demand touching the ancient councils either general or provincial and concerning the stories ecclesiastical whether any such matter be to be found in them  if for ought that appears never mention was made of this till the time of hincmerus episcopus rhemensis who lived nine hundred years after christ it may well be conceived that this was a concomitant of darkness and popish superstition which about that time grew to so great an height god permitting then the punishment to fall upon the children of unbelief  but since the light of the gospel is now in so great measure broken out again why should i not hope but those who have embraced the gospel should be free from this maleficium especially since amongst a million of men in our age there is not one found in all our country who is clearly and evidently known to be troubled with the same and if there should be any that might seem to be thus molested we are taught to use two remedies against it the one spiritual physic the other external  for the first our savior said hoc genus daemoniorum non ejicetur nisi per orationem and jejunium and st peter speaking of the devil cui resistite firmi in fide and the canonists themselves prescribe alms fasting and prayer to be used in that case but that they join superstitiously their exorcisms thereunto and for corporal physic to be applied as against a disease it is the judgment of our late divines whether they speak of maleficium or not  now admit the earl of essex might be imagined to be troubled with maleficium versus hanc i demand what alms have been given what fasting has been used what prayers have been poured out to appease the indignation of god toward him or his wife or what physic has been taken or medicine applied for eight years together not one of these things but the first hearing must be to pronounce a nullity in the marriage of which declaration we know the beginning but no mortal mans wit can foresee the end either in

eisdem incolumi licuit semper amicitia his majestys answer to the archbishops reasons to the first article that the scripture directly or by consequence does contain sufficient matter to decide all controversies especially in things appertaining to the church this in my opinion is propositio erronea and one of the puritans grounds without a better distinction or explanation for the orthodox proposition is that the scripture does directly or by consequence contain in it self sufficient matter to decide all controversies in points of faith and salvation of which sort a nullity in marriage cannot be accounted for one and therefore your consequence upon the former proposition must fail  for farther satisfaction to your former question i say your own second question does answer it for if there be a warrant in scripture for pronouncing a nullity propter frigiditatem then all the means which may make him frigidus versus hanc must be comprehended therein for why does our church justly condemn as incestuous the marriage of a man with his sisters daughter or the marriage of two sisters but a paritate rationis for none of them is in terminis prohibited by the scripture only the conclusion is gathered a paritate rationis for if it be not lawful to marry your fathers wife because thereby you discover your fathers shame nor his sister because she is his kinswoman nor your own sister because thereby you discover your father and mothers shame it can no more be lawful to marry your sisters daughter for thereby you also discover your own shame as also that the same reason serves for ascending or descending in points of consanguinity quia par est ratio the like is in this case for although christ spoke only of three sorts of eunuchs yet ratio est quia non potest esse copula inter eunuchum and mulierem and therefore st paul in the  th of the corinthians tells us clearly that it is no conjunction sine copula i conclude therefore a paritate rationis that christ did comprehend under those three sorts of eunuchs all inability which did perpetually hinder copulam versus hanc whether it were natural or accidental for what difference is there betwixt cutting off of the hand and being made impotent thereof amputatio and mutulatio membri is all one in the civil law and it is alike defrauding of the woman when either he who is to be her husband is gelded or when the use of that member toward her is by any unlawful means taken from him neither is it any way needful to crave the particular warrant of nullity propter maleficium out of the scripture no more than there is warrant in that place for any nullity at all for christ does not directly say that a marriage so made shall be null neither does he teach us what form of process shall be used in it neither makes he mention of a triennial probation no more than he forbids marriage within the fourth degree without leave obtained of the bishop of the diocese it is therefore sufficient to all moderate christians to be taught out of the word that marriage is null sine copula and that the word quos deus conjunxit is never found in the scripture where erunt  does not precede  viz they shall be one flesh but whether the impediment be universal or versus hanc only and whether the fault thereof have been born with him or done to him by violence or fallen by disease or by disproportion or ineptitude betwixt the parties or by unlawful or unnatural practices it is ever par ratio he is eunuchus versus hanc for he ought to be eunuchus versus omnes alias seeing to her only he was married and therefore a paritate rationis such nullities are grounded upon the aforesaid warrant of scripture neither had christ then any occasion to speak to the jews concerning maleficium for as it is apparent that god made king abimelech and his family unable to abuse sarah abrahams wife and so was he made by god himself eunuchus versus hanc is it not improbable that the devil being gods ape should imitate gods work by his filthy witchcraft by making such as god will permit him inhabile versus hanc though it may be that it was long after that time before the devil put that trick in use upon the earth  as to your third and fourth questions what mention the fathers and councils make of maleficium versus hanc first i answer that it may be if they be well searched that either something to this purpose shall be found in them or at least aliquid analogum which a paritate rationis or by consequence may serve to decide this question but leaving this to the search my main answer is that we must distinguish of times for in all the first ages as long as persecution lay heavy upon the church and before that the emperors became christians the church did not meddle with questions of marriage for the civil judges determined them who would not suffer the church to meddle with any thing which drew a consequence after it of possessions and inheritance as marriage does nay even diverse hundred years after the conversion of the emperors the judgment and decisions of all such questions did still remain in foro civili till the popedom began to wax great and assume or rather usurp to her self a power of supreme or independent judicatory in all ecclesiastical causes and therefore the fathers and councils had no occasion to make mention of that which was not eorum fori at that time and besides that it is an evil argument to say that such a thing is unlawful because the fathers and first councils make no mention of it for you know much beter than i that diverse main points in controversy betwixt the papists and us are never mentioned by the fathers because they could never have dreamt that such questions would arise and therefore we only find the fathers exact in such questions as were most agitated and upon the stage in their time as de trinitate de duabus in christo naturis and such like it is therefore sufficient that there can be nothing found in them which may be justly understood to contradict this opinion and it is very probable as i said before that this trick of maleficium had not then been put in practice in the world and therefore not known nor mentioned by them for why may not the devil find out as well new tricks of witchcraft when god will permit him as he does daily new sorts of heresies for his malice can never end till the end of times  to your fifth argument my former answer does also serve for till the nine hundredth year of god it may be that that devilish trick came never to be discovered and you know the old proverb ex malis moribus bonae leges and it is not unlikely that that time of darkness gave the devil occasion of devising of such new tricks look my demonology and yet was that law for which you cite hincmarus episcopus rhemensis made by charles the great who in many great points as you know had so great light as i dare scarcely term his time a time of blindness but how great and palpable soever that darkness was in points of superstition i will still maintain it as i have ever done that for matter of order and policy all the world shall never be able to find out any other so good and so old an order of government to be put in the place of it in sign whereof there is no well governed commonwealth in the christian world where the canon law is not received to judge in questions of that nature and it is certain that this question in hand is only a question of order and policy for the grounds of this question that the essential point of matrimony cannot be accomplished sine copula is warranted by express scripture and confessed by your self  to your sixth argument or rather hope i fear that hope shall prove contrary to faith for as sure as god is there be devils and devils must have some power and their power is in this world for satan is the prince of this world neither are the elect exempted from his power job was not st paul was not christ says to all his disciples cribravit vos satanas and if the devil has any power over the elect it is over their flesh and if over the flesh rather over the fleshest and most sinful part thereof whereunto original sin is so tied as god both before and under the law to show the difficulty of purging mans original sin ordained the amputation of the foreskin of that member and to exempt those of our profession from the power of witchcraft is a paradox never yet maintained by any learned or wise man that the devils power is not so universally unbridled amongst us that i freely confess but that it is totally restrained quoad nos how then was a minister of geneva bewitched to death and how are the witches daily punished by our laws surely if they can harm none but the papists we are too charitable to labor for avenging them only satan is permitted to punish man as well for the breach of the second as the first table and thereof are we no less guilty than the papists are and if the power of witchcraft may reach to our life how much more to a member especially to a member so governed by the fantasy wherein the devil has his principal operation and he may so estrange the husbands affection from the wife as he cannot be able to perform that duty unto her for it is a common thing in many mens nature that they cannot do that act but where they love nor fight but when they are angry god keep us therefore from putting the trial of our profession upon miracles let the miraclemongers live by their own trade  to your seventh argument touching the remedies what do you know whether both parties or either of them have used both those remedies or not and that that spiritual remedy of fasting and prayer should be used publicly for them i can see no necessity for non interest reipublicae nec ecclesiae and private persons are commanded to use their fasting and alms secretly and in private besides that no such remedy or cure is likely to succeed well except the parties own heart and desire be set upon it  and as for your conclusion upon the incommodum either in these persons or in the example i can see none in either for as to this couple betwixt whom marriage was never truly accomplished they will peradventure both of them by the declaratory of this nullity be made capable to accomplish lawful marriage with others which they could not do betwixt themselves wherein they may live to the satisfaction of their hearts and enjoy the blessing of procreation of children and as to the example the law shall be fulfilled by due administration of justice which cannot serve for an example or president of counterfeited nullites in time to come for notoritas facti or rather non facti is luce clariorie in this case besides the many legal probations and confessions of the parties which have been taken in this process whereas by the contrary if they shall be forcibly kept together their names or shadows may well be kept together but never their persons or affections and they shall be forced to live either in perpetual misery and scandal or both and what such a forced continency can avail the monks continency can teach us and for a president in time to come it can reach no further than to open a way of lawful relief for any parties who shall chance to be distressed in that sort hac est mea sententia    and as for the extract of our late divines opinions upon this question i confess i cannot guess what your intent was in sending them unto me for they all agree in terminis with my opinion that there is such a thing as maleficiati versus hanc and your very interlined passages prove it clearliest as for their advice concerning the remedies that is consilium non jus nec decretum not imposing a necessity but is to be used by discretion as occasion shall serve or require it    as for the legal doubts of formality they concern none of your calling if your conscience be resolved in the points of divinity it is your part to give your consent to the nullity and let the lawyers take the burden of making it formal  and as for the triennial probation i hope no man can be so blind as to make a double triennial both ante and post litem contestatam and in conclusion our new divines solution of this question proves clearly that their resolution upon this doubt howsoever it was first conceived in blindness as you think yet is it now approved in the time of the greatest light and purity of the profession of the gospel  to conclude then if this may satisfy your doubts i will end with our saviors words to st peter et cum conversus eris confirma fratres tuos but i must add vel si opus fuerit converte fratres tuos for on my conscience all the doubts i have yet seen made in this business are nothing but nodos in scirpo quaerere    the midwives appointed to make inspection upon the ladys body gave in that the lady essex is a woman apt to have copulation and to bring forth children and that the said lady is a virgin and uncorrupted  three ladies affirm that they believe the same for that they were present when the midwives made the inspection and did see them give good reasons for it  after these matters were summed up there was a sentence of divorce given for the nullity of the marriage and both parties licensed to be married again  the commissioners who gave sentence in the lady essexs behalf were bishops winchester ely litchfield and coventry rochester doctors of law sir julius caesar sir thomas parry sir daniel dun    the commissioners dissenting archbishop of canterbury bishop of london doctors of law sir john bennet francis james thomas edwards    the copy of the divorce drawn up in this form which follows it is by these presents declared that whereas robert earl of essex and the lady frances howard contracted by show of marriage did cohabit in one house and lie together in one bed nudus cum nuda and solus cum sola and that the said lady frances did show her self prompt ready to be known of him and that the said earl neither did nor could have knowledge of her although he did think himself able to have knowledge of other women and that the said lady frances by inspection of her body by midwives expert in matter of marriage was proved to be apt for carnal copulation with man and yet a virgin therefore we the said judges deputed in the cause first invocating the name of christ and setting god before our eyes do pronounce decree and declare that the earl of essex for some secret incurable binding impediment did never carnally know or was or is able carnally to know the lady frances howard and therefore we do pronounce have decreed and do declare the pretended marriage so contracted and solemnized de facto between them to have been and to be utterly void and to no effect and that they did want and ought to want the strength of the law and that the lady frances was and is and so ought to be free and at liberty from any bond of such pretended marriage de facto contracted and solemnized and we do pronounce that she ought to be divorced and so we do free and divorce her leaving them as touching other marriages to their conscience in the lord which our definitive sentence and decree we here ratify and publish  bishops winchester ely litchfield and coventry rochester doctors of law sir julius caesar sir thomas parry sir daniel dun     the earl of northampton immediately hastened to court with the news of this divorce and it was soon spread all over the kingdom the earl of essex in a great discontent left the court and repaired to his seat in warwickshire near drayton and there lived a private life  an account of the intrigue between robert car earl of somerset viscount rochester etc and the lady frances howard an reg  0 an christi      by arthur wilson esquire among all our historians mr wilson in his life of king james the first relates this affair with the most exactness and see the notes upon king jamess reign in the collection of the history of england vol   page     as he has given us a more full and particular account of these passages between the earl of essex his lady and the favorite car so he was best qualified to do it being an intimate bosom acquaintance of the earl from his youth to his death but if any unusual warmth be observed in his manner of relating them it must be attributed to his zeal for the honor of his patron  having thus given the motives that might in some measure sway mr wilson in the earls behalf i shall now produce his own words leaving the whole to the readers judgment  the treasurer see mr wilsons history of king james i page     and seq cecil earl of salisbury that great engine of the state by whom all wheels moved held an intimate correspondence with the house of suffolk which he had strengthened with an alliance marrying his eldest son the lord cranborn to katharine the eldest daughter of that family and being mindful of the asperity and sharpness that was betwixt him and the late earl of essex he thought it a good act of policy and piety not to suffer malice to become hereditary and therefore he was a great means in marrying the young earl of essex to the lady frances howard another of those sisters that the fathers enmity might be closed up by the sons nuptial fraternity the earl of essex was fourteen years of age and she thirteen when they married too young to consider but old enough to consent yet by the advice of friends separated after marriage she under her mothers wing and he visiting france and germany till time should mature and ripen a happy counion the court was her nest her father being lord chamberlain and she was hatched up by her mother whom the sour breath of that age how justly i know not had already tainted from whom the young lady might take such a tincture that ease greatness and court glories would more distain and impress on her than any way wear out and diminish and growing to be a beauty of the greatest magnitude in that horizon was an object fit for admirers and every tongue grew an orator at that shrine  the prince of wales now in his puberty sent many loving glances as ambassadors of his good respects and amorous expressions are fit subjects for jealous reproaches to work on her husband having been now three or four years beyond the seas sick with absence from her whom his desires longed after came over again and found that beauty which he had left innocent so faded and sophisticated with some court drug which had wrought upon her that he became the greatest stranger at home his patience made way for him a while and he bore up with a gentle gale against the stream of this womans affections which ran altogether unknown to him into another channel nor was her reputation yet become so robust being of a tender growth to strike his ears with reproaches and therefore he imputed her sly entertainments to a maiden bashfulness till surfeited with that dull potion upon better advice he went to the earl of suffolk her father and demanded his wife thinking himself capable to enjoy both her and her love the father that thought there had been an intimacy betwixt them suitable to their conjugal knot made use of his paternal power to reduce his daughter to the obedience of a wife but while these things were struggling for a most violent disease of a poisonous nature imputed to but far transcending the smallpox seized on the earl of essex and had not the strength of youth and that almighty power that orders all things wrought out the venom of it the earth as probable wished by her had been his marriage bed  for this lady being taken with the growing fortunes of robert car viscount rochester and grounding more hope upon him than the uncertain and hopeless love of the prince she cast her anchor there which the prince soon discovered and slighted her accordingly for dancing one time among the ladies and her glove falling down it was taken up and presented to him by one that thought he did him acceptable service but the prince refused to receive it saying publicly he would not have it it is stretched by another meaning the viscount this was an aggravation of hatred betwixt the kings son and the kings friend  the countess of essex having her heart alienated from her husband and set upon the viscount had a double task to undergo for accomplishing her ends one was to hinder her husband from enjoying her the other was to make the viscount sure unto her for dishonest love is most full of jealousy her husband she looked upon as a private person and to be carried by him into the country out of her element being ambitious of glory and a beauty covetous of applause were to close as she thought with an insufferable torment though he was a man that did not only every way merit her love but he loved her with an extraordinary affection having a gentle mild and courteous disposition especially to women such as might win upon the roughest natures but this fiery heat of his wifes mounted upon the wings of lust or love call it what you will carried her after so much mischief that those that saw her face might challenge nature of too much hypocrisy for harboring so wicked a heart under so sweet and bewitching a countenance  to strengthen her designs she finds out one of her own stamp mrs turner a doctor of physicks widow a woman whom prodigality and looseness had brought low yet her pride would make her fly any pitch rather than fall into the jaws of want these two consult together how they may stop the current of the earls affection toward his wife and make a clear passage for the viscount in the place to effect which one doctor forman a reputed conjurer living at lambeth is found out the women declare to him their grievances he promises sudden help and to amuse them frames many little pictures of brass and wax some like the viscount and countess whom he must unite and strengthen others like the earl of essex whom he must debilitate and weaken and then with philtrous powders and such drugs he works upon their persons and to practice what effects his art would produce mrs turner that loved sir arthur manwaring a gentleman then attending the prince and willing to keep him to her gave him some of the powder which wrought so violently with him that through a storm of rain and thunder he rode fifteen miles one dark night to her house scarce knowing where he was till he was there such is the devilish and mad rage of lust heightened with art and fancy  these things maturd and ripened by the cunning of this jugler forman gave them assurance of happy hopes her courtly invitements that drew the viscount to observe her she imputed to the operation of those drugs he had tasted and that harshness and stubborn comportment she expressed to her husband making him weary of such entertainments to absent himself she thought proceeded from the effects of those unknown potions and powders that were administered to him so apt is the imagination to take impression of those things we are willing to believe  the good earl finding his wife noussed in the court and seeing no possibility to reduce her to reason till she were estranged from the relish and taste of the delights she sucked in there made his condition again known to her father the old man being troubled with his daughters disobedience embittered her being near him with wearisome and continual chidings to wean her from the sweets she doted on and with much ado forced her into the country but how harsh was the parting being rent away from the place where she grew and flourished yet she left all her engines and imps behind her the old doctor and his confederate mrs turner must be her two supporters she blazons all her miseries to them at her departure and moistens the way with her tears chartley was an hundred miles from her happiness and a little time thus lost is her eternity when she came thither though in the pleasantest time of summer she shut her self up in her chamber not suffering a beam of light to peep upon her dark thoughts if she stirred out of her chamber it was in the dead of night when sleep had taken possession of all others but those about her in this implacable sad discontented humor she continued some months always murmuring against but never giving the least civil respect to her husband which the good man suffered patiently being loath to be the divulger of his own misery yet having a manly courage he would sometimes break into a little passion to see himself slighted and neglected by himself but having never found better from her it was the easier to bear with her  while she was at chartley she writ to her confederates that her husband found little operation in their drugs complaining of his lustiness and her misery for she said the viscount would never love her if her husband did meddle with her which with difficulty she yet impeded but how long she should resist his violence she knew not therefore she implored their assistance if they would not see her the most despicable creature in the world and for satisfaction they should make their own price with this kind of stuff she filled her letters which were after found in formans closet these instigations made him active and the man being skilful in natural magic did use all the artifice his subtilty could devise really to imbecilitate the earl for no linen came near his body that was not rinsed with their camphire compositions and other faint and wasting ingredients and all inward applications were foisted on him by corrupted servants to lessen and debilitate the seminal operations which veneficium is one great part of witchcraft destructive to nature and horribly abominable to be practiced and this in time wrought such effects upon his person that he found himself unable with her though she permitted him yet when he had been from her some reasonable time to renovate his spirits by shaking off those artificial applications then his abilities made her unwilling and refractory though some are of opinion that he was not much debilitated but that she got by her virtuous agents an artifice too immodest to be expressed to hinder penetration and thus she tormented him till he was contented to let her steer her own course which after run her on ground  for coming to london next winter with this full sail laden with lust she found the viscount much prepared for her who being at first fastened on the object absence and all those little artifices that mischievous women and cunning impostures could devise had advanced him as much in his desires as they had hindered the other we could dispute the nature of these operations how far they are contingent and how the fancy works with them though ignorant of them making their impulsions more active being the sparks that kindle this combustible matter for we will never allow there was any other diabolical means used nature being strong eenough for such a production but being not pertinent to the story will leave it and follow them that found the effects of it and had affections suitable to it which they made use of with an unbridled appetite yet meeting closely in corners sin being at first shamefacd but afterward they grew more bold and every hour that the viscount could steal from his royal master he dedicated it to his disloyal mistress being caught in this net of adulation he becomes a willing prisoner lust only getting liberty to all looseness and licentiousness places of frequent meetings are daily renewed persons fitted for such practices are employed and when nature was exhausted art her subtle imitator brought in her store to contribute new spirits purchased at any rate all outward adornment to present beauty in her full glory were not wanting on both sides being lusts fuel which tended to the consumption of all reason and among the rest yellow starch the invention and foil of jaundice complexions with great cutwork bands and piccadillies a thing that has since lost the name crowded in and flourished among us mrs turner being nominated to be the first contriver happily in england but the original came out from france which fashion and color did set off their lean and sallow countenances thus did the viscount get the conquest of two the king and this lady but could not subdue his own lustful appetite  however the kings affections were not so monopolizd but that his crafty servant the earl of salisbury had a good hole as well in his councils as treasure and being not well pleased to see himself bearded by a youth new started into the affairs of the world and mounted by the wing of love not of merit he cast out many mists before him to hinder and damp his passage so that the viscount could not rise to that pitch during his life that he afterward arrived at  on the  th day of november death deprived us of the kings eldest son prince henry a prince as eminent in nobleness as in blood and having a spirit too full of life and splendour to be long shrouded in a cloud of flesh  anno      the viscount rochester all this while though plunged in lust was held up by the chin in the glories of the court and the prince that interposed betwixt him and the beams of majesty being removed the earl of salisbury another obstacle dying six months after the prince in the way from the bath he now took full possession of the kings favors alone he executes the place of principal secretary receiving all pacquets and dispatching answers without the knowledge of the king or council or if the king did know his love had hoarded up such a confidence in him as he laid all out upon that stock rochesters greatest assistant was a private gentleman one sir thomas overbury by whose compass he steered his course who being a man of parts and abilities had wrought upon the viscount so as not only to keep him in and close with the king but to make him capable of managing the highest affairs if he had kept himself within the circle drawn to his hand this intimacy betwixt them spoke overbury an actor in all his privacies and when he understood by the viscount his intention of marriage with the countess of essex he opposed it with all the powerful arguments he could use for though he might be so active in his initiation of favor with the viscount to be assistant to his pleasures and for carrying forward some of his dark contrivances those secretaries being always the greatest favorites yet having now gotten good footing in his affection and building his fortune thereon his reason might tell him there could be nothing more destructive to both their growing hopes than to lay a foundation upon so much public injustice as to marry another mans wife her husband living therefore he passionately persuaded him to cast his thoughts upon a more honorable object and not one whose disloyalty in her present condition was so much branded with infamy that the marks of it would be visible on his face but the viscount bewitched with the enticements of his soulravishing mistress incapable of good counsel does not only call home his affections from overbury that had been long leiger with him denouncing enmity but incites his beloved against him also who mustering up all her passions with the greatest acrimony that a feminine malice could devise she never left till she had discharged all the vollies of her rage upon him and the better to do it she consults with her uncle the earl of northampton aggravating overburys offense as tending to the dishonor of their whole family that he a petty fellow should dare to raise such scandals against her innocence the earl of northampton that knew of the endearments betwixt the viscount and his niece so base and mercenary was his spirit thought it good policy to stop all passages that it might not come into the public mouth for being in a sphere elated above others it was a sin of a high presumption for any of an inferior orb to move but in its own place or meddle with what is above them he therefore closes with the viscount whom in his flattering acclamations by letters he makes a little deity and after some dispute of the manner how to be revenged of overbury they conclude to dispatch him by poison which could not be done so well in a public way and therefore they subtly contrive to exasperate the king against him that being a prisoner and shackled by them to a place he might be a more settled mark for their envenomed arrows  about the same time the king thinking fit to send an ambassador into flanders to the archduke some say into france the viscount recommended sir thomas overbury to the king for that service extolling his abilities and fitness for the same publicly that more notice might be taken of the affront and the king made choice of him for that employment which done the viscount under the shadow of friendship imparts to overbury what intentions the king had toward him but he thought it would not be so convenient for him to accept of it because he should not only lose his converse and company by such an alienation which he highly valued but many a fair opportunity of improving his respects to him in some better way of advancement overbury had not been so little a courtier or a man of so mean reason but that he was sensible what displeasure he should pull upon himself by refusing the kings commands and therefore he told the viscount that betwixt the kings favors and his friendship he had a great conflict in his spirit being willing to retain both but how he should refuse the kings commands with safety he knew not but the viscount with fair promises prevailed with him to set up his rest at home upon higher expectation such a sweet bait is ambition protesting to take off the asperity of the kings anger from him and smooth his way so as should be for his better advantage when he had wrought overbury in this forge he goes to the king and blows the fire incensing him with all the aggravations he could so that the poor gentleman for his contempt was forthwith committed to the tower and to prepare all things for his reception there sir william wade the late lieutenant was removed and sir jervis ellowis a person more ambitious than indigent having made his way by money the common merit was admitted to the place  now the countess like another alecto drove furiously her chariot having two wheels which ran over all impediments one was to sue a divorce betwixt her and her husband that she might marry the viscount the other was to take away overbury the blemish in her eye and that laid such a stain upon her that nothing but his blood could expiate for these she has several engines the one must be acted overtly the other covertly in dark corners and she and her agents find fit ministers for both  the earl of northampton resenting his nieces grievances makes the king acquainted with her maiden bashfulness how loath she is to divulge her husbands infirmities and how long it is since her marriage and yet she has not enjoyed the happiness of a wife that her husbands inability must needs be an unnatural conjunction such as neither law nor reason can admit of and that there was a great affection betwixt the viscount and her so as there seemed to be a more excellent sympathy and sweet composition of soul in them more suitable to reason and nature than in the state she was in which was seconded by the viscounts humble submissions to the kings great wisdom who he acknowledged had not only raised him to what he is but may yet make him more happy by uniting him to a lady of so much honor and virtue  the king that took delight to complete the happiness of them he loved commanded the bishops to sue out a divorce between the earl of essex and his lady that the viscount might marry her for he had been practiced formerly in scotland in his minority with the like experiment elizabeth daughter to the earl of athol being married to the earl of march under pretense of impotency but merely for lust as the vid johnstons hist of scotland author reports was divorced from her husband and married to the earl of arran the kings favorite who had been before a partner in her adulterous sheets so current is the parrallel and so equally are lust and ambition yoked together that they both with full violence draw one and the same way  the bishops and others having a commission under the great seal of england to convene the earl of essex and his countess before them sent out their summons and they made their appearance accordingly but before they proceeded they caused a jury of twelve discreet matrons to be impanelld to search the countess whether she were as she pretended to be and was reputed a maid still for if she were a maid they could fasten upon a nullity and so separate them for the more honor of her virginity the countess being ashamed and bashful to come to such a trial would not expose her face to the light but being to appear before the matrons under a veil another said to be one of sir thomas monsons daughters for the countess was reported to have had a child in the earls absence young gentlewoman that had less offended was fobbed into the place and she passed in the opinion both of jury and judges to be a virgin  these bishops and the rest of the judges could not be ignorant what scandalous reports of this ladys actions flew up and down from lip to lip which however sweetened by the partakers carried an ill savor with them in every honest understanding who were not blinded with wilfulness or deafned with prejudice which made the bishops of canterbury and london decline the business though nominated in the patent but kings will never want fit ministers in corrupted times both in church and commonwealth as long as there are degrees and places of ascent to clime to and though these things floated a while upon the streams of greatness yet there is one above that moves the waters who did not only see what passed in the bishops palace but in the closest prison which he discovered to the shame and ruin of the actors    the countesss attempts against the earl by sorcery the earl of essex being a gentleman of the fairest character and universally beloved he out of the natural sweetness of his temper took frequent occasions of admonishing his lady against those evils which common fame loaded her with but she being averse toward him and persuing with all her might the bent of her lascivious inclinations was deaf to his kind entreaties and privately conspired his destruction after the following manner  she became acquainted with one mrs turner a woman of a vicious character from her youth and who encouraged her in her wicked purposes against the earl by consenting to poison him which they attempted but their execrable design not taking effect the countess writ thus to mrs turner  sweet turner as thou have been hitherto so art thou all my hopes of good in this world my lord is as lusty as ever he was and has complained to my brother howard that he has not lain with me nor used me as his wife this makes me mad since of all men i loath him as the only obstacle and hindrance that i shall never enjoy him whom i love  yours etc frances essex   the earl having escaped this plot the hatred of the countess still increased toward him and drew her headlong into her own destruction he perceiving himself less regarded gives her fresh advice endeavoring if possible to reclaim her which she not in the least regarded but grew more enraged and in a great fury she takes her coach and repairs to mrs turner who was ready to assist in any evil act accordingly they repaired to one dr forman at lambeth who was skilled in the magic art him they feed to join with them who tried many devices to bewitch the earl all which failing at last they framed a waxen image and got a thorn from a tree that bore leaves and stuck them upon the privities of the said image by which means they accomplished their desire  this being done according to her expectation she repairs to her house at chartley and thither the earl comes to her but whether the earl was more lusty than she expected or what other accident happened it is unknown nevertheless she grew jealous of her acts and falls into a great fear that all their labor was lost whereupon she wrote a letter to dr forman to this effect viz  sweet father although i found you ready at all times to further me yet must i still crave your help wherefore i beseech you that you keep the doors close and that you still retain the lord with me and his affection toward me i have no cause but to be confident in you although the world be against me yet heaven fails me not many are the troubles i sustain the doggedness of my lord the crossness of mine enemies and the subversions of my fortunes unless you by your wisdom do deliver me out of the midst of this wilderness which i entreat for gods sake  from chartley your affectionote daughter frances essex   this letter coming to the hands of the old master procures a new attempt and now he goes and inchants a nutmeg and a letter one to be given the viscount in his drink the other to be sent to him as a present these things being accomplished he not long after died leaving behind him some of those letters whereby the countess had intercourse with him in his pocket which gave some light into the business amongst which this aforesaid letter was one  dr forman being dead mrs turner wanted one to assist her whereupon at the countesss coming to london one gresham was nominated to be entertained in this business and in process of time was wholly interested in it  the countess upon her return sends gratulations to the viscount and with those the letter sent her by dr forman he reads it and the more he reads it the more he is entangled for no man knows the mysteries that are contained in evil arts and who can withstand the mischiefs that are in evil tongues whereupon he returns answer and new places of meeting are assigned amongst the rest one at hammersmith in the mean time the viscount makes dispatch of his business leaves things half done half undone to the intent he might meet her who had there stayed for his coming above two hours and being met they solemnly saluted each other fell into diverse discourses and insinuating phrases from words to deeds and from speaking to acting the sin of venery  the countess having obtained that she desired and the viscount caught in the net of adulation the more he striveth to be loose is caught the faster so that lust having by this means got liberty being covered with greatness like a fire concealed in a pile of rotten wood burst forth in all looseness and licentiousness places of more frequent and private meetings are concluded upon between them persons fitting for their purposes being acquainted with their proceedings watchwords are given all things having relation to a certain end make them the bolder and more safely to accomplish that which both time and memory cannot demonstrate in former histories now these good parts which seemed heretofore to be hopeful in the viscount consume to cinders and the corruption remains to brand him in the forehead for his evil living his modesty becomes eclipsed his behavior light his carriage unseemly in his place nothing so costly no attire so uncouth but at all costs and charges he obtains it for the increase of favor new fashions are produced that so he might show more beautiful and fair and that his favor and personage might be made manifest to the world and to this purpose yellow bands dusted hair curled crisped frisled slicked skins opened breasts beyond accustomed modesty with many other inordinate attires were worn on both sides to the show of the world so that for the increase of dishonest appetites they were abundantly practiced surfeiting thus upon their pleasure having been before accustomed unto hardiness causes him to fall into all manner of forgetfulness letting all things go to wrack careless in attendance neglecting state affairs ignorant of his own worth subjecting himself to the lustful appetite of an evil woman accounting no time well spent nor hour deemed so happy as when dalliance and pleasant discourses pass between them either in words or writing  time could no longer conceal these secret meetings but at length the marriage of the viscount and countess were brought to light which when made public every one declaimed against her but extolled the earl of essex however an order was forthwith sent to him to repay her portion of  000 l to do which he was forced to sell part of his estate thereunto willingly consenting that he might get rid of her the king nevertheless continues his favor to the viscount and installed him earl of somerset but at last the joint wickedness of all these accomplices broke out in the murder of overbury upon which occasion the following letters found in dr formans closet after his death were produced in court at mrs turners arraignment by the doctors widow  the countesss letter to mrs turner to procure an enchantment for turning the viscounts affections toward her sweet turner i am out of all hope of any good in this world for my father my mother and my brother said i should lie with him and my brother howard was here and said he would not come from this place all winter so that all comfort is gone and which is worst of all my lord has complained that he has not lain with me and i would not suffer him to use me my father and mother are angry but i had rather die a thousand times over for besides the sufferings i shall lose his love if i lie with him i will never desire to see his face and if my lord do that unto me my lord is very well as ever he was so as you may see in what a miserable case i am you must send the party word of all he sent me word all should be well but i shall not be so happy as the lord to love me as you have taken pains all this while for me so now do

sake and get me from this vile place  your affectionate loving daughter frances essex give turner warning of all things but not the lord i would not have any thing come out for fear of my lord treasurer for so they may tell my father and mother and fill their ears full of noise     there were also showed in court certain pictures of a man and woman in copulation made in lead as also the mould of brass wherein they were cast a black scarf also full of white crosses which mrs turner had in her custody at the showing of these and enchanted papers and other pictures in court there was heard a crack from the scaffolds which caused great fear tumult and confusion among the spectators and throughout the hall every one fearing hurt as if the devil had been present and grown angry to have his workmanship showed by such as were not his own scholars and this terror coming about a quarter of an hour after silence proclaimed the rest of the cunning tricks were likewise showed  dr formans wife being administratix of her husband found letters in packets by which much was discovered she was in court and deposed that mrs turner came to her house immediately after her husbands death and did demand certain pictures which were in her husbands study namely one picture in wax very sumptuously apparalled in silks and sattins as also one other sitting in form of a naked woman spreading and laying forth her hair in a lookingglass which mrs turner did confidently affirm to be in a box and that she knew in what part or room of the study they were  mrs forman further deposes that mrs turner and her husband would be sometimes three or four hours locked up in his study together she did depose further that her husband had a ring would open like a watch  there was also a note showed in court made by dr forman and written in parchment signifying what ladies loved what lords in the court but the lord chief justice would not suffer it to be read openly in the court  mrs turner sent margaret her maid to mrs forman and wished that all such letters and papers as concerned the earl of somerset or the countess of essex or any other great personages should be burned telling her that the councils warrant should come to search the study and that all his goods might be seized whereupon she and her maid margaret with the consent of mrs forman burnt diverse letters and papers but yet she kept some without their privity  there were also enchantments showed in court written in parchment wherein were contained all the names of the blessed trinity mentioned in the scriptures and in another parchment  b  c  d  e and in a third likewise in parchment were written all the names of the holy trinity as also a figure in which was written this word corpus and upon the parchment was fastened a little piece of the skin of a man  in some of these parchments the devils had particular names who were conjured to torment the lord somerset and sir arthur manwaring if their loves should not continue the one to the countess the other to mrs turner  finally these faithful servants of the devil obtained the due reward of their deeds mrs turner was served first who being found guilty of the barbarous murder committed upon sir thomas overbury was condemned for the same and hanged at tyburn on wednesday november  0      sir jarvis ellowis was likewise hanged for the same on monday november the  0th following the viscount and countess were likewise found guilty of the said murder for which they were committed to the tower and although the king pardoned them they in a short time pined away their lives dying in the utmost disgrace at this time my lord of somerset little thought to have been laid in the tower and made heir of overburys bedchamber but by this course we may see that all things are in the hands of god  finis
