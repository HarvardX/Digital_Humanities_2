known for the detailed accounts he published of his travels in england wales ireland and france on the eve of the revolution after he inherited his fathers family estate in      he began experimenting with agricultural improvements in order to maximise output although he was not always successful in achieving his goals his writings contained very detailed observations and analysis of agricultural matters and were extremely popular he began with a course of experimental agriculture    0 based upon his personal experiences and then traveled widely commenting on the state of agriculture in britain and france the following books were the result a six weeks tour through the southern counties of england and wales      a six months tour through the north of england    0 farmers tour through the east of england      a tour in ireland             0 and travels in france during the years                     he also published a number of reference works on agriculture and farming which went through many editions and were translated into several european languages these included the farmers calendar     political arithmetic      and the    volume annals of agriculture      upon his return from france he was appointed to the position of secretary of the board of agriculture in the british government in which capacity he organized the collection and preparation of agricultural surveys of the english counties later in life he suffered from blindness brought on by severe cataracts and a failed operation to cure it young was a pioneer in the detailed observation of economic conditions in the countryside and the collection of statistical data relating to agriculture although modern historians dispute the reliability of his data and the conclusions he sometimes draws from them they recognise the important work he did in beginning the modern collection and analysis of this material young is also noteworthy for the sheer luck of being in france on the eve of and during the early part of the french revolution he was able to provide in his dairies close observations of the social political and economic conditions of the french countryside as it was convulsed by violent revolution this makes his travels in france      particularly valuable to historians politically young was a liberal reformer he urged the repeal of the penal laws which discriminated against catholics he condemned the british regulation of irish commerce and criticised the irish parliaments industrial policy of prohibitions and bounties he was a staunch supporter of property rights in agriculture as a means of reducing poverty some of his more famous sayings were the magic of property turns sand into gold and give a man the secure possession of a bleak rock and he will turn it into a garden give him a nine years lease of a garden and he will convert it into a desert bethamedwards miss matilda bethamedwards          published editions of youngs travels in france in      listed as

introduction by matilda bethamedwards it is with peculiar appropriateness that these famous travels are once more given to the world just a hundred years ago the suffolk squire accomplished his last journey under circumstances without parallel in history he had quitted paris towards the end of june      having come to the conclusion that with the constitution of the national assembly the whole business now seemed over and the revolution complete with true british coolness he pursued his agricultural inquiries this time taking an easterly direction on the ever memorable fourteenth of july we find him at metz leisurely as any modern tourist inspecting what was worth viewing in the city a few days later on reaching strasburg he learns the great news the bastille has fallen the whole kingdom is now in a blaze he sees famished mobs clamouring for bread he hears of seigneurs fleeing from burning châteaux he is roughly compelled to don the tricolour his liberty even life are menaced yet the imperturbable englishman goes on the wind carries his first cockade into the river he purchases a second taking care to have it securely fastened and although naïvely confessing the discomforts of travel in such an unquiet and fermenting moment the thought of turning back does not occur to him alone unarmed ignorant of the various patois—sole medium of intercourse in rural districts—our inquisitive and dauntless traveller visits one outoftheway region after another apparently unconscious whilst narrating these unique experiences that his conduct was little short of heroic the fittest introduction to the centennial edition of such a work is surely a survey of france in the present day—not made vi in the rotunda of the british museum or by the library fireside but after arthur youngs own fashion—the fruit of investigations as laboriously and lovingly pursued as those of my great predecessor i have now followed in his footsteps for upwards of fifteen years visiting and revisiting various parts of the country described by him so graphically on the eve of the revolution let us glance at the contrasted picture of france under the ancien régime and under the third republic his earliest journey takes him in a southwesterly direction through the orleannais and the berri where for the first time he meets with métayage—a miserable system he writes that perpetuates poverty and excludes instruction and he goes on to describe the fields as scenes of pitiable management and the houses of misery throughout the entire work we find métayage or farming on half profits condemned in the strongest terms yet nothing has done more to improve the condition of the peasant and of husbandry within the last fifty years  métayage indeed which is but another name for cooperative agriculture forms the steppingstone from the status of hired labourer to that of capitalist and whilst the métayer raises himself in the social scale extensive wastes are by his agency brought under cultivation so popular is la culture à mifruits that according to the census of           000 hectares were in the hands of métayers and    0000 in those of peasant owners in    0 a diminution is seen—   per cent of métayage to set against    per cent of proprietorship some parts of france are far more favourable to agricultural partnerships than others we find       métairies in the department of the landes       in the dordogne       in the allier       in the gironde whilst in the haute savoie and the lozère they may be counted by the hundred the lastnamed numbering     only in most cases be it remembered the métayer owns a bit of land two conditions are necessary to success in the first place the fermiergénéral or farm bailiff must be dispensed with in the second a good understanding is necessary between the two contracting vii parties—the one supplying land stock and implements the other manual labour all produce being equally shared from fifty to a hundred and fifty acres is found to be the most favourable size of a métairie ⚓ ✪ we will now consider the present state of things in the berri a region about which arthur young has nothing to say except that the husbandry was poor and the people miserable as all readers of georges sand know well it is a land of heaths and wastes but the extent of uncultivated tracts is being reduced year by year so rapid is the progress that the great novelist herself would hardly recognize certain portions of the country she has described so inimitably what then must be the changes wrought in a hundred years the transformation is partly realized by inspecting a prerevolutionary hovel here and there may be seen one of these bare windowless cabins now used as an outhouse and in juxtaposition the neat airy solid dwellings the peasant owners have built for themselves four years ago i was the guest of a country gentleman near châteauroux cheflieu of the department of the indre formed from the ancient berri formerly owner of an entire commune my host had gradually reduced his estate by selling small parcels of land to his daylabourers he informed me that whilst partly actuated by philanthropic motives he was commercially a gainer the expense of cultivating such large occupations was very great and he could not hope for anything like the returns of the small freeholder we visited many of these newlymade farms with their spickandspan buildings the whole having the appearance of a little settlement in the far west the holdings varied in extent from six to thirty acres their owners being capitalists to the amount of from two or three hundred to a thousand pounds in each case the purchaser had built himself a small but commodious dwelling and suitable outhouses the land was well stocked and cultivated the people were neatly and appropriately dressed and the signs of general contentment and wellbeing delightful to contemplate we next visited a métairie of nearly four hundred acres and here the farmstead was on a large scale the métayer employed several labourers who were boarded in the house as was formerly the custom in certain parts of england besides two or three dairymaids viii artificial manures and machinery had here come into use and if the culture could hardly be described as high farming the land was clean and very productive the cordial relations of bailleur and preneur or owner and métayer testified to the satisfactoriness of the arrangement not to be outdone by their rustic neighbours the artizans of the berrichon capital have with few exceptions become freeholders also suburban châteauroux has indeed been appropriated by this class the brandnew cottages and semidetached villas on the outskirts of the town representing the thrift of the mechanic—an instance of selfhelp and sobriety hardly equalled throughout france the houses were not only built for but by their owners in spare moments—another fact illustrating the innate economy of the french working man in purely agricultural districts of the indre land has quadrupled in value within the last forty or fifty years near the towns of course the rise has been much higher poitou is described by arthur young as an unimproved poor and ugly country it seems to want communication demand and activity of all kinds the ancient province of poitou comprises la vendée but if we turn to the three carefully drawn maps appended to the original edition of the french travels we find the very name so conspicuous a few years later omitted altogether such a blank need not astonish us who had so much as heard of la vendée before      asks a french historian of the vendean war was it a province a river a mountain was it in anjou brittany or poitou nobody knew and till the outbreak of the insurrection nobody cared to inquire only one road traversed the entire country—that from nantes to la rochelle—and on the creation of a department it was found absolutely necessary to build a town as cheflieu none of sufficient importance existing waste brushwood heath and morass with here and there patches of rye and buckwheat occupied the place of the fertile fields and rich pastures that now rejoice the eye of the traveller in bas poitou the transformation of recent years is startling enough on the occasion of my first visit to this province fifteen years ago many towns of the vendean plain and bocage were only accessible by diligence since that period railways have intersected the country in all directions—even the out oftheway ix little town of fontenaylecomte so precious to the archæologist has its branch line whilst schools railway stations and other buildings of public utility have risen in all directions niort cheflieu of the deux sèvres part of the ancient bocage and scene of the most terrible guerilla warfare of the blancs and the bleus now possesses a railway station worthy of a capital it may be briefly described as a town of   000 and odd souls without a beggar no rags dirt or vagrancy meet the eye in these clean wide airy streets the vendean costume still prevails and whilst all is primitive rustic and provincial evidences are here of immense and rapid progress the immediate entourage of the town is one vast fruit and vegetable garden the property of peasant owners melons tomatoes and peaches ripen in the sun purple grapes cluster yellow walls and luxuriant vegetation on all sides testifies to a highly favoured climate and soil the produce of these market gardens is renowned throughout france two hundred acres are given up to the culture of the onion only la vendée is a region of large tenant farms and one visited by me in the neighbourhood of niort may be accepted as a fair sample of the rest the occupation consisted of four hundred and fifty acres let on lease precisely as in england for sixtyfive years it had been held by members of the same family—a fact speaking volumes for both owner and tenant it had consisted in part of waste let at a nominal rent to begin with the sum being raised as the land increased in value mulerearing for spain is one of the chief resources of la vendée and we were shown upwards of forty young mules of great beauty varying in value from £ 0 to £ 0 the entire stock of the farm numbered seventy head of mules horses cows and oxen sixty sheep besides pigs and poultry vineyards cover a tract of  0000 hectares in this department but here as in many other places the phylloxera had wrought entire ruin only the blackened stocks remaining the tenant farmer i name as is almost universally the case owned a small portion of land very likely had inquiry gone back a generation or two we should have found métayage the beginning of this prosperous family their steppingstone from the condition of daylabourer to that of capitalist much larger holdings than the one just described exist in this part of france and if the traveller takes a southwesterly direction x from niort to the sea coast he will see a succession of large walledin farmsteads recalling the moated granges of the isle of wight the size and extent of the buildings attesting the importance of the occupation of languedoc arthur young writes in a very different strain the picture indeed drawn by him of peasant owners round about sauve and ganges in the department of the gard may well bear comparison with the travellers experiences today an activity has been here he writes that has swept away all difficulties before it and has clothed the very rocks with verdure it would be an insult to common sense to ask the cause the enjoyment of property must have done it give a man the secure possession of a black rock and he will turn it into a garden here it is necessary to put in a word of explanation our author sets down onethird of french territory as belonging to the peasant at the time he wrote this is one of the few errors of a very exact writer in reality only a fourth of the soil belonged to the people before the revolution their little holdings having been acquired by means of incredible laboriousness and privation the origin and development of peasant property throughout france can only be touched upon here we must go very far back farther even than the enfranchisement of the serfs by louis le hutin in order to trace the progressive transfer of land  the crusades especially that of st bernard brought about a veritable revolution in the matter of land tenure the seigneurs impoverished by all kinds of extravagance then sold portions of property not only to rich bourgeois and ecclesiastics but to their own serfs for the purpose of furnishing the necessary equipment many nobles thus succeeded in procuring ransom forfeiting patrimony for their souls good the small owner by little and little contrived to better his position and in the etats généraux of      summoned by the great anne of france for the first time we find free peasants taking part in a legislative assembly the tiers etat as a political body already existed xi in the words of a living authority lately quoted  peasant property far from being a device invented all of a piece and carried by force of law dates from a period long anterior to the revolution in some places the number of small parcels of land has hardly changed from early times the sale of church lands had by no means the effects attributed to it about onethird of these consisted of forest which was added to the state another third consisted of buildings and town property the remaining third consisting of land was sold in the lots actually existing without being divided at all and the purchasers were for the most part welltodo bourgeois these observations have seemed appropriate as much confusion still exists on the subject among ourselves that peasant property is the direct creation of the revolution appears to be the generally accepted theory in england had arthur youngs travels been read here with the attention paid to them by our french neighbours such an error would have been cleared up long ago the gard of which our traveller gives so glowing a description is by no means one of the most favoured departments the phylloxera and the silkworm pest have greatly affected the prosperity of both town and country yet the stranger halting at le vigan or making his way thence to millau in the aveyron finds himself amid a condition of things usually regarded as utopian—a cheerful welldressed selfsupporting population vagrancy unknown and a distribution of wellbeing perhaps without a parallel in any part of europe again and again will occur to his mind the famous passage with which virgil concludes his second georgic that beautiful picture of pastoral happiness which if imaginary in old roman days is so often realized in the rural france of our own next arthur young visits the landes on his way to bordeaux here extraordinary changes have taken place within the last twenty years what then must be the transformation wrought during the course of a century plantations the sinking of wells drainage and irrigation are fast fixing the unstable sands making fruitful the marsh and creating a healthful climate and fertile soil early in the present century the land xii here was sold au son de la voix  in other words the accepted standard of measurement was the compass of human lungs the stretch of ground reached by a mans voice sold for a few francs crops are now replacing the scant herbage of the salt marsh and the familiar characteristic of the landscape the shepherds stilts are already almost a thing of the past the échasse or in patois chanque a word dating from the english occupation and derived by some authorities from shank is naturally discarded as the morass is transformed into solid ground six hundred thousand hectares of landes planted with seapines produce resin to the annual value of fifteen million francs this noble tree the pinus maritima is here achieving a climatic revolution similar to the changes effected by the febrifugal eucalyptus in the once feverstricken plains of algeria the corktree or chêneliège has proved equally effective many arid tracts are now covered with magnificent forests of recent growth not only affording a source of revenue but transforming the aspect and climatic conditions of the country only an inconsiderable proportion of the landes remains in its former state arthur youngs second journey takes him through brittany and anjou here also advance has been so rapid within our own time that the traveller revisiting these provinces finds his notes of ten or fifteen years ago utterly at fault landes—landes—landes wastes wastes wastes a country possessing nothing but privilege and poverty such is the verdict passed by the suffolk squire on brittany in      the privileges were swept away with a stroke of the pen twelve months later the poverty though an evil not to be so summarily dealt with has gradually given way to a happier state of things of no french province can the economist now write more hopefully were i to renew my acquaintance with the friendly tenant farmers of nozay in the loire inférieure described by me elsewhere or the hospitable freeholders of hennebont in the morbihan i should without doubt find many changes for the better the sabots into which the bare feet of both master and men mistress and maids were thrust a few years ago have been xiii replaced by shoes and stockings wheaten bread and butchers meat find their way to many a farmhouse table cookery has improved wages have risen dwellings are built on a more wholesome plan  intellectual progress whilst hardly keeping pace with the spread of material wellbeing is yet satisfactory in the extreme when interrogated by travellers of our own day in french the breton peasant would shake his head and pass on only the ebbing generation now remains ignorant of its mother tongue one curious omission must have struck most readers of the french travels this quick and accurate observer who takes note of every object that meets his eye who traverses the three historic highroads diverging to the right and to the left in quest of information never by any chance whatever mentions a village school had such schools existed we may be sure that he would have visited them bequeathing us in a few graphic sentences an outline of their plan and working the education of the people was a dead letter in france at the time he wrote here and there the curé or frères ignorantins would get the children together and teach them to recite the catechism or spell a credo and paternoster writing arithmetic much less the teaching of french were deemed unnecessary the convention during its short régime          decreed a comprehensive scheme of primary instruction lay gratuitous and obligatory but the initiative was not followed up and the first law on the subject carried into effect was that of      how slowly matters advanced in brittany may be gathered from an isolated fact so late as      twothirds of the inhabitants of the ille and vilaine could neither read nor write it remained for the third republic to remove this stigma and within the last eighteen years schools have sprung up in all directions the department just named numbered in      between seven and eight hundred alone  xiv agricultural progress has been more rapid rotation crops and fourcourse farming have long superseded the ruinous method of sowing the same crops generally buckwheat or oats for several years in succession followed by an equally long period of fallow arthur youngs cornerstone of good farming a fine piece of turnips may now be seen here as at his native bradfield artificial manures and machinery are used instead of the dried leaves and antiquated implements once in vogue upper brittany has won for itself the name of the granary of western france from its abundance of corn the breton breed of horses and cattle is second to none throughout the country between the years    0 and    0 upwards of  00000 hectares of wastes have been brought under cultivation and the process of clearing goes steadily on to many causes are due this transformation of a region so long stationary foremost stands the great agricultural college of grand jouan near nozay in the loire inférieure founded in    0 our suffolk farmer sighed for such an institution and predicted the advantages that would accrue generally from training schools of practical and theoretic agriculture such schools alike on a large or modest scale the latter called fermeécole are now scattered all over france grand jouan precursor of the rest still retaining preeminence its object is twofold firstly to form good farmers gardeners landsurveyors and agricultural chemists secondly to develop the progress of agriculture by the introduction of the newest machinery and the most improved methods by farming high in fact for the benefit of outsiders the curriculum occupies two years and a half day students many of whom belong to the peasant class are received at a cost of two hundred francs yearly it is grand jouan that teaches us to farm remarked a tenant farmer of the neighbourhood to the present writer in      when showing with no little pride a field of turnips grown upon a layer of bone phosphate the spread of railways the creation of roads and other facilities of communication must be taken into account also the xv great advantages enjoyed by brittany in respect of climate magnolias and camellias flourish out of doors all the year round at nantes and arrived at st pol de léon finistère in november the tourist finds the soft air and warm sunshine of the south the fruit and vegetables of roscoff and other equally favoured spots produce sums that would have appeared fabulous a few years ago much more in arthur youngs time  the strawberries of plougastel alone bring an annual return of half a million francs these market gardens varying in extent from two or three to twentyfive hectares are the property of peasant owners but here as elsewhere a great variety of land tenure is found métayage whilst existing in the côtes du nord and the loire inférieure is not regarded with much favour by the breton tenant farming and ownership are more congenial to his somewhat uncompromising temperament the domaine congéable  a contract dating from the twelfth century and of universal acceptance fifty years ago is now found only in finistère and the morbihan nothing could be simpler than this arrangement—the owner handing over his land in return for a small rent the farmer becoming possessor of outbuildings if erected at his expense stock and crops both parties being at liberty to separate under certain conditions one of which was the reimbursement of outlay it will easily be seen that such a system would work well whilst the land possessed little value and capital was scarce nevertheless the domaine congéable is still to be found in what we may well call a land of survivals two of these unfortunately form a serious stumblingblock to progress and seem likely to outlast the picturesque costumes the oldworld traditions even the ancient speech of the french bretagne beggary and intemperance from time immemorial have degraded a population characterized by many sterling qualities so far back as       we find severe edicts against xvi drunkenness in brittany comprised in the celebrated judicial reforms of françois i and his legists according to this draconian code for the first offence the punishment was a term of bread and water diet in prison for the second flogging in case of incorrigibility loss of ears and banishment orphanages industrial schools benefit societies and other philanthropic measures are combating the first evil the second it is to be hoped will disappear with the gradual spread of education and material wellbeing great is the change that awaits the traveller in sunny lighthearted danceloving anjou the breton peasant taciturn reserved yet hospitable will set before his guest the best his larder affords—cyder ryebread baked weeks before hard cheese curds and whey in anjou the housewife brings out a white loaf fresh butter and jam wine even liqueur a lady tourist unaccompanied may safely entrust herself to a breton driver throughout the long days journey across solitary regions he will never once open his lips unless interrogated but the english visitor in an angevin countryhouse is soon regarded as a friend by all the neighbours many and many a time the labours in the field over the merry supper taken out of doors ended have i been invited to join the peasant folk in the joyous round accompanied only by the sound of their own voices and needing no other stimulus for ballroom a stretch of sward for illumination the stars young and old forget the long days toil and the cares of life in these innocent bacchanalia ofttimes the dance would be prolonged till near midnight the presence of a stranger apparently adding zest to the festivity but no matter how hilarious the mirth how openhearted the sense of fellowship no unseemly jest no indecorous word jars our ears maine and anjou writes our traveller have the appearance of deserts and he goes on to note one feature of the country which even in our own time is apt to convey an idea of poverty throughout the department of the maine and loire formed from the ancient anjou may still be seen those cavedwellings or troglodyte villages which astonished arthur young a century ago readymade habitations hollowed out of the tufa or yellow calcareous rock abounding in the department sometimes in our walks and drives we have the backs of the xvii houses towards us and see only their tall chimneys rising from behind the hedges elsewhere we come upon a vast cave in shape like an amphitheatre containing halfadozen cottages or human burrows crops and fruittrees flourishing overhead but already in      the darkest and most comfortless subterranean chambers had been abandoned and on revisiting the country fourteen years later i found neat new dwellings everywhere springing up the homes of peasant farmers built by themselves in the commune of st georges des sept voies i visited several new houses constructed at a cost varying from £ 0 to £  0 in every case most of the work being achieved by the owner one welltodo peasant was building for himself an eightroomed house or what in england would even be called a villa with flowergarden in front parlour kitchen and offices on the ground flour above four airy bedrooms in the maine and loire the land is much divided very few farms consist of a hundred hectares by far the larger proportion of three or four only or closeries yet between the years      and    0 0 the value of land showed a rise of  0 per cent and since that period progress has been far more rapid the creation of roads and railways the use of artificial manures and machinery the crossbreeding of stock had in      given the maine and loire the fourth rank among french departments whilst in    0 it stood first as a cornproducing country wine corn and fruit are largely exported and the slate quarries of angers the linen manufactories of cholet employ thousands of hands and bring in vast revenues the latter in      reaching the total of fifteen million francs the desert that saddened arthur youngs eyes may now be described as a land of goshen overflowing with milk and honey the peasant wastes nothing and spends little he possesses stores of homespun linen homemade remedies oil vinegar honey cyder wine of his own producing so splendid the climate so rich the soil that the poorest eats asparagus green peas and strawberries every day when in season and as everyone owns crops nobody pilfers his neighbour the absolute security of unguarded possessions is one advantage of peasant xviii property the absence of pauperism another each commune charges itself with the maintenance of its sick or aged poor provided no members of their own family are able to undertake the duty the hatefulness of dependence and the strong inducements to thrift held out by secure possession of the land render these public burdens comparatively light as a rule only intemperance or an accumulation of misfortunes reduce the french peasant to accept alms the third journey covers an enormous area and takes our traveller into regions widely divergent both in respect of scenery population and resources he begins with champagne traverses alsacelorraine as the forfeited departments of the upper and lower rhine are now called makes his way through the jura burgundy the bourbonnais auvergne obtains a glimpse of the rhône valley visits the papal state of avignon and the comté de nice familiar in these days as the riviera at the time he wrote an appanage of savoy it is curious that although fully recognizing the existence of peasant owners and as has been seen rendering ample justice to their thrift and laboriousness he never seems to have inspected any of the tiny holdings passed on the road probably the poor people humiliated by want and all kinds of wretchedness would have resented such an intrusion feeling in scriptural phrase verily to see the poverty of the land art thou come in our own day nothing flatters the flourishing farming folk of the seine and marne more than the visit of an inquiring stranger they are never too busy to be courteous and the curious in agriculture need not hesitate to put a string of questions what a contrast is presented by that recorded conversation with a peasant woman of marslatour meurthe and moselle and chance acquaintance made with a housewife of eastern france at the present time arthur young describes his interlocutor as miserably clad bent with toil and although youthful wearing a look of age whilst the story she poured out was one of hopeless struggle and unmitigated hardship the farmeress of the rich cheesemaking country of brie en champagne still works hard drives to market with her eggs and butter and even upon occasions lends a hand in the harvest field but on sundays and holidays her neat cotton dress is exchanged for a fashionable toilette xix her children receive a liberal education when her daughters marry they have a dowry of several thousand pounds   with beaming satisfaction and genuine hospitality she welcomes an english visitor offering new milk or cordials delighted to show her household stores of linen her dairy and poultry yard upon one occasion after a long ramble amid the cornfields and vineyards near couilly seine and marne i entered the shop of a village baker and asked for a roll the mistress very kindly invited me into her back parlour brought out excellent bread brie cheese the pleasant wine of the country refusing payment hospitable instincts are fostered by prevailing ease and wellbeing the little towns of this department all possess public baths personal cleanliness is a noteworthy feature and beggary is nil here however we have under consideration one of the wealthiest agricultural populations of france—the sale of cheese alone at the meaux market reaches the sum of six or seven million francs yearly fruit and vegetables are largely exported the village curé as well as his parishioners adding to income by the sale of pears and greengages you have come only just in time ladies said the vicaire of one of these villages to myself and friends bent on making a purchase during the summer of      almost all my greengages are ordered for the english market ah those english those english they monopolize everything our best fruit and the island of cyprus the rich red rose erroneously called provence rose was in reality introduced here by the crusaders but no longer forms an article of commerce provins ancient capital of la brie from which the rose derived its name is as picturesque a town as any in the country the popularity enjoyed by arthur young on the other side of la manche need not astonish us yet one passage of these travels can but raise painful reflection in every conscientious and patriotic mind nothing can be more painful to ardent sympathizers with france and french character than a sojourn in alsacelorraine the sorrowful indeed agonized clinging of born alsatians to the mothercountry once witnessed can never xx be forgotten but who is able to read the following passage by an english traveller in the rhine provinces just a hundred years ago without some change of feeling— in saverne writes arthur young in      i found myself to all appearances in germany looking at a map of france and reading histories of louis xiv never threw his conquest or seizure of alsace into the light which travelling into it did to cross a great range of mountains to enter a level plain inhabited by a people totally distinct and different from that of france with manners language ideas prejudices and habits all different made an impression of the injustice and ambition of such a conduct much more forcible than ever reading had done so much more powerful are things than words nowadays if you question a blueeyed fairhaired squarebuilt peasant girl of alsacelorraine as to her origin she will glance round shyly to assure herself that there are no unfriendly listeners and proudly reply in the tongue of her primitive ancestors recently the conquerors of the fatherland ich bin französisch geboren i am french by birth when spending an autumn in alsacelorraine five years ago i found mulhouse still a french town in every respect but name nous sommes plus français que les français we are more french than the french themselves was the universal sentiment of rich and poor expressed without reserve in english hearing a system of repression only to be compared to the russian rule in poland and wholesale immigration of born prussians is gradually forcing a hated nationality upon this population so susceptible and so warmhearted uniting the graces of the french character with the sturdy qualities of the teuton thrice unhappy alsace in the position of a beautiful and richlydowered orphan—alike the darling and the prey of one jealous fosterparent after another—the illfated country seems doomed to perpetual disenchantment and betrayal her affections no sooner firmly implanted than they are torn up by the bleeding roots of franchecomté not much is seen the travellers plans being disarranged by local disturbances he does however pass through the departments of the doubs and the jura formed from the ancient domain of mary of burgundy here again we who know every inch of the road are struck by what at first xxi appears an unaccountable omission no reference is made to the numerous village industries which now characterize the country not only from the economists point of view but also adding peculiar features to the landscape in the remotest valley of the jura breaking the solitude of pine forests mingling their din with the roar of mountain torrents is now heard the sound of millwheels and steam hammers tall factory chimneys not a little detracting from scenery inimitably described by ruskin whilst the majority of the inhabitants lead a pastoral life and cheesemaking is carried on everywhere hardly a hamlet but possesses its special manufactory or handicraft turnery and woodcarving at st claude gem polishing at septmoncel and oyonnax clock and spectacle making at morez   employ thousands of hands whilst among exports of lesser importance figure wadding gum clock cases bottles and baskets many of these trades are pursued by the craftsman at home and on his own account hours alike both pleasant and profitable have i spent in these cottage ateliers chatting with my hosts as they worked the clean little room opening on to a tiny garden the baby and the kitten sporting in the sun the woodcarvers are veritable artists and their elegantly carved pipestems find their way to the remotest corners of the earth diamond polishing and turnery were carried on in the jura several centuries ago for the most part however village industries as well as village schools were ignored by arthur young because they did not exist when in      he passed within a few miles of the marvellously placed little cathedral city of st claude the allpuissant countbishop inheritor of the rich abbey and its seigneurial dependencies had only just been compelled to enfranchise his forty thousand serfs these bondservants of a christian prelate whose cause the socalled atheist voltaire had pleaded magnanimously in vain were up to that time mainmortable—that is to say if childless they had no power to bequeath their property which accrued to the seigneur xxii the country was not without resources but its revenues did not enrich the tiller of the soil from early times the white wines of the jura were celebrated throughout france i have some wine of arbois in my cellar wrote the gay gascon henry iv to the duke de mayenne on their reconciliation and i send you two bottles which i think you will not dislike the pretty little town of arbois is worth visiting not only for the sake of tasting its matchless wine but also for its scenery—the valley of the cuisance is indeed a corner of eden the soil is poor and the land minutely subdivided in the jura yet the condition of the peasant is now one of comparative ease and entire independence both morally and intellectually these mountaineers rank high among the rural population of france an excellent notion of the mental capacities of the small landowners may be obtained by attending a sitting of the juge de paix the skill and readiness with which they state their cause and act the part of their own advocate are remarkable for the most part the quarrels among neighbours arise from contested boundaries the judge after patiently hearing both sides of the question settles matters for once and for all by visiting the spot and in person fixing the landmarks the villages of the doubs especially ornans home of the painter courbet so picturesquely placed are also active centres of industry kirsch fabricated from cherries of local renown absinthe tiles nails wire are largely manufactured to say nothing of the gruyère cheese the staple product of franche comté the revolution in a few years metamorphosed entire regions from this period dates the famous watchmaking commerce of besançon introduced by the convention in      it is now carried on so extensively that out of every hundred watches manufactured in france eightysix come from the cheflieu of the doubs in    0 the number of hands thus employed reached a total of   000 the bisontin watchmaker often works on his own account and here as at châteauroux in the indre is witnessed a striking example of thrift among the artizan class many of these working watchmakers contrive by dint of extreme laboriousness and economy to purchase a vineyard or garden in the suburbs they build a summerhouse or xxiii even châlet and with wives and children there spend sundays and holidays amid their fruit and flowers from franche comté our traveller reaches burgundy and the bourbonnais in the neighbourhood of autun saône and loire he tells us that he looked for fat farmers and found only starving métayers the department is neither preeminent in the matter of agriculture nor of social advance yet it is a sight nowadays to see the fat farmers at the september fair of autun from early morning they pour into the town some in gigs or hooded carriages with wife and children others on foot and the greater number driving their cattle—the splendid white oxen known as the morvan breed these peasant farmers wear under the blue blouse shining broad cloth and betake themselves at midday to the first hotel in the place there to enjoy the table dhôte breakfast but no sooner is business over without losing a moment untempted by fireworks and other entertainments all set off homewards such experiences enable us to understand the stability and solid wealth of the french farmer he is not above work and does not disdain the uniform of labour the same strict attention to daily concerns is seen on the occasion of a general election just before attending one of these cattle fairs of autun i happened to be staying at st honorélesbains in the adjoining department of the nièvre when an election took place the peasant farmers although the day was sunday performed their electoral duties with the utmost despatch and returned to their homes much of the scenery of this part of france has an english look we see fields set round with lofty hedges winding lanes sweeps of gorse and heather alternately recalling devonshire and sussex here are found tenant farms large properties cultivated by their owners small holdings parcelled out among the peasants and métairies it was inevitable that a traveller in arthur youngs time should miss many objects of striking interest on the way the first itineraries of france seem to have been inspired by the englishmans example—i allude to the voluminous works of millin and vaysse de villiers published in the early part of the present century the departmental system had not as yet created a french map or in the strict acceptance of the word french xxiv geography archæology was a dead letter and very little interest was felt even by educated people in the scenery or curiosities of their native land thus he halted at auray and there was no one to point out the great stone avenues of carnac and the dolmens of locmariaker he passed through alsace ignoring the famous shrine and grandiose site of st odille extolled by goethe in his poetic reminiscences arrived at autun he was within easy reach of avallon so nobly towering over the beautiful valley of the cousin and of the abbey church of vézélay unique in splendour and of unique renown here too he was on the threshold of the little celtic kingdom of the morvan where village communism as existing among patriarchal tribes remained in force till our own day and where the stalwart husbandman still throws over his shoulder the gallic sagum or short cloak worn by the contemporaries of vercingetorix the last village commune was broken up in      the inhabitants of this most picturesque but unproductive country depend largely on industrial earnings many migrating to paris and other towns and there pursuing various trades during part of the year the curious flottage à bûches perdues or floating of loose logs a speciality of the morvan gives work to thousands of men women and children at certain seasons a wretched village occupied the site of the worldfamous ironfoundries of le creusot when arthur young journeyed from autun to nevers in      these works now covering a superficies of three hundred acres and employing ten thousand hands have developed into a town almost tripling the respective populations of the abovementioned towns chefslieux of the saône and loire and the nièvre from the mild healthy and pleasant plains of the bourbonnais he passed into auvergne obtaining a glimpse of the rich limagne of which mr barham zincke has given us an exhaustive account the velay is rapidly traversed and the château of polignac visited already deserted by its owners the thankless protégés of louis xvi and marie antoinette from its ruined battlements and prison towers the tourist now beholds a heartquickening scene of rural ease and smiling fertility far and wide the beautifully cultivated plain with its varied crops not one inch of land wasted the whole forming a brilliant patchwork of green fields and yellow corn whilst dotted here xxv and there are neat little homesteads and pasturing flocks and herds from le puy cheflieu of the hauteloire in spite of wretched inns and troublous times montélimar on the rhône is reached at that time belonging to dauphiné in our own cheflieu of the drôme here he describes mountains covered with chestnuts and various articles of cultivation which in districts not waste or volcanic are waste or in a great measure useless until the ravages of the phylloxera the choicer vineyards of the drôme sold at the rate of  0000 francs the hectare but the manufactures of crest and romans now constitute the chief wealth of this department next he visits avignon and the country of venaissin described as one of the richest districts in the kingdom and followed by a picture of vaucluse no traveller has as yet surpassed it was not till two years later be it remembered that the papal state of avignon and the little comté venaissin were incorporated into french territory at the request of the inhabitants forming with the principality of orange and a portion of provence the department of vaucluse the supersession of madder by chemical dyes and the phylloxera have of late years greatly diminished the revenues of this wealthy region which if visited in summer almost persuades the stranger that he is in the east nothing can be more oriental than the veteran figtrees the peach orchards the olive groves all veiled with finest white dust beneath a burning blue sky here may be said to end arthur youngs survey of france on the eve of the revolution an enterprise altogether original and carried out under extraordinary circumstances we need not feel astonishment at the great popularity enjoyed by his work on the other side of the channel whilst many fairly educated english folk have never so much as heard the authors name it is familiar to every schoolboy in france the suffolk squires scathing summingup of the ancien régime whenever you stumble upon a grand seigneur even one that is worth millions you are sure to find his property desert is cited in the elementary histories for public schools approved by the minister of education whilst moreover english students have been hitherto compelled to resort to the british museum or wait long and patiently for an expensive copy of these travels to xxvi turn up at a secondhand booksellers unabridged edition after edition has appeared in paris   arthur young did not hesitate to tell his french readers some blunt hometruths apparently taken in excellent temper his journal must be described for all that as one long graceful acknowledgment of courtesies and hospitalities recorded in an age when anything like international friendship was rare indeed the book has greater claims upon french sympathy in spite of certain reservations it is a vindication of peasant property and the revolution the two cardinal points of french belief from the first page to the last he sets down the abject wretchedness of the people and the stagnant condition of trade and commerce to bad government but another adage of our wise and honest traveller his famous axiom the magic of property turns sands to gold equally with improved administration must account for the contrasted picture that now meets our view by the light of afterevents he was led to modify his ideas concerning the establishment of a democracy in france but he had already given his experiences to the world he could not undo the effect of his published work and the observations summed up in his final chapter to quote a great living critic were a luminous criticism of the most important side of the revolution worth a hundred times more than burke paine and macintosh all put together young afterwards became panicstricken but his book remained there the writer enumerates without trope or invective the intolerable burdens under which the great mass of the french people had for long years been groaning it was the removal of those burdens that made the very hearts core of the revolution and gave to france that new life which so soon astonished and terrified europe   into arthur youngs services to agriculture we have no space xxvii to enter here they have been briefly indicated by the brilliant but all too rapid historian of the english people the numerous enclosure bills writes mr green which began with the reign of george the second and especially marked that of his successor changed the whole face of the country ten thousand square miles of untilled land have been added under their operation to the area of cultivation while in the tilled land itself the production had been more than doubled by the advance of agriculture which began with the travels and treatises of mr arthur young his claims are not only those of a foremost agriculturist an indefatigable promoter of the arts of peace a citizen of the world in the widest acceptation of the name he had pondered long and deeply on those social and political problems that occupy thinkers of our own day eminently practical he yet indulged from time to time in the loftiest idealism why may not the time come he writes in an early work when the whole world shall be in a state of knowledge elegance and peace scattered throughout his writings we find side by side with a statesmanlike grasp of facts veritable flashes of inspiration a deep philosophical insight into the possibilities of human progress   xxviii my warm thanks are due to mr and mrs arthur young grandson and granddaughterinlaw of the great agriculturist without whose kind assistance the following memoir could not have been written the materials were placed at my disposal whilst enjoying the hospitality of bradfield hall the modern mansion occupying the site of arthur youngs old home i also beg to express my indebtedness to m paul joanne and other obliging correspondents french and english xxix biographical sketch by matilda bethamedwards arthur young was born sept         at whitehall but this accident of birthplace does not deprive suffolk of a distinguished son his home from the first as it remained throughout the greater part of his life was bradfield hall of bradfieldcombust near bury st edmunds a property held by the young family since    0 he was the youngest son of the reverend dr arthur young prebendary of canterbury cathedral chaplain to arthur onslow speaker of the house of commons and rector of bradfield and of lucretia born de coussmaker a lady of dutch extraction whose family accompanied william iii to england mr speaker onslow and the bishop of bristol stood sponsors for the boy appropriate inauguration of a life destined to be spent in the best company from his father an extremely handsome man six feet in stature and the author of a learned work commended by voltaire he inherited good looks a striking presence and literary facility from his mother an inordinate craving for knowledge and conversational powers of a high order he describes her as very amiable and cheerful fond of conversation for which she had a talent and a great reader on a variety of subjects she brought her husband a very large dowry and no inconsiderable portion of this handsome jointure seems to have been swallowed up in the speculations of her son one of the greatest agriculturists and least successful practical farmers who ever lived we can easily understand arthur youngs love of rural life and keen appreciation of scenery after a visit to bradfield reached from marks tey on the great eastern railway it is a sweet spot in the near neighbourhood of much of the beautiful country with which gainsborough has familiarized us alighting at the quiet little station of whelnetham we follow a xxx winding road overhung with lofty elms that leads to the village or in summer kneedeep in wild flowers and waving grasses we may take a traverse through the meadows their lofty hedges a tangle of eglantine and honeysuckle on every side stretches of rich pasture cornfields and woods the place has a very oldworld look here and there between the trees peeps a whitewashed cottage with overhanging thatched roof or a farmhouse of equally rustic appearance very little modernization having taken place in these regions the suffolk farmer as arthur young modestly calls himself was in reality a country squire his old home has been replaced by a gothic mansion but nothing can be more squirarchal than the wellwooded park ornamental water with its swans queen annes garden and stately avenues leading to church and lodge which remain as they were in his own time opposite the gates of bradfield hall stands the village alehouse no quainter more antiquated hostelry in rural england between park and village consisting of church rectoryhouse and a dozen cottages lies the broad elmbordered road leading to the railway station this is the old london coach road followed by our traveller when setting forth on his french travels a hundred years ago enterprises regarded by his family mad as those of don quixote himself entrancing as were these adventuresome journeys we can fancy with what pleasure he hailed the first glimpse of bradfield on returning home safe and sound from one expedition after another as happens with so many men of genius arthur young owed little to schools or schoolmasters he was first sent to the grammar school at lavenham—that exquisitely clean picturesque village with its noble cathedral—no other name befits the church—lying between sudbury and whelnetham i was sent to this school he writes in order to learn the latin and greek languages with the addition of receiving instruction in writing and arithmetic taught by a man who attended every day for that purpose but whether from my being a favourite of his or having my attention too much affected by frequent visits to bradfield i afterwards found myself so illgrounded in those languages that for some time before leaving school i found it necessary to give much attention to xxxi recover lost time my mother soon bought me a little white pony which was sent every saturday to bring me home and though the plan was that of returning every monday morning yet the weather or some other circumstance would often occasion delays not a little injurious the latter part of the time i had a pointer and a gun and went out with the master i had also a room to myself and a neat collection of books and i remember beginning to write a history of england thinking that i could make a good one out of several others how early began my literary follies i seemed to have a natural propensity to writing books pretty well this for a boy of nine or ten all readers of the travels in france will remember arthur youngs love of music and the drama his diary shows at what an early age those tastes were fostered in his thirteenth year he tells us he is taken to london sees garrick in tragedy and hears the messiah another characteristic equally familiar to us is his deep admiration of personal beauty and his delight in the society of graceful attractive women this too we find a feature of his somewhat precocious boyhood what commanded more of my attention he writes was a branch of learning very different from greek it was the lessons i received from a dancingmaster who came over once a week from colchester to teach the boys and also some young ladies two of these in succession made terrible havoc with my heart the first was a miss betsey harrington a lavenham grocers daughter who was admitted by all who saw her to be truly beautiful on quitting lavenham his destiny remained for a moment undecided his father wished him to be sent to eton and thence to one of the universities his mother opposed the scheme and he was apprenticed with a premium of £ 00 to a mercantile firm at lynn he wrote of this resolve in a strain of regret those who come after him cannot share had paternal influence prevailed he tells us his life might have been very different originality is nowhere more refreshing than in the church it is pleasant to fancy arthur young a bishop but what other pen would have given us that inimitable picture of rural france on the eve of the great revolution who else would have fought so valiantly the cause of the farmer at home xxxii every circumstance he tells us attending this new situation was most detestable to my feelings till i effected an improvement by hiring a lodging surrounding myself with books and becoming acquainted with a miss robertson the daughter of the elder partner she was of a pleasing figure with fine black expressive eyes danced well and performed on the harpsichord as she received instructions from mr burney dr burney the author of the history of music then a person in the highest estimation for his powers of conversation and agreeable manners in these interesting reminiscences he speaks of the great foppery prevailing in dress—a weakness from which he was not himself exempt as the vivacious fanny burney will tell us byandby his extraordinary—we are almost tempted to say abnormal—energy becomes apparent in these early days the future author of a history of agriculture in ten folio volumes was already busy with the pen writing pamphlets on the theatre of the present war in america and kindred topics for each of which he received the value of ten pounds in books—an arrangement between publisher and literary aspirant that might perhaps be judiciously followed in these days in      being just twenty he left lynn without education pursuits profession or employment he writes despondingly his father died during the same year somewhat later whilst at bristol recruiting from illness his skill in chessplaying attracted the attention of a military authority who offered him a commission in a cavalry regiment if we could ill have spared arthur young for the church still more should we have begrudged him to the army again his mother interfered and posterity owes her a debt of gratitude instead of exchanging bullets and sabre thrusts with his french neighbours arthur young was now destined to the more pacific international giveandtake of roots and seeds he became from that time a farmer i was absolutely destitute of all means of advancement in any path of life that promised an independent support so situated i could hardly fail of following the maternal advice to try what farming could do i rented a small farm of my mothers and farmed from      to      having taken a second farm that was in the hands of a tenant i gained some xxxiii knowledge but not much and the painful effect was to convince me that to understand the business in any perfection it was necessary to continue my exertions for many years and the circumstance perhaps of all others in my life which i most deeply regretted and considered as a sin of the blackest dye was my publishing the result of my experiences during these four years which speaking as a farmer was nothing but ignorance folly presumption and rascality the only use which resulted from these years was to enable me to view the farms of other men with an eye of more discrimination than i could possibly have done without that practice it was also the occasion of my going on the southern tour in      the northern tour in      and the eastern in    0 extending through much the greater part of the kingdom and the execution of these tours was considered by all who read them and they were very generally read to be of most singular utility to the general agriculture of the kingdom it will not escape observation that these jottings of old age interesting at they are err on the side of redundancy and epexegesis we wholly miss the vivacity terseness and vigour of the french travels at twentyfour he married miss martha allen of lynn sister to fanny burneys stepmother the marriage brought him an enviable connection—troops of friends a passport into brilliant circles but no fireside happiness the lady was evidently of a captious disposition shrewish temper and narrow sympathies i wonder how he could ever marry her wrote the quicksighted author of evelina on the other hand a generous woman might perhaps have had some ground for jealousy a few years later arthur young became famous courted by the great a conspicuous figure in society handsome witty versatile he certainly found a london salon more to his taste than a dull farmhouse—a days outing with the burneys more congenial than heavy landfarming in wet weather last night writes fanny in the gossipy ecstatic invaluable journal of girlhood while hetty susey and myself were at tea that lively charming spirited   mr young entered the room oh how glad we were to see him he was in extremely good spirits later she adds well but now for our xxxiv greenwich party talking of happiness sensibility and a total want of feeling my mamma said turning to me heres a girl will never be happy never whilst she lives for she possesses perhaps as feeling a heart as ever girl had some time after when we were near the end of our journey and so said mr young my friend fanny possesses a very feeling heart he harped on this some little time till at last he said he would call me feeling fanny it was characteristic he said and a good deal more nonsense that put me out of all patience which same virtue i have not yet sufficiently recovered to recount any more of our conversation charming as it was in the meantime he was making one disastrous attempt at practical farming after another like a desperate gamester doubling the stakes with every loss for a year or two after his marriage he remained at bradfield farming a copyhold of twenty acres his sole fortune and eighty more the property of his mother this experiment proving a failure he next hired an occupation of three times the size in essex which he was glad to be rid of in five years time paying a premium of £ 00 to the incoming tenant his successor a practical farmer made a good deal of money out of the concern probably as much as arthur young had lost by it so hampering to worldly success is the possession of original ideas one of his farms he describes as a devouring wolf an epithet that need not surprise us when we consider that he made  000 experiments on his suffolk holding alone the superstitious might see in the pertinacity with which mrs young encouraged her sons ventures some preternatural foreshadowing of his career again and again she advertised for a farm for him and nothing better offering itself he hired some land in hertfordshire which ere long he anathematized as a hungry vitriolic gravel a nabobs fortune would sink in the attempt to raise good arable crops to any extent in such a country one of the most curious incidents in a career that detractors might well call quixotic is the origin of the famous english tours will it be believed that just as cervantes halfmad hero set out in search of chivalrous adventure and dr syntax in search of the picturesque this thriceruined farmer determined xxxv to explore the entire country till he could find land that would pay whenever he put pen to paper he was successful whenever he turned to experimental farming he almost ruined himself these narratives of home travel from an agricultural point of view were a novelty and also supplied an actual want not only did he give a succinct picture of farming as carried on at that time in various parts of england but much information valuable to the general reader the three works were largely sold yet the author grew poorer and poorer in    0 fanny burney gives a vivacious jaunty picture of her uncle as she used to call him she describes him as most absurdly dressed for a common visit being in light blue embroidered with silver having a bag and sword and walking in the rain he was grown all airs and affectation she adds yet i believe this was put on for what purpose i cannot tell unless it were to let us see what a power of transformation he possessed a year later we have a very different account mr and mrs young have been in town for a few days scribbled the girldiarist they are in a situation that quite afflicts me mr young whose study and dependence is agriculture has half undone himself by experiments his writings upon this subject have been amazingly well received by the public and in his tours through england he has been caressed and assisted almost universally indeed his conversation and appearance must ever secure him welcome and admiration but of late some of his facts have been disputed and though i believe it to be only by envious and malignant people yet reports of that kind are fatal to an author whose sole credit must subsist on his veracity in short by slow but sure degrees his fame has been sported with and his fortune destroyedhis children happily have their mothers jointure settled upon them he has some thoughts of going abroad but his wife is averse to it a few weeks later she adds mr young is not well and appears almost overcome with the horrors of his situation in fact he is almost destitute this is a dreadful trial for him yet i am persuaded he will still find some means of extricating himself from his distresses at least if genius spirit and enterprise can avail his own diary for this year contains the following entry xxxvi the same unremitting industry the same anxiety the same vain hopes the same perpetual disappointment no happiness nor anything like it he had indeed reached one of the acutest crises of his muchtried life ruin stared him in the face but three months after that last sorrowful mention of her favourite fanny burney once more strikes a cheerful note mr young had dined with her sister and herself she wrote fortune she hoped smiled on him again for he again smiled on the world the originator of three thousand unsuccessful experiments was hardly the man to lose faith in himself if occasional fits of dejection overtook him he was ready an hour after to enter upon a history of agriculture throughout all ages and in all countries make gigantic schemes in the interest of english husbandry or to hire four thousand acres of yorkshire moorland with the intention of turning the wilderness into a garden his powers of work of hoping against hope of throwing heart and soul into new interests and undertakings were phenomenal of the year      he writes labour and sorrow folly and infatuation here began a new career of industry new hopes and neverfailing disappointment and once more the careless yet inimitable pen of fanny burney gives us in a few lines the catastrophe that had wellnigh shipwrecked his life i have had lately a very long and very strange conversation with mr young we happened to be alone in the parlour and either from confidence in my prudence or from an entire and unaccountable carelessness of consequences he told me that he was the most miserable fellow breathing and almost directly said that his connexions made him so and most vehemently added that if he was to begin the world again no earthly thing should prevail with him to marry that now he was never easy but when he was in a plowcart but that happy he could never be i am very sorry for him but cannot wonder in june      after a passage of twentyfour hours he landed in ireland his stay did not extend over three years and during a part of the time he was occupied in managing lord kingsburys estate in county cork the result nevertheless was a survey of the country and an inquiry into the condition of the people which for accuracy fulness of detail and acuteness of observation render it invaluable to this day arthur xxxvii youngs tour in ireland wrote lord lonsdale to croker in      has given me the idea that his views of ireland were nearer the truth than any other work an accession of fame does not always mean an increase of fortune and the future was as hard a problem to the popular author now in the prime of life and the fulness of powers as to the ambitious stripling of twenty on his return from ireland he wrote i arrived at bradfield on the first of january and had then full time to reflect upon what should be the pursuit of my life and upon what plan i could devise for that fresh establishment of myself which should at the same time prevent any relapse into those odious dependencies and uncertainties which from      to      had been the perpetual torment of my life whilst i was hesitating what plan to follow an emigration to america crossed my mind and much occupied my thoughts this project was prevented by his mothers advanced years and instead he took up leases on her estate gradually increasing his occupation to four hundred acres henceforth his home was bradfield of which a few years later he became owner my father he tells us inherited bradfield from his father bartholomew young esq called captain from a command in the militia and it is remarkable that with only a part of the present estate he lived genteelly and drove a coach and four on a property which would in the present time only maintain the establishment of a wheelbarrow four children had been born to him two daughters and a son and after an interval of thirteen years his youngest and bestbeloved child the little girl familiar to readers of the french travels whilst he appears to have been an affectionate and conscientious father all the passionate depth and tenderness of his nature were lavished on this latest born his darling child his lovely bobbin her name was martha but her bright quick ways rosy complexion and dark vivacious eyes had won for her the pet name of robin afterwards changed to bobbin and these mentions of bobbin in private diaries little notes written to her from france and letters to others concerning her welfare show his character in a new and touching light this exquisite child—for the adoring praise of her father is amply substantiated by others—was the supreme joy and consolation xxxviii of a life often steeped in uncommon bitterness and when she died there went forth a wail from an utterly desolated heart that moves us to tears after the long lapse of years this awful shadow is as yet far off the existence of his darling corresponded to the most brilliant years of arthur youngs career glancing at the entries made between    0 and      that is to say between the irish and french journeys we find many a stirring episode and much evidence of indefatigable even colossal labours undertaken in a hopeful spirit some of these memoranda are passing humorous he tells us for instance how whilst at petworth on a visit to lord egremont he went into a bath at four oclock am the thermometer standing below zero and on coming out walked straight into a shrubbery and rubbed himself in the snow to see the effect of cold upon the body it had none he complacently adds except that of increasing strength and activity from another note we learn that he had been busy on stanzas to a lady the year      opens with the project of the annals of agriculture which he calls as well he might do one of the greatest speculations of his life literary contributions were invited from all sides and the work was launched under royal patronage arthur young not only acted as editor but wrote voluminously for its pages the annals consist of fortyfive quarto volumes and although much of the information therein contained has been superseded they form in the words of a competent authority a noble addition to any library it is here as a statesman that arthur young stands preeminent on questions of home or international trade on commerce or prices on monopolies on religious bigotry on class arrogance and insolence on endowed charities on the poor laws on the law of settlement on taxation direct and indirect on bounties and drawbacks he knew as much as cobden and has written as wisely that which his great contemporary adam smith reasoned out arthur young seems to have reached with electric despatch by instinct   the annals made a noise in the world even dr burney xxxix wrote enthusiastically about them would he were ten years younger he said he would take arthur youngs white house and as much land as he could spare and enter himself as his scholar from far and near came testimonies equally flattering and from remote quarters of europe flocked disciples and pupils to sit at the feet of the modern varro among those who found their way to bradfield were three young russians sent by the empress catherine to study farming under his care he gives an amusing account of their examination one of the three was so much awed that he resolutely refused to open his lips for which offence adds the narrator i sincerely hope he was not sent to siberia later came the nephew of the polish ambassador a heavy dull man with a tartar countenance his intention was to learn agriculture but he made poor progress the duke de liancourt that amiable champion of the revolution the president of the dijon parliament—and other distinguished personages familiar to readers of the french travels—also visited bradfield in the midst of these multifarious and engrossing occupations the scheme of an agricultural survey of france was gradually taking shape in his mind whilst contributing largely to the annals making a variety of experiments with the aid of priestley holding what may be called a professorial chair in his own home he was full of new projects in      he had crossed to calais with his son arthur just to say that he had been in france in      his friends the duke de liancourt and lazonski invited him to join them in a pyrenean tour and the invitation was accepted this was touching a string tremulous to vibrate he writes i had long wished for an opportunity to examine france my darling child my lovely bobbin i left in perfect health the rest of my family well and provided for in every respect as they had themselves chalked out the annals lodged in the hand of a man on whose friendship and abilities i could entirely confide in spite of vehement remonstrances and agonized entreaties he set out i implore you to give up this mad scheme think of your wife and children his brother had written and much more in the same strain working himself up into a veritable frenzy of panic an expedition to patagonia or a journey round the world could hardly have inspired this xl timid counsellor with livelier terrors he certainly never expected to see the foolhardy traveler again arthur youngs mother had died two years before and the event is thus noted in his journal my ever dear and venerated mother died happy happy spirit during her lifetime as we have seen he shrank from the notion of quitting england it is a curious and interesting fact that these french journeys exactly realized a plan of travel laid down in an early work if we turn to the last chapter of that wellwritten and characteristic little book the farmers letters to the people of england second edition      we shall find his own agricultural survey of france anticipated in every point the nobility and men of large fortune travel he writes but no farmers unfortunately those who have this peculiar and distinguishing advantage the noble opportunity of benefitting themselves and their country seldom inquire or even think about agriculture then follows the sketch of a farmers tour in routes laid down for his imaginary traveller being precisely those he was himself to follow a decade later french flanders must be visited lorraine and the adjoining provinces champagne and burgundy then the tour of franche comté and of the lyonnais should be made next that of normandy brittany orleannais and anjou all the noble improvements of the marquis de turbilly in that province ought to be viewed with the most attentive eyes from anjou the traveller should journey through guienne and languedoc next examine provence—then enter dauphiné gascony and examine the heaths of bordeaux thence make his way to spain and travel towards galicia to few of us is granted in middle age such entire fulfilment of the worthiest aspirations of youth little perhaps did the writer foresee that he was himself to be that wise and honest traveller who should describe rural france on the eve of the revolution not only for his own countrymen and his own epoch but for all europe and generations to come we are gratified to find him at turbilly warmly received by its noble owner and inspecting his farm as he begged to be allowed to do with the oldest surviving labourer of the late marquis he had left no anxieties behind him when setting out for france but his heart is ever with his adored child the fond xli letters he wrote to her in his large clear enviable handwriting have all been preserved from moulins august        he writes bobbin being then four years old i think it high time to inquire how you do pass your time how the mag magpie does and the four kittens i hope you have taken care of them and remembered your papa wants cats do the flowers grow in your garden are you a better gardener than you used to be the marquis de guerchys little girls have a little house on a little hill and on one side a little flower garden on the other side a little kitchen garden which they manage themselves and keep very clean from weeds bobbin would much like to see it from bagnères de luchon he writes to his eldest daughter do not forget to let me know how bobbin does god send her well and free from accidents i hope she does not go alone near hedges for fear of snakes from limoges he sends many kisses to his dear little bobbin and her sister mary is to say that he will be sure to bring her a french doll we must pass briefly over these rich happy dazzling years the french travels obtained all the éclat of a brilliant invention which indeed in a literary sense they may be described no one had done the same thing before and now it was done to perfection the authors name was soon in everybodys mouth he received invitations to halfadozen courts all the learned societies of europe and america enrolled him as a member his work was translated into a score of languages and princes statesmen political economists wits—not only of his own nationality but from various parts of the world—paid a visit to bradfield among his correspondents and guests were washington pitt burke wilberforce la fayette priestley jeremy bentham that eccentric yet admirable philanthropist berchtold and the due de liancourt never perhaps had been seen in suffolk such distinguished international gatherings the burneys were of course frequent visitors at the pleasant country house described in camilla occasionally the too hospitable host—for although now owner of the maternal estate arthur young was far from rich—would give a fête champêtre at an early hour the guests arrived the fishponds in the park were dragged and after a long animated xlii morning spent by both sexes out of doors the party sat down to a four oclock dinner degustating the fish just caught travelling on the continent was now out of the question but the home journeys were continued we find mention of an eleven days tour in yorkshire made at a cost of £    s he also visited norfolk bedfordshire and essex meantime the pen was as busy as ever in the year      the editor contributed twentyfive papers to the annals on various subjects mr pitts speech the abolition of the slave trade turnips in germany a spanish merino ram inter alia the merino ram was a present from the king and is thus commented upon in the journal this year      his majesty had the goodness to present me with a present of a spanish ram the world is full of those who consider military glory as the proper object of the ambition of monarchs who measure regal merit by the millions that are slaughtered by the public robbery and plunder that are dignified by the title of dignity and conquest and who look down on every exertion of peace and tranquillity as unbecoming those who aim at the epithet great and unworthy the aim of men that are born for masters of the globe my ideas are cast in a very different mould and i believe the period is advancing with accelerated pace that shall exhibit character in a light totally new and shall rather brand than exalt the virtues hitherto admired that shall pay more homage to the prince who gave a ram to a farmer than for wielding the sceptre it is hardly necessary to remind the reader that these reminiscences belong to old age no one could write more agreeable english than the suffolk squire in his prime a ram and a secretaryship of £ 00 a year such were the ultimate rewards of a man of splendid talents one who had rendered signal services to his country seldom indeed is the irony running through human fortunes so forcibly brought home to us the lesson of the poets words so humiliatingly borne out— alas the gratitude of men has oftner left me mourning in      the board of agriculture was established by act of parliament here arthur young saw the realization of a xliii darling scheme and as secretary he was certainly the right man in the right place yet he felt doubtful of nomination and even laid a wager of books with his friend sir john sinclair a set of the annals against the statistical history of scotland that some one else would be chosen for the post he lost his wager and thus wrote of his appointment what a change in the destinies of a mans life instead of entering the solitary lord of  000 acres in allusion to his former purchase of yorkshire moorland in the keen atmosphere of lofty rock and mountain torrent with a little creation rising gradually around me making the black wilderness smile with cultivation and grouse give way to industrious population active energetic though remote and tranquil and every instant of my existence making two blades of grass grow where one was found before behold me at a desk in the smoke the fog the din of whitehall it is well to be reminded writes an author before quoted mr pell that a distinguished man like arthur young was satisfied to hold in old age an appointment with a salary of £ 00 a year finding herein a haven of rest after all his troubles and labours in this new capacity he showed all his phenomenal powers of work the business of the new board was carried on with the utmost assiduity whilst directing several clerks and organizing schemes innumerable he found time for literary undertakings that would have appalled the soul of any but varro himself it is odd that these two great authorities on agriculture removed from each other by twelve centuries should be among the most voluminous writers on record arthur young had already begun his history of agriculture the opus magnum the crowning achievement of his life destined as he hoped to be his legacy to the nation alas like many another bequest of its kind it occupies a spare cupboard into which the light of day never enters the encyclopædia was eventually finished and consisted of ten folio volumes of manuscript some years after his death a relation and devoted disciple got through the formidable task of reducing the ten massive tomes to six we hardly know which to admire most the industry of author or compiler were a third enthusiast to take the matter in hand and pare down the abridgment by yet a sixth we should doubtless have a compendium of husbandry adapted to every library xliv and perhaps the only work of the kind ever produced by a single pen meantime honours and distinctions continued to pour in the empress catherine sent him a magnificent gold snuffbox with two rich ermine cloaks for his wife and eldest daughter from her representative at moscow came a second snuffbox set with diamonds and inscribed with the words in russian from a pupil to his master the society of arts adjudged him the honorary gold medal the salford agricultural society offered a special medal on which was engraved for his services to his country and fanny burney paid him her prettiest compliments which very likely he valued far more than gold snuffboxes or medals in a letter preserved at bradfield occurs the following—ps will honeycomb says if you would know anything of a ladys meaning always provided she has any when she writes to you look at the postscript now pray dear sir how came you ever to imagine what you are pleased to blazon to the world with all the confidence of selfbelief that you think farming the only thing worth manly attention you who if taste rather than circumstances had been your guide might have found wreaths and flowers almost any way you had turned as fragrant as those of ceres the enforced residence in london had many attractions he dined out he tells us from twentyfive to thirty times in one month and had received during the same period forty invitations from people of the highest rank and consequence he mentions the fact of having had two interviews with the king and what interests us in a far greater degree a dinner in company of hannah more i was very eager he writes in listening to every word that fell from her lips though not nearly so much so as i should have been many years after an allusion explained by the last pages of this memoir in      he visited burke and this entry is too interesting to be passed by the pair had corresponded on agriculture and had met before burke was naturally delighted with arthur youngs recantation the example of france he had not seen he wrote anything in this controversy which stood better bottomed it was a most able useful and reasonable pamphlet i reached mr burkes before breakfast writes young and had every reason xlv to be pleased with my reception why mr young said burke it is many years since i saw you and to the best of my recollection you have not suffered the smallest change you look as young as you did sixteen years ago you must be very strong you have no belly your form shows lightness you have an elastic mind i wish i could have returned anything like the compliment but i was shocked to see him so broken so low and with such expressions of melancholy i almost thought that i had come to see the greatest genius of the age in vain the conversation was remarkably desultory a broken mixture of agricultural observations french madness price of provisions the death of his son the absurdity of regulating labour the mischief of our poor laws the difficulty of our cottagers keeping cows an argumentative discussion of any opinion seemed to distress him and i therefore avoided it speaking on public affairs he said i never read a newspaper but if anything happens to occur which they think will interest me i am told of it i observed there was strength of mind in the resolution oh no he replied it is mere weakness of mind it was evident that he would not publish on the subject that had brought me to gregorys here arthur young alludes to a project mooted in parliament for regulating the price of labour but he declared himself absolutely inimical to any regulation whatever by law that all such interference was not only unnecessary but mischievous he observed that the supposed scarcity was extremely ill understood and that the consumption of the people was clear proof of it this in his neighbourhood was not lessened as he had learned by a very careful examination of many bakers butchers and excisemen nor had the poor been distressed further than what resulted immediately from that improvidence which was occasioned by the poor laws after breakfast he took me a sauntering walk for five hours over his farm and to a cottage where a scrap of land had been stolen from the waste i was glad to find his farm in good order and doubly so to hear that it was his only amusement except the attention he paid to a school for sixty children of noble french emigrants mrs crewe arrived just before dinner and though she exerted herself with that brilliance of imagination which renders her conversation so interesting it was not sufficient to raise the xlvi drooping spirits of mr burkeyet he tried once or twice to rally and once even to pun mrs crewe observing that thelwel was to stand for norwich observed that it would be horrid for mr wyndham to be turned out by such a man aye mr burke replied that would not tell well she laughed at him in the style of condemning a bad pun somebody said it was a fair one burke said it was neither very bad nor very good my visit on the whole adds arthur young was interesting i am glad once more to have seen and conversed with the man who i hold to possess the greatest and most brilliant parts of any person of the age he lived in but to behold so great a genius so depressed with melancholy stooping with infirmity of body feeling the anguish of a lacerated mind and sinking into the grave under accumulated misery—to see all this in a character i venerate and apparently without resource or comfort wounded every feeling of my soul and i left him next day almost as lowspirited as himself the clouds were already gathering about his own horizon a year later and he too was a griefstricken desolated prematurely aged man his second daughter elizabeth married to a son of hoole the translator of ariosto had died of consumption in      signs of the same terrible disease now began to show themselves in his bright his adored bobbin in the midst of his engrossing occupations we find him constantly thinking of her writing long letters fulfilling her childish commissions bobbin has expressed a wish for a workbox and he bestows as much attention on the purchase as if he were in treaty for  000 acres of moorland he had looked at a good many he wrote but could find none under twentyfive shillings or at still higher prices he hears however that good ones are to be had at a lower figure and will continue his researches he shows the most painful eagerness about her health she is to tell him every particular as to appetite sleep pulse thirst one of these letters ends thus i cannot read half your mothers letter but enough to see that she is very angry with me for i know not what he sends strict orders concerning her miss patty is to ride out in the chaise or on double horse when bonnet a bailiff is not obliged to be absent from the farm if he is at market when the days are long and miss patty rises early she xlvii can have a ride before breakfast bonnet is to pay miss patty a shilling a week in another note he reasons with the little patient on the childishness of demurring at medicines she is ordered steel and only takes it under protest he urges her by the love she bears her father to follow out the doctors orders in every particular change of air was tried but the precious life could not be saved she died about twelve months after his visit to burke on friday morning june    at twelve minutes past one he writes my dear angelic child breathed her last in a note below follows a later entry here was my call to god oh may it prove effective he never recovered from the blow in his overpowering grief he could not bear to part with the mortal remains of his darling when at last he consented to interment the coffin was placed under the family pew her heart lying where he knelt in prayer he wept himself blind the terrible calamity that now gradually overtook him being indeed imputed to excess of weeping sorrow mastered unmanned a nature singularly hopeful and elastic he became a prey to morbid introspection to the gloomiest views of human life he fell at last into the mood that incites men to write or read such works as baxters saints rest or in our own day to join the salvation army the blindness came on by slow degrees and for some time he remained at his post in london i am alone and therefore at peace he writes significantly in      i rise at four or five and go to bed at nine or ten i go to no amusements and read some scripture every day i never lay aside my good books but for business he still continues to see old friends however and his former interest in public affairs does not wholly desert him during the same year he visits pitt several times at holwood and throws heart and soul into new enterprises the loss of his child has awakened pity for suffering childhood in one month alone we find seven dinners given to about fortyeight poor children each time another entry is to this effect dinner to fifteen poor children eleven shillings another dinner do do another to thirtyseven poor children sixteen shillings and sixpence and so on and so on perhaps the following note may have something to do with these charities      sold copyright of xlviii my travels for   0 guineas what travels these were he does not say the business of the board was still carried on as laboriously as before but in   0  he writes that his sight is so indifferent he is afraid of writing at all and further on my eyes grow worse and worse for me to read a letter of two sheets and a half would be a vain attempt i pick out as much as they will let me three years later he was operated upon for cataract and from a curious and interesting letter written by his wife we learn the cause or supposed cause of failure all seemed going on well with the somewhat intractable patient and the oculists held out good hope of recovery on one condition he must remain calm weeping would be fatal wilberforce paid him a visit as he sat bandaged in a dark room the visitor had been cautioned on no account whatever to agitate him but either underrating his friends susceptibility or his own he began in his soft gentle voice the duke of grafton is dead and went on to speak of the dukes death so touchingly that the other burst into tears the mischief was done past recall the last twelve years of life were spent by arthur young in total blindness they were busier for all that than those of many men in the meridian he was now chiefly at bradfield where the indefatigable veteran severely taxed the energies of his comparatively youthful associates besides his secretary m de st croix he often enjoyed the friendly services of a granddaughter of dr burneys miss francis by name a lady who like mezzofanti was a monster of languages a briareus of parts of speech a walking polyglot it was a definite understanding that this linguistic knowledge—to what special uses it was put we are not informed—should be kept up every day miss francis enjoyed an hour or more for the purpose of reading a little latin greek hebrew spanish italian dutch and so on in a letter to her brother mary young the only surviving daughter amusingly describes one of these long wellfilled days when at bradfield she tells us miss francis slept over the servants hall with a packthread round her wrist this packthread passing through the keyhole communicated with arthur youngs room and when he wanted to awake her which was generally between four or five oclock in the morning he pulled xlix it on which she immediately rose the pair would then sally forth for a two hours walk on the turnpike road stopping at some farmhouse to take milk and afterwards distributing religious tracts at the cottages by the way miss francis questioning the people upon their principles reading to them and catechizing the children at halfpast eight   they return writes miss young as that is the hour m st croix gets up who finds it quite enough to read and write for two hours and a half before breakfast after breakfast the three adjourn to the library till one when mr st croix takes his walk for an hour miss francis and my father read write or walk till three oclock he puts children to school at bradfield cockfield and stanningfield and every sunday they meet and are catechized every sunday night a hundred meet when mr st croix reads a sermon and chapter and my father explains for an hour after which a prayer dismisses them last sunday they arthur young and the linguist went to church at acton every sunday they go to acton or ampton each church ten miles out and ten home besides teaching the schools and the meeting in the hall she adds my father has taken out a license for the hall ie bradfield as there is an assembly of people which would have been liable to information this letter bears date may         the sunday evening services made a deep impression on the country folks the villagers of bradfield and the neighbourhood still talk of the blind old squire who was a great preacher they know little or nothing of his literary fame the achievement by which he will be remembered is to them a sealed book but he lives in local memory as a second wesley a wonderful stirrerup of mens consciences an unrivalled expounder of the gospel there is still living at bury st edmunds      a nonagenarian who has a vivid recollection of arthur youngs sermons in his vehemence the orator would move to and fro till he gradually had his back turned to the congregation whereupon his daughter or secretary would gently place their hands upon his shoulders and restore him to the proper position it is a touching figure we now take leave of that blind fervid silverhaired preacher a hundred eager faces fixed upon l his own the rapt silence of the crowded meetingplace only broken by his trembling impassioned tones for the story of arthur youngs life is mainly told the world had not yet lost sight of him he was from time to time pleasantly reminded of the conspicuous part he had played in it he tells us how in      when breakfasting with wilberforce he met general macaulay who recently travelling from geneva to lyons had visited a french farm where he found everything in the highest style of management and so much superior to all the rest of the country that he inquired into the origin of such superiority the answer of the owner was my cultivation is entirely that of monsieur arthur young whose recommendations i have carried into practice with the success you see for the most part the remaining years were uneventful he bore his privations and infirmities with resignation and retained full possession of his faculties to the last he died at sackville street on the  0th april    0 and was buried at bradfield the handsome tomb in the form of a sarcophagus erected to his memory stands close to the roadside over against the entrance to his old home passersby may read the somewhat stilted yet veracious inscription on the outer slab— let every real patriot shed a tear for genius talent worth lie buried here in france such a man would have had his statue long ago perhaps this more modest tribute were more to his taste that a native of his beloved suffolk herself a frequent wayfarer throughout the length and breadth of france should edit his french travels a hundred years after they were written would surely have pleased arthur young well of his children two survived him his daughter mary who

agriculture contain many contributions of arthur young not reprinted elsewhere liv lv preface it is a question whether modern history has anything more curious to offer to the attention of the politician than the progress and rivalship of the french and english empires from the ministry of colbert to the revolution in france in the course of those   0 years both have figured with a degree of splendour that has attracted the admiration of mankind in proportion to the power the wealth and the resources of these nations is the interest which the world in general takes in the maxims of political œconomy by which they have been governed to examine how far the system of that œconomy has influenced agriculture manufactures commerce and public felicity is certainly an inquiry of no slight importance and so many books have been composed on the theory of these that the public can hardly think that time misemployed which attempts to give the practice the survey which i made some years past of the agriculture of england and ireland the minutes of which i published under the title of tours was such a step towards understanding the state of our husbandry as i shall not presume to characterise there are but few of the european nations that do not read these tours in their own language and notwithstanding all their faults and deficiencies it has been often regretted that no similar description of france could be resorted to either by the lvi farmer or the politician indeed it could not but be lamented that this vast kingdom which has so much figured in history were likely to remain another century unknown with respect to those circumstances that are the objects of my enquiries an hundred and thirty years have passed including one of the most active and conspicuous reigns upon record in which the french power and resources though much overstrained were formidable to europe how far were that power and those resources founded on the permanent basis of an enlightened agriculture how far on the more insecure support of manufactures and commerce how far have wealth and power and exterior splendour from whatever cause they may have arisen reflected back upon the people the prosperity they implied very curious inquiries yet resolved insufficiently by those whose political reveries are spun by their firesides or caught flying as they are whirled through europe in postchaises a man who is not practically acquainted with agriculture knows not how to make those inquiries he scarcely knows how to discriminate the circumstances productive of misery from those which generate the felicity of a people an assertion that will not appear paradoxical to those who have attended closely to these subjects at the same time the mere agriculturist who makes such journies sees little or nothing of the connection between the practice in the fields and the resources of the empire of combinations that take place between operations apparently unimportant and the general interest of the state combinations so curious as to convert in some cases well cultivated fields into scenes of misery and accuracy of husbandry into the parent of national weakness these are subjects that never will be understood from the speculations of the mere farmer or the mere politician they demand a mixture of both and the investigation of a lvii mind free from prejudice particularly national prejudice from the love of system and of the vain theories that are to be found in the closets of speculators alone god forbid that i should be guilty of the vanity of supposing myself thus endowed i know too well the contrary and have no other pretension to undertake so arduous a work than that of having reported the agriculture of england with some little success twenty years experience since that attempt may make me hope to be not less qualified for similar exertions at present the clouds that for four or five years past have indicated a change in the political sky of the french hemisphere and which have since gathered to so singular a storm have rendered it yet more interesting to know what france was previously to any change it would indeed have been matter of astonishment if monarchy had risen and had set in that region without the kingdom having had any examination professedly agricultural the candid reader will not expect from the registers of a traveller that minute analysis of common practice which a man is enabled to give who resides some months or years confined to one spot twenty men employed during twenty years would not effect it and supposing it done not one thousandth part of their labours would be worth a perusal some singularly enlightened districts merit such attention but the number of them in any country is inconsiderable and the practices that deserve such a study perhaps still fewer to know that unenlightened practices exist and want improvement is the chief knowledge that is of use to convey and this rather for the statesman than the farmer no reader if he knows anything of my situation will expect in this work what the advantages of rank and fortune are necessary to produce—of such i had none to exert and could combat lviii difficulties with no other arms than unremitted attention and unabating industry had my aims been seconded by that success in life which gives energy to effort and vigour to pursuit the work would have been more worthy of the public eye but such success must in this kingdom be sooner looked for in any other path than in that of the plough the non ullus aratro dignus honos was not more applicable to a period of confusion and bloodshed at rome than one of peace and luxury in england one circumstance i may be allowed to mention because it will shew that whatever faults the ensuing pages contain they do not flow from any presumptive expectation of success a feeling that belongs to writers only much more popular than myself when the publisher agreed to run the hazard of printing these papers and some progress being made in the journal the whole ms was put into the compositors hand to be examined if there were a sufficiency for a volume of sixty sheets he found enough prepared for the press to fill   0 and i assure the reader that the successive employment of striking out and mutilating more than the half of what i had written was executed with more indifference than regret even though it obliged me to exclude several chapters upon which i had taken considerable pains the publisher would have printed the whole but whatever faults may be found with the author he ought at least to be exempted from the imputation of an undue confidence in the public favour since to expunge was undertaken as readily as to compose—so much depended in the second part of the work on accurate figures that i did not care to trust to myself but employed a schoolmaster who has the reputation of being a good arithmetician for examining the calculations and i hope he has not let any material errors escape him lix the revolution in france was a hazardous and critical subject but too important to be neglected the details i have given and the reflections i have ventured will i trust be received with candour by those who consider how many authors of no inconsiderable ability and reputation have failed on that difficult theme the course i have steered is so removed from extremes that i can hardly hope for the approbation of more than a few and i may apply to myself in this instance the words of swift—i have the ambition common with other reasoners to wish at least that both parties may think me in the right but if that is not to be hoped for my next wish should be that both might think me in the wrong which i would understand as an ample justification of myself and a sure ground to believe that i have proceeded at least with impartiality and perhaps with truth lx    travels during the years           and      there are two methods of writing travels to register the journey itself or the result of it in the former case it is a diary under which head are to be classed all those books of travels written in the form of letters the latter usually falls into the shape of essays on distinct subjects of the former method of composing almost every book of modern travels is an example of the latter the admirable essays of my valuable friend mr professor symonds upon italian agriculture  are the most perfect specimens it is of very little importance what form is adopted by a man of real genius he will make any form useful and any information interesting but for persons of more moderate talents it is of consequence to consider the circumstances for and against both these modes the journal form hath the advantage of carrying with it a greater degree of credibility and of course more weight a traveller who thus registers his observations is detected the moment he writes of things he has not seen he is precluded from giving studied or elaborate remarks upon insufficient foundations if he sees little he must register little if he has few good opportunities of being well informed the reader is enabled to observe it and will be induced to give no more credit to his relations than the sources of them appear to deserve if he passes so rapidly through a country as necessarily to be no judge of what he sees the reader knows it if he dwells long in places of   little or no moment with private views or for private business the circumstance is seen and thus the reader has the satisfaction of being as safe from imposition either designed or involuntary as the nature of the case will admit all which advantages are wanted in the other method but to balance them there are on the other hand some weighty inconveniences among these the principal is the prolixity to which a diary generally leads the very mode of writing almost making it inevitable it necessarily causes repetitions of the same subjects and the same ideas and that surely must be deemed no inconsiderable fault when one employs many words to say what might be better said in a few another capital objection is that subjects of importance instead of being treated de suite for illustration or comparison are given by scraps as received without order and without connection a mode which lessens the effect of writing and destroys much of its utility in favour of composing essays on the principal objects that have been observed that is giving the result of travels and not the travels themselves there is this obvious and great advantage that the subjects thus treated are in as complete a state of combination and illustration as the abilities of the author can make them the matter comes with full force and effect another admirable circumstance is brevity for by the rejection of all useless details the reader has nothing before him but what tends to the full explanation of the subject of the disadvantages i need not speak they are sufficiently noted by shewing the benefits of the diary form for proportionably to the benefits of the one will clearly be the disadvantages of the other after weighing the pour and the contre i think that it is not impracticable in my peculiar case to retain the benefits of both these plans with one leading and predominant object in view namely agriculture i have conceived that i might throw each subject of it into distinct chapters retaining all the advantages which arise from composing the result only of my travels   at the same time that the reader may have whatever satisfaction flows from the diary form the observations which i made upon the face of the countries through which i passed and upon the manners customs amusements towns roads seats c may without injury be given in a journal and thus satisfy the reader in all those points with which he ought in candour to be made acquainted for the reasons above intimated it is upon this idea that i have reviewed my notes and executed the work i now offer to the public but travelling upon paper as well as moving amongst rocks and rivers hath its difficulties when i had traced my plan and begun to work upon it i rejected without mercy a variety of little circumstances relating to myself only and of conversations with various persons which i had thrown upon paper for the amusement of my family and intimate friends for this i was remonstrated with by a person of whose judgment i think highly as having absolutely spoiled my diary by expunging the very passages that would best please the mass of common readers in a word that i must give up the journal plan entirely or let it go as it was written—to treat the public like a friend let them see all and trust to their candour for forgiving trifles he reasoned thus depend on it young that those notes you wrote at the moment are more likely to please than what you will now produce coolly with the idea of reputation in your head whatever you strike out will be what is most interesting for you will be guided by the importance of the subject and believe me it is not this consideration that pleases so much as a careless and easy mode of thinking and writing which every man exercises most when he does not compose for the press that i am right in this opinion you yourself afford a proof your tour of ireland he was pleased to say is one of the best accounts of a country i have read yet it had no great success why because the chief part of it is a farming diary which however valuable it may be to consult nobody will read if therefore you print your journal at all print it so as to be read or reject the method entirely and confine yourself to set dissertations remember the travels of dr — and mrs — from which it would be difficult to gather one single important   idea yet they were received with applause nay the bagatelles of baretti amongst the spanish muleteers were read with avidity the high opinion i have of the judgment of my friend induced me to follow his advice in consequence of which i venture to offer my itinerary to the public just as it was written on the spot requesting my reader if much should be found of a trifling nature to pardon it from a reflection that the chief object of my travels is to be found in another part of the work to which he may at once have recourse if he wish to attend only to subjects of a more important character   journal may         the streight that separates england so fortunately for her from all the rest of the world must be crossed many times before a traveller ceases to be surprised at the sudden and universal change that surrounds him on landing at calais the scene the people the language every object is new and in those circumstances in which there is most resemblance a discriminating eye finds little difficulty in discovering marks of distinctions the noble improvement of a salt marsh worked by mons mouron of this town occasioned my acquaintance some time ago with that gentleman and i had found him too well informed upon various important objects not to renew it with pleasure i spent an agreeable and instructive evening at his house—    miles the   th nine hours rolling at anchor had so fatigued my mare that i thought it necessary for her to rest one day but this morning i left calais for a few miles the country resembles parts of norfolk and suffolk gentle hills with some inclosures around the houses in the vales and a distant range of wood the country is the same to boulogne towards that town i was pleased to find many seats belonging to people who reside there how often are false ideas conceived from reading and report i imagined that nobody but farmers and labourers in france lived in the country and the first ride i take in that kingdom shews me a score of country seats the road excellent boulogne is not an ugly town and from the ramparts   of the upper part the view is beautiful though low water in the river would not let me see it to advantage it is well known that this place has long been the resort of great numbers of persons from england whose misfortunes in trade or extravagance in life have made a residence abroad more agreeable than at home it is easy to suppose that they here find a level of society that tempts them to herd in the same place certainly it is not cheapness for it is rather dear the mixture of french and english women makes an odd appearance in the streets the latter are dressed in their own fashion but the french heads are all without hats with close caps and the body covered with a long cloak that reaches to the feet the town has the appearance of being flourishing the buildings good and in repair with some modern ones perhaps as sure a test of prosperity as any other they are raising also a new church on a large and expensive scale the place on the whole is chearful and the environs pleasing and the seashore is a flat strand of firm sand as far as the tide reaches the high land adjoining is worth viewing by those who have not already seen the petrification of clay it is found in the stoney and argilaceous state just as what i described at harwich annals of agriculture vol vi p    —   miles the   th the view of boulogne from the other side at the distance of a mile is a pleasing landscape the river meanders in the vale and spreads in a fine reach under the town just before it falls into the sea which opens between two high lands one of which backs the town—the view wants only wood for if the hills had more fancy could scarcely paint a more agreeable scene the country improves more inclosed and some parts strongly resembling england some fine meadows about bonbrie  and several chateaus i am not professedly in this diary on husbandry but must just observe that it is to the full as bad as the country is good corn miserable and yellow with weeds yet all summer fallowed with lost attention on the hills which are at no great distance from the sea the trees turn their heads from it shorn of their foliage it is not therefore to the s w alone that we should attribute   this effect—if the french have not husbandry to shew us they have roads nothing can be more beautiful or kept in more garden order if i may use the expression than that which passes through a fine wood of mons neuvilliers and indeed for the whole way from samer  it is wonderfully formed a vast causeway with hills cut to level vales which would fill me with admiration if i had known nothing of the abominable corveès  that make me commiserate the oppressed farmers from whose extorted labour this magnificence has been wrong women gathering grass and weeds by hand in the woods for their cows is a trait of poverty pass turbarries  near montreuil  like those at newbury the walk round the ramparts of that town is pretty the little gardens in the bastions below are singular the place has many english for what purpose not easy to conceive for it is unenlivened by those circumstances that render towns pleasant in a short conversation with an english family returning home the lady who is young and i conjecture agreeable assured me i should find the court of versailles amazingly splendid oh how she loved france—and should regret going to england if she did not expect soon to return as she had crossed the kingdom of france i asked her what part of it pleased her best the answer was such as a pair of pretty lips would be sure to utter oh paris and versailles her husband who is not so young said touraine it is probable that a farmer is much more likely to agree with the sentiments of the husband than of the lady notwithstanding her charms—   miles the   th dined or rather starved at bernay  where   for the first time i met with that wine of whose ill fame i had heard so much in england that of being worse than small beer no scattered farmhouses in this part of picardy all being collected in villages which is as unfortunate for the beauty of a country as it is inconvenient to its cultivation to abbeville  unpleasant nearly flat and though there are many and great woods yet they are uninteresting pass the new chalk chateau of mons st maritan who had he been in england would not have built a good house in that situation nor have projected his walls like those of an almshouse abbeville is said to contain   000 souls it is old and disagreeably built many of the houses of wood with a greater air of antiquity than i remember to have seen their brethren in england have been long ago demolished viewed the manufacture of van robais  which was established by lewis xiv and of which voltaire and others have spoken so much i had many enquiries concerning wool and woollens to make here and in conversation with the manufacturers found them great politicians condemning with violence the new commercial treaty 0 with england— 0 miles the   st it is the same flat and unpleasing country to flixcourt   —   miles the   d poverty and poor crops to amiens women are now ploughing with a pair of horses to sow barley the difference of the customs of the two nations is in nothing more striking than in the labours of the sex in england it is very little that they will do in the fields except to glean and make hay the first is a party of pilfering and the second of pleasure in france they plough and   fill the dungcart lombardy poplars seem to have been introduced here about the same time as in england picquigny   has been the scene of a remarkable transaction that does great honour to the tolerating spirit of the french nation mons colmar a jew bought the seignory and estate including the viscounty of amiens of the duke of chaulnes by virtue of which he appoints the canons of the cathedral of amiens the bishop resisted his nomination and it was carried by appeal to the parliament of paris whose decree was in favour of mons colmar the immediate seignory of picquigny but without its dependences is resold to the count dartois at amiens view the cathedral said to be built by the english it is very large and beautifully light and decorated they are fitting it up in black drapery and a great canopy with illuminations for the burial of the prince de tingry colonel of the regiment of cavalry whose station is here to view this was an object among the people and crouds were at each door i was refused entrance but some officers being admitted gave orders that an english gentleman without should be let in and i was called back from some distance and desired very politely to enter as they did not know at first that i was an englishman these are but trifles but they show liberality and it is fair to report them if an englishman receives attention in france because he is an englishman what return ought to be made to a frenchman in england is sufficiently obvious the château deau or machine for supplying amiens with water is worth viewing but plates only could give an idea of it the town abounds with woollen manufactures i conversed with several masters who united entirely with those of abbeville in condemning the treaty of commerce—   miles the   rd to breteuil   the country is diversified woods everywhere in sight the whole journey—   miles the   th a flat and uninteresting chalky country continues about to clermont   where it improves is hilly and has wood the view of the town as soon as the dale is seen with the duke of fitzjames plantation is pretty—   miles  0 the   th the environs of clermont are picturesque the hills about liancourt are pretty and spread with a sort of cultivation i had never seen before a mixture of vineyards for here the vines first appear gardens and corn a piece of wheat a scrap of lucerne a patch of clover or vetches a bit of vine with cherry and other fruit trees scattered among all and the whole cultivated with the spade it makes a pretty appearance but must form a poor system of trifling chantilly—magnificence is its reigning character it is never lost there is not taste or beauty enough to soften it into milder features all but the château   is great and there is something imposing in that except the gallery of the great condés battles and the cabinet of natural history which is rich in very fine specimens most advantageously arranged it contains nothing that demands particular notice nor is there one room which in england would be called large the stable is truly great and exceeds very much indeed anything of the kind i had ever seen it is   0 feet long and  0 broad and is sometimes filled with   0 english horses i had been so accustomed to the imitation in water of the waving and irregular lines of nature that i came to chantilly   prepossessed against the idea of a canal but the view of one here is striking and had the effect which magnificent scenes impress it arises from extent and from the right lines of the water uniting with the regularity of the objects in view it is lord kames   i think who says the part of the garden contiguous to the house should partake of the regularity of the building with much magnificence about a place this is unavoidable the effect here however is lessened by the parterre before the castle in which the division and the diminutive jets deau are not of a size to correspond with the magnificence of the canal the menagerie is very pretty and exhibits a prodigious variety of domestic poultry from all parts of the world one of the best objects    to which a menagerie can be applied these and the corsican stag had all my attention the hameau contains an imitation of an english garden the taste is but just introduced into france so that it will not stand a critical examination the most english idea i saw is the lawn in front of the stables it is large of a good verdure and well kept proving clearly that they may have as fine lawns in the north of france as in england the labyrinth is the only complete one i have seen and i have no inclination to see another it is in gardening what a rebus is in poetry in the sylvae are many very fine and scarce plants i wish those persons who view chantilly and are fond of fine trees would not forget to ask for the great beech this is the finest i ever saw strait as an arrow and as i guess not less than  0 or  0 feet high  0 feet to the first branch and    feet diameter at five from the ground it is in all respects one of the finest trees that can anywhere be met with two others are near it but not equal to this superb one the forest around chantilly belonging to the prince of condé   is immense spreading far and wide the paris road crosses it for ten miles which is its least extent they say the capitainerie or paramountship is above  00 miles in circumference that is to say all the inhabitants for that extent are pestered with game without permission to destroy it in order to give one man diversion ought not these capitaineries to be extirpated at luzarch   i found that my mare from illness would travel no further french stables which are covered dunghills and the carelessness of garcons decuries an execrable set of vermin had given her cold i therefore left her to send for from paris and went thither post by which experiment i found that posting in france is much worse    and even upon the whole dearer than in england being in a postchaise i travelled to paris as other travellers in postchaises do knowing little or nothing the last ten miles i was eagerly on the watch for that throng of carriages which near london impede the traveller i watched in vain for the road quite to the gates is on comparison a perfect desert so many great roads join here that i suppose this must be accidental the entrance has nothing magnificent ill built and dirty to get to the rue de varenne faubourg st germain i had the whole city to cross and passed it by narrow ugly and crouded streets at the hotel de la rochefoucauld i found the duke of liancourt 0 and his sons the count de la rochefoucauld and the count alexander with my excellent friend monsieur de lazowski   all of whom i had the pleasure of knowing in suffolk they introduced me to the duchess destissac mother of the duke of liancourt and to the duchess of liancourt the agreeable reception and friendly attentions i met with from all this liberal family were well calculated to give me the most favourable impression    —   miles the   th so short a time had i passed before in france that the scene is totally new to me till we have been accustomed to travelling we have a propensity to stare at and admire everything—and to be on the search for novelty even in circumstances in which it is ridiculous to    look for it i have been upon the full silly gape to find out things that i had not found before as if a street in paris could be composed of anything but houses or houses formed of anything but brick or stone—or that the people in them not being english would be walking on their heads i shall shake off this folly as fast as i can and bend my attention to mark the character and disposition of the nation such views naturally lead us to catch the little circumstances which sometimes express them not an easy task but subject to many errors i have only one day to pass at paris and that is taken up with buying necessaries at calais my abundant care produced the inconvenience it was meant to avoid i was afraid of losing my trunk by leaving it at desseins for the diligence so i sent it to m mourons—the consequence is that it is not to be found at paris and its contents are to be bought again before i can leave this city on our journey to the pyrenees i believe it may be received as a maxim that a traveller should always trust his baggage to the common voitures of the country without any extraordinary precautions after a rapid excursion with my friend lazowski to see many things but too hastily to form any correct idea spend the evening at his brothers where i had the pleasure of meeting mons de broussonet   secretary of the royal society of agriculture   and mons desmarets both of the academy of sciences as mons lazowski is well informed in the manufactures of france in the police of which he enjoys a post of consideration and as the other gentlemen have paid much attention to agriculture the conversation was in no slight degree instructive and i regretted that a very early departure from paris would not let me promise myself a further enjoyment so congenial with my feelings as the company of men whose conversation shewed a marked attention to objects of national    importance on the breaking up of the party went with count alexander de la rochefoucauld post to versailles to be present at the fête of the day following whitsunday slept at the duke de liancourts hotel the   th breakfasted with him at his apartments in the palace which are annexed to his office of grand master of the wardrobe one of the principal in the court of france—here i found the duke surrounded by a circle of noblemen among whom was the duke de la rochefoucauld   well known for his attention to natural history i was introduced to him as he is going to bagnere de luchon in the pyrenees where i am to have the honour of being in his party the ceremony of the day was the kings investing the duke of berri son of the count dartois with the cordon blue the queens band was in the chapel where the ceremony was performed but the musical effect was thin and weak during the service the king was seated between his two brothers and seemed by his carriage and inattention to wish himself a hunting he would certainly have been as well employed as in hearing afterwards from his throne a feudal oath of chivalry i suppose or some such nonsense administered to a boy of ten years old seeing much pompous folly i imagined it was the dauphin and asked a lady of fashion near me at which she laughed in my face as if i had been guilty of the most egregious idiotism nothing could be done in a worse manner for the stifling of her expression only marked it the more i applied to mons de la rochefoucauld to learn what gross absurdity i had been guilty of so unwittingly when forsooth it was because the dauphin as all the world knows in france has the cordon blue put around him as soon as he is born so unpardonable was it for a foreigner to be ignorant of such an important part of french history as that of giving a babe a blue slobbering bib instead of a white one    after this ceremony was finished the king and the knights walked in a sort of procession to a small apartment in which he dined saluting the queen as they passed there appeared to be more ease and familiarity than form in this part of the ceremony her majesty who by the way is the most beautiful woman i saw today received them with a variety of expression on some she smiled to others she talked a few seemed to have the honour of being more in her intimacy her return to some was formal and to others distant to the gallant suffrein   it was respectful and benign the ceremony of the kings dining in public is more odd than splendid the queen sat by him with a cover before her but ate nothing conversing with the duke of orleans and the duke of liancourt who stood behind her chair to me it would have been a most uncomfortable meal and were i a sovereign i would sweep away threefourths of these stupid forms if kings do not dine like other people they lose much of the pleasure of life their station is very well calculated to deprive them of much and they submit to nonsensical customs the sole tendency of which is to lessen the remainder the only comfortable or amusing dinner is a table of ten or twelve covers for the people whom they like travellers tell us that this was the mode of the late king of prussia who knew the value of life too well to sacrifice it to empty forms on the one hand or to a monastic reserve on the other the palace of versailles one of the objects of which report had given me the greatest expectation is not in the least striking i view it without emotion the impression it makes is nothing what can compensate the want of unity from whatever point viewed it appears an assemblage of buildings a splendid quarter of a town but not a fine edifice an objection from which the garden front is not free though by far the most beautiful—the great gallery is the finest room i have seen the other apartments    are nothing but the pictures and statues are well known to be a capital collection the whole palace except the chapel seems to be open to all the world we pushed through an amazing croud of all sorts of people to see the procession many of them not very well dressed whence it appears that no questions are asked but the officers at the door of the apartment in which the king dined made a distinction and would not permit all to enter promiscuously travellers speak much even very late ones of the remarkable interest the french take in all that personally concerns their king shewing by the eagerness of their attention not curiosity only but love where how and in whom those gentlemen discovered this i know not—it is either misrepresentation or the people are changed in a few years more than is credible dine at paris and in the evening the duchess of liancourt who seems to be one of the best of women carried me to the opera at st cloud   where also we viewed the palace which the queen is building it is large but there is much in the front that does not please me— 0 miles the   th finding my mare sufficiently recovered for a journey a point of importance to a traveller so weak in cavalry as myself i left paris accompanying the count de la rochefoucauld and my friend lazowski and commencing a journey that is to cross the whole kingdom to the pyrenees the road to orleans is one of the greatest that leads from paris i expected therefore to have my former impression of the little traffic near that city removed but on the contrary it was confirmed it is a desert compared with those around london in ten miles we met not one stage or diligence only two messageries and very few chaises not a tenth of what would have been met had we been leaving london at the same hour knowing how great rich and important a city paris is this circumstance perplexes me much should it afterwards be confirmed conclusions in abundance are to be drawn for a few miles the scene is everywhere scattered with    the shafts of quarries the stone drawn up by lanthorn wheels of a great diameter the country diversified and its greatest want to please the eye is a river woods generally in view the proportion of the french territory covered by this production for want of coals must be prodigious for it has been the same all the way from calais at arpajon   the maréchal duke de mouchy   has a small house which has nothing to recommend it— 0 miles the   th to estamps   is partly through a flat country the beginning of the famous pays de beauce to toury 0 flat and disagreeable only two or three gentlemens seats in sight—   miles the  0th one universal flat uninclosed uninteresting and even tedious though small towns and villages are every where in sight the features that might compound a landscape are not brought together this pays de beauce contains by reputation the cream of french husbandry the soil excellent but the management all fallow pass through part of the forest of orleans belonging to the duke of that name it is one of the largest in france from the steeple of the cathedral at orleans the prospect is very fine the town large and its suburbs of single streets extend near a league the vast range of country that spreads on every side is an unbounded plain through which the magnificent loire bends his stately way in sight for    leagues the whole scattered with rich meadows vineyard gardens and forests the population must be very great for beside the city which contains near  0000 people the number of smaller towns and villages strewed thickly over the plain is such as to render the whole scene animated the cathedral from which we had this noble prospect is a fine building the    choir raised by henry iv the new church is a pleasing edifice the bridge a noble structure of stone and the first experiment of the flat arch made in france where it is now so fashionable it contains nine and is   0 yards long and    feet wide to hear some englishmen talk one would suppose there was not a fine bridge in all france not the first nor the last error i hope that travelling will remove there are many barges and boats at the quay built upon the river in the bourbonnois c loaded with wood brandy wine and other goods on arriving at nantes the vessels are broken up and sold with the cargo great numbers built with spruce fir a boat goes from hence to that city when demanded by six passengers each paying a louisdor   they lie on shore every night and reach nantes in four days and a half the principal street leading to the bridge is a fine one all busy and alive for trade is brisk here admire the fine acacias scattered about the town— 0 miles the   st on leaving it enter soon the miserable province of sologne which the french writers call the triste sologne   through all this country they have had severe spring frosts for the leaves of the walnuts are black and cut off i should not have expected this unequivocal mark of a bad climate after passing the loire to la ferté lowendahl   a dead flat of hungry sandy gravel with much heath the poor people who cultivate the soil here are métayers   that is men who hire the land without ability to stock it the proprietor is forced to provide cattle and seed and he and his tenant divide the produce a miserable system that perpetuates poverty and excludes instruction meet a man employed on the roads who was    prisoner at falmouth four years he does not seem to have any rancour against the english nor yet was he very well pleased with his treatment at la ferté   is a handsome chateau of the marquis de croix with several canals and a great command of water to nonantlefuzelier   a strange mixture of sand and water much inclosed and the houses and cottages of wood filled between the studs with clay or bricks and covered not with slate but tile with some barns boarded like those in suffolk—rows of pollards in some of the hedges an excellent road of sand the general features of a woodland country all combined to give a strong resemblance to many parts of england but the husbandry is so little like that of england that the least attention to it destroyed every notion of similarity—   miles june   the same wretched country continues to la loge   the fields are scenes of pitiable management as the houses are of misery yet all this country highly improveable if they knew what to do with it the property perhaps of some of those glittering beings who figured in the procession the other day at versailles heaven grant me patience while i see a country thus neglected—and forgive me the oaths i swear at the absence and ignorance of the possessors—enter the generality   of bourges and soon after a forest of oak belonging to the count dartois the trees are dying at top before they attain any size there the miserable sologne ends the first view of verson   and its vicinity is fine a noble vale spreads at your feet through which the river cher 0 leads seen in several places to the distance of some leagues a bright sun burnished the water like a string of lakes amidst the shade of a vast woodland see bourges to the left—   miles the  d pass the rivers cher and lave the bridges well built the stream fine and with the wood buildings boats and adjoining hills form an animated scene several  0 new houses and buildings of good stone in verson the place appears thriving and doubtless owes much to the navigation we are now in berri a province governed by a provincial assembly consequently the roads good and made without corvées vatan   is a little town that subsists chiefly by spinning we drank there excellent sancere   wine of a deep colour rich flavour and good body  0f   the bottle but in the country  0 an extensive prospect before we arrived at chateauroux   where we viewed the manufactures— 0 miles the  d within about three of argenton   come upon a fine scene beautiful yet with bold features a narrow vale bounded on every side with hills covered with wood all of which are immediately under the eye without a level acre except the bottom of the vale through which a river flows by an old castle picturesquely situated to the right and to the left a tower rising out of a wood at argenton walk up a rock that hangs almost over the town it is a delicious scene a natural ledge of perpendicular rock pushes forward abruptly over the vale which is half a mile broad and two or three long at one end closed by hills and at the other filled by the town with vineyards rising above it the surrounding scene that hems in the vale is high enough for relief vineyards rocks or hills covered with wood the vale cut into inclosures of a lovely verdure and a fine river winds through it with an outline that leaves nothing to wish the venerable fragments of a castles ruins near the point of view are well adapted to awaken reflections on the triumph of the arts of peace over the barbarous ravages of the feudal ages when every class of society was involved in commotion and the lower ranks were worse slaves than at present the general face of the country from verson to argenton is an uninteresting flat with many heaths of ling    no appearance of population and even towns are thin the husbandry poor and the people miserable by the circumstances to which i could give attention i conceive them to be honest and industrious they seem clean are civil and have good countenances they appear to me as if they would improve their country if they formed the part of a system the principles of which tended to national prosperity—   miles the  th pass an inclosed country which would have a better appearance if the oaks had not lost their foliage by insects whose webs hang over the buds they are but now coming into leaf again cross a stream which separates berri from la marche   chesnuts appear at the same time they are spread over all the fields and yield the food of the poor a variety of hill and dale with fine woods but little signs of population lizards for the first time also there seems a connection relative to climate between the chesnuts and these harmless animals they are very numerous and some of them near a foot long sleep at la ville au brun   —   miles the  th the country improves in beauty greatly pass a vale where a causeway stops the water of a small rivulet and swells it into a lake that forms one feature of a delicious scene the indented outlines and the swells margined with wood are beautiful the hills on every side in unison one now covered with ling the prophetic eye of taste may imagine lawn nothing is wanted to render the scene a garden but to clear away rubbish the general face of the country for    miles by far the most beautiful i have seen in france it is thickly inclosed and full of wood the umbrageous foliage of the chesnuts gives the same beautiful verdure to the hills as watered meadows seen for the first time to day to the vales distant mountainous ridges form the back ground and make the whole interesting the declivity of country as we go down to bassies   offers a beautiful view and    the approach to the town presents a landscape fancifully grouped of rock and wood and water to limoge pass another artificial lake between cultivated hills beyond are wilder heights but mixed with pleasant vales still another lake more beautiful than the former with a fine accompanyment of wood across a mountain of chesnut copse which commands a scene of a character different from any i have viewed either in france or england a great range of hill and dale all covered with forest and bounded by distant mountains not a vestige of any human residence no village no house or hut no smoke to raise the idea of a peopled country an american scene wild enough for the tomohawk of the savage stop at an execrable auberge called maison rouge where we intended to sleep but on examination found every appearance so forbidding and so beggarly an account of a larder that we passed on to limoge the roads through all this country are truly noble far beyond any thing i have seen in france or elsewhere—   miles the  th view limoge and examine its manufactures it was certainly a roman station and some traces of its antiquity are still remaining it is ill built with narrow and crooked streets the houses high and disagreeable they are raised of granite or wood with lath and plaister which saves lime an expensive article here being brought from a distance of twelve leagues the roofs are of pantiles with projecting eaves and almost flat a sure proof we have quitted the region of heavy snows the best of their public works is noble fountain the water conducted three quarters of a league by an arched aqueduct brought under the bed of a rock  0 feet deep to the highest spot in the town where it falls into a bason    feet diameter cut out of one piece of granite thence the water is let into reservoirs closed by sluices which are opened for watering the streets or in cases of fires the cathedral is ancient and the roof of stone there are some arabesque ornaments cut in stone as light airy and elegant as any modern house can boast whose decorations are in the same taste the present bishop has erected a large and handsome palace and his garden is the finest object to be seen at    limoge for it commands a landscape hardly to be equalled for beauty it would be idle to give any other description than just enough to induce travellers to view it a river winds through a vale surrounded by hills that present the gayest and most animated assemblage of villas farms vines hanging meadows and chesnuts blended so fortunately as to compose a scene truly smiling this bishop is a friend of the count de la rochefoucaulds family he invited us to dine and gave us a very handsome entertainment lord macartney   when a prisoner in france after the grenades were taken spent some time with him there was an instance of french politeness shewn to his lordship that marks the urbanity of this people the order came from court to sing te deum on the very day that lord macartney was to arrive conceiving that the public demonstrations of joy for a victory that brought his noble guest a prisoner might be personally unpleasant to him the bishop proposed to the intendant to postpone the ceremony for a few days in order that he might not meet it so abruptly this was instantly acceded to and conducted in such a manner afterwards as to mark as much attention to lord macartneys feelings as to their own the bishop told me that lord macartney spoke better french than he could have conceived possible for a foreigner had he not heard him better than many well educated frenchmen the post of intendant here was rendered celebrated by being filled by that friend of mankind turgot whose well earned reputation in this province placed him at the head of the french finances as may be very agreeably learned in that production of equal truth and elegance his life by the marquis of condorcet the character which turgot left here is considerable the noble roads we have passed so much exceeding any other i have seen in france were amongst his good works an epithet due to them because not made by corvées there is here a society of    agriculture which owes it origin to the same distinguished patriot but in that most unlucky path of french exertion he was able to do nothing evils too radically fixed were in the way of the attempt this society does like other societies—they meet converse offer premiums and publish nonsense this is not of much consequence for the people instead of reading their memoirs are not able to read at all they can however see and if a farm was established in that good cultivation which they ought to copy something would be presented from which they might learn i asked particularly if the members of this society had land in their own hands from which it might be judged if they knew anything of the matter themselves i was assured that they had but the conversation presently explained it they had métayers around their countryseats and this was considered as farming their own lands so that they assume something of a merit from the identical circumstance which is the curse and ruin of the whole country in the agricultural conversations we have had on the journey from orleans i have not found one person who seemed sensible of the mischief of this system the  th no chesnuts for a league before we reach piere bussiere 0 they say because the basis of the country is a hard granite and they assert also at limoge that in this granite there grow neither vines wheat nor chesnuts but that on the softer granites these plants thrive well it is true that chesnuts and this granite appeared together when we entered limosin the road has been incomparably fine and much more like the well kept alleys of a garden than a common high way see for the first time old towers that appear in this country—   miles the  th pass an extraordinary spectacle for english eyes of many houses too good to be called cottages without any glass windows some miles to the right is pompadour   where the king has a stud there are all kinds of horses but chiefly arabian turkish and english three years ago four arabians were imported which had    been procured at the expence of   000 livres         the price of covering a mare is only three livres to the groom the owners are permitted to sell their colts as they please but if these came up to the standard height the kings officers have the preference provided they give the price offered by others these horses are not saddled till six years old they pasture all day but at night are confined on account of wolves which are so common as to be a great plague to the people a horse of six years old a little more than four feet six inches high is sold for  0  and     has been offered for a colt of one year old pass uzarch   dine at donzenac   between which place and brive meet the first maize or indian corn the beauty of the country through the    miles from st george   to brive   is so various and in every respect so striking and interesting that i shall attempt no particular description but observe in general that i am much in doubt whether there be anything comparable to it either in england or ireland it is not that a fine view breaks now and then upon the eye to compensate the traveller for the dulness of a much longer district but a quick succession of landscapes many of which would be rendered famous in england by the resort of travellers to view them the country is all hill or valley the hills are very high and would be called with us mountains if waste and covered with heath but being cultivated to the very tops their magnitude is lessened to the eye their forms are various they swell in beautiful semiglobes they project in abrupt masses which inclose deep glens they expand into amphitheatres of cultivation that rise in gradation to the eye in some places tossed into a thousand inequalities of surface in others the eye reposes on scenes of the softest verdure add to this the rich robe with which natures bounteous hand has dressed the slopes with hanging woods of chesnut and whether the vales open their verdant bosoms and admit the sun to illumine the rivers in their comparative repose or whether they be closed in deep glens that afford a passage with difficulty    to the water rolling over their rocky beds and dazzling the eye with the lustre of cascades in every case the features are interesting and characteristic of the scenery some views of singular beauty rivetted us to the spot that of the town of uzarch covering a conical hill rising in the hollow of an amphitheatre of wood and surrounded at its feet by a noble river is unique derry in ireland has something of its form but wants some of its richest features the waterscenes from the town itself and immediately after passing it are delicious the immense view from the descent to donzenac is equally magnificent to all this is added the finest road in the world every where formed in the most perfect manner and kept in the highest preservation like the well ordered alley of a garden without dust sand stones or inequality firm and level of pounded granite and traced with such a perpetual command of prospect that had the engineer no other object in view he could not have executed it with a more finished taste the view of brive from the hill is so fine that it gives the expectation of a beautiful little town and the gaiety of the environs encourages the idea but on entering such a contrast is found as disgusts completely close ill built crooked dirty stinking streets exclude the sun and almost the air from every habitation except a few tolerable ones on the promenade—   miles the  th enter a different country with the new province of quercy   which is a part of guienne not near so beautiful as limosin but to make amends it is far better cultivated thanks to maize which does wonders pass noailles on the summit of a high hill the chateau   of the marshal duke of that name—enter a calcareous country and lose chesnuts at the same time in going down to souillac   there is a prospect that must universally please it is a birds eye view of a delicious little valley sunk deep amongst some very bold hills that    inclose it a margin of wild mountain contrasts the extreme beauty of the level surface below a scene of cultivation scattered with fine walnut trees nothing can apparently exceed the exuberant fertility of this spot souillac is a little town in a thriving state having some rich merchants they receive staves from the mountains of auvergne by their river dordonne which is navigable eight months in the year these they export to bordeaux and libourn also wine corn and cattle and import salt in great quantities it is not in the power of an english imagination to figure the animals that waited upon us here at the chapeau rouge some things that called themselves by the courtesy of souillac women but in reality walking dunghills—but a neatly dressed clean waiting girl at an inn will be looked for in vain in france—   miles the  0th cross the dordonne by a ferry the boat well contrived for driving in at one end and out at the other without the abominable operation common in england of beating horses till they leap into them the price is as great a contrast as the excellence we paid for an english whisky 0 a french cabriolet one saddlehorse and six persons no more than  0s  s  d i have paid half acrown a wheel in england for execrable ferries passed over at the hazard of the horses limbs—this river runs in a very deep valley between two ridges of high hills extensive views all scattered with villages and single houses an appearance of great population chesnuts on a calcareous soil contrary to the limosin maxim pass payrac   and meet many beggars which we had not done before all the country girls and women are without shoes or stockings and the ploughmen at their work have neither sabots nor feet to their stockings this is a poverty that strikes at the root of national prosperity a large consumption among the poor being of more consequence than among the rich the wealth of a nation lies in its circulation and consumption and the case of poor people abstaining from the use of manufactures of leather and wool ought to be considered as an evil of the first magnitude it reminded me of the misery of ireland    pass pontderodez   and come to high land whence we enjoyed an immense and singular prospect of ridges hills vales and gentle slopes rising one beyond another in every direction with few masses of wood but many scattered trees at least forty miles are tolerably distinct to the eye and without a level acre the sun on the point of being set illumined part of it and displayed a vast number of villages and scattered farms the mountains of auvergne at the distance of  00 miles added to the view pass by several cottages exceedingly well built of stone and slate or tiles yet without any glass to the windows can a country be likely to thrive where the great object is to spare manufactures women picking weeds into their aprons for their cows another sign of poverty i observed during the whole way from calais— 0 miles the   th see for the first time the pyrenees at the distance of   0 miles—to me who had never seen an object farther than  0 or  0 i mean the wicklow mountains as i was going out of holyhead this was interesting wherever the eye wandered in search of new objects it was sure to rest there their magnitude their snowy height the line of separation between two great kingdoms and the end of our travels altogether account for this effect towards cahors   the country changes and has something of a savage aspect yet houses are seen every where and onethird of it under vines that town is bad the streets neither wide nor strait but the new road is an improvement the chief object of its trade and resource are vines and brandies the true vin de cahors which has a great reputation is the produce of a range of vineyards very rocky on a ridge of hills full to the south and is called vin de grave because growing on a gravelly soil in plentiful years the price of good wine here does not exceed that of the cask last year it was sold at  0s  d a barique or  d a dozen we drank it at the trois rois from three to ten years old the latter at  0s  s  d the bottle both excellent full bodied great spirit without being fiery and to my palate much better than our ports i liked it so well that i established    a correspondence with mons andoury the innkeeper   the heat of this country is equal to the production of strong wine this was the most burning day we had experienced on leaving cahors the mountain of rock rises so immediately that it seems as if it would tumble into the town the leaves of walnuts are now black with frosts that happened within a fortnight on enquiry i found they are subject to these frosts all through the spring months and though rye is sometimes killed by them the mildew in wheat is hardly known—a fact sufficiently destructive of the theory of frosts being the cause of that distemper it is very rare that any snow falls here sleep at ventillac   —   miles the   th the shape and colour of the peasants houses here add a beauty to the country they are square white and with rather flat roofs but few windows the peasants are for the most part landproprietors immense view of the pyrenees before us of an extent and height truly sublime near perges   the view of a rich vale that seems to reach uninterruptedly to those mountains is a glorious scenery one vast sheet of cultivation every where chequered with these well built white houses—the eye losing itself in the vapour which ends only with that stupendous ridge whose snowcapped heads are broken into the boldest outline the road to caussade   leads through a very fine avenue of six rows of trees two of them mulberries which are the first we have seen thus we have travelled almost to the pyrenees before we met with an article of culture which some want to introduce into england the vale here is all on a dead level the roads finely made and mended with gravel montauban   is old but not ill built there are many good houses without forming handsome streets it is said to be very populous and the eye confirms the intelligence the cathedral is modern and pretty well built but too heavy the public college the seminary  0 the bishops palace and the house of the first president of the court of aids are good buildings the last large with a most shewy entrance the promenade is finely situated built on the highest part of the rampart and commanding that noble vale or rather plain one of the richest in europe which extends on one side to the sea and in front to the pyrenees whose towering masses heaped one upon another in a stupendous manner and covered with snow offer a variety of lights and shades from indented forms and the immensity of their projections this prospect which contains a semicircle of an hundred miles diameter has an oceanic vastness in which the eye loses itself an almost boundless scene of cultivation an animated but confused mass of infinitely varied parts—melting gradually into the distant obscure from which emerges the amazing frame of the pyrenees rearing their silvered heads far above the clouds at montauban i met capt plampin of the royal navy he was with major crew who has a house and family here to which he politely carried us it is sweetly situated on the skirts of the town commanding a fine view they were so obliging as to resolve my enquiries upon some points of which a residence made them complete judges living is reckoned cheap here a family was named to us whose income was supposed to be about   00 louis ayear and who lived as handsomely as in england on  000l the comparative dearness and cheapness of different countries is a subject of considerable importance but difficult to analize as i conceive the english to have made far greater advances in the useful arts and in manufactures than the french have done england ought to be the cheaper country what we meet with in france is a cheap mode of living which is quite another consideration— 0 miles the   th pass grisolles   where are well built cottages without glass and some with no other light than the door dine at pompinion 0 at the grand soleil an uncommonly good inn where capt plampin who accompanied us thus far took his leave here we had a violent storm of thunder and lightning with rain much heavier i thought than i had known in england but when we set out for toulouze    i was immediately convinced that such a violent shower had never fallen in that kingdom for the destruction it had poured on the noble scene of cultivation which but a moment before was smiling with exuberance was terrible to behold all now one scene of distress the finest crops of wheat beaten so flat to the ground that i question whether they can ever rise again other fields so inundated that we were actually in doubt whether we were looking on what was lately land or always water the ditches had been filled rapidly with mud had overflowed the road and swept dirt and gravel over the crops cross one of the finest plains of wheat that is any where to be seen the storm therefore was fortunately partial pass st jorry   a noble road but not better than in limosin it is a desert to the very gates meet not more persons than if it were  00 miles from any town—   miles the   th view the city   which is very ancient and very large but not peopled in proportion to its size the buildings are a mixture of brick and wood and have consequently a melancholy appearance this place has always prided itself on its taste for literature and the fine arts it has had a university since      and it pretends that its famous academy of jeux floraux   is as old as      it has also a royal academy of sciences another of painting sculpture and architecture the church of the cordelliers   has vaults into which we descended that have the property of preserving dead bodies from corruption we saw many that they assert to be  00 years old if i had a vault well lighted that would preserve the countenance and physiognomy as well as the flesh and bones i should like to have it peopled with all my ancestors and this desire would i suppose be proportioned to their merit and celebrity but to one like this that preserves cadaverous    deformity and gives perpetuity to death the voracity of a common grave is preferable but toulouze is not without objects more interesting than churches and academies these are the new quay the corn mills and the canal de brien the quay is of a great length and in all respects a noble work the houses intended to be built will be regular like those already erected in a stile aukward and inelegant the canal de brien   so called from the archbishop of toulouze   afterwards prime minister and cardinal was planned and executed in order to join the garonne at toulouze with the canal of languedoc which is united at two miles from the town with the same river the necessity of such a junction arises from the navigation of the river in the town being absolutely impeded by the wear which is made across it in favour of the corn mills it passes arched under the quay to the river and one sluice levels the water with that of languedoc canal it is broad enough for several barges to pass abreast these undertakings have been well planned and their execution is truly magnificent there is however more magnificence than trade for while the languedoc canal is alive with commerce that of brien is a desert among other things we viewed at toulouze was the house   of mons du barrè   brother of the husband of the celebrated countess by some transactions favourable to anecdote which enabled him to draw her from obscurity and afterwards to marry her to his brother he contrived to make a pretty considerable fortune on the first floor    is one principal and complete apartment containing seven or eight rooms fitted up and furnished with such profusion of expence that if a fond lover at the head of a kingdoms finances were decorating for his mistress he could hardly give in large any thing that is not here to be seen on a moderate scale to those who are fond of gilding here is enough to satiate so much that to an english eye it has too gaudy an appearance but the glasses are large and numerous the drawingroom very elegant gilding always excepted—here i remarked a contrivance which has a pleasing effect that of a lookingglass before the chimnies instead of those various screens used in england it slides backwards and forwards into the wall of the room there is a portrait of madame du barrè which is said to be very like if it really is one would pardon a king some follies committed at the shrine of so much beauty—as to the garden it is beneath all contempt except as an object to make a man stare at the efforts to which folly can arrive in the space of an acre there are hills of genuine earth mountains of pasteboard rocks of canvass abbés cows sheep and shepherdesses in lead monkeys and peasants asses and altars in stone fine ladies and blacksmiths parrots and lovers in wood windmills and cottages shops and villages nothing excluded except nature the   th meet highlanders who put me in mind of those of scotland saw them first at montauban they have round flat caps and loose breeches pipers blue bonnets and oatmeal are found says sir james stuart in catalonia auvergne and swabia as well as in lochabar many of the women here are without stockings meet them coming from the market with their shoes in their baskets the pyrenees at sixty miles distance appear now so distinct that one would guess it not more than fifteen the lights and shades of the snow are seen clearly— 0 miles the   th a ridge of hills on the other side of the garonne which began at toulouze became more and more regular yesterday and is undoubtedly the most distant ramification of the pyrenees reaching into this vast vale quite to toulouze but no farther approach the mountains the lower ones are all cultivated but the higher    seem covered with wood the road now is bad all the way meet many waggons each loaded with two casks of wine quite backward in the carriage and as the hind wheels are much higher than the lower ones it shews that these mountaineers have more sense than john bull the wheels of these waggons are all shod with wood instead of iron here for the first time see rows of maples with vines trained in festoons from tree to tree they are conducted by a rope of bramble vine cutting or willow they give many grapes but bad wine pass st martino   and then a large village of well built houses without a single glass window— 0 miles the   th st gaudens 0 is an improving town with many new houses something more than comfortable an uncommon view of st bertrand   you break at once upon a vale sunk deep enough beneath the point of view to command every hedge and tree with that town clustered round its large cathedral on a rising ground if it had been built purposely to add a feature to a singular prospect it could not have been better placed the mountains rise proudly around and give their rough frame to this exquisite little picture cross the garonne by a new bridge of one fine arch built of hard blue limestone medlars plumbs cherries maples in every hedge with vines trained—stop at lauresse   after which the mountains almost close and leave only a narrow vale the garonne and the road occupying some portion of it immense quantities of poultry in all this country most of it the people salt and keep in grease we tasted a soup made of the leg of a goose thus kept and it was not nearly so bad as i expected every crop here is backward and betrays a want of sun no wonder for we have been long travelling on the banks of a rapid river and must now be very high though still apparently in vales the mountains in passing on grow more interesting their beauty to northern eyes is very singular the black and dreary prospects which our    mountains offer are known to every one but here the climate cloaths them with verdure and the highest summits in sight are covered with wood there is snow on still higher ridges quit the garonne some leagues before sirpe   where the river neste   falls into it the road to bagnere is along this river in a very narrow valley at one end of which is built the town of luchon   the termination of our journey which to me has been one of the most agreeable i ever undertook the good humour and good sense of my companions are well calculated for travelling one renders a journey pleasing and the other instructive—having now crossed the kingdom and been in many french inns i shall in general observe that they are on an average better in two respects and worse in all the rest than those in england we have lived better in point of eating and drinking beyond a question than we should have done in going from london to the highlands of scotland at double the expence but if in england the best of every thing is ordered without any attention to the expence we should for double the money have lived better than we have done in france the common cookery of the french gives great advantage it is true they roast every thing to a chip if they are not cautioned but they give such a number and variety of dishes that if you do not like some there are others to please your palate the desert at a french inn has no rival at an english one nor are the liqueurs to be despised—we sometimes have met with bad wine but upon the whole far better than such port as english inns give beds are better in france in england they are good only at good inns and we have none of that torment which is so perplexing in england to have the sheets aired for we never trouble our heads about them doubtless on account of the climate after these two points all is a blank you have no parlour to eat in only a room with two three or four beds apartments badly fitted up the walls whitewashed or paper of different    sorts in the same room or tapestry so old as to be a fit nidus for moths and spiders and the furniture such that an english innkeeper would light his fire with it for a table you have every where a board laid on cross bars which are so conveniently contrived as to leave room for your legs only at the end—oak chairs with rush bottoms and the back universally a direct perpendicular that defies all idea of rest after fatigue doors give music as well as entrance the wind whistles through their chinks and hinges grate discord windows admit rain as well as light when shut they are not so easy to open and when open not easy to shut mops brooms and scrubbingbrushes are not in the catalogue of the necessaries of a french inn bells there are none the fille must always be bawled for and when she appears is neither neat well dressed nor handsome the kitchen is black with smoke the master commonly the cook and the less you see of the cooking the more likely you are to have a stomach to your dinner but this is not peculiar to france copper utensils always in great plenty but not always well tinned the mistress rarely classes civility or attention to her guests among the requisites of her trade— 0 miles the   th having being now ten days fixed in our lodgings which the count de la rochefoucaulds friends had provided for us it is time to minute a few particulars of our life here mons lazowski and myself have two good rooms on a ground floor with beds in them and a servants room for   liv  s  d aday we are so unaccustomed in england to live in our bedchambers that it is at first aukward in france to find that people live no where else at all the inns i have been in it has been always in bedrooms and here i find that every body let his rank be what it may lives in his bedchamber this is novel our english custom is far more convenient as well as more pleasing but this habit i class with the œconomy of the french the day after we came i was introduced to the la rochefoucauld party with whom we have lived it consists of the duke and dutchess de la rochefoucauld daughter of the duke de chabot her brother the prince de laon and his princess the daughter of the duke de montmorenci the count de chabot another    brother of the dutchess de la rochefoucauld the marquis daubourval who with my two fellowtravellers and myself made a party of nine at dinner and supper a traiteur serves our table at   liv a head for the two meals two courses and a good desert for dinner for supper one and a desert the whole very well served with every thing in season the wine separate at  f  d a bottle with difficulty the counts groom found a stable hay is little short of    english per ton oats much the same price as in england but not so good straw dear and so scarce that very often there is no litter at all the states of languedoc are building a large and handsome bathing house to contain various separate cells with baths and a large common room with two arcades to walk in free from sun and rain the present baths are horrible holes the patients lie up to their chins in hot sulphureous water which with the beastly dens they are placed in one would think sufficient to cause as many distempers as they cure they are resorted to for cutaneous eruptions the life led here has very little variety those who bathe or drink the waters do it at half after five or six in the morning but my friend and myself are early in the mountains which are here stupendous we wander among them to admire the wild and beautiful scenes which are to be met with in almost every direction the whole region of the pyrenees is of a nature and aspect so totally different from every thing that i had been accustomed to that these excursions were productive of much amusement cultivation is here carried to a considerable perfection in several articles especially in the irrigation of meadows we seek out the most intelligent peasants and have many and long conversations with those who understand french which however is not the case with all for the language of the country is a mixture of catalan provencal and french—this with examining the minerals an article for which the duke de la rochefoucauld likes to accompany us as he possesses a considerable knowledge in that branch of natural history and with noting the plants with which we are acquainted serves well to keep our time employed sufficiently to our taste the ramble of the morning finished we return in time to dress for dinner at half after    twelve or one then adjourn to the drawingroom of madam de la rochefoucauld or the countess of grandval alternately the only ladies who have apartments large enough to contain the whole company none are excluded as the first thing done by every person who arrives is to pay a morning visit to each party already in the place the visit is returned and then every body is of course acquainted at these assemblies which last till the evening is cool enough for walking there is nothing in them but cards tricktrack chess and sometimes music but the great feature is cards i need not add that i absented myself often from these parties which are ever mortally insipid to me in england and not less so in france in the evening the company splits into different parties for their promenade which lasts till half an hour after eight supper is served at nine there is after it an hours conversation in the chamber of one of our ladies and this is the best part of the day—for the chat is free lively and unaffected and uninterrupted unless on a postday when the duke has such packets of papers and pamphlets that they turn us all into politicians all the world are in bed by eleven in this arrangement of the day no circumstance is so objectionable as that of dining at noon the consequence of eating no breakfast for as the ceremony of dressing is kept up you must be at home from any mornings excursion by twelve oclock this single circumstance if adhered to would be sufficient to destroy any pursuits except the most frivolous dividing the day exactly in halves destroys it for any expedition enquiry or business that demands seven or eight hours attention uninterrupted by any calls to the table or the toilette calls which after fatigue or exertion are obeyed with refreshment and with pleasure we dress for dinner in england with propriety as the rest of the day is dedicated to ease to converse and relaxation but by doing it at noon too much time is lost what is a man good for after his silk breeches and stockings are on his hat under his arm and his head bien poudrè—can he botanize in a watered meadow—can he clamber the rocks to mineralize—can he farm with the peasant and the ploughman—he is in order for the conversation of the ladies which to be sure is in every country    but particularly in france where the women are highly cultivated an excellent employment but it is an employment that never relishes better than after a day spent in active toil or animated pursuit in something that has enlarged the sphere of our conceptions or added to the stores of our knowledge—i am induced to make this observation because the noon dinners are customary all over france except by persons of considerable fashion at paris they cannot be treated with too much ridicule or severity for they are absolutely hostile to every view of science to every spirited exertion and to every useful pursuit in life living in this way however with several persons of the first fashion in the kingdom is an object to a foreigner solicitous to remark the manners and character of the nation i have every reason to be pleased with the experiment as it affords me a constant opportunity to enjoy the advantages of an unaffected and polished society in which an invariable sweetness of disposition mildness of character and what in english we emphatically call good temper eminently prevails—seeming to arise—at least i conjecture it from a thousand little nameless and peculiar circumstances not resulting entirely from the personal character of the individuals but apparently holding of the national one—beside the persons i have named there are among others at our assemblies the marquis and marchioness de hautfort the duke and dutchess de ville this dutchess is among the good order of beings the chevalier de peyrac mons labbé bastard baron de serres viscountess duhamel the bishops of croire   and montauban mons de la marche the baron de montagu a chess player the chevalier de cheyron and mons de bellecomb who commanded in pondicherry and was taken by the english there are also about half a dozen young officers and three or four abbes if i may hazard a remark on the conversation of french assemblies from what i have known here i should praise them for equanimity but condemn them for insipidity all vigour of thought seems so excluded from expression that characters of ability and of inanity meet nearly on a par tame and elegant uninteresting and polite the  0 mingled mass of communicated aside has powers neither to offend nor instruct where there is much polish of character there is little argument and if you neither argue nor discuss what is conversation—good temper and habitual ease are the first ingredients in private society but wit knowledge or originality must break their even surface into some inequality of feeling or conversation is like a journey on an endless flat of the rural beauties we have to contemplate the valley of larbousse   in a nook of which the town of luchon is situated is the principal with its surrounding accompanyment of mountain the range that bounds it to the north is bare of wood but covered with cultivation and a large village about three parts of its height is perched on a steep that almost makes the unaccustomed eye tremble with apprehension that the village church and people will come tumbling into the valley villages thus perched like eagles nests on rocks are a general circumstance in the pyrenees which appear to be wonderfully peopled the mountain that forms the western wall of the valley is of a prodigious magnitude watered meadow and cultivation rise more than onethird the height a forest of oak and beech forms a noble belt above it higher still is a region of ling and above all snow from whatever point viewed this mountain is commanding from its magnitude and beautiful from its luxuriant foliage the range which closes in the valley to the east is of a character different from the others it has more variety more cultivation villages forests glens and cascades that of gouzat which turns a mill as soon as it falls from the mountain is romantic with every accompanyment necessary to give a high degree of picturesque beauty there are features in that of montaubau which claude loraine would not have failed transfusing on his canvass and the view of the vale from the chesnut rock is gay and animated the termination of our valley to the south is striking the river neste pours in incessant cascades over the rocks that seem an eternal resistance the eminence in the centre of a small vale on which is an old tower is a wild and romantic spot the roar of the waters beneath unites in effect with the    mountains whose towering forests finishing in snow give an awful grandeur a gloomy greatness to the scene and seem to raise a barrier of separation between the kingdoms too formidable even for armies to pass but what are rocks and mountains and snow when opposed to human ambition—in the recesses of the pendent woods the bears find their habitation on the rocks and above the eagles have their nests all around is great the sublime of nature with imposing majesty impresses awe upon the mind attention is rivetted to the spot and imagination with all its excursive powers seeks not to wander beyond the scene deepens the murmurs of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror oer the woods   to view these scenes tolerably is a business of some days and such is the climate here or at least has been since i was at bagnere de luchon that not more than one day in three is to be depended on for fine weather the heights of the mountains is such that the clouds perpetually broken pour down quantities of rain from june   th to july  d we had one heavy shower which lasted without intermission for sixty hours the mountains though so near were hidden to their bases in the clouds they do not only arrest the fleeting ones which are passing in the atmosphere but seem to have a generative power for you see small ones at first like thin vapour rising out of glens forming on the sides of the hills and increasing by degrees till they become clouds heavy enough to rest on the tops or else rise into the atmosphere and pass away with others among the original tenants of this immense range of mountains the first in point of dignity from the importance of the mischief they do are the bears there are both sorts carnivorous and vegetableeaters the latter are more mischievous than their more terrible brethren coming down in the night and eating the corn particularly buckwheat and maize and they are so nice in choosing the sweetest ears of the latter that they trample and spoil infinitely more than they eat the carnivorous bears wage    war against the cattle and sheep so that no stock can be left in the fields at night flocks must be watched by shepherds who have firearms and the assistance of many stout and fierce dogs and cattle are shut up in stables every night in the year sometimes by accident they wander from their keepers and if left abroad they run a considerable risque of being devoured—the bears attack these animals by leaping on their back force the head to the ground thrust their paws into the body in the violence of a dreadful hug there are many hunting days every year for destroying them several parishes joining for that purpose great numbers of men and boys form a cordon and drive the wood where the bears are known or suspected to be they are the fattest in winter when a good one is worth three louis a bear never ventures to attack a wolf but several wolves together when hungry will attack a bear and kill and eat him wolves are here only in winter in summer they are in the very remotest parts of the pyrenees—the most distant from human habitations they are here as every where else in france dreadful to sheep a part of our original plan of travelling to the pyrenees was an excursion into spain our landlord at luchon had before procured mules and guides for persons travelling on business to saragossa and barcelona and at our request wrote to vielle   the first spanish town across the mountains for three mules and a conductor who speaks french and being arrived according to appointment we set out on our expedition for the register of this tour into spain i must refer the reader to the annals of agriculture vol viii p     july    return—leave jonquieres 0 where the countenances and manners of the people would make one believe all the inhabitants were smugglers come to a most noble road which the king of spain is making it begins at the pillars that mark the boundaries of the two monarchies joining with the french road it is admirably executed here take leave of spain and reenter france the contrast is striking when one crosses the sea from    dover to calais the preparation and circumstance of a naval passage leave the mind by some gradation to a change but here without going through a town a barrier or even a wall you enter a new world from the natural and miserable roads of catalonia you tread at once on a noble causeway made with all the solidity and magnificence that distinguishes the highways of france instead of beds of torrents you have well built bridges and from a country wild desert and poor we found ourselves in the midst of cultivation and improvement every other circumstance spoke the same language and told us by signs not to be mistaken and some great and operating cause worked an effect too clear to be misunderstood the more one sees the more i belive we shall be led to think that there is but one allpowerful cause that instigates mankind and that is government—others form exceptions and give shades of difference and distinction but this acts with permanent and universal force the present instance is remarkable for roussillon   is in fact a part of spain the inhabitants are spaniards in language and in customs but they are under a french government great range of the pyrenees at a distance meet shepherds that speak the catalan the cabriolets we meet are spanish the farmers thresh their corn like the spaniards the inns and the houses are the same reach perpignan   there i parted with mons lazowski he returned to bagnere de luchon but i had planned a tour in languedoc to fill up the time to spare—   miles the   d the duke de la rochefoucauld had given me a letter to mons barri de lasseuses major of a regiment at perpignan and who he said understood agriculture and would be glad to converse with me on the subject i sallied out in the morning to find him but being sunday he was at his countryseat at pia about a league from the town i had a roasting walk thither over a dry stony country under vines mons madame and mademoiselle de lasseuses received me with great politeness i explained    the motives of my coming to france which were not to run idly through the kingdom with the common herd of travellers but to make myself a master of their agriculture that if i found any thing good and applicable to england i might copy it he commended the design greatly said it was travelling with a truly laudable motive but expressed much astonishment as it was so uncommon and was very sure there was not a single frenchman in all england on such an errand he desired i would spend the day with him i found the vineyard the chief part of his husbandry but he had some arable land managed in the singular manner of that province he pointed to a village which he said was rivesalta   which produced some of the most famous wine in france at dinner i found that it merited its reputation in the evening returned to perpignan after a day fertile in useful information—  miles the   d take the road to narbonne pass rivesalta under the mountain there is the largest spring i ever saw otterspool and hollywell are bubbles to it it rises at the foot of the rock and is able to turn immediately many mills being at once rather a river than a spring pass an uninterrupted flat waste without a single tree house or village for a considerable distance by much the ugliest country i have seen in france great quantities of corn every where treading out with mules as in spain dine at sejean   at the soleil a good new inn where i accidentally met with the marquis de tressan he told me that i must be a singular person to travel so far with no other object than agriculture he never knew nor heard of the like but approved much of the plan and wished he could do the same the roads here are stupendous works i passed a hill cut through to ease a descent that was all in the solid rock and cost  0000 liv     l yet it extends but a few hundred yards three leagues and an half from sejean to narbonne cost   00000 liv     0l these ways are superb even to a folly enormous sums have been spent to level even gentle slopes the causeways are raised and    walled on each side forming one solid mass of artificial road carried across the vallies to the height of six seven or eight feet and never less than  0 wide there is a bridge of a single arch and a causeway to it truly magnificent we have not an idea of what such a road is in england the traffic of the way however demands no such exertions onethird of the breadth is beaten onethird rough and onethird covered with weeds in    miles i have met one cabriolet half a dozen carts and some old women with asses for what all this waste of treasure—in languedoc it is true these works are not done by corvées but there is an injustice in levying the amount not far short of them the money is raised by tailles and in making the assessment lands held by a noble tenure are so much eased and others by a base one so burthened that   0 arpents in this neighbourhood held by the former pay  0 liv and  00 possessed by a plebeian right which ought proportionally to pay  00 liv is instead of that assessed at   00 liv at narbonne the canal   which joins that of languedoc deserves attention it is a very fine work and will they say be finished next month—   miles the   th women without stockings and many without shoes but if their feet are poorly clad they have a superb consolation in walking upon magnificent causeways the new road is  0 feet wide and  0 more digged away or destroyed to make it the vintage itself can hardly be such a scene of activity and animation as this universal one of treading out the corn with which all the towns and villages in languedoc are now alive the corn is all roughly stacked around a dry firm spot where great numbers of mules and horses are driven on a trot round a centre a woman holding the reins and another or a girl or two with whips drive the men supply and clear the floor other parties are dressing by throwing the corn into the air for the wind to blow away the chaff every soul is employed and with such an air of cheerfulness that the people seem as well pleased with their labour as the farmer himself with his great    heaps of wheat the scene is uncommonly animated and joyous i stopped and alighted often to see their method i was always very civilly treated and my wishes for a good price for the farmer and not too good a one for the poor well received this method which entirely saves barns depends absolutely on climate from my leaving bagnere de luchon to this moment all through catalonia roussillon and this part of languedoc there has been nothing like rain but one unvarying clear bright sky and burning sun yet not at all suffocating or to me even unpleasant i asked whether they were not sometimes caught in the rain they said very rarely indeed but if rain did come it is seldom more than a heavy shower which a hot sun quickly succeeds and dries every thing speedily the canal of languedoc   is the capital feature of all this country the mountain through which it pierces is insulated in the midst of an extended valley and only half a mile from the road it is a noble and stupendous work goes through the hill about the breadth of three toises and was digged without shafts leave the road and crossing the canal follow it to beziers   nine sluicegates let the water down the hill to join the river at the town—a noble work the port is broad enough for four large vessels to lie abreast the greatest of them carries from  0 to  00 tons many of them were at the quay some in motion and every sign of an animated business this is the best sight i have seen in france here lewis xiv thou art truly great—here with a generous and benignant hand thou dispensest ease and wealth to thy people—si sic omnia thy name would indeed have been revered to effect this noble work of uniting the two seas less money was expended than to besiege turin or to seize strasbourg like a robber such an employment of the revenues of a great kingdom is the only laudable way of a monarchs acquiring immortality all other means make their names survive with those only of the incendiaries robbers and violators of mankind    the canal passes through the river for about half a league separated from it by walls which are covered in floods and then turns off for cette dine at beziers knowing that mons labbé rozier   the celebrated editor of the journal physique and who is now publishing a dictionary of husbandry which in france has much reputation lived and farmed near beziers i enquired at the inn the way to his house they told me that he had left beziers two years but that the house was to be seen from the street and accordingly shewed it me from something of a square open on one side to the country adding that it belonged now to a mons de rieuse who had purchased the estate of the abbé to view the farm of a man celebrated for his writings was an object as it would at least enable me in reading his book to understand better the allusions he might make to the soil situation and other circumstances i was sorry to hear at the table dhôte much ridicule thrown on the abbé roziers husbandry that it had beaucoup de fantasie mais rien solide in particular they treated his paving his vineyards as a ridiculous circumstance such an experiment seemed remarkable and i was glad to hear it that i might desire to see these paved vineyards the abbé here as a farmer has just that character which every man will be sure to have who departs from the methods of his neighbours for it is not in the nature of countrymen that any body should come among them who can presume with impunity to think for themselves i asked why he left the country and they gave me a curious anecdote of the bishop of beziers cutting a road through the abbés farm at the expence of the province to lead to the house of his the bishops mistress which occasioned such a quarrel that mons rozier could stay no longer in the country this is a pretty feature of a government that a man is to be forced to sell his estate and driven out of a country because bishops make love—i suppose to their neighbours wives as no other love is fashionable in france which of my neighbours wives will tempt the bishop of norwich to make a road through my farm and drive me to sell bradfield—    i give my authority for this anecdote the chat of a table dhôte it is as likely to be false as true but languedocian bishops are certainly not english ones—mons de rieuse received me politely and satisfied as many of my enquiries as he could for he knew little more of the abbes husbandry than common report and what the farm itself told him as to paved vineyards there was no such thing the report must have taken rise from a vineyard of burgundy grapes which the abbé planted in a new manner he set them in a curved form in a foss covering them only with flints instead of earth this succeeded well i walked over the farm which is beautifully situated on the slope and top of a hill which commands beziers its rich vale its navigation and a fine accompanyment of mountains beziers has a fine promenade and is becoming they say a favourite residence for the english preferring the air to that of montpellier take the road to pezenas   it leads up a hill which commands for some time a view of the mediterranean through all this country but particularly in the olive grounds the cricket cicala makes a constant sharp monotonous noise a more odious companion on the road can hardly be imagined pezenas opens on a very fine country a vale of six or eight leagues extent all cultivated a beautiful mixture of vines mulberries olives towns and scattered houses with a great deal of fine lucerne the whole bounded by gentle hills cultivated to their tops—at supper at the table dhôte we were waited on by a female without shoes or stockings exquisitely ugly and diffusing odours not of roses there were however a croix de st louis 00 and two or three mercantilelooking people that prated with her very familiarly at an ordinary of farmers at the poorest and remotest market village in england such an animal would not be allowed by the landlord to enter his house or by the guests their room—   miles the   th the road in crossing a valley to and from a    bridge is a magnificent walled causeway more than a mile long ten yards wide and from eight to twelve feet high with stone posts on each side at every six yards—a prodigious work—i know nothing more striking to a traveller than the roads of languedoc we have not in england a conception of such exertions they are splendid and superb and if i could free my mind of the recollection of the unjust taxation which pays them i should travel with admiration at the magnificence displayed by the states of this province the police of these roads is however execrable—for i scarcely meet a cart but the driver is asleep in it taking the road to montpellier pass through a pleasing country and by another immense walled causeway twelve yards broad and three high leading close to the sea to pijan 0  and near frontignan 0  and montbasin 0  famous for their muscat wines—approach montpellier the environs for near a league are delicious and more highly ornamented than any thing i have seen in france—villas well built clean and comfortable with every appearance of wealthy owners are spread thickly through the country they are in general pretty square buildings some very large montpellier with the air rather of a great capital than of a provincial town covers a hill that swells proudly to the view—but on entering it you experience a disappointment from narrow illbuilt crooked streets but full of people and apparently alive with business yet there is no considerable manufacture in the place the principal are verdigrease silk handkerchiefs blankets perfumes and liqueurs the great object for a stranger to view is the promenade or square for it partakes of both called the perou 0  —there is a magnificent aqueduct on three tires of arches for supplying the city with water from a hill at a considerable distance a very noble work a chateau deau receives the water in a circular bason from which it falls into an external reservoir to supply the city and the jets deau that cool the air of a garden below the whole in a fine square considerably elevated above the surrounding ground walled in with a ballustrade and other mural decorations and in the centre a good equestrian statue of  0 louis xiv there is an air of real grandeur and magnificence in this useful work that struck me more than any thing at versailles the view is also singularly beautiful to the south the eye wanders with delight over a rich vale spread with villas and terminated by the sea to the north a series of cultivated hills on one side the vast range of the pyrenees trend away till lost in remoteness on the other the eternal snows of the alps pierce the clouds the whole view one of the most stupendous to be seen when a clear sky approximates these distant objects—   miles the   th the fair of beaucaire 0  fills the whole country with business and motion meet many carts loaded and nine diligences going or coming yesterday and to day the hottest i ever experienced we had none like them in spain—the flies much worse than the heat— 0 miles the   th the amphitheatre of nismes is a prodigious work which shews how well the romans had adapted these edifices to the abominable uses to which they were erected the convenience of a theatre that could hold   000 spectators without confusion the magnitude the massive and substantial manner in which it is built without mortar that has withstood the attacks of the weather and the worse depredations of the barbarians in the various revolutions of sixteen centuries all strike the attention forcibly i viewed the maison quarré last night again this morning and twice more in the day it is beyond all comparison the most light elegant and pleasing building i ever beheld without any magnitude to render it imposing without any extraordinary magnificence to surprize it rivets attention there is a magic harmony in the proportions that charms the eye one can fix on no particular part of preeminent beauty it is one perfect whole of symmetry and grace what an infatuation in modern architects that can overlook the chaste and elegant simplicity of taste manifest in such a work and yet rear such piles of laboured foppery and heaviness as are to be met    with in france the temple of diana as it is called and the ancient baths with their modern restoration and the promenade form parts of the same scene and are magnificent decorations of the city i was in relation to the baths in ill luck for the water was all drawn off in order to clean them and the canals—the roman pavements are singularly beautiful and in high preservation my quarters at nismes were at the louvre a large commodious and excellent inn the house was almost as much a fair from morning to night as beaucaire itself could be i dined and supped at the table dhôte the cheapness of these tables suits my finances and one sees something of the manners of the people we sat down from twenty to forty at every meal most motley companies of french italians spaniards and germans with a greek and armenian and i was informed that there is hardly a nation in europe or asia that have not merchants at this great fair chiefly for raw silk of which many millions in value are sold in four days all the other commodities of the world are to be found there one circumstance i must remark on this numerous table dhôte because it has struck me repeatedly which is the taciturnity of the french i came to the kingdom expecting to have my ears constantly fatigued with the infinite volubility and spirits of the people of which so many persons have written sitting i suppose by their english firesides at montpellier though    persons and some of them ladies were present i found it impossible to make them break their inflexible silence with more than a monosyllable and the whole company sat more like an assembly of tonguetied quakers than the mixed company of a people famous for loquacity here also at nismes with a different party at every meal it is the same not a frenchman will open his lips to day at dinner hopeless of that nation and fearing to lose the use of an organ they had so little inclination to employ i fixed myself by a spaniard and having been so lately in his country i found him ready to converse and tolerably communicative but we had more conversation than thirty other persons maintained among themselves the   th early in the morning to the pont du gard    through a plain covered with vast plantations of olives to the left but much waste rocky land at the first view of that celebrated aqueduct i was rather disappointed having expected something of greater magnitude but soon found the error i was on examining it more nearly convinced that it possessed every quality that ought to make a strong impression it is a stupendous work the magnitude and the massive solidity of the architecture which may probably endure two or three thousand years more united with the undoubted utility of the undertaking to give us a high idea of the spirit of exertion which executed it for the supply of a provincial town the surprize however may cease when we consider the nations enslaved that were the workmen—returning to nismes meet many merchants returning from the fair each with a childs drum tied to their cloakbag my own little girl was too much in my head not to love them for this mark of attention to their children—but why a drum—have they not had enough of the military in a kingdom where they are excluded from all the honours respect and emolument that can flow from the sword—i like nismes much and if the inhabitants are at all on a par with the appearance of their city i should prefer it for a residence to most if not all the towns i have seen in france the theatre however is a capital point in that montpellier is said to exceed it—   miles the   th pass six leagues of a disagreeable country to sauve 0  vines and olives the chateau of mons sabbatier 0  strikes in this wild country he has inclosed much with dry walls planted many mulberries and olives which are young thriving and well inclosed yet the soil is so stony that no earth is visible some of his walls are four feet thick and one of them twelve thick and five high whence it seems he thinks moving the stones a necessary improvement which i much question he has built three or four new farmhouses i suppose he resides on this estate for improving it i hope he does not serve that no moonshine pursuit may divert him from a conduct honourable    to himself and beneficial to his country—leaving sauve i was much struck with a large tract of land seemingly nothing but huge rocks yet most of it inclosed and planted with the most industrious attention every man has an olive a mulberry an almond or a peachtree and vines scattered among them so that the whole ground is covered with the oddest mixture of these plants and bulging rocks that can be conceived the inhabitants of this village deserve encouragement for their industry and if i was a french minister they should have it they would soon turn all the deserts around them into gardens such a knot of active husbandmen who turn their rocks into scenes of fertility because i suppose their own would do the same by the wastes if animated by the same omnipotent principle dine at st hyppolite 0  with eight protestant merchants returning home to rouverge 0  from the fair of beaucaire as we parted at the same time we travelled together and from their conversation i learned some circumstances of which i wanted to be informed they told me also that mulberries extend beyond vigan  0 but then and especially about milhaud    almonds take their place and are in very great quantities my rouverge friends pressed me to pass with them to milhaud and rodez assured me that the cheapness of their province was so great that it would tempt me to live some time amongst them that i might have a house at milhaud of four tolerable rooms on a floor furnished for    louis ayear and live in the utmost plenty with all my family if i would bring them over for  00 louis ayear that there were many families of noblesse who subsisted on  0 and even on    ayear such anecdotes of cheapness are only curious when considered in a political light as contributing on one hand to the welfare of individuals and on the other as contributing to the prosperity wealth and power of the kingdom if i should meet with many such instances and also with others directly contrary it will be necessary to consider them more at large— 0 miles    the  0th going out of gange    i was surprised to find by far the greatest exertion in irrigation which i had yet seen in france and then pass by some steep mountains highly cultivated in terraces much watering at st laurence    the scenery very interesting to a farmer from gange to the mountain of rough ground which i crossed the ride has been the most interesting which i have taken in france the efforts of industry the most vigorous the animation the most lively an activity has been here that has swept away all difficulties before it and has cloathed the very rocks with verdure it would be a disgrace to common sense to ask the cause the enjoyment of property must have done it give a man the secure possession of a bleak rock and he will turn it into a garden give him a nine years lease of a garden and he will convert it into a desert to montadier    over a rough mountain covered with box and lavender it is a beggarly village with an auberge that made me almost shrink some cut throat figures were eating black bread whose visages had so much of the gallies that i thought i heard their chains rattle i looked at their legs and could not but imagine they had no business to be free there is a species of countenance here so horridly bad that it is impossible to be mistaken in ones reading i was quite alone and absolutely without arms till this moment i had not dreamt of carrying pistols i should now have been better satisfied if i had had them the master of the auberge who seemed first cousin to his guests procured for me some wretched bread with difficulty but it was not black—no meat no eggs no legumes and execrable wine no corn for my mule no hay no straw no grass the loaf fortunately was large i took a piece and sliced the rest for my fourfooted spanish friend who ate it thankfully but the aubergiste growled—descend by a winding and excellent road to maudieres    where a vast arch is thrown across the torrent pass st maurice    and cross a ruined forest amongst fragments of trees descend three hours by a most noble road hewn out of the mountain side to    lodeve    a dirty ugly ill built town with crooked close streets but populous and very industrious—here i drank excellent light and pleasing white wine at  f a bottle—   miles the   st cross a mountain by a miserable road and reach beg de rieux    which shares with carcassonne the fabric of londrins    for the levant trade—cross much waste to beziers—i met today with an instance of ignorance in a well dressed french merchant that surprised me he had plagued me with abundance of tiresome foolish questions and then asked for the third or fourth time what country i was of i told him i was a chinese how far off is that country—i replied  00 leagues deux cents lieus diable cest un grand chemin the other day a frenchman asked me after telling him i was an englishman if we had trees in england—i replied that we had a few had we any rivers—oh none at all ah ma foi cest bien trieste this incredible ignorance when compared with the knowledge so universally disseminated in england is to be attributed like every thing else to government— 0 miles august   leave beziers in order to go to capestan  0 by the pierced mountain cross the canal of languedoc several times and over many wastes to pleraville    the pyrenees now full to the left and their roots but a few leagues off at carcassonne they carried me to a fountain of muddy water and to a gate of the barracks but i was better pleased to see several large good houses of manufacturers that shew wealth— 0 miles the  d pass a considerable convent with a long line of front and rise to fanjour    —   miles the  d at mirepoix    they are building a most magnificent bridge of seven flat arches each of    feet span    which will cost   00000 liv     0l it has been    years erecting and will be finished in two more the weather for several days has been as fine as possible but very hot today the heat was so disagreeable that i rested from    to   at mirepoix and found it so burning that it was an effort to go half a quarter of a mile to view the bridge the myriads of flies were ready to devour me and i could hardly support any light in the room riding fatigued me and i enquired for a carriage of some sort to carry me while these great heats should continue i had done the same at carcassonne but nothing like a cabriolet of any sort was to be had when it is recollected that that place is one of the most considerable manufacturing towns in france containing   000 people and that mirepoix is far from being a mean place and yet not a voiture of any kind to be had how will an englishman bless himself for the universal conveniences that are spread through his own country in which i believe there is not a town of   00 people in the kingdom where post chaises and able horses are not to be had at a moments warning what a contrast this confirms the fact deducible from the little traffic on the roads even around paris itself circulation is stagnant in france—the heat was so great that i left mirepoix disordered with it this was by far the hottest day that i ever felt the hemisphere seemed almost in a flame with burning rays that rendered it impossible to turn ones eyes within many degrees of the radiant orb that now blazed in the heavens—cross another fine new bridge of three arches and come to a woodland the first i have seen for a great distance many vines about pamiers    which is situated in a beautiful vale upon a fine river the place itself is ugly stinking and ill built with an inn adieu mons gascit if fate sends me to such another house as thine—be it an expiation for my sins—   miles the  th leaving amous    there is the extraordinary spectacle of a river issuing out of a cavern in a mountain of rock on crossing the hill you see where it enters by another cavern—it pierces the mountain most countries    however have instances of rivers passing under ground at st geronds    go to the croix blanche the most execrable receptacle of filth vermin impudence and imposition that ever exercised the patience or wounded the feelings of a traveller a withered hag the dæmon of beastliness presides there i laid not rested in a chamber over a stable whose effluviæ through the broken floor were the least offensive of the perfumes afforded by this hideous place—it could give me nothing but two stale eggs for which i paid exclusive of all other charges  0f spain brought nothing to my eyes that equalled this sink from which an english hog would turn with disgust but the inns all the way from nismes are wretched except at lodeve gange carcassonne and mirepoix st geronds must have from its appearance four or five thousand people pamiers near twice that number what can be the circulating connection between such masses of people and other towns and countries that can be held together and supported by such inns there have been writers who look upon such observations as rising merely from the petulance of travellers but it shews their extreme ignorance such circumstances are political data we cannot demand all the books of france to be opened in order to explain the amount of circulation in that kingdom a politician must therefore collect it from such circumstances as he can ascertain and among these traffic on the great roads and the convenience of the houses prepared for the reception of travellers tell us both the number and the condition of those travellers by which term i chiefly allude to the natives who move on business or pleasure from place to place for if they are not considerable enough to cause good inns those who come from a distance will not which is evident from the bad accommodations even in the high road from london to rome on the contrary go in england to towns that contain   00  000 or  000 people in situations absolutely cut off from all dependence or almost the expectation of what are properly called travellers yet you will meet with neat inns well dressed and clean people keeping them good furniture and a refreshing    civility your senses may not be gratified but they will not be offended and if you demand a post chaise and a pair of horses the cost of which is not less than  0l in spite of a heavy tax it will be ready to carry you whither you please are no political conclusions to be drawn from this amazing contrast it proves that such a population in england have connections with other places to the amount of supporting such houses the friendly clubs of the inhabitants the visits of friends and relations the parties of pleasure the resort of farmers the intercourse with the capital and with other towns form the support of good inns and in a country where they are not to be found it is a proof that there is not the same quantity of motion or that it moves by means of less wealth less consumption and less enjoyment in this journey through languedoc i have passed an incredible number of splendid bridges and many superb causeways but this only proves the absurdity and oppression of government bridges that cost  0 or  0000l and immense causeways to connect towns that have no better inns than such as i have described appear to be gross absurdities they cannot be made for the mere use of the inhabitants because onefourth of the expense would answer the purpose of real utility they are therefore objects of public magnificence and consequently for the eye of travellers but what traveller with his person surrounded by the beggarly filth of an inn and with all his senses offended will not condemn such inconsistencies as folly and will not wish for more comfort and less appearance of splendour— 0 miles the  th to st martory    is an almost uninterrupted range of well inclosed and well cultivated country—for an hundred miles past the women generally without shoes even in the towns and in the country many men also—the heat yesterday and today as intense as it was before there is no bearing any light in the rooms all must be shut close or none are tolerably cool in going out of a light room into a dark one tho both to the north there is a very sensible coolness and out of a dark one into a    roofed balcony is like going into an oven i have been advised every day not to stir till four oclock from ten in the morning till five in the afternoon the heat makes all exercise most uncomfortable and the flies are a curse of egypt give me the cold and fogs of england rather than such a heat should it be lasting the natives however assert that this intensity has now continued as long as it commonly does namely four or five days and that the greatest part even of the hottest months is much cooler than the weather is at present—in   0 miles distant i have met on the road two cabriolets only and three miserable things like old english onehorse chaises not one gentleman though many merchants as they call themselves each with two or three cloakbags behind him—a paucity of travellers that is amazing—   miles the  th to bagnere de luchon rejoining my friends and not displeased to have a little rest in the cool mountains after so burning a ride—   miles the  0th finding our party not yet ready to set out on their return to paris i determined to make use of the time there was yet to spare ten or eleven days in a tour to bagnere de bigorre to bayonne    and to meet them on the way to bourdeaux at auch this being settled i mounted my english mare and took my last leave of luchon—   miles the   th pass a convent    of bernardine monks who have a revenue of  0000 liv it is situated in a vale watered by a charming chrystal stream and some hills covered with oak shelter it behind—arrive at bagnere which contains little worthy of notice but it is much frequented by company on account of its waters to the valley of campan  0 of which i had heard great things and which yet much surpassed my expectation it is quite different from all the other vales i have seen in the pyreness or in catalonia the features and the arrangement novel in general the richly cultivated slopes of those mountains are thickly inclosed this on the contrary is open the vale itself is a flat range of cultivation and  0 watered meadow spread thickly with villages and scattered houses the eastern boundary is a rough steep and rocky mountain and affords pasturage to goats and sheep a contrast to the western which forms the singular feature of the scene it is one noble sheet of corn and grass uninclosed and intersected only by lines that mark the division of properties or the channels that conduct water from the higher regions for irrigating the lower ones the whole hanging is one matchless slope of the richest and most luxuriant vegetation here and there are scattered some small masses of wood which chance has grouped with wonderful happiness for giving variety to the scene the season of the year by mixing the rich yellow of ripe corn with the green of the watered meadows added greatly to the colouring of the landscape which is upon the whole the most exquisite for form and colour that my eye has ever been regaled with—take the road to lourde    where is a castle on a rock garrisoned for the mere purpose of keeping state prisoners sent hither by lettres de cachet seven or eight are known to be here at present thirty have been here at a time and many for life—torn by the relentless hand of jealous tyranny from the bosom of domestic comfort from wives children friends and hurried for crimes unknown to themselves—more probably for virtues—to languish in this detested abode of misery—and die of despair oh liberty liberty—and yet this is the mildest government of any considerable country in europe our own excepted the dispensations of providence seem to have permitted the human race to exist only as the prey of tyrants as it has made pigeons for the prey of hawks—   miles the   th pau    is a considerable town that has a parliament and a linen manufacture but it is more famous for being the birthplace of henry iv i viewed the castle and was shewn as all travellers are the room in which that amiable prince was born and the cradle the shell of a tortoise in which he was nursed what an effect on    posterity have great and distinguished talents this is a considerable town but i question whether any thing would ever carry a stranger to it but its possessing the cradle of a favourite character take the road to moneng    and come presently to a scene which was so new to me in france that i could hardly believe my own eyes a succession of many well built tight and comfortable farming cottages built of stone and covered with tiles each having its little garden inclosed by clipt thorn hedges with plenty of peach and other fruit trees some fine oaks scattered in the hedges and young trees nursed up with so much care that nothing but the fostering attention of the owner could effect any thing like it to every house belongs a farm perfectly well inclosed with grass borders mown and neatly kept around the corn fields with gates to pass from one inclosure to another the men are all dressed with red caps like the highlanders of scotland there are some parts of england where small yeomen still remain that resemble this country of bearne but we have very little that is equal to what i have seen in this ride of twelve miles from pau    to moneng it is all in the hands of little proprietors without the farms being so small as to occasion a vicious and miserable population an air of neatness warmth and comfort breathes over the whole it is visible in their new built houses and stables in their little gardens in their hedges in the courts before their doors even in the coops for their poultry and the sties for their hogs a peasant does not think of rendering his pig comfortable if his own happiness hangs by the thread of a nine years lease we are now in bearne within a few miles of the cradle of henry iv do they inherit these blessings from that good prince the benignant genius of that good monarch seems to reign still over the country each peasant has the fowl in the pot—   miles the   th the agreeable scene of yesterday continues many small properties and every appearance of rural    happiness navareen    is a small walled and fortified town consisting of three principal streets which cross at right angles with a small square from the ramparts there is the view of a fine country the linen fabric spreads through it to st palais    the country is mostly inclosed and much of it with thornhedges admirably trained and kept neatly clipped—   miles the   th left st palais and took a guide to conduct me four leagues to anspan    fair day and the place crouded with farmers i saw the soup prepared for what we should call the farmers ordinary there was a mountain of sliced bread the colour of which was not inviting ample provision of cabbage grease and water and about as much meat for some scores of people as half a dozen english farmers would have eaten and grumbled at their host for short commons—   miles the   th bayonne is by much the prettiest town i have seen in france the houses are not only well built of stone but the streets are wide and there are many openings which though not regular squares have a good effect the river is broad and many of the houses being fronted to it the view of them from the bridge is fine the promenade is charming it has many rows of trees whose heads join and form a shade delicious in this hot climate in the evening it was thronged with well dressed people of both sexes and the women through all the country are the handsomest i have seen in france in coming hither from pau i saw what is very rare in that kingdom clean and pretty country girls in most of the provinces hard labour destroys both person and complexion the bloom of health on the cheeks of a well dressed country girl is not the worst feature in any landscape i hired a chaloup for viewing the embankment at the mouth of the river by the water spreading itself too much the harbour was injured and government to contract it has built a wall on the north bank a mile long and another on the south shore of half the length it is from ten to  0 feet wide and    about twelve high from the top of the base of rough stone which extends twelve or fifteen feet more towards the mouth of the harbour it is twenty feet wide and the stones on both sides crampt together with irons they are now driving piles of pine    feet deep for the foundation it is on the whole a work of great expence magnificence and utility the   th to dax is not the best way to auch but i had a mind to see the famous waste called les landes de bourdeaux    of which i had long heard and read so much i was informed that by this route i should pass through more than twelve leagues of them they reach almost to the gates of bayonne but broken by cultivated spots for a league or two these landes are sandy tracts covered with pine trees cut regularly for resin historians report that when the moors were expelled from spain they applied to the court of france for leave to settle on and cultivate these landes and that the court was much condemned for refusing them it seems to have been taken for granted that they could not be peopled with french and therefore ought rather to be given to moors than to be left waste—at dax there is a remarkably hot spring in the middle of the town it is a very fine one bubbling powerfully out of the ground in a large bason walled in it is boiling hot it tastes like common water and i was told that it was not impregnated with any mineral the only use to which it is applied is for washing linen it is at all seasons of the same heat and in the same quantity—   miles the   th pass district of sand as white as snow and so loose as to blow yet has oaks two feet in diameter by reason of a bottom of white adhesive earth like marl pass three rivers the waters of which might be applied in irrigation yet no use made of them the duke de    bouillon    has vast possessions in these lands a grand seigneur will at any time and in any country explain the reason of improveable land being left waste—   miles the   th as dearness is in my opinion the general feature of all money exchanges in france it is but candid to note instances to the contrary at airé  0 they gave me at the croix dor soup eels sweet bread and greenpeas a pigeon a chicken and vealcutlets with a dessert of biscuits peaches nectarines plumbs and glass of liqueur with a bottle of good wine all for  0f  0d oats for my mare  0f and hay  0f at the same price at st severe    i had a supper last night not inferior to it every thing at airé seemed good and clean and what is very uncommon i had a parlour to eat my dinner in and was attended by a neat well dressed girl the last two hours to airé it rained so violently that my silk surtout was an insufficient defence and the old landlady was in no haste to give me fire enough to be dried as to supper i had the idea of my dinner—   miles the   th pass beek    which seems a flourishing little place if we may judge by the building of new houses the clef dor is a large new and good inn in the   0 miles from bagnere de luchon to auch    a general observation i may make is that the whole with very few exceptions is inclosed and that the farmhouses are every where scattered instead of being as in so many parts of france collected in towns i have seen scarcely any gentlemens country seats that seem at all modern and in general they are thin to a surprising degree i have not met with one country equipage nor any thing like a gentleman riding to see a neighbour scarcely a gentleman at all at auch met by appointment my friends on their return to paris the town is almost without manufactures or commerce and is supported chiefly by the rents of the country but they have many    of the noblesse in the province too poor to live here some indeed so poor that they plough their own fields and these may possibly be much more estimable members of society than the fools and knaves that laugh at them—   miles the  0th pass fleuran    which contains many good houses and go through a populous country to la tour    a bishoprick the diocesan of which we left at bagnere de luchon the situation is beautiful on the point of a ridge of hills— 0 miles the   d by leyrac    through a fine country to the garonne which we cross by a ferry this river is here a quarter of a mile broad with every appearance of commerce a large barge passed loaded with cages of poultry of such consequence throughout the extent of this navigation is the consumption of the great city of bourdeaux the rich vale continues to agen    and is very highly cultivated but has not the beauty of the environs of leitour if new buildings are a criterion of the flourishing state of a place agen prospers the bishop has raised a magnificent palace the centre of which is in good taste but the junction with the wings not equally happy—   miles the   d pass a rich and highly cultivated vale to aguillon    much hemp and every woman in the country employed on it many neat well built farmhouses on small properties and all the country very populous view the chateau of the duc daguillon    which being in the town is badly situated according to all rural ideas but a town is ever an accompanyment of a chateau in france as it was formerly in most parts of europe it seems to have    resulted from a feudal arrangement that the grand seigneur might keep his slaves the nearer to his call as a man builds his stables near his house this edifice is a considerable one built by the present duke begun about twenty years ago when he was exiled here during eight years and thanks to that banishment the building went on nobly the body of the house done and the detached wings almost finished but as soon as the sentence was reversed the duke went to paris and has not been here since consequently all now stands still it is thus that banishment alone will force the french nobility to execute what the english do for pleasure—reside upon and adorn their estates there is one magnificent circumstance namely an elegant and spacious theatre it fills one of the wings the orchestra is for twentyfour musicians the number kept fed and paid by the duke when here this elegant and agreeable luxury which falls within the compass of a very large fortune is known in every country in europe except england the possessors of great estates here preferring horses and dogs very much before any entertainment a theatre can yield to tonnance  0 —   miles the   th many new and good country seats of gentlemen well built and set off with gardens plantations c these are the effects of the wealth of bourdeaux these people like other frenchmen eat little meat in the town of leyrac five oxen only are killed in a year whereas an english town with the same population would consume two or three oxen a week a noble view towards bourdeaux for many leagues the river appearing in four or five places reach langon    and drink of its excellent white wine—   miles the   th—pass through barsac    famous also for its wines they are now ploughing with oxen between the rows of the vines the operation which gave tull    the idea of horsehoeing corn great population and country seats all the way at castres    the country changes to an uninteresting    flat arrive at bourdeaux    through a continued village— 0 miles   th much as i had read and heard of the commerce wealth and magnificence of this city they greatly surpassed my expectations paris did not answer at all for it is not to be compared to london but we must not name liverpool in competition with bourdeaux the grand feature here of which i had heard most answers the least i mean the quay which is respectable only for length and its quantity of business neither of which to the eye of a stranger is of much consequence if devoid of beauty the row of houses is regular but without either magnificence or beauty it is a dirty sloping muddy shore parts without pavement incumbered with filth and stones barges lie here for loading and unloading the ships which cannot approach to what should be a quay here is all the dirt and disagreeable circumstances of trade without the order arrangement and magnificence of a quay barcelona is unique in this respect when i presumed to find fault with the buildings on the river it must not be supposed that i include the whole the crescent which is in the same line is better the place royale with the statue of lewis xv in the middle is a fine opening and the buildings which form it regular and handsome but the quarter of the chapeau rouge is truly magnificent consisting of noble houses built like the rest of the city of white hewn stone it joins the chateau trompette which occupies near half a mile of the shore this fort is bought of the king by a company of speculators who are now pulling it down with an intention of building a fine square and many new streets to the amount of   00 houses i have seen a design of the square and the streets and it would if executed be one of the most splendid additions to a city that is to be seen in europe this great work stands still at present through a fear of resumptions the theatre built about ten or twelve years ago is by far the most magnificent in france i have seen nothing that approaches it the building is insulated and fills up a space of  0  feet by     one end being the principal front    containing a portico the whole length of it of twelve very large corinthian columns the entrance from this portico is by a noble vestibule which leads not only to the different parts of the theatre but also to an elegant oval concertroom and saloons for walking and refreshments the theatre itself is of a vast size in shape the segment of an oval the establishment of actors actresses singers dancers orchestra c speak the wealth and luxury of the place i have been assured that from thirty to fifty louis a night have been paid to a favourite actress from paris larrive    the first tragic actor of that capital is now here at  00 liv   l   s  d a night with two benefits dauberval the dancer and his wife the mademoiselle theodore of london are retained as principal balletmaster and first female dancer at a salary of   000 liv     l pieces are performed every night sundays not excepted as every where in france the mode of living that takes place here among merchants is highly luxurious their houses and establishments are on expensive scales great entertainments and many served on plate high play is a much worse thing—and the scandalous chronicle speaks of merchants keeping the dancing and singing girls of the theatre at salaries which ought to import no good to their credit this theatre which does so much honour to the pleasures of bourdeaux was raised at the expence of the town and cost   0000l the new tide cornmill erected by a company is very well worth viewing a large canal is dug and formed in masonry of hewn stone the walls four feet thick leading under the building for the tide coming in to turn the water wheels it is then conducted in other equally well formed canals to a reservoir and when the tide returns it gives motion to the wheels again three of these canals pass under the building for containing    pairs of stones every part of the work is on a scale of solidity and duration admirably executed the estimate of the expence is  000000 liv   0000l but i know not how to credit such a sum how far the erection of steam engines to do the same business would have been found a cheaper method i shall    not enquire but i should apprehend that the common water mills on the garonne which start without such enormous expences for their power must in the common course of common events ruin this company the new houses that are building in all quarters of the town mark too clearly to be misunderstood the prosperity of the place the skirts are every where composed of new streets with still newer ones marked out and partly built these houses are in general small or on a middling scale for inferior tradesmen they are all of white stone and add as they are finished much to the beauty of the city i enquired into the date of these new streets and found that four or five years were in general the period that is to say since the peace and from the colour of the stone of those streets next in age it is plain that the spirit of building was at a stop during the war since the peace they had gone on with great activity what a satire on the government of the two kingdoms to permit in one the prejudices of manufacturers and merchants and in the other the insidious policy of an ambitious court to hurry the two nations for ever into wars that check all beneficial works and spread ruin where private exertion was busied in deeds of prosperity the rent of houses and lodgings rises every day as it has done since the peace considerably at the same time that so many new houses have been and are erecting unites with the advance in the prices of every thing they complain that the expences of living have risen in ten years full  0 per cent—there can hardly be a clearer proof of an advance in prosperity the commercial treaty with england being a subject too interesting not to have demanded attention we made the necessary enquiries—here it is considered in a very different light from abbeville and rouen at bourdeaux they think it a wise measure that tends equally to the benefit of both countries this is not the place for being more particular on the trade of this town we went twice to see larrive do his two capital parts of the black prince in mons du belloys    piere le cruel and philoctete which gave me a very high idea of the french  0 theatre the inns at this city are excellent the hotel dangletere and the prince of asturias at the latter we found every accommodation to be wished but with an inconsistence that cannot be too much condemned we had very elegant apartments and were served on plate yet the necessaryhouse the same temple of abomination that is to be met in a dirty village the   th leave bourdeaux—cross the river by a ferry which employs twentynine men and fifteen boats and lets at   000 liv    l a year the view of the garonne is very fine appearing to the eye twice as broad as the thames at london and the number of large ships lying in it makes it i suppose the richest water view that france has to boast from hence to the dordonne a noble river though much inferior to the garonne which we cross by another ferry that lets at  000 liv reach cavignac    — 0 miles the   th to barbesieux    situated in a beautiful country finely diversified and wooded the marquisate of which with the chateau belongs to the duke de la rochefoucauld whom we met here he inherits this estate from the famous louvois the minister of louis xiv in this thirtyseven miles of country lying between the great rivers garonne dordonne and charente and consequently in one of the best parts of france for markets the quantity of waste land is surprising it is the predominant feature the whole way much of these wastes belonged to the prince de soubise  0 who would not sell any part of them thus it is whenever you stumble on a grand seigneur even one that was worth millions you are sure to find his property desert the duke of bouillons and this princes are two of the greatest properties in france    and all the signs i have yet seen of their greatness are wastes landes deserts fern ling—go to their residence wherever it may be and you would probably find them in the midst of a forest very well peopled with deer wild boars and wolves oh if i was the legislator of france for a day i would make such great lords skip again    we supped with the duke de la rochefoucauld the provincial assembly of saintonge is soon to meet and this nobleman being the president is waiting for their assembling the  0th through a chalk country well wooded though without inclosures to angoulême the approach to that town is fine the country around being beautiful with the fine river charente    here navigable flowing through it the effect striking—   miles the   st quitting angoulême pass through a country almost covered with vines and across a noble wood belonging to the duchess danville mother of the duke de la rochefoucauld to verteul    a chateau of the same lady built in      where we found every thing that travellers could wish in a hospitable mansion the emperor charles v was entertained here by anne de polignac widow of francis ii count de la rochefoucauld and that prince said aloud navoir jamais été en maison qui sentit mieux sa grande vertu honnêteté  seigneurie que celle la—it is excellently kept in thorough repair fully furnished and all in order which merits praise considering that the family rarely are here for more than a few days in a year having many other and more considerable seats in different parts of the kingdom if this just attention to the interests of posterity was more general we should not see the melancholy spectacle of ruined chateaus in so many parts of france in the gallery is a range of portraits from the tenth century by one of which it appears that this estate    came by a mademoiselle la rochefoucauld in    0 the park woods and river charente here are fine the last abounds greatly in carp tench and perch it is at any time easy to get from  0 to  00 brace of fish that weigh from three to  0lb each we had a brace of carp for supper the sweetest without exception i ever tasted if i pitched my tent in france i should choose it to be by a river that gave such fish nothing provokes one so in a country residence as a lake a river or the sea within view of the windows and a dinner every day without fish which is so common in england—   miles september  st pass caudec    ruffec    maisonsblanches    and chaunay    at the first of these places view a very fine flourmill built by the late count de broglio    brother of the marechal de broglio one of the ablest and most active officers in the french service in his private capacity his undertakings were of a national kind this mill an iron forge and the project of a navigation proved that he had a disposition for every exertion that could according to the prevalent ideas of the times benefit his country that is to say in every way except the one in which it would have been effective—practical agriculture this days journey has been with some exceptions through a poor dull and disagreeable country—   miles the  d poitou    from what i see of it is an unimproved poor and ugly country it seems to want communication demand and activity of all kinds nor does it on an average yield the half of what it might the lower part of the province is much richer and better    arrive at poitiers which is one of the worst built towns i have seen in france very large and irregular but containing scarcely any thing worthy of notice except the cathedral which is well built and very well kept—the finest thing by far in the town is the promenade which is the most extensive i have seen it occupies a considerable space of ground with gravelled walks c excellently kept—   miles the  d a white chalky country to chateaurault  0 open and thinly peopled though not without countryseats that town has some animation owing to its navigable river which falls into the loire there is a considerable cutlery manufacture we were no sooner arrived than our apartment was full of the wives and daughters of manufacturers each with her box of knives scissars toys c and with so much civil solicitude to have something bought that had we wanted nothing it would have been impossible to let so much urgency prove vain it is remarkable as the fabrics made here are cheap that there is scarcely any division of labour in this manufacture it is in the hands of distinct and unconnected workmen who go through every branch on their own account and without assistance except from their families—   miles the  th pass a better country with many chateaus to les ormes    where we stopped to see the seat built by the late count de voyer dargenson this chateau is a large handsome edifice of stone with two very considerable wings for offices and strangers apartments the entrance is into a neat vestibule at the end of which is the saloon a circular marble room extremely elegant and well furnished in the drawingroom are paintings of the four french victories of the war of      in every apartment there is a strong disposition to english furniture and modes this pleasing residence belongs at present to the count dargenson the late count who built it formed with the present duke of grafton in england the scheme of a very agreeable party the duke was to go over with his horses and pack of foxhounds and live here for some    months with a number of friends it originated in the proposal to hunt french wolves with english foxdogs nothing could be better planned than the scheme for les ormes is large enough to have contained a numerous party but the counts death destroyed the plan this is a sort of intercourse between the nobility of two kingdoms which i am surprised does not take place sometimes it would vary the common scenes of life very agreeably and be productive of some of the advantages of travelling in the most eligible way—   miles the  th through a dead flat and unpleasant country but on the finest road i have seen in france—nor does it seem possible that any should be finer not arising from great exertions as in languedoc but from being laid flat with admirable materials chateaus are scattered every where in this part of touraine but farm houses and cottages thin till you come in sight of the loire the banks of which seem one continued village the vale through which that river flows may be three miles over a dead level of burnt russet meadow the entrance of tours    is truly magnificent by a new street of large houses built of hewn white stone with regular fronts this fine street which is wide and with foot pavements on each side is cut in a strait line through the whole city to the new bridge of fifteen flat arches each of seventyfive feet span it is altogether a noble exertion for the decoration of a provincial town some houses remain yet to be built the fronts of which are done some reverend fathers are satisfied with their old habitations and do not choose the expence of filling up the elegant design of the tours projectors they ought however to be unroosted if they will not comply for fronts without houses behind them have a ridiculous appearance from the tower of the cathedral there is an extensive view of the adjacent country but the loire for so considerable a river and for being boasted as the most beautiful in europe exhibits such a breadth of shoals and sands as to be almost subversive of beauty in the chapel of the old palace of louis xi les plessis les tours    are three    pictures which deserve the travellers notice a holy family st catharine and the daughter of herod they seem to be of the best age of italian art there is a very fine promenade here long and admirably shaded by four rows of noble and lofty elms which for shelter against a burning sun can have no superior parallel with it is another on the rampart of the old walls which looks down on the adjacent gardens but these walks of which the inhabitants have long boasted are at present objects of melancholy the corporation has offered the trees to sale and i was assured they would be cut down the ensuing winter—one would not wonder at an english corporation sacrificing the ladies walk for plenty of turtle venison and madeira but that a french one should have so little gallantry is inexcusable the  th the count de la rochefoucauld having a feverish complaint when he arrived here which prevented our proceeding on the journey it became the second day a confirmed fever the best physician of the place was called in whose conduct i liked much for he had recourse to very little physick but much attention to keep his apartment cool and airy and seemed to have great confidence in leaving nature to throw off the malady that oppressed her who is it that says there is a great difference between a good physician and a bad one yet very little between a good one and none at all among other excursions i took a ride on the banks of the loire towards saumur and found the country the same as near tours but the chateaus not so numerous or good where the chalk hills advance perpendicularly towards the river they present a most singular spectacle of uncommon habitations    for a great number of houses are cut out of the white rock fronted with masonry and holes cut above for chimnies so that you sometimes know not where the house is from which you see the smoke issuing these cavernhouses are in some places in tires one above another some with little scraps of gardens have a pretty effect in general the proprietors occupy them but many are let at  0    and    liv a year the people i talked    with seemed well satisfied with their habitations as good and comfortable a proof of the dryness of the climate in england the rheumatism would be the chief inhabitant walked to the benedictine convent of marmoutier    of which the cardinal de rohan at present here is abbot the  0th nature or the tours doctor having recovered the count we set forward on our journey the road to chanteloup is made on an embankment that secures a large level tract from floods the country more uninteresting than i could have thought it possible for the vicinity of a great river to be—view chanteloup the magnificent seat of the late duke de choiseul    it is situated on a rising ground at some distance from the loire which in winter or after great floods is a fine object but at present is scarcely seen the groundfloor in front consists of seven rooms the diningroom of about thepleasureground on a hill thirty by twenty and the drawingroom thirty by thirtythree the library is seventytwo by twenty but now fitted up by the present possessor the duke de penthievre with very beautiful tapestry from the gobelins—in commanding a very extensive prospect is a chinese pagoda   0 feet high built by the duke in commemoration of the persons who visited him in his exile on the walls of the first room in it their names are engraved on marble tablets the number and rank of the persons do honour to the duke and to themselves the idea was a happy one the forest you look down on from this building is very extensive they say eleven leagues across ridings are cut pointing to the pagoda and when the duke was alive these glades had the mischievous animation of a vast hunt supported so liberally as to ruin the master of it and transferred the property of this noble estate and residence from his family to the last hands i    should wish to see it in—a prince of the blood great lords love too much an environ of forest boars and huntsmen instead of marking their residence by the accompanyment of neat and well cultivated farms clean cottages and happy peasants in such a method of shewing their magnificence rearing forests gilding domes or bidding aspiring columns rise might be wanting but they would have instead of them erections of comfort establishments of ease and plantations of felicity and their harvest instead of the flesh of boars would be in the voice of chearful gratitude—they would see public prosperity flourish on its best basis of private happiness—as a farmer there is one feature which shews the duke had some merit he built a noble cowhouse a platform leads along the middle between two rows of mangers with stalls for seventytwo and another apartment not so large for others and for calves he imported   0 very fine swiss cows and visited them with his company every day as they were kept constantly tied up to this i may add the best built sheephouse i have seen in france and i thought i saw from the pagoda part of the farm better laid out and ploughed than common in the country so that he probably imported some ploughmen—this has merit in it but it was all the merit of banishment chanteloup would neither have been built nor decorated nor furnished if the duke had not been exiled it was the same with the duke daguillon these ministers would have sent the country to the devil before they would have reared such edifices or formed such establishments if they had not both been sent from versailles view the manufacture of steel at amboise    established by the duke de choiseul vineyards the chief feature of agriculture—   miles the   th to blois    an old town prettily situated on the loìre with a good stone bridge of eleven arches we viewed the castle for the historical monument it affords that has rendered it so famous they shew the room where the council assembled and the chimney in it before which the duke of guise was standing when the kings page came to demand his presence in the royal closet the door he was    entering when stabbed the tapestry he was in the act of turning aside the tower where his brother the cardinal suffered with a hole in the floor into the dungeon of louis xi of which the guide tells many horrible stories in the same tone from having told them so often in which the fellow in westminster abbey gives his monotonous history of the tombs the best circumstance attending the view of the spots or the walls within which great daring or important actions have been performed is the impression they make on the mind or rather on the heart of the spectator for it is an emotion of feeling rather than an effort of reflection the murders or political executions perpetrated in this castle though not uninteresting were inflicted on and by men that command neither our love nor our veneration the character of the period and of the men that figured in it were alike disgusting bigotry and ambition equally dark insidious and bloody allow no feelings of regret the parties could hardly be better employed than in cutting each others throats quit the loire and pass to chambord the quantity of vines is very great they have them very flourishing on a flat poor blowing sand how well satisfied would my friend le blanc be if his poorest sands at cavenham gave him  00 dozen of good wine per acre per annum see at one coup dœil  000 acres of them view the royal chateau of chambord    built by that magnificent prince francis i and inhabited by the late marechal de saxe i had heard much of this castle and it more than answered my expectation it gives a great idea of the splendor of that prince comparing the centuries and the revenues of louis xiv and francis i i prefer chambord infinitely to versailles the apartments are large numerous and well contrived i admired particularly the stone staircase in the centre of the house which being in a double spiral line contains two distinct staircases one above another by which means people are going up and down at the same time without seeing each other the four apartments in the attic with arched stone roofs were in no mean taste one of these count saxe turned into a neat well contrived theatre we    were shewn the apartment which that great soldier occupied and the room in which he died whether in his bed or not is yet a problem for ancedote hunters to solve a report not uncommon in france was that he was ran through the heart in a duel with the prince of conti who came to chambord for that purpose and great care was taken to conceal it from the king louis xv who had such a friendship for the marechal that he would certainly have driven the prince out of the kingdom there are several apartments modernized either for the marechal or for the governors that have resided here since in one there is a fine picture of louis xiv on horseback near the castle are the barracks for the regiment of   00 horse formed by marechal de saxe and which louis xv gave him by appointing them to garrison chambord while their colonel made at his residence he lived here in great splendour and highly respected by his sovereign and the whole kingdom—the situation of the castle is bad it is low and without the least prospect that is interesting indeed the whole country is so flat that a high ground is hardly to be found in it from the battlements we saw the environs of which the park or forest forms threefourths it contains within a wall about  0000 arpents and abounds with all sorts of game to a degree of profusion great tracts of this park are waste or under heath c or at least a very imperfect cultivation i could not help thinking that if the king of france ever formed the idea of establishing one compleat and perfect farm under the turnip culture of england here is the place for it let him assign the chateau for the residence of the director and all his attendants and the barracks which are now applied to no use whatever for stalls for cattle and the profits of the wood would be sufficient to stock and support the whole undertaking  0 what comparison between the utility of such an establishment and that of a much greater expence applied here at present for supporting a wretched haras stud which has not a tendency but to mischief i may  0 however recommend such agricultural establishments but they never were made in any country and never will be till mankind are governed on principles absolutely contrary to those which prevail at present—until something more is thought requisite for a national husbandry than academies and memoirs—   miles the   th in two miles from the park wall regain the high road on the loire in discourse with a vigneron we were informed that it froze this morning hard enough to damage the vines and i may observe that for four or five days past the weather has been constantly clear with a bright sun and so cold a northeast wind as to resemble much our cold clear weather in england in april we have all our great coats on the day through dine at clarey    and view the monument of that able but bloody tyrant louis xi in white marble he is represented in a kneeling posture praying forgiveness i suppose which doubtless was promised him by his priests for his basenesses and his murders reach orleans— 0 miles the   th here my companions wanting to return as soon as possible to paris took the direct road thither but having travelled it before i preferred that by petivier    in the way to fountainbleau one motive for my taking this road was its passing by denainvilliers the seat of the late celebrated mons du hamel    and where he made those experiments in agriculture which he has recited in many of his works at petivier i was just by and walked thither for the pleasure of viewing grounds i had read of so often considering them with a sort of classic reverence his homme daffaire who conducted the farm being dead i could not get many particulars to be depended upon mons fougeroux the present possessor was not at home or i should doubtless have had all the information i wished i examined the soil a principal point in all experiments    when conclusions are to be drawn from them and i also took notes of the common husbandry learning from the labourer who attended me that the drillploughs c were yet in being on a loft in one of the offices i viewed them with pleasure and found them as well as i can remember very accurately represented in the plates which their ingenious author has given i was glad to find them laid up in a place out of common traffic where they may remain safe till some other farming traveller as enthusiastic as myself may view the venerable remains of a useful genius here is a stove and bath for drying wheat which he also has described in an inclosure behind the house is a plantation of various curious exotic trees finely grown also several rows of ash elm and poplar along the roads near the chateau all planted by mons du hamel it gave me still greater pleasure to find that denainvilliers is not an inconsiderable estate the lands extensive the chateau respectable with offices gardens c that prove it the residence of a man of fortune from which it appears that this indefatigable author however he might have failed in some of his pursuits met with that reward from his court which did it credit to bestow and that he was not like others left in obscurity to the simple rewards which ingenuity can confer on itself four miles before malsherbs    a fine plantation of a row of trees on each side the road begins formed by mons de malsherbs and is a striking instance of attention to decorating an open country more than two miles of them are mulberries they join his other noble plantations at malsherbs which contain a great variety of the most curious trees that have been introduced in france—   miles the   th after passing three miles through the forest of fountainbleau arrive at that town and view the royal palace which has been so repeatedly added to by several kings that the share of francis i its original founder is not easily ascertained he does not appear to such advantage as at chambord this has been a favourite with the bourbons from there having been so many nimrods of that family of the apartments which are shewn here    the kings the queens monsieurs and madames are the chief gilding seems the prevalent decoration but in the queens cabinet it is well and elegantly employed the painting of that delicious little room is exquisite and nothing can exceed the extremity of ornament that is here with taste bestowed the tapestries of beauvais and the gobelins are seen in this palace to great advantage i liked to see the gallery of francis i preserved to its ancient state even to the andirons in the chimney which are those that served that monarch the gardens are nothing and the grand canal as it is called not to be compared with that at chantilly in the pond that joins the palace are carp as large and as tame as the prince of condès the landlord of the inn at fountainbleau thinks that royal palaces should not be seen for nothing he made me pay  0 liv for a dinner which would have cost me not more than half the money at the star and garter at richmond reach meulan    —   miles the   th cross for a considerable distance the royal oak forest of senár    —about montgeron    all open fields which produce corn and partridges to eat it for the number is enormous there is on an average a covey of birds on every two acres besides favourite spots where they abound much more at st george    the seine is a much more beautiful river than the loire enter paris once more with the same observation i made before that there is not onetenth of the motion on the roads around it that there is around london to the hotel de la rochefoucauld— 0 miles the   th accompanied the count de la rochefoucauld to liancourt—   miles i went thither on a visit for three or four days but the whole family contributed so generally to render the place in every respect agreeable that i staid more than three weeks at about half a mile from the chateau is a range of hill that was chiefly a neglected waste the duke of liancourt has lately converted this into a plantation with winding walks benches and covered seats in the english    style of gardening the situation is very fortunate these ornamented paths follow the edge of the declivity to the extent of three or four miles the views they command are every where pleasing and in some places great nearer to the chateau the dutchess of liancourt has built a menagerie and dairy in a pleasing taste the cabinet and antiroom are very pretty the saloon elegant and the diary entirely constructed of marble at a village near liancourt the duke has established a manufacture of linen and stuffs mixed with thread and cotton which promises to be of considerable utility there are    looms employed and preparations making for more as the spinning for these looms is also established it gives employment to great numbers of hands who were idle for they have no sort of manufacture in the country though it is populous such efforts merit great praise connected with this is the execution of an excellent plan of the dukes for establishing habits of industry in the rising generation the daughters of the poor people are received into an institution to be educated to useful industry they are instructed in their religion taught to write and read and to spin cotton are kept till marriageable and then a regulated proportion of their earnings given them as a marriage portion there is another establishment of which i am not so good a judge it is for training the orphans of soldiers to be soldiers themselves the duke of liancourt has raised some considerable buildings for their accommodation well adapted to the purpose the whole is under the superintendance of a worthy and intelligent officer mons le roux captain of dragoons and croix de st louis who sees to every thing himself there are at present   0 boys all dressed in uniform—my ideas have all taken a turn which i am too old to change i should have been better pleased to see   0 lads educated to the plough in habits of culture superior to the present but certainly the establishment is humane and the conduct of it excellent       the ideas i had formed before i came to france of a country residence in that kingdom i found at liancourt to be far from correct i expected to find it a mere transfer of paris to the country and that all the burthensome forms of a city were preserved without its pleasures but i was deceived the mode of living and the pursuits approach much nearer to the habits of a great noblemans house in england than would commonly be conceived a breakfast of tea for those that chose to repair to it riding sporting planting gardening till dinner and that not till half after two oclock instead of their old fashioned hour of twelve music chess and the other common amusements of a rendezvouzroom with an excellent library of seven or eight thousand volumes were well calculated to make the time pass agreeably and to prove that there is a great approximation in the modes of living at present in the different countries of europe amusements in truth ought to be numerous within doors for in such a climate none are to be depended on without the rain that has fallen here is hardly credible i have for fiveandtwenty years past remarked in england that i never was prevented by rain from taking a walk every day without going out while it actually rains it may fall heavily for many hours but a person who watches an opportunity gets a walk or a ride since i have been at liancourt we have had three days in succession of such incessantly heavy rain that i could not go an hundred yards from the house to the dukes pavilion without danger of being quite wet for ten days more rain fell here i am confident had there been a guage to measure it than ever fell in england in thirty the present fashion in france of passing some time in the country is new at this time of the year and for many weeks past paris is comparatively speaking empty every body that have countryseats are at them and those who have none visit others who have this remarkable revolution in the french manners is certainly one of the best customs they have taken from england and its introduction was effected the easier being assisted by the magic of rousseaus writings mankind are much indebted to that splendid genius who when living was hunted from country to country to seek an asylum with    as much venom as if he had been a mad dog thanks to the vile spirit of bigotry which has not yet received its deaths wound women of the first fashion in france are now ashamed of not nursing their own children and stays are universally proscribed from the bodies of the poor infants which were for so many ages tortured in them as they are still in spain the country residence may not have effects equally obvious but they will be no less sure in the end and in all respects beneficial to every class in the state the duke of liancourt being president of the provincial assembly of the election of clermont  0 and passing several days there in business asked me to dine with the assembly as he said there were to be some considerable farmers present these assemblies which had been proposed many years past by the french patriots and especially by the marquis de mirabeau    the celebrated lami des hommes which had been treated by m necker and which were viewed with eyes of jealousy by certain persons who wished for no better government than one whose abuses were the chief foundation of their fortunes these assemblies were to me interesting to see i accepted the invitation with pleasure three considerable farmers renters not proprietors of land were members and present i watched their carriage narrowly to see their behaviour in the presence of a great lord of the first rank considerable property and high in royal favour and it was with pleasure that i found them behaving with becoming ease and freedom and though modest and without anything like flippancy yet without any obsequiousness offensive to english ideas they started their opinions freely and adhered to them with becoming confidence a more singular spectacle was to see two ladies present at a dinner of this sort with five or six and twenty gentlemen such a thing could not happen in england to say that the french manners    in this respect are better than our own is the assertion of an obvious truth if the ladies are not present at meetings where the conversation has the greatest probability of turning on subjects of more importance than the frivolous topics of common discourse the sex must either remain on one hand in ignorance or on the other filled with the foppery of over education learned affected and forbidding the conversation of men not engaged in trifling pursuits is the best school for the education of a woman the political conversation of every company i have seen has turned much more on the affairs of holland than on those of france the preparations going on for a war with england are in the mouths of all the world but the finances of france are in such a state of derangement that the people best informed assert a war to be impossible the marquis of verac the late french ambassador at the hague who was sent thither as the english politicians assert expressly to bring about a revolution in the government has been at liancourt three days it may easily be supposed that he is cautious in what he says in such a mixed company but it is plain enough that he is well persuaded that that revolution change or lessening the stadtholders power that plan in a word whatever it was for which he negotiated in holland had for some time been matured and ready for execution almost without a possibility of failure had the count de vergennes consented and not spun out the business by refinement on refinement to make himself the more necessary to the french cabinet and it unites with the idea of some sensible dutchmen with whom i have conversed on the subject during my stay at liancourt my friend lazowski accompanied me on a little excursion of two days to ermenonville the celebrated seat of the marquis de girardon we passed by chantilly to morefountain    the countryseat of mons de morefountain prevost des merchands of paris the place has been mentioned as decorated in the english style it consists of two scenes one a garden of winding walks and ornamented with a profusion of temples benches grottos columns ruins and i know not what i    hope the french who have not been in england do not consider this as the english taste it is in fact as remote from it as the most regular stile of the last age the water view is fine there is a gaiety and chearfulness in it that contrast well with the brown and unpleasing hills that surround it and which partake of the waste character of the worst part of the surrounding country much has been done here and it wants but few additions to be as perfect as the ground admits reach ermenonville    through another part of the prince of condes forest which joins the ornamented grounds of the marquis girardon    this place after the residence and death of the persecuted but immortal rousseau whose tomb every one knows is here became so famous as to be resorted to very generally it has been described and plates published of the chief views to enter into a particular description would therefore be tiresome i shall only make one or two observations which i do not recollect having been touched on by others it consists of three distinct water scenes or of two lakes and a river we were first shewn that which is so famous for the small isle of poplars in which reposes all that was mortal of that extraordinary and inimitable writer this scene is as well imagined and as well executed as could be wished the water is between forty and fifty acres hills rise from it on both sides and it is sufficiently closed in by tall wood at both ends to render it sequestered the remains of departed genius stamp a melancholy idea from which decoration would depart too much and accordingly there is little we viewed the scene in a still evening the declining sun threw a lengthened shade on the lake and silence seemed to repose on its unruffled bosom as some poet says i forget who the worthies to whom the temple of philosophers is dedicated and whose names are marked on the columns are newton lucem—descartes nil in rebus inane—voltaire ridiculum—rousseau naturam—and on another unfinished column quis hoc perficiet the other    lake is larger it nearly fills the bottom of the vale around which are some rough rocky wild and barren sand hills either broken or spread with heath in some places wooded and in others scattered thinly with junipers the character of the scene is that of wild and undecorated nature in which the hand of art was meant to be concealed as much as was consistent with ease of access the last scene is that of a river which is made to wind through a lawn receding from the house and broken by wood the ground is not fortunate it is too dead a flat and no where viewed to much advantage from ermenonville we went the morning after to brasseuse    the seat of madame du pont sister to the dutchess of liancourt what was my surprize at finding this viscountess a great farmer a french lady young enough to enjoy all the pleasures of paris living in the country and minding her farm was an unlooked for spectacle she has probably more lucerne than any other person in europe—  0 arpents she gave me in a most unaffected and agreeable manner both lucerne and dairy intelligence but of that more elsewhere returned to liancourt by pont    where there is a handsome bridge of three arches the construction uncommon each pier consisting of four pillars with a towingpath under one of the arches for the bargehorses the river being navigable amongst the morning amusements i partook at liancourt was la chasse in deer shooting the sportsmen place themselves at distances around a wood then beat it and seldom more than one in a company gets a shot it is more tedious than is easily conceived like angling incessant expectation and perpetual disappointment partridge and hare shooting are almost as different from that of england we took this diversion in the fine vale of catnoir    five or six miles from liancourt arranging ourselves in a file at about thirty yards from person to person and each with a servant and a loaded gun ready to present when his master fires thus we marched across and cross the vale treading up the game four or five brace of hares and twenty    brace of partridges were the spoils of the day i like this mode of shooting but little better than waiting for deer the best circumstance to me of exercise in company it was not so once is the festivity of the dinner at the close of the day to enjoy this it must not be pushed to great fatigue good spirits after violent exercise are always the affectation of silly young folks i remember being that sort of fool myself when i was young but with something more than moderate the exhilaration of body is in unison with the flow of temper and agreeable company is then delicious on such days as these we were too late for the regular dinner and had one by ourselves with no other dressing than the refreshment of clean linen and these were not the repasts when the dutchesss champaigne had the worst flavour a man is not worth hanging that does not drink a little too much on such occasions mais prenezygarde repeat it often and make it a mere drinking party the lustre of the pleasure fades and you become what was an english foxhunter one day while we were thus dining à langlais and drinking the plough the chace and i know not what the dutchess of liancourt and some of her ladies came in sport to see us it was a moment for them to have betrayed illnature in the contempt of manners not french which they might have endeavoured to conceal under a laugh—but nothing of this it was a good humoured curiosity a natural inclination to see others pleased and in spirits ils ont été de grands chasseurs aujourdhui said one oh ils sapplaudissent de leurs exploites do they drink the gun said another leurs maitresses certainement added a third jaime a les voir en gaiété il y a quelque chose daimable dans tout ceci to note such trifles may seem superfluous to many but what is life when trifles are withdrawn and they mark the temper of a nation better than objects of importance in the moments of council victory flight or death mankind i suppose are nearly the same trifles discriminate better and the number is infinite that gives me an opinion of the good temper of the french i am fond neither of a man nor a recital that can appear only on stilts and dressed in holiday geers it is everyday feelings that decide the colour of our lives and he who values them the most  0 plays the best for the stake of happiness but it is time to quit liancourt which i do with regret take leave of the good old dutchess whose hospitality and kindness ought long to be remembered—   miles the  th  0th and   th return by beauvais    and pontoise    and enter paris for the fourth time confirmed in the idea that the roads immediately leading to that capital are deserts comparatively speaking with those of london by what means can the connection be carried on with the country the french must be the most stationary people upon earth when in a place they must rest without a thought of going to another or the english must be the most restless and find more pleasure in moving from one place to another than in resting to enjoy life in either if the french nobility went to their country seats only when exiled there by the court the roads could not be more solitary—   miles the   th my intention was to take lodgings but on arriving at the hotel de la rochefoucauld i found that my hospitable dutchess was the same person at the capital as in the country she had ordered an apartment to be ready for me it grows so late in the season that i shall make no other stay in this capital than what will be necessary for viewing public buildings this will unite well enough with delivering some letters i brought to a few men of science and it will leave me the evenings for the theatres of which there are many in paris in throwing on paper a rapid coup dœil of what i see of a city so well known in england i shall be apt to delineate my own ideas and feelings perhaps more than the objects themselves and be it remembered that i profess to dedicate this careless itinerary to trifles much more than to objects that are of real consequence from the tower of the cathedral the view of paris is complete it is a vast city even to the eye that has seen london from st pauls being circular gives an advantage to paris but a much greater is the atmosphere it is now so clear that one would suppose it the height of summer the clouds of coalsmoke that envelope london always prevent a distinct view of    that capital but i take it to be onethird at least larger than paris the buildings of the parliamenthouse 00 are disfigured by a gilt and taudry gate and a french roof the hotel des monoies is a fine building and the facade of the louvre one of the most elegant in the world because they have to the eye no roofs in proportion as a roof is seen a building suffers i do not recollect one edifice of distinguished beauty unless with domes in which the roof is not so flat as to be hidden or nearly so what eyes then must the french architects have had to have loaded so many buildings with coverings of a height destructive of all beauty put such a roof as we see on the parliamenthouse or on the thuilleries upon the facade of the louvre and where would its beauty be—at night to the opera 0  which i thought a good theatre till they told me it was built in six weeks and then it became good for nothing in my eyes for i suppose it will be tumbling down in six years durability is one of the essentials of building what pleasure would a beautiful front of painted pasteboard give the alceste of gluck was performed that part by mademoiselle st huberti their first singer an excellent actress as to scenes dresses decorations dancing c this theatre beats the haymarket to nothing the   th across paris to the rue des blancs manteaux to mons broussonet secretary of the society of agriculture he is in burgundy called on mr cook from london who is at paris with his drillplough 0  waiting for weather to shew its performance to the duke of orleans    this is a french idea improving france by drilling a man should learn to walk before he learns to dance there is agility in cutting capers and it may be done with grace but where is the necessity to cut them at all there has been much rain to day and it is almost incredible to a person used to london how dirty the streets of paris are and how horribly inconvenient and dangerous walking is without a footpavement we had a large party at dinner with politicians among them and some interesting conversation on the present state of france the feeling of every body seems to be that the archbishop 0  will not be able to do any thing towards exonerating the state from the burthen of its present situation some think that he has not the inclination others that he has not the courage others that he has not the ability by some he is thought to be attentive only to his own interest and by others that the finances are too much deranged to be within the power of any system to recover short of the statesgeneral of the kingdom and that it is impossible for such an assembly to meet without a revolution in the government ensuing all seem to think that something extraordinary will happen and a bankruptcy is an idea not at all uncommon but who is there that will have the courage to make it the   th to the benedictine abbey of st germain to see pillars of african marble c it is the richest abbey in france the abbot has  00000 liv a year      l i lose my patience at such revenues being thus bestowed consistent with the spirit of the tenth century but not with that of the eighteenth what a noble farm would the fourth of this income establish what turnips what cabbages what potatoes what clover what sheep what wool—are not these things better than a fat ecclesiastic if an active english farmer was mounted behind this abbot i think he would do more good to france with half the income than half the abbots of the kingdom with the whole of theirs pass the bastile another pleasant object to make agreeable emotions vibrate in a mans bosom i search for good farmers and run my head at every turn    against monks and state prisoners—to the arsenal to wait on mons lavoisier 0  the celebrated chemist whose theory of the nonexistence of phlogiston has made as much noise in the chemical world as that of stahl which established its existence dr priestly had given me a letter of introduction i mentioned in the course of conversation his laboratory and he appointed tuesday by the boulevards to the place louis xv 0  which is not properly a square but a very noble entrance to a great city the facades of the two buildings erected are highly finished the union of the place louis xv with the champs elisées the gardens of the thuilleries and the seine is open airy elegant and superb and is the most agreeable and best built part of paris here one can be clean and breathe freely but by far the finest thing i have yet seen at paris is the halle aux bleds or corn market it is a vast rotunda the roof entirely of wood upon a new principle of carpentry to describe which would demand plates and long explanations the gallery is   0 yards round consequently the diameter is as many feet it is as light as if suspended by the fairies in the ground area wheat pease beans lentils are stored and sold in the surrounding divisions flour on wooden stands you pass by staircases doubly winding within each other to spacious apartments for rye barley oats c the whole is so well planned and so admirably executed that i know of no public building that exceeds it in either france or england and if an appropriation of the parts to the conveniences wanted and an adaptation of every circumstance to the end required in union with that elegance which is consistent with use and that magnificence which results from stability and duration are the criteria of public edifices i know nothing that equals it—it has but one fault and that is situation it should have been upon the banks of the river for the convenience of unloading barges without land carriage in    the evening to the comedie italienne 0  the edifice fine and the whole quarter regular and new built a private speculation of the duke de choiseul whose family has a box entailed for ever—laimant jaloux here is a young singer mademoiselle rénard with so sweet a voice that if she sung italian and had been taught in italy would have made a delicious performer to the tomb of cardinal de richlieu 0  which is a noble production of genius by far the finest statue i have seen nothing can be wished more easy and graceful than the attitude of the cardinal nor more expressive nature than the figure of weeping science dine with my friend at the palais royale at a coffeehouse well dressed people every thing clean good and well served but here as every where else you pay a good price for good things we ought never to forget that a low price for bad things is not cheapness in the evening to lecole des peres at the comedie francaise a crying larmoyant thing this theatre the principal one at paris is a fine building with a magnificent portico after the circular theatres of france how can any one relish our ill contrived oblong holes of london the   th to mons lavoisier by appointment madame lavoisier a lively sensible scientific lady had prepared a dejeuné anglois of tea and coffee but her conversation on mr kirwans essay on phlogiston 0  which she is translating from the english and on other subjects which a woman of understanding that works with her husband in his laboratory knows how to adorn was the best repast that apartment the operations of which    have been rendered so interesting to the philosophical world i had pleasure in viewing in the apparatus for ærial experiments nothing makes so great a figure as the machine for burning inflammable and vital air to make or deposit water it is a splendid machine three vessels are held in suspension with indexes for marking the immediate variations of their weights two that are as large as half hogsheads contain the one inflammable the other the vital air and a tube of communication passes to the third where the two airs unite and burn by contrivances too complex to describe without plates the loss of weight of the two airs as indicated by their respective balances equal at every moment to the gain in the third vessel from the formation or deposition of the water it not being yet ascertained whether the water be actually made or deposited if accurate of which i must confess i have little conception it is a noble machine mons lavoisier when the structure of it was commended said mais oüi monsieur  même par un artiste francois with an accent of voice that admitted their general inferiority to ours it is well known that we have a considerable exportation of mathematical and other curious instruments to every part of europe and to france amongst the rest nor is this new for the apparatus with which the french academicians measured a degree in the polar circle was made by mr george graham 0  another engine mons lavoisier shewed us was an electrical apparatus inclosed in a balloon for trying electrical experiments in any sort of air his pond of quicksilver is considerable containing   0lb and his water apparatus very great but his furnaces did not seem so well calculated for the higher degrees of heat as some others i have seen i was glad to find this gentleman splendidly lodged and with every appearance of a man of considerable fortune this ever gives one pleasure the employments of a state can never be in better hands than of men who thus apply the superfluity of their wealth from the use that is generally made of money one would think it the assistance of all others of the least consequence in affecting any business truly useful to mankind many of    the great discoveries that have enlarged the horizon of science having been in this respect the result of means seemingly inadequate to the end the energic exertions of ardent minds bursting from obscurity and breaking the bands inflicted by poverty perhaps by distress to the hotel des invalids the major of which establishment had the goodness to shew the whole of it in the evening to mons lomond  0 a very ingenious and inventive mechanic who has made an improvement of the jenny for spinning cotton common machines are said to make too hard a thread for certain fabrics but this forms it loose and spongy in electricity he has made a remarkable discovery you write two or three words on a paper he takes it with him into a room and turns a machine inclosed in a cylindrical case at the top of which is an electrometer a small fine pith ball a wire connects with a similar cylinder and electrometer in a distant apartment and his wife by remarking the corresponding motions of the ball writes down the words they indicate from which it appears that he has formed an alphabet of motions as the length of the wire makes no difference in the effect a correspondence might be carried on at any distance within and without a besieged town for instance or for a purpose much more worthy and a thousand times more harmless between two lovers prohibited or prevented from any better connection whatever the use may be the invention is beautiful mons lomond has many other curious machines all the entire work of his own hands mechanical invention seems to be in him a natural propensity in the evening to the comedie francaise mola did the bourru bienfaisant and it is not easy for acting to be carried to greater perfection the   th to mons labbé messier    astronomer royal

difference between an annual and    biennial exhibition dined today with a party whose conversation was entirely political mons de calonnes    requête au roi is come over and all the world are reading and disputing on it it seems however generally agreed that without exonerating himself from the charge of the agiotage he has thrown no inconsiderable load on the shoulders of the archbishop of toulouze the present premier who will be puzzled to get rid of the attack but both these ministers were condemned on all hands in the lump as being absolutely unequal to the difficulties of so arduous a period one opinion pervaded the whole company that they are on the eve of some great revolution in the government that every thing points to it the confusion in the finances great with a deficit impossible to provide for without the statesgeneral of the kingdom yet no ideas formed of what would be the consequence of their meeting no minister existing or to be looked to in or out of power with such decisive talents as to promise any other remedy than palliative ones a prince on the throne with excellent dispositions but without the resources of a mind that could govern in such a moment without ministers a court buried in pleasure and dissipation and adding to the distress instead of endeavouring to be placed in a more independent situation a great ferment amongst all ranks of men who are eager for some change without knowing what to look to or to hope for and a strong leaven of liberty increasing every hour since the american revolution altogether form a combination of circumstances that promise eer long to ferment into motion if    some master hand of very superior talents and inflexible courage is not found at the helm to guide events instead of being driven by them it is very remarkable that such conversation never occurs but a bankruptcy is a topic the curious question on which is would a bankruptcy occasion a civil war and a total overthrow of the government the answers that i have received to this question appear to be just such a measure conducted by a man of abilities vigour and firmness would certainly not occasion either one or the other but the same measure attempted by a man of a different character might possibly do both all agree that the states of the kingdom cannot assemble without more liberty being the consequence but i meet with so few men that have any just ideas of freedom that i question much the species of this new liberty that is to arise they know not how to value the privileges of the people as to the nobility and the clergy if a revolution added any thing to their scale i think it would do more mischief than good    the   th to the gobelins which is undoubtedly the first manufacture of tapestry in the world

his assistant and soninlaw i had had the pleasure of knowing in suffolk they shewed the whole veterinary establishment and it does honour to the government of france it was formed in      in      a farm was annexed to it and four other professorships established two for rural œconomy one for anatomy and another for chemistry—i was informed that mons daubenton who is at the head of this farm with a salary of  000 liv a year reads lectures of rural œconomy particularly on sheep and that a flock was for that purpose kept in exhibition there is a spacious and convenient apartment for dissecting horses and other animals a large cabinet where the most interesting parts of all domestic animals are preserved in spirits and also of such parts of their bodies that mark the visible effect of distempers this is very rich this with a similar one near lyons is kept up exclusive of the addition of      at the moderate expence as appears by the writings of m necker of about  0000 liv   00l whence as in many other instances it appears that the most useful things cost the least there are at present about one hundred elèves from different parts of the kingdom as well as from every country in europe except england a strange exception considering how grossly ignorant our farriers are and that the whole expence of supporting a young man here does not exceed forty louis ayear nor more than four years necessary for his complete instruction as to the farm it is under the conduct of a great naturalist high in royal academies of science and whose name is celebrated through europe for merit in superior branches of knowledge it would argue in me a want of judgment in human nature to expect good practice from such men they would probably think it beneath their pursuits and situation in life to be good ploughmen turniphoers and shepherds i should therefore betray my own ignorance of life if i was to express any surprize at finding this farm in a situation that—i had rather forget

do not secure a situation in life answerable to that education if you do secure such a situation you destroy the result of the education because nothing but merit ought to give that security you educate the children of men who are well able to give the education themselves you tax the people who cannot afford to educate their children in order to ease those who can well afford the burthen and

letter to mons richard which procured admittance it contains about  00 acres disposed in the taste of what we read of in books of chinese gardening whence it is supposed the english style was taken there is more of sir william chambers     here than of mr brown     —more effort than nature—and more expence than taste it is not easy to conceive any thing that art can introduce in a garden that is not here woods rocks lawns lakes rivers islands cascades grottos walks temples and even  0  villages there are parts of the design very pretty and well executed the only fault is too much crouding which has led to another that of cutting the lawn by too many gravel walks an error to be seen in almost every garden i have met with in france but the glory of la petite trianon is the exotic trees and shrubs the world has been successfully rifled to decorate it here are curious and beautiful ones to please the eye of ignorance and to exercise the memory of science of the buildings the temple of love is truly elegant again to versailles in viewing the kings apartment which he had not left a quarter of an hour with those slight traits of disorder that shewed he lived in it it was amusing to see the blackguard figures that were walking uncontrouled about the palace and even in his bedchamber men whose rags betrayed them to be in the last stage of poverty and i was the only person that stared and wondered how the devil they got there it is impossible not to like this careless indifference and freedom from suspicion one loves the master of the house who would not be hurt or offended at seeing his apartment thus occupied if he returned suddenly for if there was danger of this the intrusion would be prevented this is certainly a feature of that good temper which appears to me so visible every where in france i desired to see the queens apartments but i could not is her majesty in it no why then not see it as well as the kings ma foi mons cest un autre chose ramble through the gardens and by the grand canal with absolute astonishment at the exaggerations of writers and travellers there is magnificence in the quarter of the orangerie but no beauty any where there are some statues good enough to wish them under cover the extent and breadth of the canal are nothing to the eye and it is not in such good repair as a farmers horsepond the menagerie is well enough but nothing great let those who desire that the buildings and establishments of louis xiv should continue the impression made by the writings of voltaire go to the canal of languedoc and by no means to versailles—return to paris—   miles the   th with mons de broussonet to the kings  0  cabinet of natural history and the botanical garden which is in beautiful order its riches are well known and the

the celebrated author of many œconomical works particularly on the boulangerie of france the gentleman to a considerable mass of useful knowledge adds a great deal of that fire and vivacity for which his nation has been distinguished but which i have not recognized so often as i expected the   th this great city appears to be in many respects the most ineligible and inconvenient for the residence of a person of small fortune of any that i have seen and vastly inferior to london the streets are very narrow and many of them crouded nine tenths dirty and all without footpavements walking which in london is so pleasant and so clean that ladies do it every day is here a toil and a fatigue to a man and an impossibility to a well dressed woman the coaches are numerous and what are much worse there are an infinity of onehorse cabriolets which are driven by young men of fashion and their imitators alike fools with such rapidity as to be real nuisances and render the streets exceedingly dangerous without an incessant caution i saw a poor child run over and probably killed and have been myself many times blackened with the mud of the kennels this beggarly practice of driving a onehorse booby hutch about the streets of a great capital flows either from poverty or wretched and despicable œconomy nor is it possible to speak of it with too much severity if young noblemen at london were to drive their chaises in streets without footways as their brethren do at paris they would speedily and justly get  0  very well threshed or rolled in the kennel this circumstance renders paris an ineligible residence for persons particularly families that cannot afford to keep a coach a convenience which is as dear as at london the fiacres hackneycoaches are much worse than at that city and chairs there are none for they would be driven down in the streets to this circumstance also it is owing that all persons of small or moderated fortune are forced to dress in black with black stockings the dusky hue of this in company is not so disagreeable a circumstance as being too great a distinction too clear a line drawn in company between a man that has a good fortune and another that has not with the pride arrogance and ill temper of english wealth this could not be borne but the prevailing good humour of the french eases all such untoward circumstances lodgings are not half so good as at london yet considerably dearer if you do not hire a whole suite of rooms at an hotel you must probably mount three four or five pair of stairs and in general have nothing but a bedchamber after the horrid fatigue of the streets such an elevation is a delectable circumstance you must search with trouble before you will be lodged in a private family as gentlemen usually are at london and pay a higher price servants wages are about the same as at that city it is to be regretted that paris should have these disadvantages for in other respects i take it to be a most eligible residence for such as prefer a great city the society for a man of letters or who has any scientific pursuit cannot be exceeded the intercourse between such men and the great which if it is not upon an equal footing ought never to exist at all is respectable persons of the highest rank pay an attention to science and literature and emulate the character they confer i should pity the man who expected without other advantages of a very different nature to be well received in a brilliant circle at london because he was a fellow of the royal society but this would not be the case with a member of the academy of sciences at paris he is sure of a good reception every where perhaps this contrast depends in a great measure on the difference of the governments of the two countries politics are too much attended to in england to allow a due respect to be  0  paid to any thing else and should the french establish a freer government academicians will no be held in such estimation

under ground for a considerable depth even under many vales as well as hills in one of these vallies there is an opening for visiting it by an arched staircase on which i descended     steps to the canal and as this valley is much below the adjacent and other hills the great depth at which it is dug may be conceived over the door of the descent is the following inscription—lann     —mons le

their train and as to poor louis xvi at whose expence the whole was done these gentlemen certainly thought that no name less than that of an emperor ought to be annexed to theirs when inscriptions are fixed to public works no names ought to be permitted but those of the king whose merit patronizes and the engineer or artist whose genius executes the work as to a mob of intendants directors and

cultivated as our own it has been the first of my foreign travels and has with me confirmed the idea that to know our own country well we must see something of others nations figure by comparison and those ought to be esteemed the benefactors of the human race who have most established public prosperity on the basis of private happiness to ascertain how far this has been the case with the french

versailles      the long journey i had last year taken in france suggested a variety of reflections on the agriculture and on the sources and progress of national prosperity in that kingdom in spite of myself these ideas fermented in my mind and while i was drawing conclusions relative to the political state of that great country in every circumstance connected with its husbandry i found at each

of the famous works erecting to form a harbour here that i was eager to view them without the loss of a moment the duke favoured me with an order for that purpose i therefore took a boat and rowed across the artificial harbour formed by the celebrated cones as it is possible that this itinerary may be read by persons that have not either time or inclination to seek other books for an account of these works i will in a few words sketch the intention and execution the french possess no port for ships of war from dunkirk to brest and the former capable of receiving only frigates this deficiency has been fatal to them more than once in their wars with england whose more favourable coast affords not only the thames but the noble harbour of portsmouth to remedy the want they planned a mole across the open bay of cherbourg but to inclose a space sufficient to protect a fleet of the line would demand so extended a wall and so exposed to heavy seas that the expence would be far too great to be thought of and at the same time the success too dubious to be ventured the idea of a regular mole was therefore given up and a partial one on a new plan adopted this was to erect in the sea a line where a mole is wanted insulated columns of timber and masonry of so vast a size as to resist the violence of the ocean and to break its waves sufficiently to permit a bank being formed between column and   0 column these have been called cones from their form they are   0 feet diameter at the base  0 diameter at the top and  0 feet vertical height being when sunk in the sea  0 to    feet immersed at the low water of high tides these enormous broadbottomed tubs being constructed of oak with every attention to strength and solidity when finished for launching were loaded with stone just sufficient for sinking and in that state each cone weighed  000 tons of  000 lb to float them sixty empty casks each of ten pipes were attached around by cords and in this state of buoyancy the enormous machine was floated to its destined spot towed by numberless vessels and before innumerable spectators at a signal the cords are cut in a moment and the pile sinks it is then filled instantly with stone from vessels ready attending and capped with masonry the contents of each filled only to within four feet of the surface   00 cubical toises of stone   a vast number of vessels are then employed to form a bank of stone from cone to cone visible at low water in neap tides eighteen cones by one account but    by another would complete the work leaving only two entrances commanded by two very fine newbuilt forts royale and dartois thoroughly well provided it is said for they do not shew them with an apparatus for heating cannon balls the number of cones will depend on the distances at which they are placed i found eight finished and the skeleton frames of two more in the dockyard but all is stopped by the archbishop of toulouze in favour of the economical plans at present in speculation four of them the last sunk being most exposed are now repairing having been found too weak to resist the fury of the storms and the heavy westerly seas the last cone is much the most damaged and in proportion as they advance they will be still more and more exposed which gives rise to the opinion of many skilful engineers that the whole scheme will prove fruitless unless such an expence is bestowed on the remaining cones as would be sufficient to exhaust the revenues of a kingdom the eight already erected have for some years given a new appearance to cherbourg new houses and even streets     and such a face of activity and animation that the stop to the works was received with blank countenances they say that quarrymen included  000 were employed the effect of the eight cones already erected and the bank of stone formed between them has been to give perfect security to a considerable portion of the intended harbour two  0 gun ships have lain at anchor within them these eighteen months past by way of experiment and though such storms have happened in that time as have put all to severe trials and as i mentioned before considerably damaged three of the cones yet these ships have not received the smallest agitation hence it is a harbour for a small fleet without doing more should they ever proceed with the rest of the cones they must be built much stronger perhaps larger and far greater precautions taken in giving them firmness and solidity it is also a question whether they must not be sunk much nearer to each other at all events the proportional expence will be nearly doubled but for wars with england the importance of having a secure harbour so critically situated they consider as equal almost to any expence at least this importance has its full weight in the eyes of the people of cherbourg i remarked in rowing across the harbour that while the sea without the artificial bar was so rough that it would have been unpleasant for a boat within it was quite smooth i mounted two of the cones one of which has this inscription—louis xvi—sur ce premiere cône èchoue le   juin      a vu limmersion de celui de lest le    juin     —on the whole the undertaking is a prodigious one and does no trifling credit to the spirit of enterprize of the present age in france   the service of the marine is a favourite whether justly or not is another question and this harbour shews that when this great people undertake any capital works that are really favourites they find inventive genius to plan and engineers of capital talents to execute whatever is devised in a manner that does honour to their kingdom the duke de beuvron had asked me to dinner     but i found that if i accepted his invitation it would then take me the next day to view the glass manufacture i preferred therefore business to pleasure and taking with me a letter from that nobleman to secure a sight of it i rode thither in the afternoon it is about three miles from cherbourg mons de puye the director explained every thing to me in the most obliging manner cherbourg is not a place for a residence longer than necessary i was here fleeced more infamously than at any other town in france the two best inns were full i was obliged to go to the barque a vile hole little better than a hogsty where for a miserable dirty wretched chamber two suppers composed chiefly of a plate of apples and some butter and cheese with some trifle besides too bad to eat and one miserable dinner they brought me in a bill of    liv  l  s  d they not only charged the room   liv a night but even the very stable for my horse after enormous items for oats hay and straw this is a species of profligacy which debases the national character calling as i returned on mons baillio i shewed him the bill at which he exclaimed for imposition and said the man and woman were going to leave off their trade and no wonder if they had made a practice of fleecing others in that manner let no one go to cherbourg without making a bargain for everything he has even to the straw and stable pepper salt and tablecloth— 0 miles the   th return to carentan and the   th pass through a rich and thickly inclosed country to coutances capital of the district called the cotentin they build in this country the best mud houses and barns i ever saw excellent habitations even of three stories and all of mud with considerable barns and other offices the earth the best for the purpose is a rich brown loam is well kneaded with straw and being spread about four inches thick on the ground is cut in squares of nine inches and these are taken with a shovel and tossed to the man on the wall who builds it and the wall built as in ireland in layers each three feet high that it may dry before they advance the thickness about two feet they make them project about an inch which they cut off layer by layer perfectly smooth if they had the english way of white washing they would     look as well as our lath and plaister and are much more durable in good houses the doors and windows are in stone work— 0 miles the  0th a fine sea view of the isles of chausée   at five leagues distant and afterwards jersey clear at about forty miles with that of town of grandval   on a high peninsula entering the town every idea of beauty is lost a close nasty ugly ill built hole market day and myriads of triflers common at a french market they bay of cancalle all along to the right and st michaels rock rising out of the sea conically with a castle on the top a most singular and picturesque object— 0 miles the   st at pont orsin   enter bretagne there seems here a more minute division of farms than before there is a long street in the episcopal town of doll   without a glass window a horrid appearance my entry into bretagne gives me an idea of its being a miserable province—   miles september  st to combourg   the country has a savage aspect husbandry not much further advanced at least in skill than among the hurons which appears in credible amidst inclosures the people almost as wild as their country and their town of combourg one of the most brutal filthy places that can be seen mud houses no windows and a pavement so broken as to impede all passengers but ease none—yet here is a chatean and inhabited who is this mons de chateaubriant   the owner that has nerves strung for a residence amidst such filth and poverty below this hideous heap of wretchedness is a fine lake surrounded by well wooded inclosures coming out of hedé 0 there is a beautiful lake belonging to mons de blassac   intendant of poictiers with a fine accompanyment of wood a very little cleaning would make here a delicious scenery there is a chateau with four rows of     trees and nothing else to be seen from the windows in the true french stile forbid it taste that this should be the house of the owner of that beautiful water and yet this mons de blassac has made at poictiers the finest promenade in france but that taste which draws a strait line and that which traces a waving one are founded on feelings and ideas as separate and distinct as painting and music—as poetry or sculpture the lake abounds with fish pike to   lb carp to   lb perch  lb and tench  lb to rennes the same strange wild mixture of desert and cultivation half savage half human—   miles the  d rennes   is well built and it has two good squares that particularly of louis xv where is his statue the parliament being in exile the house is not to be seen the benedictines garden called the tabour   is worth viewing but the object at rennes most remarkable at present is a camp with a marshal of france de stainville and four regiments of infantry and two of dragoons close to the gates the discontents of the people have been double first on account of the high price of bread and secondly for the banishment of the parliament the former cause is natural enough but why the people should love their parliament was what i could not understand since the members as well as of the states are all noble and the distinction between the noblesse and roturiers no where stronger more offensive or more abominable than in bretagne they assured me however that the populace have been blown up to violence by every art of deception and even by money distributed for that purpose the commotions rose to such a height before the camp was established that the troops here were utterly unable to keep the peace mons argentaise to whom i had brought letters had the goodness during the four days i was here to shew and explain everything to be seen i find rennes very cheap and it appears the more so to me just come from normandy where every thing is extravagantly dear the table dhôte at the grand maison is well served  they give two courses containing plenty of good things and a very ample regular dessert the supper one good course with a large     joint of mutton and another good dessert each meal with the common wine  0f and for  0 more you have very good wine instead of the ordinary sort  0f for the horse thus with good wine it is no more than   liv  0f a day or  s  0d yet a camp which they complain has raised prices enormously the  th to montauban   the poor people seem poor indeed the children terribly ragged if possible worse clad than it with no cloaths at all as to shoes and stockings they are luxuries a beautiful girl of six or seven years playing with a stick and smiling under such a bundle of rags as made my heart ache to see her they did not beg and when i gave them any thing seemed more surprized than obliged one third of what i have seen of this province seems uncultivated and nearly all of it in misery what have kings and ministers and parliaments and states to answer for their prejudices seeing millions of hands that would be industrious idle and starving through the execrable maxims of despotism or the equally detestable prejudices of a feudal nobility   sleep at the lion d or at montauban an abominable hole— 0 miles the  th the same inclosed country to brooms   but near that town improves to the eye from being more hilly at the little town of lamballe   there are above fifty families of noblesse that live in winter who reside on their estates in the summer there is probably as much foppery and nonsense in their circles and for what i know as much happiness as in those of paris both would be better employed in cultivating their lands and rendering the poor industrious— 0 miles the  th leaving lamballe the country immediately changes the marquis d urvoy who i met at rennes and has a good estate at st brieux   gave me a letter for his agent who answered my questions—  ½ miles the  th to guingamp   a sombre inclosed country     pass chateaulandrin 0 and enter bas bretagne one recognizes at once another people meeting numbers who have not more french than je ne sai pas ce que vous dites or je nentend rien enter guingamp by gateways towers and battlements apparently of the oldest military architecture every part denoting antiquity and in the best preservation the poor peoples habitations are not so good they are miserable heaps of dirt no glass and scarcely any light but they have earth chimnies i was in my first sleep at belleisle   when the aubergiste came to my bedside undrew a curtain that i expected to cover me with spiders to tell me that i had une jument anglois superbe and that a singneur wished to buy it of me i gave him half a dozen flowers of french eloquence for his impertinence when he thought proper to leave me and his spiders at peace there was a great chasse assembled these bas bretagne signeurs are capital hunters it seems that fix on a blind mare for an object of admiration apropos to the breeds of horses in france this mare cost me twentythree guineas when horses were dear in england and had been sold for sixteen when they were rather cheaper her figure may therefore be guessed yet she was much admired and often in this journey and as to bretagne she rarely met a rival that province and it is the same in parts of normandy is infested in every stable with a pack of garran poney stallions sufficient to perpetuate the miserable breed that is every where seen this villainous hole that calls itself the grand maison is the best inn at a post town on the great road to brest at which marshals of france dukes peers countesses and so forth must now and then by the accidents to which long journies are subject to have found themselves what are we to think of a country that has made in the eighteenth century no better provision for its travellers— 0 miles the  th morlaix    is the most singular port i have seen it has but one feature a vale just wide enough for a fine canal with two quays and two rows of houses behind them the mountain rises steep and woody on one side on the other gardens rocks and wood the effect     romantic and beautiful trade now very dull but flourished much in the war— 0 miles the  0th fair day at landervisier   which gave me an opportunity of seeing numbers of bas bretons collected as well as their cattle the men dress in great trowsers like breeches many with naked legs and most with wooden shoes strong marked features like the welch with countenances a mixture of half energy half laziness their persons stout broad and square the women furrowed without age by labour to the utter extinction of all softness of sex the eye discovers them at first glance to be a people absolutely distinct from the french wonderful that they should be found so with distinct language manners dress c after having been settled here   00 years—   miles the   th i had respectable letters and to respectable people at brest in order to see the dockyard but they were vain mons le chevalier de tredairne particularly applied for me earnestly to the commandant but the order contrary to its being shewn either to frenchmen or foreigners was too strict to be relaxed without an express direction from the minister of the marine given very rarely and to which when it does come they give but an unwilling obedience mons tredairne however informed me that lord pembroke saw it not long since by means of such an order and he remarked himself knowing that i could not fail doing the same that it was strange to shew the port to an english general and governor of portsmouth yet deny it to a farmer he however assured me that the duke of chartres went away but the other day without being permitted to see it gretrys music at the theatre which though not large is neat and even elegant was not calculated to put me in good humour it was panurge—brest is a well built town with many regular and handsome streets and the quay where many men of war are laid up and other shipping has much of that life and motion which animates a seaport the   th return to landernau   where at the duc de chartre which is the best and cleanest inn in the bishopric     as i was going to dinner the landlord told me there was a monsieur un homme comme il faut and the dinner would be better if we united de tout mon cœur he proved a bas breton noble with his sword and a little miserable but nimble nag this seigneur was ignorant that the duke de chartres the other day at brest was not the duke that was in mons dorvilliers fleet take the road to nantes—   miles the   th the country to chateaulin   more mountainous onethird waste all this region far inferior to leon   and traguer   no exertions nor any marks of intelligence yet all near to the great navigation and market of brest water and the soil good quimper   though a bishopric has nothing worth seeing but its promenades which are among the finest in france—   miles the   th leaving quimper there seem to be more cultivated features but this only for a moment—wastes—wastes—wastes reach quimperly   —   miles the   th the same sombre country to lorient   but with a mixture of cultivation and much wood—i found lorident so full of fools gaping to see a man of war launched that i could get no bed for myself nor stable for my house at the epeè royale at the cheval blanc a poor hole i got my horse crammed among twenty others like herrings in a barrel but could have no bed the duke de brissac with a suite of officers had no better success if the governor of paris could not without trouble get a bed at lorient no wonder arthur young found obstacles i went directly to deliver my letters found mons besné a merchant at home he received me with a frank civility better than a million of compliments and the moment he understood my situation offered me a bad in his house which i accepted the tourville of    guns was to be launched at three oclock but put off till the next day     much to the joy of the aubergistes c who were well pleased to see such a swarm of strangers kept another day i wished the ship in their throats for i thought only of my poor mare being squeezed a night amongst the bretagne garrans sixpence however to the garcon had effects marvelously to her ease the town is modern and regularly built the streets diverge in rays from the gate and are crossed by others at right angles broad handsomely built and well paved with many houses that make a good figure but what makes lorient more known is being the appropriated port for the commerce of india containing all the shipping and magazines of the company the latter are truly great and speak the royal munificence from which they arose they are of several stores and all vaulted in stone in a splendid style and of vast extent but they want at least at present like so many other magnificent establishments in france the vigour and vivacity of an active commerce the business transacting here seems trifling three    gun ships the tourville leole and jean bart with a    gun frigate are upon the stocks they assured me that the tourville has been only nine months building the scene is alive and fifteen large men of war being laid up here in ordinary with some indiamen and a few traders render the port a pleasing spectacle there is a beautiful round tower  00 feet high of white stone with a railed gallery at top the proportions light and agreeable it is for looking out and making signals my hospitable merchant i find a plain unaffected character with some whimsical originalities that make him more interesting he has an agreeable daughter who entertains me with singing to her harp the next morning the tourville quitted her stocks to the music of the regiments and the shouts of thousands collected to see it leave lorient arrive at hennebon 0 — ½ miles the   th to auray   the eighteen poorest miles i have yet seen in bretagne good houses of stone and slate without glass auray has a little port and some sloops which always give an air of life to a town to vannes   the country various but landes the more permanent feature   0 vannes is not an inconsiderable town but its greatest beauty is its port and promenade the   th to musiliac   belleisle   with the smaller ones dhedic   and dhonat are in sight musiliac if it can boast of nothing else may at least vaunt its cheapness i had for dinner two good flat fish a dish of oysters soup a fine duck roasted with an ample dessert of grapes pears walnuts biscuits liqueur and a pint of good bourdeaux wine my mare besides hay had threefourths of a peck of corn and the whole   f  f to the fille and two to the garcon in all  s  d pass landes—landes—landes—to la roche bernard the view of the river villaine is beautiful from the boldness of the shores there are no insipid flats the river is twothirds of the width of the thames at westminster and would be equal to any thing in the world if the shores were woody but they are the savage wastes of this country—   miles the   th turned aside to auvergnae   the seat of the count de la bourdonaye   to whom i had a letter from the dutchess danville as a person able to give me every species of intelligence relative to bretagne having for fiveandtwenty years been first syndic of the noblesse a fortuitous jumble of rocks and steeps could scarcely form a worse road than these five miles could i put as much faith in two bits of wood laid over each other as the good folks of the country do i should have crossed myself but my blind friend with the most incredible surefootedness carried me safe over such places that if i had not been in the every day habit of the saddle i should have shuddered at though guided by eyes keen as eclipses for i suppose a fine racer on whose velocity so many fools have been ready to lose their money must have good eyes as well as good legs such a road leading to several villages and one of the first noblemen of the province shews what the state of     society must be—no communication—no neighbourhood—no temptation to the expences which flow from society a mere seclusion to save money in order to spend it in towns the count received me with great politeness i explained to him my plan and motives for travelling in france which he was pleased very warmly to approve expressing his surprise that i should attempt so large an undertaking as such a survey of france unsupported by my government i told him he knew very little of our government if he supposed they would give a shilling to any agricultural project or projector that whether the minister was whig or tory made no difference the party of the plough never yet had one on its side and that england has had many colberts but not one sully this led to much interesting conversation on the balance of agriculture manufactures and commerce and on the means of encouraging them and in reply to his enquiries i made him understand their relations in england and how our husbandry flourished in spite of the teeth of our ministers merely by the protection which civil liberty gives to property and consequently that it was in a poor situation comparatively with what it would have been in had it received the same attention as manufactures and commerce i told m de la bourdonaye that his province of bretagne seemed to me to have nothing in it but privileges and poverty he smiled and gave me some explanations that are important but no nobleman can ever probe this evil as it ought to be done resulting as it does from the privileges going to themselves and the poverty to the people he shewed me his plantations which are very fine and well thriven and shelter him thoroughly on every side even from the s w so near to the sea from his walks we see belleisle and its neighbours and a little isle or rock belonging to him which he says the king of england took from him after sir edward hawkes victory but that his majesty was kind enough to leave him his island after one nights possession— 0 miles the  0th take my leave of monsieur and madame de la bourdonaye to whose politeness as well as friendly attentions i am much obliged towards nazaire   there is a fine view of the mouth of the loire from the rising grounds     but the headlands that form the embouchure are low which takes off from that greatness of the effect which highlands give to the mouth of the shannon the swelling bosom of the atlantic boundless to the right savanal   poverty itself—   miles the   st come to an improvement in the midst of these deserts four good houses of stone and slate and a few acres run to wretched grass which have been tilled but all savage and become almost as rough as the rest i was afterwards informed that this improvement as it is called was wrought by englishmen at the expence of a gentleman they ruined as well as themselves—i demanded how it had been done pare and burn and sow wheat then rye and then oats thus it is for ever and ever the same follies the same blundering the same ignorance and then all the fools in the country said as they do now that these wastes are good for nothing to my amazement find the incredible circumstance that they reach within three miles of the great commercial city of nantes this is a problem and a lesson to work at but not at present arrive—go to the theatre new built of fine white stone and has a magnificent portico front of eight elegant corinthian pillars and four others within to part the portico from a grand vestibule within all is gold and painting and a coup dœil at entering that struck me forcibly it is i believe twice as large as drurylane and five times as magnificent it was sunday and therefore full mon dieu cried i to myself do all the wastes the deserts the heath ling furz broom and bog that i have passed for  00 miles lead to this spectacle what a miracle that all this splendour and wealth of the cities in france should be so unconnected with the country there are no gentle transitions from ease to comfort from comfort to wealth you pass at once from beggary to profusion—from misery in mud cabins to mademoiselle st huberti in splendid spectacles at  00 liv a night   l   s  d the country deserted or if a gentleman in it you find him in some wretched hole to save that money which is lavished with profusion in the luxuries of a capital— 0 miles     the   d deliver my letters as much as agriculture is the chief object of my journey it is necessary to acquire such intelligence of the state of commerce as can be best done from merchants for abundance of useful information is to be gained without putting any questions that a man would be cautious of answering and even without putting any questions at all mons riédy was very polite and satisfied many of my enquiries i dined once with him and was pleased to find the conversation take an important turn on the relative situations of france and england in trade particularly in the west indies i had a letter also to mons epivent consilier in the parliament of rennes whose brother mons epivent de la villesboisnet is a very considerable merchant here it was not possible for any person to be more obliging than these two gentlemen their attentions to me were marked and friendly and rendered a few days residence here equally instructive and agreeable the town has that sign of prosperity of new buildings which never deceives the quarter of the comedie is magnificent all the streets at right angles and of white stone i am in doubt whether the hotel de henri iv is not the finest inn in europe desseins at calais is larger but neither built fitted up nor furnished like this which is new it cost  00000liv    00l furnished and is let at   000 liv per ann       0s with no rent for the first year it contains  0 beds for masters and    stalls for horses some of the apartments of two rooms very neat are   liv a day one good   liv but for merchants   liv per diem for dinner supper wine and chamber and   f for his horse it is without comparison the first inn i have seen in france and very cheap it is in a small square close to the theatre as convenient for pleasure or trade as the votaries of either can wish the theatre cost   0000 liv and lets to the comedians at   00 liv a year it holds when full   0 louis dor the land the inn stands on was bought at   liv a foot in some parts of the city it sells as high as    liv this value of the ground induces them to build so high as to be destructive of beauty the quay has nothing remarkable the river is choaked with islands but at the furthest part next to the sea is a large range of houses regularly fronted an     institution common in the great commercial towns of france but particularly flourishing in nantes is a chambre de lecture or what we should call a bookclub that does not divide its books but forms a library there are three rooms one for reading another another for conversation and the third is the library good fires in winter are provided and wax candles messrs epivent had the goodness to attend me in a water expedition to view the establishment of mr wilkinson for boring cannon in an island in the loire below nantes 0 until that well known english manufacturer arrived the french knew nothing of the art of casting cannon solid and then boring them mr wilkinsons machinery for boring four cannons is now at work moved by tide wheels but they have erected a steam engine with a new apparatus for boring seven more m de la motte who has the direction of the whole shewed us also a model of this engine about six feet long five high and four or five broad which he worked for us by making a small fire under the boiler that is not bigger than a large teakettle one of the best machines for a traveling philosopher that i have seen nantes is as enflammé in the cause of liberty as any town in france can be the conversations i witnessed here prove how great a change is effected in the minds of the french nor do i believe it will be possible for the present government to last half a century longer unless the clearest and most decided talents are at the helm the american revolution has laid the foundation of another in france if government does not take care of itself   the   d one of the twelve prisoners   from the bastile arrived here—he was the most violent of them all—and his imprisonment has been far enough from silencing him     the   th it was not without regret that i quitted a society both intelligent and agreeable nor should i feel comfortably if i did not hope to see messrs epivents again i have little chance of being at nantes but if they come a second time to england i have a promise of seeing them at bradfield the younger of these gentlemen spent a fortnight with lord shelburne at bowood which he remembers with much pleasure colonel barré and drpriestley were there at the same time to aucenis   is all inclosed for seven miles many seats—  ½ miles the   th to the scene of the vintage i had not before been witness to so much advantage as here last autumn the heavy rains made it a melancholy business at present all is life and activity the country all thickly and well inclosed glorious view of the loire from a village the last of bretagne where is a great barrier across the road and customhouses to search everything coming from thence the loire takes the appearance of a lake large enough to be interesting there is on both sides an accompanyment of wood which is not universal on this river the addition of towns steeples windmills and a great range of lovely country covered with vines the character gay as well as noble enter anjou with a great range of meadows pass st george   and take the road to angers for ten miles quit the loire and meet it again at angers letters from mons de broussonet but he is unable to inform me in what part of anjou was the residence of the marquis de tourbilly to find out that noblemans farm where he made those admirable improvements which he describes in the memoire sur les defrichements was such an object to me that i was determined to go to the place let the distance out of my way be what it might— 0 miles the   th among my letters one to mons de la livoniere perpetual secretaryof the society of agriculture here i found he was at his countryseat two leagues off at mignianne   on my arrival at his seat he was sitting down to dinner with his family not being past twelve i     thought to have escaped this awkwardness but both himself and madame prevented all embarrassment by very unaffectedly desiring me to partake with them and making not the least derangement either in table or looks placed me at once at my ease to an indifferent dinner garnished with so much ease and chearfulness that i found it a repast more to my taste than the most splendid tables could afford an english family in the country similar in situation taken unawares in the same way would receive you with an unquiet hospitality and an anxious politeness and after waiting for a hurryscurry derangement of cloth table plates sideboard pot and spit would give you perhaps so good a dinner that none of the family between anxiety and fatigue could supply one word of conversation and you would depart under cordial wishes that you might never return—this folly so common in england is never met with in france the french are quiet in their houses and do things without effort—mons livoniere conversed with me much on the plan of my travels which he commended greatly but thought it very extraordinary that neither government nor the academy of sciences nor the academy of agriculture should at least be at the expence of my journey this idea is purely french they have no notion of private people going out of their way for the public good without being paid by the public nor could he well comprehend me when i told him that every thing is well done in england except what is done with public money i was greatly concerned to find that he could give me no intelligence concerning the residence of the late marquis of tourbilly as it would be a provoking circumstance to pass all through the province without finding his house and afterwards hear perhaps that i had been ignorantly within a few miles of it in the evening returned to angers— 0 miles the   th to la flêche the chateau of duretal   belonging to the dutchess destissac is boldly situated above the little town of that name and on the banks of a beautiful river the slopes to which that hang to the south are covered with vines the country chearful dry and pleasant     for residence i enquired here of several gentlemen for the residence of the marquis of tourbilly but all in vain the  0 miles to la flêche the road is a noble one of gravel smooth and kept in admirable order la flêche is a neat clean little town not ill built on the river that flows to duretal which is navigable but the trade is inconsiderable my first business here as every where else in anjou was to enquire for the residence of the marquis de tourbilly i repeated my enquires till i found that there was a place not far from la flêche called tourbilly but not what i wanted as there was no mons de tourbilly there but a marquis de galway who inherited tourbilly from his father this perplexed me more and more and i renewed my enquiries with so much eagerness that several people i believe thought me half mad at last i met with an ancient lady who solved my difficulty she informed me that tourbilly about twelve miles from la flêche was the place i was in search of that it belonged to the marquis of that name who had written some books she believed that he died twenty years ago insolvent that the father of the present marquis de galway bought the estate this was sufficient for my purpose i determined to take a guide the next morning and as i could not visit the marquis at least see the remains of his improvements the news however that he died insolvent hurt me very much it was a bad commentary on his book and foresaw that whoever i should find at tourbilly would be full of ridicule on a husbandry that proved the loss of the estate on which it was practiced— 0 miles the   th this morning i executed my project my guide was a countryman with a good pair of legs who conducted me across a range of such ling wastes as the marquis speaks of in his memoir they appear boundless here and i was told that i could travel many—many days and see nothing else what fields of improvement to make not to lose estates at last we arrived at tourbilly   a poor village of a few scattered houses in a vale between two rising grounds which are yet heath and waste the chateau in the midst with plantations of fine poplars leading     to it i cannot easily express the anxious inquisitive curiosity i felt to examine every scrap of the estate no hedge or tree no bush but what was interesting to me i had read the translation of the marquiss history of his improvements in mrmills husbandry   and thought it the most interesting morsel i had met with long before i procured the original memoire sur les defrichemens and determined that if ever i should go to france to view improvements the recital of which had given me such pleasure i had neither letter nor introduction to the present owner the marquis de galway i therefore stated to him the plain fact that i had read mons de tourbillys book with so much pleasure that i wished much to view the improvements described in it he answered me directly in good english received me with such cordiality of politeness and such expressions of regard for the purport of my travels that he put me perfectly in humour with myself and consequently with all around me he ordered breakfast a l angloise gave orders for a man to attend us in our walk who i desired might be the oldest labourer to be found of the late marquis de tourbillys i was pleased to hear that one was alive who had worked with him from the beginning of his improvement at breakfast mons de galway introduced me to his brother who also spoke english and regretted that he could not do the same to madame de galway who was in the straw he then gave me an account of his fathers acquiring the estate and chateau of tourbilly his greatgrandfather came to bretagne with king james ii when he fled from the english throne some of the same family are still living in the county of cork particularly at lotta his father was famous in that province for his skill in agriculture and as a reward for an improvement he had wrought on the landes the states of the province gave him a waste tract in the island of belleisle which at present belongs to his son hearing that the marquis de tourbilly was totally ruined and his estates in anjou to be sold by the creditors     he viewed them and finding the land very improveable made the purchase giving about   000 louis dors for tourbilly a price which made the acquisition highly advantageous not withstanding his having bought some lawsuits with the estate it is about  000 arpents nearly contiguous the seigneury of two parishes with the haute justice c a handsome large and convenient chateau offices very compleat and many plantations the work of the celebrated man concerning whom my enquiries were directed i was almost breathless on the question of so great an improver being ruined you are unhappy that a man should be ruined by an art you love so much precisely so but he eased me in a moment by adding that if the marquis had done nothing but farm and improve he had never been ruined one day as he was boring to find marl his ill stars discovered a vein of earth perfectly white which on trial did not effervesce with acids   it struck him as an acquisition for porcelain—he shewed it to a manufacturer—it was pronounced excellent the marquiss imagination took fire and he thought of converting the poor village of tourbilly into a town by a fabric of china—he went to work on his own account—raised buildings—and got together all that was necessary except skill and capital—in fine he made good porcelain was cheated by his agents and people and at last ruined a soap manufactory which he established also as well as some lawsuits relative to other estates had their share in causing his misfortunes his creditors seized the estate but permitted him to administer it till his death when it was sold the only part of the tale that lessened my regret was that though married he left no family so that his ashes will sleep in peace without his memory being reviled by an indigent posterity his ancestors acquired the estate by marriage in the fourteenth century his agricultural improvements mons galway observed certainly did not hurt him they were not well done nor well supported by himself but they rendered the estate more valuable and he never heard that they had brought him into any difficulties i cannot but observe here that there   0 seems a fatality to attend country gentlemen whenever they attempt trade or manufacture in england i never knew a man of landed property with the education and habits of landed property attempt either but they were infallibly ruined or if not ruined considerably hurt by them whether it is that the ideas and principles of trade have something in them repugnant to the sentiments which ought to flow from education—or whether the habitual inattention of country gentlemen to small gains and savings which are the soul of trade renders their success impossible to whatever it may be owing the fact is such not one in a million succeeds agriculture in the improvement of their estates is the only proper and legitimate sphere of their industry and though ignorance renders this sometimes dangerous yet they can with safety attempt no other the old labourer whose name is piron as propitious i hope to farming as to wit being arrived we sallied forth to tread what to me was a sort of classic ground i shall dwell but little on the particulars they make a much better figure in the memoire sur les defrichemens than at tourbilly the meadows even near the chateau are yet very rough the general features are rough but the alleys of poplars of which he speaks in the memoirs are nobly grown indeed and do credit to his memory they are  0 or  0 feet high and girt a foot the willows are equal why were they not oak to have transmitted to the farming travellers of another century the pleasure i feel in viewing the more perishable poplars of the present time the causeways near the castle must have been arduous works the mulberries are in a state of neglect mons galways father not being fond of that culture destroyed many but some hundreds remain and i was told that the poor people had made as far as    lbs of silk but none attempted at present the meadows had been drained and improved near the chateau to the amount of  0 or  0 arpents they are now rushy but valuable in such a country near them is a wood of bourdeaux pines sown    years ago and are now worth five or six liv each i walked into the boggy bit that produced the great cabbages he mentioned it joins a large and most improveable bottom piron informed me that the marquis pared and burnt     about  00 arpents in all and he folded   0 sheep on our return to the chateau mons de galway finding what an enthusiast i was in agriculture searched among his papers to find a manuscript of the marquis de tourbillys written with his own hand which he had the goodness to make me a present of and which i shall keep amongst my curiosities in agriculture the polite reception i had met from mons galway and the friendly attention he had given to my views entering into the spirit of my pursuits and wishing to promote it would have induced me very cheerfully to have accepted his invitation of remaining some days with him had i not been apprehensive that the moment of madame galways being in bed would render such an unlooked for visit inconvenient i took my leave therefore in the evening and returned to la flêche by a different road—   miles the  0th a quantity of moors to le mans 0 they assured me at guerces   that they are here  0 leagues in circumference with no great interruptions at le mans i was unlucky in mons tournai secretary to the society of agriculture being absent—   miles october   towards alencon   the country a contrast to what i passed yesterday good land well inclosed well built and tolerably cultivated with marling a noble road of dark coloured stone apparently ferruginous that binds well near beaumont   vineyards in sight on the hills and these are the lasting thus travelling northwards the whole country finely watered by rivers and streams yet no irrigation— 0 miles the  d four miles to nouant   of rich herbage under bullocks—   miles the  d from gacé   towards bernay   pass the marishal duc de broglios chateau at broglio   which is surrounded by such a multiplicity of clipt hedges double treble and quadruple that he must half maintain the poor of the little town in clipping—   miles the  th leave bernay where and at other places in this country are many mud walls made of rich red loam     thatched at top and well planted with fruittrees a hint very well worth taking for copying in england where brick and stone are dear come to one of the richest countries in france or indeed in europe there are few finer views than the first of elbeuf   from the eminence above it which is high the town at your feet in the bottom on one side the seine presents a noble reach broken by wooded islands and an immense amphitheatre of hill covered with a prodigious wood surrounding the whole the  th to rouen where i found the hotel royal a contrast to that dirty impertinent cheating hole the pomme de pin in the evening to the theatre which is not so large i think as that of nantes but not comparable in elegance or decoration it is sombre and dirty grettys caravanne de caire the music of which though too much chorus and noise has some tender and pleasing passages i like it better than any other piece i have heard of that celebrated composer the next morning waited on mons scanegatty professeur de physique dans la société royale d agriculture he received me with politeness he has a considerable room furnished with mathematical and philosophical instruments and models he explained some of the latter to me that are of his own invention particularly one of a furnace for calcining gypsum which is brought here in large quantities from montmartre   waited on messrs midy rossec and co the most considerable wool merchants in france who were so kind as to shew me a great variety of wools from most of the european countries and permitted me to take specimens the next morning i went to darnetal 0 where mons curmer shewed me his manufacture return to rouen and dined with mons portier directeur general des fermes to whom i had brought a letter from the duc de la rochefoucauld the conversation turned among other subjects on the want of new streets at rouen on comparison with havre nantes and bourdeaux at the latter places it was remarked that a merchant makes a fortune in ten or fifteen years and builds away but at rouen it is a commerce of œconomy in which a man is long doing it and therefore unable with     prudence to make the same exertions every person at table agreed in another point which was discussed that the wine provinces are the poorest in all france i urged the produce being greater per arpent by far than of other lands they adhered to the fact as one generally known and admitted in the evening at the theatre madame du fresne entertained me greatly she is an excellent actress never overdoes her parts and make one feel by feeling herself the more i see of the french theatre the more i am forced to acknowledge the superiority to our own in the number of good performers and in the paucity of bad ones and in the quantity of dancers singers and persons on whom the business of the theatre depends all established on a great scale i remark in the sentiments that are applauded the same generous feelings in the audience in france that have many times in england put me in good humour with my countrymen we are too apt to hate the french for myself i see many reasons to be pleased with them attributing faults very much to their government perhaps in our own our roughness and want of good temper are to be traced to the same origin the  th my plan had for some time been to go directly to england on leaving rouen for the postoffices had been cruelly uncertain i had received no letters for some time from my family though i had written repeatedly to urge it they passed to a person at paris who was to forward them but some carelessness or other cause impeded all at a time that others directed to the towns i passed came regularly i had fears that some of my family were ill and that they would not write bad news to me in a situation where knowing the worst could have influence in changing it for better but the desire i had to accept the invitation to la roche guyon of the dutchess danvilles and the duc de la rochefoucauld prolonged my journey and i set forward on this further excursion a truly noble view from the road above rouen the city at one end of the vale with the river flowing to it perfectly checkered with isles of wood the other divides into two great channels between which the vale is all spread with islands some arable some meadow and much wood on all pass pont     larch   to louviers   i had letters for the celebrated manufacturer mons decretot who received me with a kindness that ought to have some better epithet than polite he shewed me his fabric unquestionably the first woolen one in the world if success beauty of fabric and an inexhaustible invention to supply with taste all the cravings of fancy can give the merit of such superiority perfection goes no further than the vigonia cloths of mons decretot at   0 liv  l   s  d the aulne he shewed me also his cottonmills under the direction of two englishmen near louviers is a manufacture of copper plates for the bottoms of the kings ships a colony of englishmen i supped with mons decretot passing a very pleasant evening in the company of some agreeable ladies—   miles the  th by guillon   to vernon   the vale flat rich arable among the notes i had long ago taken of objects to see in france was the plantation of mulberries and the silk establishment of the marechal de belleisle at bissy   near vernon the attempts repeatedly made by the society for the encouragement of arts at london to introduce silk into england had made the similar undertakings in the north of france more interesting i accordingly made all the enquiries that were necessary for discovering the success of this meritorious attempt bissy is a fine place purchased on the death of the duc de belleisle by the duc de penthievre who has but one amusement which is that of varying his residence at the numerous seats he possesses in many parts of the kingdom there is something rational in this taste i should like myself to have a score of farms from the vale of valencia to the highlands of scotland and to visit and direct their cultivation by turns from vernon cross the seine and mount the chalk hills again after which mount again and to la roche guyon   the     most singular place i have seen mademe danville and the duc de la rochefoucauld received me in a manner that would have made me pleased with the place had it been in the midst of a bog it gave me pleasure to find also the dutchess de la rouchefoucauld here with whom i had passed so much agreeable time at bagnere de luchon a thoroughly good woman with that simplicity of character which is banished by pride of family or foppery of rank the abbé rochon   the celebrated astronomer of the academy of sciences with some other company which with the domestics and trappings of a grand seigneur gave la roche guyon exactly the resemblance of the residence of a great lord in england europe is now so much assimilated that if one goes to a house where the fortune is    or  0000l ayear we shall find in the mode of living much more resemblance than a young traveller will ever be prepared to look for—   miles the  0th this is one of the most singular places i have been at the chalk rock has been cut perpendicularly to make room for the chateau the kitchen which is a large one vast vaults and extensive cellars magnificently filled by the way with various other offices are all cut out of the rock with merely fronts of brick the house is large containing thirtyeight apartments the present dutchess has added a handsome saloon of fortyeight feet long and well proportioned with four fine tablets of the gobelin tapestry also a library well filled here i was shewn the inkstand that belonged to the famous louvois the minister of louis xiv known to be the identical one from which he signed the revocation of the edict of nantes and i suppose also the order to turenne to burn the palatinate this marquis de louvois was grandfather to the two dutchesses danville and destissac who inherited all his fortune as well as their own family one of the house of la rochefoucauld from which family i conceive and not from louvois they inherited their dispositions from the principal apartment there is a balcony that leads to the walks which serpentine up the mountain like all french seats there is a town and a great potager to remove before it would be     consonant with english ideas bissy the duc de penthievres is just the same before the chateau there is a gently falling vale with a little stream through it that might be made any thing of for lawning and watering exactly there in full front of the house they have placed a great kitchengarden with walls enough for a fortress the houses of the poor people here as on the loire in touraine are burrowed into the chalk rock and have a singular appearance here are tow streets of them one above another they are asserted to be wholesome warm in winter and cool in summer but others thought differently and that they were bad for the health of the inhabitants the duc de la rochefoucauld had the kindness to order the steward to give me all the information i wanted relative to the agriculture of the country and to speak to such persons as was necessary on points that he was in doubt about at an english noblemans there would have been three or four farmers asked to meet me who would have dined with the family amongst the ladies of the first rank i do not exaggerate when i say that i have had this at least an hundred times in the first houses of our islands it is however a thing that in the present state of manners in france would not be met with from calais to bayonne except by chance in the house of some great lord that had been much in england   and then not unless it was asked for the nobility in france have no more idea of practising agriculture and making it an object of conversation except on the mere theory as they would speak of a loom or a bowsprit than of any other object the most remote from their habits and pursuits i do not so much blame them for this neglect as i do that herd of visionary and absurd writers on agriculture who from their chambers in cities have with an impertinence almost incredible deluged france with nonsense and theory enough to disgust and ruin the whole nobility of the kingdom the   th part with regret from a society i had every reason to be pleased with—   miles the   th the  0 miles to rouen the same features     first view of rouen sudden and striking but the road doubling in order to turn more gently down the hill presents from an elbow the finest view of a town i have ever seen the whole city with all its churches and convents and its cathedral proudly rising in the midst fills the vale the river presents one reach crossed by the bridge and then dividing into two fine channels forms a large island covered with wood the rest of the vale of verdure and cultivation of gardens and habitations finish the scene in perfect unison with the great city that forms the capital feature wait on mons dambournay secretary of the society of agriculture who was absent when i was here before we had an interesting conversation on agriculture and on the means of encouraging it i found from this very ingenious gentleman that his plan of using madder green which many years ago made so much noise in the agricultural world is not practised at present any where but he continues to think it perfectly practicable in the evening to the play where madame cretal from paris acted nina and it proved the richest treat i have received from the french theatre she performed it with an inimitable expression with a tenderness a naivetè and an elegance withal that mastered every feeling of the heart against which the piece was written her expression is as delicious as her countenance is beautiful in her acting nothing overcharged but all kept within the simplicity of nature the house was crouded garlands of flowers and laurel were thrown on the stage and she was crowned by the other actors but modestly removed them from her head as often as they were placed there— 0 miles the   th take the road to dieppe meadows in the vale well watered and hay now making sleep at tote   —  ½ miles the   th to dieppe i was lucky enough to find the passageboat ready to sail go on board with my faithful surefooted blind friend i shall probably never ride her again but all my feelings prevent my selling her in france—without eyes she has carried me in safety above   00 miles and for the rest of her life she shall have no other     master than myself could i afford it this should be her last labour some ploughing however on my farm she will perform for me i dare say cheerfully landing at the neat newbuilt town of brighthelmston offers a much greater contrast to dieppe which is old and dirty than dover does to calais and in the castle inn i seemed for a while to be in fairy land but i paid for the enchantment the next day to lord sheffields a house i never go to but to receive equal pleasure and instruction i longed to make one for a few days in the evening library circle but i took it strangely into my head from one or two expressions merely accidental in the conversation coming after my want of letters to france that i had certainly lost a child in my absence and i hurried to london next morning where i had the pleasure of finding my alarm a false one letters enough had been written but all failed to bradfield— 0  miles          my two preceding journies had crossed the whole western half of france in various directions and the information i had received in making them had made me as much a master of the general husbandry the soil management and productions as could be expected without penetrating every corner and residing long in various stations a method of surveying such a kingdom as france that would demand several lives instead of years the eastern part of the kingdom remained the great mass of country formed by the triangle whose three points are paris strasbourg and moulins and the mountainous region se of the last town presented in the map an ample space which it would be necessary to pass before i could have such an idea of the kingdom as i had planned the acquisition i determined to make this third effort in order to accomplish a design which appeared more and more important the more i reflected on it and less likely to be executed by those whose powers are better adapted to the undertaking than mine the meeting of the states general of france also who were now assembled made it the more necessary to lose no time for in all human probability that assembly will be the epoch of a new constitution which will have new effects and for what i know attended with a new agriculture and to have the regal sun in such a kingdom both rise and set without the territory being known must of necessity be regretted by every man solicitous for real political knowledge the events of a century and half including the brilliant reign of louis xiv will for ever render the sources of the french power interesting to mankind and particularly that its state may be known previous to the establishment of an improved government as the comparison of the effects of the old and new system will be not a little curious in future june   to london at night il generosité d alessandro by tarchi in which signor marchesi exerted his   0 powers and sung a duet that made me for some moments forget all the sheep and pigs of bradfield i was however much better entertained after it by supping at my friend dr burneys and meeting miss burney how seldom it is that we can meet two characters at once in whom great celebrity deducts nothing from private amiableness how many dazzling ones that we have no desire to live with give me such as to great talents add the qualities that make us wish to shut up doors with them the

princes know their subjects the  th to dover in the machine with two merchants from stockholm a german and a swede we shall be companions to paris i am more likely to learn something useful from the conversation of swede and a german than from the chance medley englishmen of a stagecoach—   miles the  th passage to calais    hours for reflection in a vehicle that does not allow one power to reflect—   miles the  th a frenchman and his wife and a french     teacher from ireland full of foppery and affectation which her own nation did not give her were our company with a young goodnatured raw countryman of hers at whom she played off many airs and graces the man and his wife contrived to produce a pack of cards to banish they said lenuye of the journey but they contrived also to fleece the young fellow of five louis this is the first french diligence i have been in and shall be the last they are detestable sleep at abbevile—   miles these men and women girls and boys think themselves except the swede very cheerful because very noisy they have stunned me with singing my ears have been so tormented with french airs that i would almost as soon have rode the journey blindfold on an ass this is what the french call good spirits no truly chearful emotion in their bosoms silent or singing but for conversation they had none i lose all patience in such company heaven send me a blind mare rather than another diligence we were all this night as well as all the day on the road and reached paris at nine in the morning— 0  miles the  th to my friend lazowski to know where were the lodgings i had written him to hire me but my good dutchess destissac would not allow him to execute my commission i found an apartment in her hotel prepared for me paris is at present in such a ferment about the states general  now holding at versailles that conversation is absolutely absorbed by them not a word of any thing else talked of everything is considered and justly so as important in such a crisis of the fate of fourandtwenty millions of people it is now a serious contention whether the representatives are to be called the commons or tiers etat they call themselves steadily the former while the court and the great lords reject the term with a species of apprehension as if it involved a meaning not easily to be fathomed but this point is of little consequence compared with another that has kept the states for some time in inactivity the verification of their power separately or in common the nobility and the clergy demand     the former but the commons steadily refuse it the reason why a circumstance apparently of no great consequence is thus tenaciously regarded is that it may decide their sitting for the future in separate houses or in one  those who are warm for the interest of the people declare that it will be impossible to reform some of the grossest abuses in the state if the nobility by sitting in a separate chamber shall have a negative on the wishes of the people and that to give such a veto to the clergy would be still more preposterous if therefore by the verification of their powers in one chamber they shall once come together the popular party hope that there will remain no power afterwards to separate the nobility and clergy foresee the same result and will not therefore agree to it in this dilemma it is curious to remark the feelings of the moment it is not my business to write memoirs of what passes but i am intent to catch as well as i can the opinions of the day most prevalent while i remain at paris i shall see people of all descriptions from the coffeehouse politicians to the leaders in the states and the chief object of such rapid notes as i throw on paper will be to catch the ideas of the moment to compare them afterwards with the actual events that shall happen will afford amusement at least the most prominent feature that appears at present is that an idea of common interest and common danger does not seem to unite those who if not united may find themselves too weak to oppose the common danger that must arise from the people being sensible of a strength the result of their weakness the king court nobility clergy army and parliament are nearly in the same situation all these consider with equal dread the ideas of liberty now afloat except the first who for reasons obvious to those who know his character troubles himself little even with circumstances that concern his power the most intimately among the rest the feeling of danger is common and they would unite were there a head to render it easy in order to do without the states at all that the commons themselves look for some such hostile union as more than probable appears from an idea     which gains ground that they will find it necessary should the other two orders continue to unite with them in one chamber to declare themselves boldly the representatives of the kingdom at large calling on the nobility and clergy to take their places—and to enter upon deliberations of business without them should they refuse it all conversation at present is on this topic but opinions are more divided than i should have expected there seem to be many who hate the clergy so cordially that rather than permit them to form a distinct chamber would venture on a new system dangerous as it might prove the  th the business going forward at present in the pamphlet shops of paris is incredible i went to the palais royal to see what new things were published and to procure a catalogue of all every hour produces something new thirteen came out today sixteen yesterday and ninetytwo last week we think sometimes that debretts or stockdales shops at london are crouded but they are mere deserts compared to deseins and some others here in which one can scarcely squeeze from the door to the counter the price of printing two years ago was from    liv to  0 liv per sheet but now it is from  0 liv to  0 liv this spirit of reading political tracts they say spreads into the provinces so that all the presses of france are equally employed nineteentwentieths of these productions are in favour of liberty and commonly violent against the clergy and nobility i have today bespoke many of this description that have reputation but enquiring for such as had appeared on the other side of the question to my astonishment i find there are but two or three that have merit enough to be known is it not wonderful that while the press teems with the most levelling and even seditious principles that if put in execution would overturn the monarchy nothing in reply appears and not the least step is taken by the court to restrain this extreme licentiousness of publication it is easy to conceive the spirit that must thus be raised among the people but the coffeehouses in the palais royal present yet more singular and astonishing spectacles they are not only crouded within but other expectant crouds are at the doors and windows listening a gorge deployé to certain orators     who from chairs or tables harangue each his little audience the eagerness with which they are heard and the thunder of applause they receive for every sentiment of more than common hardiness or violence against the present government cannot easily be imagined i am all amazement at the ministry permitting such nests and hotbeds of sedition and revolt which disseminate amongst the people every hour principles that by and by must be opposed with vigour and therefore it seems little short of madness to allow the propagation at present the  0th every thing conspires to render the present period in france critical the want of bread is terrible accounts arrive every moment from the provinces of riots and disturbances and calling in the military to preserve the peace of the markets the prices reported are the same as i found at abbeville and amiens  f  ½ a pound for white bread and  ½f to  f for the common sort eaten by the poor these rates are beyond their faculties and occasion great misery at meudon the police that is to say the intendant ordered that no wheat should be sold on the market without the person taking at the same time an equal quantity of barley what a stupid and ridiculous regulation to lay obstacles on the supply in order to be better supplied and to shew the people the fears and apprehensions of government creating thereby an alarm and raising the price at the very moment they wish to sink it i have had some conversation on this topic with well informed persons who have assured me that the price is as usual much higher than the proportion of the crop demanded and there would have been no real scarcity if mr necker would have let the corntrade alone but his edicts of restriction which have been mere comments on his book on the legislation of corn have operated more to raise the price than all other causes together it appears plain to me that the violent friends of the commons are not displeased at the high price of corn which seconds their views greatly and makes any appeal to the common feeling of the people more easy and much more to their purpose than if the price was low three days past the chamber of the clergy contrived a cunning proposition it was to send a deputation to the commons proposing to name a     commission from the three orders to take into consideration the misery of the people and to deliberate on the means of lowering the price of bread this would have led to the deliberation by order and not by heads consequently must be rejected but unpopularly so from the situation of the people the commons were equally dextrous in their reply they prayed and conjured the clergy to join them in the common hall of the states to deliberate which was no sooner reported at paris than the clergy became doubly an object of hatred and it became a question with the politicians of the caffé de foy  whether it was not lawful for the commons to decree the application of their estates towards easing the distress of the people the   th i have been in much company all day and cannot but remark that there seem to be no settled ideas of the best means of forming a new constitution yesterday the abbé syeyes  made a motion in the house of commons to declare boldly to the privileged orders that if they will not join the commons the latter will proceed in the national business without them and the house decreed it with a small amendment this causes much conversation on what will be the consequence of such a proceeding and on the contrary on what may flow from the nobility and clergy continuing steadily to refuse to join the commons and should they so proceed to protest against all they decree and appeal to the king to dissolve the states and recal them in such a form as may be practicable for business in these most interesting discussions i find a general ignorance of the principles of government a strange and unaccountable appeal on one side to ideal and visionary rights of nature and on the other no settled plan that shall give security to the people for being in     future in a much better situation than hitherto a security absolutely necessary but the nobility with the principles of great lords that i converse with are most disgustingly tenacious of all old rights however hard they may bear on the people they will not hear of giving way in the least to the spirit of liberty beyond the point of paying equal landtaxes which they hold to be all that can with reason be demanded the popular party on the other hand seem to consider all liberty as depending on the privileged classes being lost and outvoted in the order of the commons at least for making the new constitution and when i urge the great probability that should they once unite there will remain no power of ever separating them and that in such case they will have a very questionable constitution perhaps a very bad one i am always told that the first object must be for the people to get the power of doing good and that it is no argument against such a conduct to urge that an ill use may be made of it but among such men the common idea is that any thing tending towards a separate order like our house of lords is absolutely inconsistent with liberty all which seems perfectly wild and unfounded the   th to the royal society of agriculture which meets at the hotel de ville and of which being an associé i voted and received a jetton which is a small medal given to the members every time they attend in order to induce them to mind the business of their institution it is the same at all royal academies c and amounts in a year to a considerable and illjudged expence for what good is to be expected from men who would go only to receive their jetton whatever the motive may be it seems well attended near thirty were present among them parmentier vicepresident cadet de vaux fourcroy tillet desmarets broussonet secretary and creté de palieul at whose farm i was two years ago and who is the only practical farmer in the society the secretary reads the titles of the papers presented and gives some little account of them but they are not read unless particularly interesting then memoirs are read by the members or reports of references and when they discuss or debate there is no order but all speak together as in a warm private conversation     the abbé reynal  has given them   00 liv   l  0s for a premium on some important subject and my opinion was asked what it should be given for give it i replied in some way for the introduction of turnips  but that they conceive to be an object of impossible attainment they have done so much and the government so much more and all in vain that they consider it as a hopeless object i did not tell them that all hitherto done has been absolute folly and that the right way to begin was to undo every thing done i am never present at any societies of agriculture either in france or england but i am much in doubt with myself whether when best conducted they do most good or mischief that is whether the benefits a national agriculture may by great chance owe to them are not more than counterbalanced by the harm they effect by turning the public attention to frivolous objects instead of important ones or dressing important ones in such a garb as to make them trifles the only society that could be really useful would be that which in the culture of a large farm should exhibit a perfect example of good husbandry for the use of such as would resort to it consequently one that should consist solely of practical men and then query whether many good cooks would not spoil a good dish the ideas of the public on the great business going on at versailles change daily and even hourly it now seems the opinion that the commons in their late violent vote have gone too far and that the union of the nobility clergy army parliament and king will be by far too many for them such an union is said to be in agitation and that the count dartois the queen and the party usually known by her name are taking steps to effect it against the moment when the proceedings of the commons shall make it necessary to act with unity and vigour the abolition of the     parliaments is common conversation among the popular leaders as a step essentially necessary because while they exist they are tribunals to which the court can have resort should they be inclined to take any step against the existence of the states those bodies are alarmed and see with deep regret that their refusal to register the royal edicts has created a power in the nation not only hostile but dangerous to their own existence it is now very well known and understood on all hands that should the king get rid of the states and govern on any tolerable principles all the edicts would be enregistered by all the parliaments in the dilemma and apprehension of the moment the people look very much to the duc doleans  as to a head but with palpable and general ideas of distrust and want of confidence they regret his character and lament that they cannot depend on him in any severe and difficult trial they conceive him to be without steadiness and that his greatest apprehension is to be exiled from the pleasures of paris and tell of many littlenesses he practiced before to be recalled from banishment they are however so totally without a head that they are contented to look to him as one and are highly pleased with what is every moment reported that he is determined to go at the head of a party of the nobility and verify their powers in common with the commons all agree that had he firmness in addition to his vast revenue of seven millions  0   0l and four more    000l in reversion after the death of his fatherinlaw the duc de penthievre 0 he might at the head of the popular cause do any thing the   th in the morning to the kings library   which     i had not seen when before at paris it is a vast apartment and as all the world knows nobly filled every thing is provided to accommodate those who wish to read or transcribe—of whom there were sixty or seventy present along the middle of the rooms are glass cases containing models of the instruments of many trades preserved for the benefit of posterity being made on the most exact scale of proportion among others the potter founder brickmaker chymist c c and lately added a very large one of the english garden most miserably imagined but with all this not a plough or an iota of agriculture yet a farm might be much easier represented than the garden they have attempted and with infinitely more use i have no doubt but there may arise many cases in which the preservation of instruments unaltered may be of considerable utility i think i see clearly that such a use would result in agriculture and if so why not in other arts these cases of models however have so much the air of childrens playhouses that i would not answer for my little girl if i had her here not crying for them at the dutchess of danvilles where meet the archbishop of aix   bishop of blois   prince de laon and duc and dutchess de la rochefoucauld the three last of my old bagnere de luchon acquaintance lord   and lady camelford lord eyre   c c all this day i hear nothing but anxiety of expectation for what the crisis in the states will produce the embarrassment of the moment is extreme every one agrees that there is no ministry the queen is closely connecting herself with the party of the princes with the count dartois at their head who are all so adverse to mons necker that every thing is in confusion but the king   0 who is personally the honestest man in the world has but one wish which is to do right yet being without those decisive parts that enable a man to foresee difficulties and to avoid them finds himself in a moment of such extreme perplexity that he knows not what council to take refuge in it is said that mons necker is alarmed for his power and anecdote reports things to his disadvantage which probably are not true—of his trimming—and attempting to connect himself to the abbé de vermont   reader to the queen and who has great influence in all affairs in which he chuses to interfere this is hardly credible as that party are known to be exceedingly adverse to mons necker and it is even said that as the count dartois madame de polignac   and a few others were but two days ago walking in the private garden of versailles they met madame necker and descended even to hissing if half this is true it is plain enough that this minister must speedily retire all who adhere to the antient constitution or rather government consider him as their mortal enemy they assert and truly that he came in under circumstances that would have enabled him to do every thing he pleased—he had king and kingdom at command—but that the errors he was guilty of for want of some settled plan have been the cause of all dilemmas experienced since they accuse him heavily of assembling the notables as a false step that did nothing but mischief and assert that his letting the king go to the statesgeneral before their powers were verified and the necessary steps taken to keep the orders separate after giving double the representation to the tiers to that of the other two orders was madness that he ought to have appointed commissaries to have received the verification before admittance they accuse him further of     having done all this through an excessive and insufferable vanity which gave him the idea of guiding the deliberation of the states by his knowledge and reputation the character of a man drawn by his enemies must necessarily be charged but these are his features here of which all parties recognize some truth however rejoiced they may be that error was a part of his constitution it is expressly asserted by m neckers   most intimate friends that he has acted with good faith and that he has been in principle a friend to the regal power as well as to an amelioration of the condition of the people the worst thing i know of him is his speech to the states on their assembling—a great opportunity but lost—no great leading or masterly views—no decision on circumstances in which the people ought to be relieved and new principles of government adopted—it is the speech you would expect from a bankers clerk of some ability concerning it there is an anecdote worth inserting he knew his voice would not enable him to go through the whole of it in so large a room and to so numerous an assembly and therefore he had spoken to mons de broussonet of the academy of sciences and secretary to the royal society of agriculture to be in readiness to read it for him he had been present at an annual general meeting of that society when mons broussonet had read a discourse with a powerful piercing voice that was heard distinctly to the greatest distance this gentleman attended him several times to take his instructions and be sure of understanding the interlineations that were made even after the speech was finished m broussonet was with him the evening before the assembly of the states at nine oclock and next day when he came to read it in public he found still more corrections and alterations which mons necker had made after quitting him they were chiefly in stile and shew how very solicitous he was in regard to the form and decoration of his matter the ideas in my opinion wanted this attention more than the stile mons broussonet himself told me this little anecdote this morning in the states     three cureés of poitou have joined themselves to the commons for the verification of their powers and were received with a kind of madness of applause and this evening at paris nothing else is talked of the nobles have been all day in debate without coming to any conclusion and have adjourned to monday the   th to the kings garden where mons thouin had the goodness to shew me some small experiments he has made on plants that promise greatly for the farmer particularly the lathyrus biennis   and the melilotus syberica  which now make an immense figure for forage both are biennial but will last three or four years if not seeded the achillæa syberica promises well and an astragalus he has promised me seeds the chinese hemp has perfected its seeds which it had not done before in france 0 the more i see of mons thouin the better i like him he is one of the most amiable men i know to the repository of the royal machines which mons vandermond shewed and explained to me with great readiness and politeness what struck me most was mons vaucussons machine for making a chain which i was told mr watt of birmingham admired very much at which my attendants seemed not displeased another for making the cogs indented in iron wheels there is a chaff cutter from an english original and a model of the nonsensical plough to go without horses there are the only once in agriculture many of very ingenious contrivance for winding silk c in the evening to the theatre francoise the     siege of calais by mons de belloy not a good but a popular performance it is now decided by the popular leaders that they will move tomorrow to declare all taxes illegal not raised by authority of the states general but to grant them immediately for a term either for two years or for the duration of the present session of the states this plan is highly approved at paris by all the friends of liberty and it is certainly a rational mode of proceeding founded on just principles and will involve the court in a great dilemma the   th this has been a rich day and such an one as ten years ago none could believe would ever arrive in france a very important debate being expected on what in our house of commons would be termed the state of the nation my friend mons lazowski and myself were at versailles by eight in the morning we went immediately to the hall of the states to secure good seats in the gallery we found some deputies already there and a pretty numerous audience collected the room is too large none but stentorian lungs or the finest clearest voices can be heard however the very size of the apartment which admits  000 people gave a dignity to the scene it was indeed an interesting one the spectacle of the representatives of twentyfive millions of people just emerging from the evils of  00 years of arbitrary power and rising to the blessings of a freer constitution assembled with open doors under the eye of the public was framed to call into animated feelings every latent spark every emotion of a liberal bosom to banish whatever ideas might intrude of their being a people too often hostile to my own country—and to dwell with pleasure on the glorious idea of happiness to a great nation—of felicity to millions yet unborn mons labbé syeyes opened the debate he is one of the most zealous sticklers for the popular cause carries his ideas not to a regulation of the present government which he thinks too bad to be regulated at all but wishes to see it absolutely overturned being in fact a violent republican this is the character he commonly bears and in his pamphlets he seems pretty much to justify such an idea he speaks ungracefully and uneloquently but logically or     rather reads so for he read his speech which was prepared his motion or rather string of motions was to declare themselves the representatives known and verified of the french nation admitting the right of all absent deputies the nobility and clergy to be received among them on the verification of their powers mons de mirabeau spoke without notes for near an hour with a warmth animation and eloquence that entitles him to the reputation of an undoubted orator he opposed the words known and verified in the proposition of abbé syeyes with great force of reasoning and proposed in lieu that they should declare themselves simply representatives du peuple francoise that no veto should exist against their resolves in any other assembly that all taxes are illegal but should be granted during the present session of the states and no longer that the debt of the kind should become the debt of the nation and be secured on funds accordingly mons de mirabeau was well heard and his proposition much applauded mons de mounier   a deputy from dauphine of great reputation and who has also published some pamphlets very well approved by the public moved a different resolution to declare themselves the legitimate representatives of the majority of the nation that they should vote by head and not by order and that they should never acknowledge any right in the representatives of the clergy or nobility to deliberate separately mons rabaud st etienne   a protestant from languedoc also an author     who has written in the present affairs and a man of considerable talents spoke also and made his proposition which was to declare themselves the representatives of the people to france to declare all taxes null to regrant them during the sitting of the states to verify and consolidate the debt and to vote a loan all which were well approved except the loan which was not at all to the feeling of the assembly this gentleman speaks clearly and with precision and only passages of his speech from notes mons bernarve   a very young man from grenoble spoke without notes with great warmth and animation some of his periods were so well rounded and so eloquently delivered that he met with much applause several members crying—bravo in regard to their general method of proceeding there are two circumstances in which they are very deficient the spectators in the galleries are allowed to interfere in the debates by clapping their hands and other noisy expressions of approbation this is grossly indecent it is also dangerous for if they are permitted to express approbation they are by parity of reason allowed expressions of dissent and they may hiss as well as clap which it is said they have sometimes done—this would be to overrule the debate and influence the deliberations another circumstance is the want of order among themselves more than once today there were an hundred members on their legs at a time and mons bailly   absolutely without     power to keep order this arises very much from complex motions being admitted to move a declaration relative to their title to their powers to taxes to a loan c c all in one proposition appears to english ears preposterous and certainly is so specific motions founded on single and simple propositions can alone produce order in debate for it is endless to have five hundred members declaring their reasons of assent to one part of a complex proposition and their dissent to another part a debating assembly should not proceed to any business whatever till they have settled the rules and orders of their proceedings which can only be done by taking those of other experienced assemblies confirming them as they find useful and altering such as require to be adapted to different circumstances the rules and orders of debate in the house of commons of england as i afterwards took the liberty of mentioning to mons rabaud st etienne might have been taken at once in mr hatsels   book and would have saved them at least a fourth of their time they adjourned for dinner dined ourselves with the due de liancourt at his apartments in the palace meeting twenty deputies—i sat by m rabaud st etienne and had much conversation with him they all speak with equal confidence on the fall of despotism the foresee that attempts very adverse to the spirit of liberty will be made but the spirit of the people is too much excited at present to be crushed any more finding that the question of todays debate cannot be decided today and that in all probability it will be unfinished even tomorrow as the number that will speak on it is very great return in the evening to paris the   th to dugny ten miles from paris again with mons de broussonet to wait on mons creté de palieul the only practical farmer in the society of agriculture mons broussonet than whom no man can be more eager for the honour and improvement of agriculture was desirous     that i should witness the practice and improvements of a gentleman who stands so high in the list of good french farmers called first on the brother of mons creté who at present has the poste and consequently   0 horses walked over his farm and the crops he shewed me of wheat and oats were on the whole very fine and some of them superior but i must confess i should have been better pleased with them if he had not had his stables so well filled with a view different from that of the farm and to look for a course of crops in france is vain he sows white corn twice thrice and even four times in succession at dinner c had much conversation with the two brothers and with some other neighbouring cultivators present on this point in which i recommended either turnips or cabbages according to the soil for breaking their rotations of white corn but every one of them except mons de broussonet was against me they demanded can we sow wheat after turnips and cabbages on a small portion you may with great success but the time of consuming the greater part of the crop renders it impossible that is sufficient if we cannot sow wheat after them they cannot be good in france this idea is everywhere nearly the same in that kingdom i then said that they might have half their land under wheat and yet be good farmers thus—  beans—  wheat—  tares  wheat—  clover—  wheat—this they approved better of but thought their own courses more profitable but the most interesting circumstance of their farms is the chicory chicorium intybus   i had the satisfaction to find that mons creté de palieul had as great an opinion of it as ever that his brother had adopted it that it was every flourishing on both their farms and on those of their neighbours also i never see this plant but i congratulate myself on having travelled for something more than to write in my closet and that the introduction of it in england would alone if no other result had flowed from one mans existence have been enough to shew that he did not live in vain of this excellent plant and mons cretés experiments on it more elsewhere     the   th all conversation on the motion of labbé syeyes being accepted yet that of the count de mirabeau better relished but his character is a dead weight upon him there is a suspicion that he has received  00000 liv from the queen a blind improbable report   for his conduct would in every probability be very different had any such transaction taken place but when a mans life has not passed free from gross errors to use the mildest language suspicions are ever ready to fix on him even when he is as free from what ought at the moment to give the imputation as any the most immaculate of their patriots this report brings out others from their lurking holes that he published at her instigation the anecdotes of the court of berlin and that the king of prussia knowing the causes of that publication circulated the memoirs of madame de la motte   all over germany such are the eternal tales suspicions and improbabilities for which paris has always been so famous one clearly however gathers from the complexion of conversation even on the most ridiculous topics provided of a public nature how far and for what reason confidence is lodged in certain men in every company of every rank you hear of the count de mirabeaus talents that he is one of the first pens of france and the first orator and yet that he could not carry from confidence six votes on any question in the states his writings however spread in paris and the provinces he published a journal of the states written for a few days with such force and such severity that it was silenced by an express edict of government this is attributed to mons necker who was treated in it with so little ceremony that his vanity was wounded to the quick the number of subscribers to the journal was such that i have heard the profit to mons mirabeau calculated at  0000 liv   00  a year since its suppression he publishes once or twice a week a small pamphlet to answer     the same purpose of giving an account of the debates or rather observations on them entitled       c lettre des comte de mirabeau a ses commettans which though violent sarcastic and severe the court has not thought proper to stop respecting i suppose its title it is a weak and miserable conduct to single out any particular publication for prohibition while the press groans with innumerable productions whose tendency is absolutely to overturn the present government to permit such pamphlets to be circulated all over the kingdom even by the posts and diligences in the hands of government is a blindness and folly from which there are no effects that may not be expected in the evening to the comic opera italian music italian words and italian performers and the applause so incessant and rapturous that the ears of the french must be changing apace what could jean jacques have said could he have been a witness to such a spectacle at paris the   th yesterday the commons decreed themselves in consequence of the abbé syeyess amended motion the title of assembleé nationale and also considering themselves then in activity the illegality of all taxes but granted them during the session declaring that they would without delay deliberate on the consolidating of the debt and on the relief of the misery of the people these steps give great spirits to the violent partizans of a new constitution but amongst more sober minds i see evidently an apprehension that it will prove a precipitate measure it is a violent step which may be taken hold of by the court and converted very much to the peoples disadvantage the reasoning of mons de mirabeau against it was forcible and just—si je voulois employer contre les autres motions les armes dont on se sert pour attaquer la mienne ne pourroisje pas dire a montour de quelque maniere que vousvous qualifiez que vous soyez les representans connus  verifies de la nation les représentans de    millions dhommes les representans de la majorité du peuple dussiezvous même vous appeller lassembleé nationalé les etats généraux empecherezvous les classes privilegieés de continuer des assembleés que sa majesté a reconnues les empecherezvous de prendre des deliberationes les empecherezvous de pretendre au   0 veto empecherezvous le roi de les recevoir des les reconnoitre de leur continuer les mêmes titres quil leur adonnès jusqua present enfin empecherezvous la nation dappeller le clergé la noblesse la noblesse to the royal society of agriculture where i gave my vote with the rest who were unanimous for electing general washington an honorary member this was a proposal of mons broussonet in consequence of my having assured him that the general was an excellent farmer and had corresponded with me on the subject abbé commeral   was present he gave a pamphlet of his on a new project the choux a fauché and a paper of the seed the   th accompanied mons de broussonet to dine with mons de parmentier at the hotel des invalids a president of the parliament a mons mailly brotherinlaw to the chancellor was there abbé commerel c c i remarked two years ago that mons parmentier is one of the best of men and beyond all question understands every circumstance of the boulangerie better than any other writer as his productions clearly manifest after dinner to the plains of sablon 0 to see the societys potatoes and preparation for turnips of which i shall only say that i wish my brethren to stick to their scientific farming and leave the practical to those who understand it what a sad thing for philosophical husbandmen that god almighty created such a thing as couch triticum repens the  0th news—news—every one stares at what every one might have expected   a message from the king to the presidents of the three orders that he should meet them on monday and under pretence of preparing the hall for the seance royale the french guards were placed with bayonets to prevent any of the deputies entering the room the circumstances of doing this illjudged act of violence have been as illadvised as the act itself mons bailly received no other notice of it than by a letter from the marquis de brézé and the deputies met at the door of the hall without knowing that it was shut thus the seeds of disgust were sown wantonly in the manner of     doing a thing which in itself was equally impalatable and unconstitutional the resolution taken on the spot was a noble and firm one it was to assemble instantly at the jeu de paume   and there the whole assembly took a solemn oath never to be dissolved but by their own consent and consider themselves and act as the national assembly let them be wherever violence or fortune might drive them and their expectations were so little favourable that expresses were sent off no nantes intimating that the national assembly might possibly find it necessary to take refuge in some distant city this message and placing guards at the hall of the states are the result of long and repeated councils held in the kings presence at marly where he has been shut up for some days seeing nobody and no person admitted even to the officers of the court without jealousy and circumspection the kings brothers have no seat in the council but the count dartois incessantly attends the resolutions conveys them to the queen and has long conferences with her when this news arrives at paris the palais royal was in a flame the coffeehouses pamphletshops corridores and gardens were crouded—alarm and apprehension sat in every eye—the reports that were circulated eagerly tending to shew the violent intentions of the court as if it was bent on the utter extirpation of the french nation except the party of the queen are perfectly incredible for their gross absurdity but nothing was so glaringly ridiculous but the mob swallowed it with undiscriminating faith it was however curious to remark among people of another description for i was in several parties after the news arrived that the balance of opinions was clearly that the national assembly as it called itself had gone too far—had been too precipitate—and too violent—had taken steps that the mass of the people would not support from which we may conclude that if the court having seen the tendency of their late proceedings shall pursue a firm and politic plan the popular cause will have little to boast the   st it is impossible to have any other employment at so critical a moment than going from house to     house demanding news and remarking the opinions and ideas most current the present moment is of all others perhaps that which is most pregnant with the future destiny of france the step the commons have taken of declaring themselves the national assembly independent of the other orders and of the king himself precluding a dissolution is in fact an assumption of all the authority in the kingdom they have at one stroke converted themselves into the long parliament of charles i it needs not the assistance of much penetration to see that if such a pretension and declaration are not done away king lords and clergy are deprived of their shares in the legislature of france so bold and apparently desperate a step full in the teeth of every other interest in the realm equally destructive to the royal authority by parliaments and the army can never be allowed if it is not opposed all other powers will lie in ruins around that of the common with what anxious expectation must one therefore wait to see if the crown will exert itself firmly on the occasion with such an attention to an improved system of liberty as is absolutely necessary to the moment all things considered that is the characters of those who are in possession of power no well digested system and steady execution are to be looked for in the evening to the play madame rocquere did the queen in hamlet it may easily be supposed how that play of shakespeare is cut in pieces it has however effect by her admirable acting the   nd to versailles at six in the morning to be ready for the seance royale breakfasting with the duc de liancourt we found that the king had put off going to the states till tomorrow morning a committee of council was held last night which sat till midnight at which were present mons and the count dartois for the first time an event considered as extraordinary and attributed to the influence of the queen the count dartois the determined enemy of mons neckers plans opposed his system and prevailed to have the seance put off to give time for a council in the kings presence today from the chateau we went to find out the deputies reports were various where they were assembling to the recolets where they had been but finding it incommodious they went to the     church of st louis   whither we followed them and were in time to see m bailly take the chair and read the kings letter putting off the seance till tomorrow the spectacle of this meeting was singular—the crowd that attended in and around the church was great—and the anxiety and suspense in every eye with the variety of expression that flowed from different views and different characters gave to the countenances of all the world an impression i had never witnessed before the only business of importance transacted but which lasted till three 0clock was receiving the oaths and the signatures of some deputies who had not taken them at the jeu de paume and the union of three bishops and   0 of the deputies of the clergy who came to verify their powers and were received by such applause with such clapping and shouting from all present that the church resounded apparently the inhabitants of versailles which having a population of  0000 people can afford a pretty numerous mob are to the last person in the interest of the commons remarkable as this town is absolutely fed by the palace and if the cause of the court is not popular here it is easy to suppose what it must be in all the rest of the kingdom dine with the duc de liancourt in the palace a large party of nobility and deputies of the commons the duc dorleans amongst them the bishop of rodez abbé syeyes and mons rabaud st etienne this was one of the most striking instances of the impression made on men of different ranks by great events in the streets and in the church of st louis such anxiety was in every face that the importance of the moment was written in the physiognomy and all the common forms and salutations of habitual civility lost in attention but amongst a class so much higher as those i dined with i was struck with the difference there were not in thirty persons five in whose countenances you could guess that any extraordinary event was going forward more of the conversation was indifferent than i should have expected had it all been so there would have been no room for wonder but observations were made of the greatest freedom and so received as to mark that there was not the least impropriety in     making them in such a case would not one have expected more energy of feeling and expression and more attention in conversation to the crisis that must in its nature fill every bosom yet they eat and drank and sat and walked loitered and smirked and smiled and chatted with that easy indifference that made me stare at their insipidity perhaps there is a certain nonchalance that is natural to people of fashion from long habit and which marks them from the vulgar who have a thousand asperities in the expression of their feelings that cannot be found on the polished surface of those whose manners are smoothed by society not worn by attrition such an observation would therefore in all common cases be unjust but i confess the present moment which is beyond all question the most critical the france has seen from the foundation of the monarchy since the council was assembled that must finally determine the kings conduct was such as might have accounted for a behaviour totally different the duc dorleans presence might do a little but not much his manner might do more for it was not without some disgust that i observed him several times playing off that small sort of wit and flippant readiness to titter which i suppose is a part of his character or it would not have appeared today from his manner he seemed not at all displeased the abbé syeyes has a remarkable physiognomy a quick rolling eye penetrating the ideas of other people but so cautiously reserved as to guard him own there is as much character in his air and manner as there is vacuity of it in the countenance of mons rabaud st etienne whose physiognomy however is far from doing him justice for he has undoubted talents it seems agreed that if in the council the count dartois carries his point mons necker the count de montmorin   and mons de st priest   will resign in which case mons neckers return to power and in triumph will inevitably     happen such a turn however must depend on events—evening—the count dartois plan accepted the king will declare it in his speech tomorrow mons necker demanded to resign but it was refused by the king all is now anxiety to know what the plan is the   rd the important day is over in the morning versailles seemed filled with troops the streets about ten oclock were lined with the french guards and some swiss regiments c the hall of the states was surrounded and centinels fixed in all the passages and at the doors and none but deputies admitted this military preparation was illjudged for it seemed admitting the impropriety and unpopularity of the intended measure and the expectation perhaps fear of popular commotions they pronounced before the king left the chateau that his plan was adverse to the people from the military parade with which it was ushered in the contrary however proved to be the fact the propositions are known to all the world the plan was a good one much was granted to the people in great and essential points and as it was granted before they had provided for these public necessities of finance which occasioned the states being called together and consequently left them at full power in future to procure for the people all that opportunity might present they apparently ought to accept them provided some security is given for the future meetings of the states without which all the rest would be insecure but as a little negociation may easily secure this i apprehend the deputies will accept them conditionally the use of soldier and some imprudencies in the manner of forcing the kings system relative to the interior constitution and assembling of the deputies as well as the illblood which had had time to brood for three days past in their minds prevented the commons from receiving the king with any expressions of applause the clergy and some of the nobility cried vive le roi but treble the number of mouths being silent took off all effect it seems they had previously determined to submit to no violence when the king was gone and the clergy and nobility retired the marquis the brézé waiting a moment to see if they meant to obey the kings express orders to retire also to another chamber prepared for     them and perceiving that no one moved addressed them—messieurs vous connoissez les intentions du roi a dead silence ensued and then it was that superior talents bore the sway that overpowers in critical moments all other considerations the eyes of the whole assembly were turned on the count de mirabeau who instantly replied to the marquis de brézé—oui monsieur nous avons entendu les intentions qu on a suggéreés au roi  vous qui ne sauriez être son organe auprès des etats généraux vous qui návez ici ni place ni voix ni droit de parler vous nêtes pas fait pour nous rapeller son discours cependant pour eviter toute equivoque  tout delai je vous declare que si lon vous a chargé de nous faire sortir dici vous devez demander des ordres pour employer la force car nous ne quitterons nos places que par la puissance de la baionette—on which there was a general cry of—tel est le væu del lassembleé they then immediately passed a confirmation of their preceding arrets and on the motion of the count de mirabeau a declaration that their persons individually and collectively were sacred and that all who made any attempts against them should be deemed infamous traitors to their country the   th the ferment at paris is beyond conception  0000 people have been all this day in the palais royal a full detail of yesterdays proceedings was brought this morning and read by many apparent leaders of little parties with comments to the people to my surprise the kings propositions are received with universal disgust he said nothing explicit on the periodical meeting of the states he declared all the old feudal rights to be retained as property these and the change in the balance of representation in the provincial assemblies are the articles that give the greatest offence but instead of looking to or hoping for further concessions on these points in order to make them more consonant to the general wishes the people seem with a sort of phrenzy to reject all idea of compromise and to insist on the necessity of the orders uniting that full power may consequently reside in the commons to effect what they call the regeneration of the kingdom a favourite term to which they affix no precise idea but add the indefinite explanation of the general reform of all abuses they are also full of suspicions at     m neckers offering to resign to which circumstance they seem to look more than to much more essential points it is plain to me from many conversations and harangues i have been witness to that the constant meetings at the palais royal which are carried to a degree of licentiousness and fury of liberty that is scarcely credible united with the innumerable inflammatory publications that have been hourly appearing since the assembly of the states have so heated the peoples expectations and given them the idea of such total changes that nothing the king or court could do would now satisfy them consequently it would be idleness itself to make concessions that are not steadily adhered to not only to be observed by the king but to be enforced on the people and good order at the same time restored but the stumblingblock to this and every plan that can be devised as the people know and declare in every corner is the situation of the finances which cannot possible be restored but by liberal grants of the states on one hand or by a bankruptcy on the other it is well known that this point has been warmly debated in the council mons necker has proved to them that a bankruptcy is inevitable if they break with the states before the finances are restored and the dread and terror of taking such a step which no minister would at present dare to venture on has been the great difficulty that opposed itself to the projects of the queen and the count dartois the measure they have taken is a middle one from which they hope to gain party among the people and render the deputies unpopular enough to get rid of them an expectation however in which they will infallibly be mistaken if on the side of the people it is urged that the vices of the old government make a new system necessary and that it can only be by the firmest measures that the people can be put in possession of the blessings of a free government it is to be replied on the other hand that the personal character of the king is a just foundation for relying that no measures of actual violence can be seriously feared that the state of the finances under any possible regimen whether of faith or bankruptcy must secure their existence at least for time sufficient to secure by negociation what may be hazarded     by violence that by driving things to extremities they risque an union between all the other orders of the state with the parliaments army and a great body even of the people who must disapprove of all extremities and when to this is added the possibility of involving the kingdom in a civil war now so familiarly talked of that it is upon the lips of all the world we must confess that the commons if they steadily refuse what is now held out to them put immense and certain benefits to the chance of fortune to that hazard which may make posterity curse instead of bless their memories as real patriots who had nothing in view but the happiness of their country such an incessant buzz of politics has been in my ears for some days past that i went tonight to the italian opera for relaxation nothing could be better calculated for that effect than the piece performed la villanella rapita by bianchi a delicious composition can it be believed that this people who so lately valued nothing at an opera but the dances and could hear nothing but a squall—now attend with feeling to italian melodies applaud with taste and rapture and this without the meretricious aid of a single dance the music of this piece is charming elegantly playful airy and pleasing with a duet between signora mandini and vigagnoni of the first lustre the former is a most fascinating singer—her voice nothing but her grace expression soul all strung to exquisite sensibility the   th the criticisms that are made on mons neckers conduct even by his friends if above the level of the people are severe it is positively asserted that abbé syeyes messrs mounier chapellier   bernave target   tourette rabaud and other leaders were almost on their     knees to him to insist peremptorily on his resignation being accepted as they were well convinced that his retreat would throw the queens party into infinitely greater difficulties and embarrassment than any other circumstance but his vanity prevailed over all their efforts to listen to the insidious persuasions of the queen who spoke to him in a style of asking a request that would keep the crown on the kings head at the same time that he yielded to do it contrary to the interest of the friends of liberty he courted the huzzas of the mob of versailles in a manner that did much mischief the ministers never go to and from the kings apartment on foot across the court which mons necker took this opportunity of doing though he himself had not done it in quiet times in order to court the flattery of being called the father of the people and moving with an immense and shouting multitude at his heels nearly at the time that the queen in an audience almost private spoke as above to m necker she received the deputation from the nobility with the dauphin in her hand whom she presented to them claiming of their honour the protection of her sons rights clearly implying that if the step the king had taken was not steadily asserted the monarchy would be lost and the nobility sunk while m neckers mob was heard through every apartment of the chateau the kind passed in his coach to marly through a dead and mournful silence—and that just after having given to his people and the cause of liberty more perhaps than ever any monarch had done before of such materials are all mobs made—so impossible is it to satisfy in moments like these when the heated imagination dresses every visionary project of the brain in the bewitching colours of liberty i feel great anxiety to know what will be the result of the deliberations of the commons after their first protests are over against the military violence which was so unjustifiably and injudiciously used had the kings proposition come after the supplies were granted and on any inferior question it would be quite another affair but to offer this before one shilling is granted or a step taken makes all the difference imaginable—evening—the conduct of the court is inexplicable and without plan while the late step was taken   0 to secure the orders sitting separate a great body of the clergy has been permitted to go to the commons and the duc dorleans at the head of fortyseven of the nobility has done the same and what is equally a proof of the unsteadiness of the court the commons are in the common hall of the states contrary to the express command of the king the fact is the seance royale was contrary to the personal feelings of the king and he was brought to it by the council with much difficulty and when it afterwards became as it did every hour to give new and effective orders to support the system then laid down it was necessary to have a new battle for every point and thus the scheme was only opened and not persisted in—this is the report and apparently authentic it is easy to see that that step had better on a thousand reasons not have been taken at all for all vigour and effect of government will be lost and the people be more assuming than ever yesterday at versailles the mob was violent—they insulted and even attacked all the clergy and nobility that are knows to be strenuous for preserving the separation of orders the bishop of beauvais   had a stone on his head that almost struck him down   the archbishop of paris had all his windows broken and forced to move his lodgings and the cardinal de la rochefoucauld hissed and hooted the confusion is so great that the court have only the troops to depend on and it is now said confidently that if an order is given to the french guards to fire on the people they will refuse obedience this astonishes all except those who know how they have been disgusted by the treatment conduct and manœuvres of the duc de chatelet their colonel so wretchedly have the affairs of the court in every particular been managed so miserable its choice of the men in office even such as are the most intimately connected with its safety and even existence what a     lesson to princes how they allow intriguing courtiers women and fools to interfere or assume the power that can be lodged with safety only in the hands of ability and experience it is asserted expressly that these mobs have been excited and instigated by the leaders of the commons and some of them paid by the duc dorleans the distraction of the ministry is extreme—at night to the theatre francoise the earl of essex 0 and the maison de moliere the   th every hour that passes seems to give the people fresh spirit the meetings at the palais royal are more numerous more violent and more assured and in the assembly of electors at paris for sending a deputation to the national assembly the language that was talked by all ranks of people was nothing less than a revolution in the government and the establishment of a free constitution what they mean by a free constitution is easily understood—a republic for the doctrine of the times runs every day more and more to that point yet they profess that the kingdom ought to be a monarchy too or at least that there ought to be a king in the streets one is stunned by the hawkers of seditious pamphlets and descriptions of pretended events that all tend to keep the people equally ignorant and alarmed the supineness and even stupidity of the court is without example the moment demands the greatest decision—and yesterday while it was actually a question whether he should be a doge of venice or a king of france the king went a hunting the spectacle the palais royal presented this night till eleven oclock and as we afterwards heard almost till morning is curious the croud was prodigious and fireworks of all sorts were played off and all the building was illuminated these were said to be rejoicings on account of the duc dorleans and the nobility joining the commons but united with the excessive freedom and even licentiousness of the orators who harangue the people with the general movement which before was threatening all this bustle and noise which will not leave them a moment tranquil has a prodigious effect in preparing them for whatever purposes the leaders of the     commons shall have in view consequently they are grossly and diametrically opposite to the interests of the court—but all these are blind and infatuated it is now understood by everybody that the kings offers in the seance royale are out of the question the moment the commons found a relaxation even in the trifling point of assembling in the great hall they disregarded all the rest and considered the whole as null and not to be taken notice of unless enforced in a manner of which there were no signs they lay it down for a maxim that they have a right to a great deal more than what the king touched on but that they will accept of nothing as the concession of power they will assume and secure all to themselves as matters of right many persons i talk with seem to think there is nothing extraordinary in this—but it appears that such pretensions are equally dangerous and inadmissible and lead directly to a civil war which would be the height of madness and folly when public liberty might certainly be secured without any such extremity if the commons are to assume everything as their right what power is there in the state short of arms to prevent them from assuming what is not their right they instigate the people to the most extensive expectations and if they are not gratified all must be confusion and even the king himself easy and lethargic as he is his indifference to power will by and by be seriously alarmed and then he will be ready to listen to measures to which he will not at present give a moments attention all this seems to point strongly to great confusion and even civil commotions and to make it apparent that to have accepted the kings offers and made them the foundation of future negociation would have been the wisest conduct and with that idea i shall leave paris the   th the whole business now seems over and the revolution complete the king has been frightened by the mobs into overturning his own act of the seance royale by writing to the presidents of the orders of the nobility and clergy requiring them to join the commons—full in the teeth of what he had ordained before it was represented to him that the want of bread was so great in every part of the kingdom that there was no extremity to which the people might not be driven that they were nearly starving     and consequently ready to listen to any suggestions and on the qui vive for all sorts of mischief that paris and versailles would inevitably by burnt and in a word that all sorts of misery and confusion would follow his adherence to he system announced in the seance royale his apprehensions got the better of the party who had for some days guided him and he was thus induced to take this step which is of such importance that he will never more know where to stop or what to refuse or rather he will find that in the future arrangement of the kingdom his situation will be very nearly that of charles i a spectator without power of the effective resolutions of a long parliament the joy this step occasioned was infinite the assembly uniting with the people all hurried to the chateau vive le roi might have been heard at marly the king and queen appeared in he balcony and were received with the loudest shouts of applause the leaders who governed these notions knew the value of the concession much better than those who made it i have today had conversation with many persons on this business and to my amazement there is an idea and even among many of the nobility that this union of the orders is only for the verification of their powers and for making the constitution which is a new term they have adopted and which they use as if a constitution was a pudding to be made by a receipt in vain i have asked where is the power that can separate them hereafter if the commons insist on remaining together which may be supposed as such an arrangement will leave all the power in their own hands and in vain i appeal to the evidence of the pamphlets written by the leaders of that assembly in which they hold the english constitution cheap because the people have not power enough owing to that of the crown and the house of lords the event now appears so clear as not to be difficult to predict all real power will be henceforward in the commons having so much inflamed the people in the exercise of it they will find themselves unable to use it temperately the court cannot sis to have their hands behind them the clergy nobility parliaments and army will when they find themselves all in danger of annihilation unite in their mutual defence but as such as union will demand     time they will find the people armed and a bloody civil war must be the result i have more than once declared this as my opinion but do not find that others unite in it   at all events however the tide now runs so strongly in favour of the people and the conduct of the court seems to be so weak divided and blind that little can happen that will not clearly date from the present moment vigour and abilities would have turned every thing on the side of the court for the great mass of nobility in the kingdom the higher clergy the parliaments and the army were with the crown but this desertion of the conduct that was necessary to secure its power at a moment so critical must lead to all sorts of pretensions at night the fireworks and illuminations and mob and noise at the palais royal increased the expence must be enormous and yet nobody knows with certainty from whence it arises shops there are however that for   f give as many squibs and serpents as would cost five livres there is no doubt of it being the duc dorleands money the people are thus kept in a continual ferment are for ever assembled and ready to be in the last degree of commotion whenever called on by the men they have confidence in lately a company of swiss would have crushed all this a regiment would do it now if led with firmness but let it last a fortnight longer and an army will be wanting—at the play mademoiselle contá in the misanthrope of moliere charmed me she is truly a great actress ease grace person beauty wit and soul mola did the misanthrope admirably i will not take leave of the theatre francois without once more giving it the preference to all i have ever seen i shall leave paris however truly rejoiced that the representatives of the people have it undoubtedly in their power so to improve the constitution of their country as to render all great abuses in future if not impossible at least exceedingly     difficult and consequently will establish to all useful purposes an undoubted political liberty and if they effect this it cannot be doubted but they will have a thousand opportunities to secure to their fellowsubjects the invaluable blessing of civil liberty also the state of the finances is such that the government may easily be kept virtually dependent on the states and their periodical existence absolutely secured such benefits will confer happiness on    millions of people a noble and animating idea that ought to fill the mind of every citizen of the world whatever be his country religion or pursuit i will not allow myself to believe for a moment that the representatives of the people can ever so far forget their duty to the french nation to humanity and their own fame as to suffer any inordinate and impracticable views—any visionary or theoretic systems—any frivolous ideas of speculative perfection much less any ambitious private views to impede their progress or turn aside their exertions from that security which is in their hands to place on the chance and hazard of public commotion and civil war the invaluable blessings which are certainly in their power i will not conceive it possible that men who have eternal fame within their grasp will place the rich inheritance on the cast of a die and losing the venture be damned among the worst and most profligate adventurers that ever disgraced humanity—the duc de liancourt having made an immense collection of pamphlets buying every thing that has a relation to the present period and among the rest the cahiers of all the districts and towns of france of the three orders it was a great object with me to read these as i was sure of finding in them a representation of the grievances of the three orders and an explanation of the improvements wished for in the government and administration these cahiers being instructions given to their deputies i have now gone through them all with a pen in hand to make extracts and shall therefore leave paris tomorrow the   th having provided myself a light french cabriolet for one horse or gig anglois and a horse i left paris taking leaving of my excellent friend mons lazowski whose anxiety for the fate of his country made me respect his character as much as i had reason to love it for     the thousand attentions i was in the daily habit of receiving from him my kind protectress the dutchess destissac had the goodness to make me promise that i would return to her hospitable hotel when i had finished the journey i was about to undertake of the place i dined at on my road to nangis   i forget the name but it is a posthouse on the left at a small distance out of the road it afforded me a bad room bare walls cold raw weather and no fire for when lighted it smoked too much to be borne—i was thoroughly out of humour i had passed some time at paris amidst the fire energy and animation of a great revolution add for those moments not filled by political events i had enjoyed the resources of liberal and instructing conversation the amusements of the first theatre in the world and the fascinating accents of mandini had by turns solaced and charmed the fleeting moments the change to inns and those french inns the ignorance of everybody of those events that were now passing and which so intimately concerned them the detestable circumstance of having no newspapers with a press much freer than the english altogether formed such a contrast that my heart sunk with depression at guignes   an itinerant dancingmaster was fiddling to some children of tradesmen to relieve my sadness i became a spectator of their innocent pleasures and with great magnificence i gave four   f pieces for a cake for the children which made them dance with fresh animation but my host the postmaster who is a surly pickpocket thought that if i was so rich he ought also to receive the benefit and made me pay   liv  0f for a miserable tough chicken a cutlet a sallad and a bottle of sorry wine such a dirty pilfering disposition did not tend to bring me into better humour— 0 miles the   th to nangis   the chateau of which belongs to the marquis de guerchy who last year at caen had kindly made me promise to spend a few days here a house almost full of company and some of them agreeable with the eagerness of mons de guerchy for farming and the     amiable naiveté of the marchioness whether in life politics or a farm were well calculated to bring me into tune again but i found myself in a circle of politicians with whom i could agree in hardly any other particular except the general one of cordially wishing that france might establish an indestructible system of liberty but for the means of doing it we were far as the poles asunder the chaplain of mons de guerchys regiment who has a cure here and i had known at caen mons labbé de—— was particularly strenuous for what is called the regeneration of the kingdom by which it is impossible from the explanation to understand any thing more than a theoretic perfection of government questionable in its origin hazardous in its progress and visionary in its end but always presenting itself under a most suspicious appearance to me because its advocates from the pamphlets of the leaders in the national assembly to the gentlemen who make its panegyric at present all affect to hold the constitution of england cheap in respect of liberty and as that is unquestionably and by their own admission the best the world ever saw they profess to appeal from practice to theory which in the arrangement of a question of science might be admitted though with caution but in establishing the complex interests of a great kingdom in securing freedom to    millions of people seems to me the very acmé of imprudence the very quintessence of insanity my argument was an appeal to the english constitution take it at once which is the business of a single vote by your possession of a real and equal representation of the people you have freed it from its only great objection in the remaining circumstances which are but of small importance improve it—but improve it cautiously for surely that ought to be touched with caution which has given from the moment of its establishment felicity to a great nation which has given greatness to a people designed by nature to be little and from being the humble copiers of every neighbour has rendered them in a single century rivals to the most successful nations in those decorative arts that embellish human life and the masters of the would in all those that contribute to its convenience i was commended for my attachment to what i thought was liberty but answered that the     king of france must have no veto on the will of the nation and that the army must be in the hands of the provinces width an hundred ideas equally impracticable and preposterous yet these are the sentiments which the court has done all in its power to spread through the kingdom for will posterity believe that while the press has swarmed with inflammatory productions that tend to prove the blessings of theoretical confusion and speculative licentiousness not one writer of talents has been employed to refute and confound the fashionable doctrines nor the least care taken to disseminate works of another complexion by the way when the court found that the states could not be assembled on the old plan and that great innovations must accordingly be made they ought to have taken the constitution of england for their model in the mode of assembling they should have thrown the clergy and nobles into one chamber with a throne for the king when present the commons should have assembled in another and each chamber have as in england verified their powers only to themselves and when the kind held a seance royale the commons should have been sent for to the bar of the lords where seats should have been provided and the king in the edict that constituted the states should have copied from england enough of the rules and orders of proceeding to prevent those preliminary discussions which in france lost two months and gave time for heated imaginations to work upon the people too much by taking such steps security would have been had that if changes or events unforeseen arose they would at least be met with in no such dangerous channel as another form and order of arrangement would permit—   miles the  0th my friends chateau is a considerable one and much better built than was common in england in the same period  00 years ago i believe however that this superiority was universal in france in all the arts they were i apprehend in the reign of henry iv far beyond us in towns houses streets roads and in short in every thing we have since thanks to liberty contrived to turn the tables on them like all the chateaus i have seen in france it stands close to the town indeed joining the end of it but the bank front by some very judicious plantations has     entirely the air of the country without the sight of any buildings there the present marquis has formed an english lawn with some agreeable winding walks of gravel and other decorations to skirt it in this lawn they are making hay and i have had the marquis mons labbé and some others on the stack to shew them how to make and tread it such hot politicians—it is well they did not set the stack on fire nangis is near enough to paris for the people to be politicians the perruquier that dressed me this morning tells me that every body is determined to pay no taxes should the national assembly so ordain but the soldiers will have something to say no sir never—be assured as we are that the french soldiers will never fire on the people but if they should it is better to be shot than starved he gave me a frightful account of the misery of the people whole families in the utmost distress those that work have a pay insufficient to feed them—and many that find it difficult to get work at all i enquired of mons de guerchy concerning this and found it true by order of the magistrates no person is allowed to buy more than two bushels of wheat at a market to prevent monopolizing it is clear to common sense that all such regulations have a direct tendency to increase the evil but it is in vain to reason with people whose ideas are immoveably fixed being here on a marketday i attended and saw the wheat sold out under this regulation with a party of dragoons drawn up before the marketcross to prevent violence the people quarrel with the bakers asserting the prices they demand for bread are beyond the proportion of wheat and proceeding from words to scuffling raise a riot and then run away with bread and wheat for nothing this has happened at nangis and many other markets the consequence was that neither farmers nor bakers would supply them till they were in danger of starving and when they did come prices under such circumstances must necessarily rise enormously which aggravated the mischief till troops became really necessary to give security to those who supplied the markets i have been sifting madame de guerchy on the expences of living our friend mons labbé joined the conversation and i collect from it that to live in a chateau like this with six menservants five maids   0 eight horses a garden and a regular table with company but never to go to paris might be done for  000 louis a year it would in england cost  000 the mode of living not the price of things is therefore cent per cent different—there are gentlemen noblesse that live in this country on   or  000 liv    l to   0l that keep two men two maids three horses and a cabriolet there are the same in england but they are fools among the neighbours that visited nangis was mons trudaine de montigny with his new and pretty wife to return the first visit of ceremony he has a fine chateau at montigny   and an estate of  000 louis a year this lady was mademoiselle de cour breton niece to madame calonne she was to have been married to the son of mons lamoignon   but much against her inclinations finding that common refusals had no avail she determined on a very uncommon one which was to go to church in obedience to her fathers orders and give a solemn no instead of a yea she was afterwards at dijon and never stirred but she was received with huzzas and acclamations by the people for refusing to be allied with la cour pleniere and her firmness was every where spoken of much to her advantage mons la luzerne was with them nephew to the french ambassador at london who in some broken english informed me that he had learned to box of mendoza   no one can say that he has travelled without making acquisitions has the duc dorleans learned to box also the news from paris is bad the commotions increase greatly and such an alarm has spread that the queen has called the marechal de broglio to the kings closet he has had several conferences the report is that     an army will be collected under him it may be now necessary but woeful management to have made it so july   to meaux   mons de guerchy was so kind as to accompany me to columiers   i had a letter to mons anveé dumeé pass rosoy 0 to maupertuis   through a country chearfully diversified by woods and scattered with villages and single farms spread every where as about nangis maupertuis seems to have been the creation of the marquis de montesquieu who has here a very fine chateau of his own building an extensive english garden made by the count dartois gardener with the town has all been of his own forming i viewed the garden with pleasure a proper advantage has been taken of a good command of a stream and many fine springs which rise in the grounds they are well conducted and the whole executed with taste in the kitchengarden which is on the slope of a hill one of these springs has been applied to excellent use it is made to wind in many doubles through the whole on a paved bed forming numerous basons for watering the garden and might with little trouble be conducted alternately to every bed as in spain this is a hint of real utility to all those who form gardens on the sides of hills for watering with pots and pails is a miserable as well as expensive succedaneum to this infinitely more effective method there is but one fault in this garden which is its being placed near the house where there should be nothing but lawn and scattered trees when viewed from the chateau the road might be hidden by a judicious use of planting the road to columiers is admirably formed of broken stone like gravel by the marquis of montesquieu partly at his own expence before i finish with this nobleman let me observe that he is commonly esteemed the second family in france and by some who admit his pretensions even the first he claims from the house of armagnac which was undoubtedly from charlemagne the present king of france when he signed some paper relative to this family     that seemed to admit the claim or refer to it remarked that it was declaring one of his subjects to be a better gentleman than himself but the house of montmorenci of which family are the dukes of luxembourg and laval and the prince of robec is generally admitted to be the first mons de montesquieu   is a deputy in the states one of the quarante in the french academy having written several pieces he is also chief minister to monsieur the kings brother an office that is worth  00000 liv a year     l dine with mons and madame dumeé conversation here as in every other town of the country seems more occupied by the dearness of wheat than on any other circumstance yesterday was marketday and a riot ensued of the populace in spite of the troops that were drawn up as usual to protect the corn it rises to    liv  l  d the septier or halfquarter—and some is sold yet higher to meaux—   miles the  d meaux was by no means in my direct road but its district brie   is so highly celebrated for fertility that it was an object not to omit i was provided with letters for m bernier a considerable farmer at chaucaunin near meaux and for m gibert of neuf moutier   a considerable cultivator whose father and himself had between them made a fortune by agriculture the former gentleman was not at home by the latter i was received with great hospitality and i found in him the strongest desire to give me every information i wished mons gibert has built a very handsome and commodious house with farmingoffices on the most ample and solid scale i was pleased to find his wealth which is not inconsiderable to have arisen all from the plough he did not forget to let me know that he was noble and exempted from all tailles and that he had the honours of the chace his father having purchased the charge of secretaire du roi but he very wisely lives en fermier his wife made ready the table     for dinner and his bailiff with the female domestic who has the charge of the dairy c both dined with us this is in a true farming style it has many conveniencies and looks like a plan of living which does not promise like the foppish modes of little gentlemen to run through a fortune from false shame and silly pretensions i can find no other fault with his system than having built a house enormously beyond his plan of living which can have no other effect than tempting some successor less prudent than himself into expences that might dissipate all his and his fathers savings in england that would certainly be the case the danger however is not equal in france the  th to chateau thiery   following the course of the marne the country is pleasantly varied and hilly enough to render it a constant picture were it inclosed thiery is beautifully situated on the same river i arrived there by five oclock and wished in a period so interesting to france and indeed to all europe to see a newspaper i asked for a coffeehouse not one in the town here are two parishes and some thousands of inhabitants and not a newspaper to be seen by a traveller even in a moment when all ought to be anxiety—what stupidity poverty and want of circulation this people hardly deserve to be free and should there be the least attempt with vigour to keep them otherwise it can hardly fail of succeeding to those who have been used to travel amidst the energetic and rapid circulation of wealth animation and intelligence of england it is not possible to describe in words adequate to ones feelings the dulness and stupidity of france i have been to day on one of their greatest roads within thirty miles of paris yet i have not seen one diligence and met but a single gentlemans carriage nor anything else on the road that looked like a gentleman— 0 miles the  th to mareuil   the marne about    rods broad flows in an arable vale to the right the country hilly and parts of it pleasant from one elevation there is a noble view of the river mareuil is the residence of mons le blanc of whose husbandry and improvements particularly     in sheep of spain and cows of switzerland mons de broussonet had spoken very advantageously this was the gentleman also on whom i depended for information relative to the famous vineyards of epernay that produce the fine champagne what therefore was my disappointment when his servants informed me that he was nine leagues off on business is madame le blanc at home no she is at dormans my complaining ejaculations were interrupted by the approach of a very pretty young lady whom i found to be mademoiselle le blanc her mama would return to dinner her papa at night and if i wished to see him i had better stay when persuasion takes so pleasing a form it is not easy to resist it there is a manner of doing every thing that either leaves it absolutely indifferent or that interests the unaffected good humour and simplicity of mademoiselle le blanc entertained me till the return of her mama and made me say to myself you will make a good farmers wife madame le blanc when she returned confirmed the native hospitality of her daughter assured me that her husband would be at home early in the morning as she must dispatch a messenger to him on other business in the evening we supped with mons b in the same village who married madame le blancs niece to pass mareuil it has the appearance of a small hamlet of inconsiderable farmers with the houses of their labourers and the sentiment that would arise in most bosoms would be that of picturing the banishment of being condemned to live in it who would think that there should be two gentlemens families in it and that in one i should find mademoiselle le blanc singing to her systrum and in the other madame b young and handsome performing on an excellent english piano forte compared notes of the expences of living in champagne and suffolk—agreed that  00 louis d or a year in champagne were as good an income as   0 in england which i believe true on his return mons le blanc in the most obliging manner satisfied all my enquiries and gave me letters to the most celebrated wine districts the  th to epernay   famous for its wines i had letters     for mons paretilaine one of the most considerable merchants who was so obliging as to enter with two other gentlemen into a minute disquisition of the produce and profit of the fine vineyards the hotel de rohan here is a very good inn where i solaced myself with a bottle of excellent vin mousseux for  0f and drank prosperity to true liberty in france—   miles the  th to ay   a village not far out of the road to rheims very famous for its wines i had a letter for mons lasnier who has  0000 bottles in his cellar but unfortunately he was not at home mons dorse has from  0 to  0000 all through this country the crop promises miserably not owing to the great frost but the cold weather of last week to rheims   through a forest of five miles on the crown of the hill which separates the narrow vale of epernay from the great plain of rheims the first view of that city from this hill just before the descent at the distance of about four miles is magnificent the cathedral makes a great figure and the church of st remy terminates the town proudly many times i have had such a view of towns in france but when you enter them all is a clutter of narrow crooked dark and dirty lanes at rheims it is very different the streets are almost all broad straight and well built equal in that respect to any i have seen and the inn the hotel de moulinet is so large and wellserved as not to check the emotions raised by agreeable objects by giving an impulse to contrary vibrations in the bosom of the traveller which at inns in france is too often the case at dinner they gave me also a bottle of excellent wine i suppose fixed air is good for the rheumatism i had some writhes of it before i entered champagne but the vin mousseux has absolutely banished it i had letters for mons cadot lainé a considerable manufacturer and the possessor of a large vineyard which he cultivates himself he was therefore a double fund to me he received me very politely answered my enquiries and shewed me his fabric the cathedral is large but does not strike me like that of amiens yet ornamented and many painted     windows they showed me the spot where the kings are crowned you enter and quit rheims through superb and elegant iron gates in such public decorations promenades c french towns are much beyond english ones stopped at sillery 0 to view the wine press of the marquis de sillery   he is the greatest winefarmer in all champagne having in his own hands   0 arpents till i got to sillery i knew not that it belonged to the husband of madame de genlis but i determined on hearing that it did to pluck up impudence enough to introduce myself to the marquis should he be at home i did not like to pass the door of madame de genlis without seeing her her writings are too celebrated la petite loge where i slept is bad enough of all conscience but such a reflection would have made it ten times worse the absence however of both mons and madame quieted both my wishes and anxieties he is in the states—   miles the  th to chalons   through a poor country and poor crops m de broussonet had given me a letter to mons sabbatier secretary to the academy of sciences but he was absent a regiment passing to paris an officer at the inn addressed me in english—he had learned he said in america damme—he had taken lord cornwallis damme—marechal broglio was appointed to command an army of  0000 men near paris—it was necessary—the tiers état were running mad—and wanted some wholesome correction—they want to establish a republic—absurd pray sir what did you fight for in america to establish a republic what was so good for the americans is it so bad for the french aye damme that is the way the english want to be revenged it is to be sure no bad opportunity can the english follow a better example he then made many enquiries about what we thought and said upon it in england and i may remark that almost every person i meet has the same idea—the english must be very well contented at our confusion they feel pretty pointedly what they deserve—  ½ miles     the  0th to ove   pass courtisseau   a small village with a great church and though a good stream not an idea of irrigation roofs of houses almost flat with projecting eaves resembling those from pau to bayonne at st menehoud   a dreadful tempest after a burning day with such a fall of rain that i could hardly get to mons iabbé michel to whom i had a letter when i found him the incessant flashes of lightning would allow me no conversation for all the females of the house came into the room for the abbés protection i suppose so i took leave the vin de champagne which is  0f at rheims is   liv at chalons and here and execrably bad so there is an end of my physic for the rheumatism—   miles the   th pass islets   a town or rather collection of dirt and dung of new features that seem to mark with the faces of the people a country not french—   miles the   th walking up a long hill to ease my mare i was joined by a poor woman who complained of the times and that it was a sad country demanding her reasons she said her husband had but a morsel of land one cow and a poor little horse yet they had a franchar    lb of wheat and three chickens to pay as a quitrent to one seigneur and four franchar of oats one chicken and  f to pay to another besides very heavy tailles and other taxes she had seven children and the cows milk helped to make the soup but why instead of a horse do not you keep another cow oh her husband could not carry his produce so well without a horse and asses are little used in the country it was said at present that something was to be done by some great folks for such poor ones but she did not know who nor how but god send us better car les tailles  les droits nous ecrasent—this woman at no great distance might     have been taken for sixty or seventy her figure was so bent and her face so furrowed and hardened by labour—but she said she was only twentyeight an englishman who has not travelled cannot imagine the figure made by infinitely the greater part of the countrywomen in france it speaks at the first sight hard and severe labour i am inclined to think that they work harder than the men and this united with the more miserable labour of bringing a new race of slaves into the world destroys absolutely all symmetry of person and every feminine appearance to what are we to attribute this difference in the manners of the lower people in the two kingdoms to government—   miles the   th leave marletour   at four in the morning the village herdsman was sounding his horn and it was droll to see every door vomiting out its hogs or sheep and some a few goats the flock collecting as it advances very poor sheep and the pigs with mathematical backs large segments of small circles they must have abundance of commons here but if i may judge by the report of the animals carcases dreadfully overstocked to metz   one of the strongest places in france pass three drawbridges but the command of water must give a strength equal to its works the common garrison is  0000 men but there are fewer at present waited on m de payen secretary of the academy of sciences he asked my plan which i explained he appointed me at four in the afternoon at the academy as there would be seance held and he promised to introduce me to some persons who could answer my enquiries i attended accordingly when i found the academy assembled at one of their weekly meetings mons payen introduced me to the members and before they proceeded to their business they had the goodness to sit in council on my enquiries and to resolve many of them in the almanach des trois evechés      this academy is said to have been instituted particularly for agriculture i turned to the list of their honorary members to see what attention they had paid to the men who in the present age     have advanced that art i found an englishman dom cowley of london who is dom cowley—dined at the table dhôte with seven officers out of whose mouths at this important moment in which conversation is as free as the press not one word issued for which i would give a straw nor a subject touched on of more importance than a coat or a puppy dog at table dhôtes of officers you have a voluble garniture of bawdry or nonsense at those of merchants a mournful and stupid silence take the mass of mankind and you have more good sense in half an hour in england than in half a year in france—government again—all—all—is government—   miles the   th   they have a cabinet literaire at metz something like that i described at nantes but not on so great a plan and they admit any person to read or go in and out for a day on paying  f to this i eagerly resorted and the news from paris both in the public prints and by the information of a gentleman i found to be interesting versailles and paris are surrounded by troops   000 men are assembled and  0000 more on the road large trains of artillery collected and all the preparations of war the assembling of such a number of troops has added to the scarcity of bread and the magazines that have been made for their support are not easily by the people distinguished from those they suspect of being collected by monopolists this has aggravated their evils almost to madness so that the confusion and tumult of the capital are extreme a gentleman of an excellent understanding and apparently of consideration from the attention paid him with whom i had some conversation on the subject lamented in the most pathetic terms the situation of his country he considers a civil war as impossible to be avoided there is not he added a doubt but the court finding it impossible to bring the national assembly to terms will get rid of them a bankruptcy at the same moment is inevitable the union of such confusion must be a civil war and it is now only by torrents of blood that we have any hope of establishing a freer constitution yet it must be established for the old government is rivetted to abuses that are insupportable  00 he agreed with me entirely that the propositions of the seance royale though certainly not sufficiently satisfactory yet were the ground for a negociation that would have secured by degrees all even that the sword can give us let it be as successful as it will the purse—the power of the purse is every thing skilfully managed with so necessitous a government as ours it would one after another have gained all we wished as to a war heaven knows the event and if we have success success itself may ruin us france may have a cromwell in its bosom as well as england metz is without exception the cheapest town i have been in the table dhôte is   f a head plenty of good wine included we were ten and had two courses and a dessert of ten dishes each and those courses plentiful the supper is the same i had mine of a pint of wine and a large plate of chaudiés 0 in my chamber for  0f a horse hay and corn   f and nothing for the apartment my expence was therefore   f a day or  s   ½d and with the table dhôte for supper would have been but   f or  s 0½d—in addition much civility and good attendance it is at the faisan why are the cheapest inns in france the best—the country to pondamousson   is all of bold feature—the river moselle which is considerable runs in the vale and the hills on either side are high not far from metz there are the remains of an ancient aqueduct for conducting the waters of a spring across the moselle there are many arches left on this side with the houses of poor people built between them at pontamousson mons pichon the subdelegué of the intendant to whom i had letters received me politely satisfied my enquiries which he was well able to do from his office and conducted me to see whatever was worth viewing in the town it does not contain much the école militaire for the sons of the poor nobility also the convent de premonte    0  which has a very fine library  0  feet long and    broad i was introduced to the abbot as a person who had some knowledge in agriculture—   miles the   th i went to nancy   with great expectation having heard it represented as the prettiest town in france i think on the whole it is not undeserving the character in point of building direction and breadth of streets—bourdeaux is far more magnificent bayonne and nantes are more lively but there is more equality in nancy it is almost all good and the public buildings are numerous the place royale and the adjoining area are superb letters from paris all confusion the ministry removed mons necker ordered to quit the kingdom without noise the effect on the people of nancy was considerable—i was with mons willemet when his letters arrived and for some time his house was full of enquirers all agreed that it was fatal news and that it would occasion great commotions what will be the result at nancy the answer was in effect the same from all i put this question to we are a provincial town we must wait to see what is done at paris but every thing is to be feared from the people because bread is so dear they are half starved and are consequently ready for commotion—this is the general feeling they are as nearly concerned as paris but they dare not stir they dare not even have an opinion of their own till they know what paris thinks so that if a starving populace were not in question no one would dream of moving this confirms what i have often heard remarked that the deficit would not have produced the revolution but in concurrence with the price of bread does not this shew the infinite consequence of great cities to the liberty of mankind without paris i question whether the present revolution which is fast working in france could possibly have had an origin it is not in the villages of syria or diarbekir that the grand seigneur meets with a murmur against his will  0  it is at constantinople that he is obliged to manage and mix caution even with despotism mr willemet who is demonstrator of botany shewed me the botanical garden but it is in a condition that speaks the want of better funds he introduced me to a mons durival who has written on the vine and gave me one of his treatises and two of his own on botanical subjects he also conducted me to mons labbé grandpére a gentleman curious in gardening who as soon as he knew that i was an englishman whimsically took it into his head to introduce me to a lady my countrywoman who hired he said the greatest part of his house i remonstrated against the impropriety of this but all in vain the abbé had never travelled and thought that if he were at the distance of england from france the french are not commonly good geographers he should be very glad to see a frenchman and that by parity of reasoning this lady must be the same to meet a countryman she never saw or heard of away he went and would not rest till i was conducted into her apartment it was the dowager lady douglas she was unaffected and good enough not to be offended at such a strange intrusion—she had been here but a few days had two fine daughters with her and a beautiful kamchatka dog she was much troubled with the intelligence her friends in the town had just given her that she would in all probability be forced to move again as the news of mons neckers removal and the new ministry being appointed would certainly occasion such dreadful tumults that a foreign family would probably find it equally dangerous and disagreeable—   miles the   th all the houses at nancy have tin eave troughs and pipes which render walking the streets much more easy and agreeable it is also an additional consumption which is politically useful both this place and luneville are lighted in the english manner instead of the lamps being strung across the streets as in other french towns before i quit nancy let me caution the unwary traveller if he is not a great lord with plenty of money that he does not know what to do with against the hotel dangleterre a bad dinner   liv and for the room as much more a pint of wine and a plate of chaudié  0f which at metz was  0f and  0  in addition i liked so little my treatment that i changed my quarters to the hotel de halle where at the table dhôte i had the company of some agreeable officers two good courses and a dessert for   f with a bottle of wine the chamber  0f for building however the hotel dangleterre is much superior and is the first inn in the evening to luneville the country about nancy is pleasing—   miles the   th luneville   being the residence of mons lazowski the father of my much esteemed friend who was advertised of my journey i waited on him in the morning he received me with not politeness only but hospitality—with a hospitality i began to think was not to be found on this side of the kingdom—from mareuil hither i had really been so unaccustomed to receive any attentions of that sort that it awakened me to a train of new feelings agreeable enough—an apartment was ready for me which i was pressed to occupy desired to dine and expected to stay some days he introduced me to his wife and family particularly to m labbé lazowski who with the most obliging alacrity undertook the office of shewing me whatever was worth seeing—we examined in a walk before dinner the establishment of the orphans well regulated and conducted luneville wants such establishments for it has no industry and therefore is very poor i was assured not less than half the population of the place or  0000 persons are poor luneville is cheap a cooks wages two three or four louis a maids that dresses hair three or four louis a common housemaid one louis a common footman or a house lad three louis rent of a good house sixteen or seventeen louis lodgings of four or five rooms some of them small nine louis after dinner wait on m vaux dit pompone an intimate acquaintance of my friends here mingled hospitality and politeness also received me and so much pressed to dine with him tomorrow that i should certainly have staid had it been merely for the pleasure of more conversation with a very sensible and cultivated man who though advanced in years has the talents and good humour to render his company  0  universally agreeable i was obliged to refuse it i was out of order all day yesterdays heat was followed after some lightning by a cold night and i laid without knowing it with the windows open and caught cold i suppose from the information of my bones i am acquainted with strangers as easily and quickly as any body a habit that much travelling can scarcely fail to give but to be ill among them would be enuyante demand too much attention and incroach on their humanity this induced me to refuse the obliging wishes of both the messrs lazowski mons pompone and also of a pretty and agreeable american lady i met at the house of the latter her history is singular and yet very natural she was miss blake of newyork what carried her to dominica i know not but the sun did not spoil her complexion a french officer mons tibalié on taking the island made her his captive and himself became her own fell in love and married her brought his prize to france and settled her in his native town of luneville the regiment of which he is major being quartered in a distant province she complained of seeing her husband not more than for six months in two years she has been four years at luneville and having the society of three children is reconciled to a scene of life new to her mons pompone who she assured me is one of the best men in the world has parties every day at his house not more to his own satisfaction than to her comfort—this gentleman is another instance as well as the major of attachment to the place of nativity he was born at luneville attended king stanislaus in some respectable office near his person has lived much at paris and with the great and had first ministers of state for his intimate friends but the love of the natale solum brought him back of luneville where he has lived beloved and respected for many years surrounded by an elegant collection of books amongst which the poets are not forgotten having himself no inconsiderable talents in transfusing agreeable sentiments into pleasing verses he has some couplets of his own composition under the portraits of his friends which are pretty and easy it would have given me much pleasure to have spent some days at luneville an agreeable opening was made for me in two houses where i should  0  have met with a friendly and agreeable reception but the misfortunes of travelling are sometimes the accidents that cross the moments prepared for enjoyment and at others the system of a journey inconsistent with the plans of destined pleasure the   th to haming   through an uninteresting country—   miles the   th to savern   in alsace the country to phalsbourg   a small fortified town on the frontiers is much the same to the eye as hitherto the women in alsace all wear straw hats as large as those worn in england they shelter the face and should secure some pretty country girls but i have seen none yet coming out of phalsbourg there are some hovels miserable enough yet have chimnies and windows but the inhabitants in the lowest poverty from that town to savern all a mountain of oak timber the descent steep and the road winding in savern i found myself to all appearance veritably in germany for two days past much tendency to a change but here not one person in an hundred has a word of french the rooms are warmed by stoves the kitchenhearth is three of four feet high and various other trifles shew that you are among another people looking at a map of france and reading histories of louis xiv never threw his conquest or seizure of alsace into the light which travelling into it did to cross a great range of mountains to enter a level plain inhabited by a people totally distinct and different from france with manners language ideas prejudices and habits all different made an impression of the injustice and ambition of such a conduct much more forcible than ever reading had done so much more powerful are things than words—   miles the  0th to strasbourg   through one of the richest scenes of soil and cultivation to be met with in france and rivalled only by flanders which however exceeds it i  0  arrived there at a critical moment which i thought would have broken my neck a detachment of horse with their trumpets on one side a party of infantry with their drums beating on the other and a great mob hallooing frightened my french mare and i could scarcely keep her from trampling on messrs the tiers etat on arriving at the inn hear the interesting news of the revolt of paris—the guardes francoises joining the people the little dependence on the rest of the troops the taking the bastile and the institution of the milice bourgeoise in a word of the absolute overthrow of the old government every thing being now decided and the kingdom absolutely in the hands of the assembly they have the power to make a new constitution such as they think proper and it will be a great spectacle for the world to view in this enlightened age the representatives of twentyfive millions of people sitting on the construction of a new and better order and fabric of liberty than europe has yet offered it will now be seen whether they will copy the constitution of england freed from its faults or attempt from theory to frame something absolutely speculative in the former case they will prove a blessing to their country in the latter they will probably involve it in inextricable confusions and civil wars perhaps not in the present period but certainly at some future one i hear nothing of their removing from versailles if they stay there under the controul of an armed mob they must make a government that will please the mob but they will i suppose be wise enough to move to some central town tours blois or orleans where their deliberations may be free but the parisian spirit of commotion spreads quickly it is here the troops that were near breaking my neck are employed to keep an eye on the people who shew signs of an intended revolt they have broken the windows of some magistrates that are no favourites and a great mob of them is at this moment assembled demanding clamourously to have meat at  f a pound they have a cry among them that will conduct them to good lengths—point dimpôt  vivent les etâts—waited on mons herman professor of natural history in the university here to whom i had letters he replied to some of my questions and introduced me for others to mons zimmer who having been in  0  some degree a practitioner had understanding enough of the subject to afford me some information that was valuable view the public buildings and cross the rhine passing for some little distance into germany but no new features to mark a change alsace is germany and the change great on descending the mountains the exterior of the cathedral is fine and the tower singularly light and beautiful it is well known to be one of the highest in europe commands a noble and rich plain through which the rhine from the number of its islands has the appearance of a chain of lakes rather than of a river—monument of marechal saxe c c i am puzzled about going to carlsrhue the residence of the margrave of baden it was an old intention to do it if ever i was within an hundred miles for there are some features in the reputation of that sovereign which made me wish to be there he fixed mr taylor of bifrons in kent whose husbandry i describe in my eastern tour on a large farm and the œconomistes in their writings speak much of an experiment he made in their physiocratical rubbish which however erroneous their principles might be marked much merit in the prince mons herman tells me also that he has sent a person into spain to purchase rams for the improvement of wool i wish he had fixed on somebody likely to understand a good ram which a professor of botany is not likely to do too well this botanist is the only person mons herman knows at carlsrhue and therefore can give me no letter thither and how can i go unknown to all the world to the residence of a sovereign prince for mr taylor has left him is a difficulty apparently insurmountable—  ½ miles the   st i have spent some time this morning at the cabinet literaire reading the gazettes and journals that give an account of the transactions at paris and i have had some conversation with several sensible and intelligent men on the present revolution the spirit of revolt is gone forth into various parts of the kingdom the price of bread has prepared the populace every where for all sorts of violence at lyons there have been commotions as furious as at paris and the same at a great many other places dauphiné is in arms and bretagne in absolute  0  rebellion the idea is that the people will from hunger be driven to revolt and when once they find any other means of subsistence than that of honest labour every thing will be to be feared of such consequence it is to a country and indeed to every country to have a good police of corn a police that shall by securing a high price to the farmer encourage his culture enough to secure the people at the same time from famine my anxiety about carlsrhue is now at an end the margrave is at spaw i shall not therefore think of going—night—i have been witness to a scene curious to a foreigner but dreadful to frenchmen that are considerate passing through the square of the hotel de ville the mob were breaking the windows with stones notwithstanding an officer and a detachment of horse was in the square perceiving that their numbers not only increased but that they grew bolder and bolder every moment i thought it worth staying to see what it would end in and clambered on to the roof of a row of low stalls opposite the building against which their malice was directed here i beheld the whole commodiously perceiving that the troops would not attack them except in words and menaces they grew more violent and furiously attempted to beat the door in pieces with iron crows placing ladders to the windows in about a quarter of an hour which gave time for the assembled magistrates to escape by a back door they burst all open and entered like a torrent with a universal shout of the spectators from that minute a shower of casements sashes shutters chairs tables sophas books papers pictures c rained incessantly from all the windows of the house which is seventy or eighty feet long and which was then succeeded by tiles skirting boards bannisters framework and every part of the building that force could detach the troops both horse and foot were quiet spectators they were at first too few to interpose and when they became more numerous the mischief was too far advanced to admit of any other conduct than guarding every avenue around permitting none to go to the scene of action but letting every one that pleased retire with his plunder guards being at the same time placed at the doors of the churches and all public buildings i was for two hours a spectator  0  at different places of the scene secure myself from the falling furniture but near enough to see a fine lad of about    crushed to death by something as he was handing plunder to a woman i suppose his mother from the horror pictured in her countenance i remarked several common soldiers with their white cockades among the plunderers and instigating the mob even in sight of the officers of the detachment there were amongst them people so decently dressed that i regarded them with no small surprize—they destroyed all the public archives the streets for some way around strewed with papers this has been a wanton mischief for it will be the ruin of many families unconnected with the magistrates the   d to schelestadt   at strasbourg and the country i passed the lower ranks of women wear their hair in a toupee in front and behind braided into a circular plait three inches thick and is most curiously contrived to convince one that they rarely pass a comb through it i could not but picture them as the nidus of living colonies that never approach me they are not burthened with too much beauty but i scratched my head from sensations of imaginary itching the moment you are out of a great town all in this country is german the inns have one common large room many tables and cloths ready spread where every company dines gentry at some and the poor at others cookery also german schnitz 0 is a dish of bacon and fried pears has the appearance of a mess for the devil but i was surprized on tasting to find it better than passable at schelestadt i had the pleasure of finding the count de la rochefoucauld whose regiment of champagne of which he is second major is quartered here no attentions could be kinder than what i received from him they were a renewal of the numerous ones i was in the habit of experiencing from his family and he introduced me to a good farmer from whom i had the intelligence i wanted—   miles the   d an agreeable quiet day with the count de la   0 rochefoucauld dine with the officers of the regiment the count de loumené the colonel nephew to the cardinal de loumené present sup at my friends lodgings an officer of infantry a dutch gentleman who has been much in the east indies and speaks english there this has been a refreshing day the society of well informed people liberal polite and communicative has been a contrast to the sombre stupidity of table dhôtes the   th to isenheim   by colmar   the country is in general a dead level with the voge mountains very near to the right those of suabia to the left and there is another range very distant that appears in the opening to the south the news at the table dhôte at colmar curious that the queen had a plot nearly on the point of execution to blow up the national assembly by a mine and to march the army instantly to massacre all paris a french officer present presumed but to doubt of the truth of it and was immediately overpowered with numbers of tongues a deputy had written it they had seen the letter and not a hesitation could be admitted i strenuously contended that it was folly and nonsense at the first blush a mere invention to render persons odious who for what i knew might deserve to be so but certainly not by such means if the angel gabriel had descended and taken a chair at table to convince them it would not have shaken their faith thus it is in revolutions one rascal writes and an hundred thousand fools believe—   miles the   th from isenheim the country changes from the dead flat to pleasant views and inequalities improving all the way to befort   but neither scattered houses nor inclosures great riots at befort—last night a body of mob and peasants demanded of the magistrates the arms in the magazine to the amount of three or four thousand stand being refused they grew riotous and threatened to set fire     to the town on which the gates were shut and today the regiment of bourgogne arrived for their protection mons necker passed here today in his way from basle to paris escorted by  0 bourgeois horsemen and through the town by the music of all the troops but the most brilliant period of his life is past from the moment of his reinstatement in power to the assembling of the states the fate of france and of the bourbons was then in his hands and whatever may be the result of the present confusions they will by posterity be attributed to his conduct since he had unquestionably the power of assembling the states in whatever form he pleased he might have had two chambers three or one he might have given what would unavoidably have slid into the constitution of england all was in his hands he had the greatest opportunity of political architecture that ever was in the power of man the great legislators of antiquity never possessed such a moment in my opinion he missed it completely and threw that to the chance of the winds and waves to which he might have given impulse direction and life i had letters to mons de bellonde commissaire de guerre i found him alone he asked me to sup saying he should have some persons to meet me who could give me information on my returning he introduced me to madame de bellonde and a circle of a dozen ladies with three or four young officers leaving the room himself to attend madame the princess of something who was on her flight to switzerland i wished the whole company very cordially at the devil for i saw at one glance what sort of information i should have there was a little coterie in one corner listening to an officers detail of leaving paris this gentleman further informed us that the count dartois and all the princes of the blood except monsieur and the duke dorleans the whole connection of polignac the marechal de broglio and an infinite number of the first nobility had fled the kingdom and were daily followed by others and lastly that the king queen and royal family were in a situation at versailles really dangerous and alarming without any dependence on the troops near them and in fact more like prisoners than free here is therefore a revolution effected by a sort of magic all powers in the     realm are destroyed but that of the commons and it now will remain to see what sort of architects they are at rebuilding an edifice in the place of that which has been thus marvellously tumbled in ruins supper being announced the company quitted the room and as i did not push myself forward i remained at the rear till i was very whimsically alone i was a little struck at the turn of the moment and did not advance when i found myself in such an extraordinary situation in order to see whether it would arrive at the point it did i then smiling took my hat and walked fairly out of the house i was however overtaken below but i talked of business—or pleasure—or of something or nothing—and hurried to the inn i should not have related this if it had not been at a moment that carried with it its apology the anxiety and distraction of the time must fill the head and occupy the attention of a gentleman—and as to ladies what can french ladies think of a man who travels for the plough—   miles the   th for twenty miles to lisle sur daube   the country nearly as before but after that to baume les dames   it is all mountainous and rock much wood and many pleasing scenes of the river flowing beneath the whole country is in the greatest agitation at one of the little towns i passed i was questioned for not having a cockade of the tiers etat they said it was ordained by the tiers and if i was not a seigneur i ought to obey but suppose i am a seigneur what then my friends—what then they replied sternly why be hanged for that most likely is what you deserve it was plain this was no moment for joking the boys and girls began to gather whose assembling has every where been the preliminaries of mischief and if i had not declared myself an englishman and ignorant of the ordinance i had not escaped very well i immediately bought a cockade but the hussey pinned it into my hat so loosely that before i got to lisle it blew into the river and i was again in the same danger my assertion of being english would not do i was a seigneur perhaps in disguise and without doubt a great rogue at this moment a priest came into the street with a letter     in his hand the people immediately collected around him and he then read aloud a detail from befort giving an account of m neckers passing with some general features of news from paris and assurances that the condition of the people would be improved when he had finished he exhorted them to abstain from all violence and assured them they must not indulge themselves with any ideas of impositions being abolished which he touched on as if he knew that they had got such notions when he retired they again surrounded me who had attended to the letter like others were very menacing in their manner and expressed many suspicions i did not like my situation at all especially on hearing one of them say that i ought to be secured till somebody would give an account of me i was on the steps of the inn and begged they would permit me a few words i assured them that i was an english traveller and to prove it i desired to explain to them a circumstance in english taxation which would be a satisfactory comment on what mons labbé had told them to the purport of which i could not agree he had asserted that the impositions must be paid as heretofore that the impositions must be paid was certain but not as heretofore as they might be paid as they were in england gentlemen we have a great number of taxes in england which you know nothing of in france but the tiers etat the poor do not pay them they are laid on the rich every window in a mans house pays but if he has no more than six windows he pays nothing a seigneur with a great estate pays the vingtiemes and tailles but the little proprietor of a garden pays nothing the rich for their horses their voitures and their servants and even for liberty to kill their own partridges but the poor farmer nothing of all this and what is more we have in england a tax paid by the rich for the relief of the poor hence the assertion of mons labbé that because taxes existed before they must exist again did not at all prove that they must be levied in the same manner our english method seemed much better there was not a word of this discourse they did not approve of they seemed to think that i might be an honest fellow which i confirmed by crying vive le tiers sans impositions when they gave me a bit of a huzza and     i had no more interruption from them my miserable french was pretty much on a par with their own patois i got however another cockade which i took care to have so fastened as to lose it no more i do not half like travelling in such an unquiet and fermenting moment one is not secure for an hour beforehand—   miles the   th to besançon   the country mountain rock and wood above the river some scenes are fine i had not arrived an hour before i saw a peasant pass the inn on horseback followed by an officer of the guard bourgeois of which there are   00 here and  00 under arms and his partycoloured detachment and these by some infantry and cavalry i asked why the militia took the pas of the kings troops for a very good reason they replied the troops would be attacked and knocked on the head but the populace will not resist the milice this peasant who is a rich proprietor applied for a guard to protect his house in a village where there is much plundering and burning the mischiefs which have been perpetrated in the country towards the mountains and vesoul   are numerous and shocking many chateaus have been burnt others plundered the seigneurs hunted down like wild beasts their wives and daughters ravished their papers and titles burnt and all their property destroyed and these abominations not inflicted on marked persons who were odious for their former conduct or principles but an indiscriminating blind rage for the love of plunder robbers galleyslaves and villains of all denominations have collected and instigated the peasants to commit all sorts of outrages some gentlemen at the table dhôte informed me that letters were received from the maconois the lyonois auvergne dauphné c and that similar commotions and mischiefs were perpetrating every where and that it was expected they would pervade the whole kingdom the backwardness of france is beyond credibility in every thing that pertains to intelligence from strasbourg hither i have not been able to see a newspaper here i asked for the cabinet literaire none the gazettes at the coffeehouse very easily replied but not so easily     found nothing but the gazette de france for which at this period a man of common sense would not give one sol to four other coffeehouses at some no paper at all not even the mercure at the caffé militaire the courier de leurope a fortnight old and well dressed people are now talking of the news of two or three weeks past and plainly by their discourse know nothing of what is passing the whole town of besançon has not been able to afford me a sight of the journal de paris nor of any paper that gives a detail of the transactions of the states yet it is the capital of a province large as half a dozen english counties and containing   000 souls—with strange to say the post coming in but three times a week at this eventful moment with no licence nor even the least restraint on the press not one paper established at paris for circulation in the provinces with the necessary steps taken by affiche or placard to inform the people in all the towns of its establishment for what the country knows to the contrary their deputies are in the bastile instead of the bastile being razed so the mob plunder burn and destroy in complete ignorance and yet with all these shades of darkness these clouds of tenebrity this universal mass of ignorance there are men every day in the states who are puffing themselves off for the first nation in europe the greatest people in the universe as if the political juntos or literary circle of a capital constituted a people instead of the universal illumination of knowledge acting by rapid intelligence on minds prepared by habitual energy of reasoning to receive combine and comprehend it that this dreadful ignorance of the mass of the people of the events that most intimately concern them is owing to the old government no one can doubt it is however curious to remark that if the nobility of other provinces are hunted like those of franche compté of which there is little reason to doubt that whole order of men undergo a proscription suffer like sheep without making the least effort to resist the attack this appears marvellous with a body that have an army of   0000 men in their hands for though a part of those troops would certainly disobey their leaders yet let it be remembered that out of the  0000 or possibly  00000 noblesse of france they might     if they had intelligence and union amongst themselves fill half the ranks of more than half the regiments of the kingdom with men who have fellowfeelings and fellowsufferings with themselves but no meetings no associations among them no union with military men no taking refuge in the ranks of regiments to defend or avenge their cause fortunately for france they fall without a struggle and die without a blow that universal circulation of intelligence which in england transmits the least vibration of feeling or alarm with electric sensibility from one end of the kingdom to another and which unites in bands of connection men of similar interests and situations has no existence in france thus it may be said perhaps with truth that the fall of the king court lords nobles army church and parliaments is owing to a want of intelligence being quickly circulated consequently is owing to the very effects of that thraldom in which they held the people it is therefore a retribution rather than a punishment—   miles the   th at the table dhôte last night a person gave an account of being stopped at salins for want of a passport and suffering the greatest inconveniencies i found it necessary therefore to demand one for myself and went accordingly to the bureau this was the house of a mons bellamy an attorney with whom the following dialogue ensued mais monsieur qui me repondra de vous est ce que personne vous connoit connoissez vous quelqun a besançon non personne mon dessein etoit daller a vesoul doü jaurois eu des lettres mais jai changê de route a cause de ces tumultes monsieur je ne vous connois pas  si vous etes inconnu a besançon vous ne pouvez avoir de passport mais voici mes lettres jen ai plusieurs pour dautres villes en france il y a en même dadressêes a vesoul e a arbois ouvrez  lisez les  vous trouverez que je ne suis pas inconnu ailleurs quoique je le sois a besançon nimporte je ne vous connois pas il ny a personne ici qui vous connoisse ainsi vous naurez point de passport je vous dit monsieur que ces lettres vous expliqueront il me faut des gens et non pas des lettres pour mexpliquer qui vous etes ces lettres ne me valent rien     cette façon dagir me parôit assez singuliere apparaement que vous la croyez tres honnête pour moi monsieur jen pense bien autrement eh monsieur je ne men soucie de ce que vous en pensez en verité voici ce qui sappelle avoir des manieres gracieuses envers un etranger cest la premiere fois que jai eu a faire avec ces messieurs du tiers etat  vous mavourez quil ny a rien ici qui puisse me donner une haute idée du caracteré de ces messieurs là monsieur cela mest fort égal je donnerai a mon retour en angleterre le detail de mon voyage au publique  assurement monsieur je noublirai pas denregistrer ce trait de vôtre politesse il vous fait tant dhonneure  à ceux pour qui vous agissez monsieur je regarde tout cela avec la derniere indifference my gentlemans manner was more offensive than his words he walked backward and forward among his parchments with an air veritablement dun commis de bureau—these passports are new things from new men in new power and show that they do not bear their new honours too meekly thus it is impossible for me without running my head against a wall to go see the salins   or to arbois   where i have a letter from m de broussonet but i must take my chance and get to dijon as fast as i can where the president de virly knows me having spent some days at bradfield unless indeed being a president and a nobleman he has got knocked on the head by the tiers état at night to the play miserable performers the theatre which has not been built many years is heavy the arch that parts the stage from the house is like the entrance of a cavern and the line of the amphitheatre that of a wounded eel i do not like the air and manners of the people here—and i would see besançon swallowed up by an earthquake before i would live in it the music and bawling and squeaking of lepreuve villageoise of gretry which is wretched had no power to put me in better humour i will not take leave of this place to which i never desire to come again without saying that they have a fine promenade and that mons arthaud the arpenteur     to whom i applied for information without any letter of recommendation was liberal and polite and answered my enquiries satisfactorily the   th to orechamp 0 the country is bold and rocky with fine woods and yet it is not agreeable it is like many men that have estimable points in their characters and yet we cannot love them poorly cultivated too coming out of st veté   a pretty riant landskip of the river doubling through the vale enlivened by a village and some scattered houses the most pleasing view i have seen in franche compté—   miles the  0th the mayor of dole   is made of as good stuff as the notary of besançon he would give no passport but as he accompanied his refusal with neither airs nor graces i let him pass to avoid the centinels i went round the town the country to auxonne   is chearful cross the saone at auxonne it is a fine river through a region of flat meadow of beautiful verdure commons of great herds of cattle vastly flooded and the haycocks underwater to dijon is a fine country but wants wood my passport demanded at the gate and as i had none two bourgeois musqueteers conducted me to the hotel de ville where i was questioned but finding that i was known at dijon they let me go to my inn out of luck mons de virly on whom i most depended for dijon is at bourbon les bains and mons de morveau   the celebrated chymist who i expected would have had letters for me had none and though he received me very politely when i was forced to announce myself as his brother in the royal society of london yet i felt very awkwardly however he desired to see me again next morning the tell me here     that the intendant is fled and that the prince of condé who is governor of burgundy is in germany they positively assert and with very little ceremony that they would both be hanged if they were to come here at present such ideas do not mark too much authority in the milice bourgeoise as they have been instituted to stop and prevent hanging and plundering they are too weak however to keep the peace the licence and spirit of depredation of which i heard so much in crossing franche compté has taken place but not equally in burgundy in this inn la ville de lyon there is at present a gentleman unfortunately a seigneur his wife family three servants an infant but a few months old who escaped from their flaming chateau half naked in the night all their property lost except the land itself and this family valued and esteemed by the neighbours with many virtues to command the love of the poor and no oppressions to provoke their enmity such abominable actions must bring the more detestation to the cause from being unnecessary the kingdom might have been settled in a real system of liberty without the regeneration of fire and sword plunder and bloodshed three hundred bourgeois mount guard every day at dijon armed but not paid at the expence of the town they have also six pieces of cannon the noblesse of the place as the only means of safety have joined them—so that there are croix de st louis in the ranks the palais des états here is a large and splendid building but not striking proportionably to the mass and expence the arms of the prince of condé are predominant and the great salon is called the salle a manger de prince a dijon artist has painted the battle of seniff   and the grande condé thrown from his horse and a cieling both well executed tomb of the duke of bourgogne   0  a picture by rubens at the chartreuse   they talk of the house of mons de montigny but his sister being in it not shown dijon on the whole is a handsome town   0 the streets though old built are wide and very well paved with the addition uncommon in france of trotoirs—   miles the   st waited on mons de morveau who has most fortunately for me received only this morning from mons de virly a recommendation of me with four letters from mons de broussonet but mons vaudrey of this place to whom one of them is addressed is absent we had some conversation on the interesting topic to all philosophers phlogiston mons de morveau contends vehemently for its nonexistence treats dr priestleys last publication as wide of the question and declared that he considers the controversy as much decided as the question of liberty is in france he shewed me part of the article air in the new encyclopædia by him to be published soon in which work he thinks he has beyond controversy established the truth of the doctrine of the french chymists of its nonexistence mons de morveau requested me to call on him in the evening to introduce me to a learned and agreeable lady and engaged me to dine with him tomorrow on leaving him i went to search coffeehouses but will it be credited that i could find but one in this capital of burgundy where i could read the newspapers—at a poor little one in the square i read a paper after waiting an hour to get it the people i have found every where desirous of reading newspapers but it is rare that they can gratify themselves and the general ignorance of what is passing may be collected from this that i found nobody at dijon had heard of the riot at the townhouse of strasbourg i described it to a gentleman and a party collected around me to hear it not one of them had heard a syllable of it yet it is nine days since it happened had it been nineteen i question whether they would more than have received the intelligence but though they are slow in knowing what has really happened they are very quick in hearing what is impossible to happen the current report at present to which all possible credit is given is that the queen has been convicted of a plot to poison the king and monsieur and give the regency to the count dartois to set fire to paris and blow up the palais royale by a mine—why do not the several parties in the     states cause papers to be printed that shall transmit only their own sentiments and opinions in order that to man in the nation arranged under the same standard of reasoning may want the facts that are necessary to govern his arguments and the conclusions that great talents have drawn from those facts the king has been advised to take several steps of authority against the states but none of his ministers have advised the establishment of journals and their speedy circulation that should undeceive the people in those points his enemies have misrepresented when numerous papers are published in opposition to each other the people take pains to sift into and examine the truth and that inquisitiveness alone—the very act of searching enlightens them they become informed and it is no longer easy to deceive them at the table dhôte only three myself and two noblemen driven from their estates as i conjecture by their conversation but they did not hint at any thing like their houses being burnt their description of the state of that part of the province they come from in the road from langres   to gray   is terrible the number of chateaus burnt not considerable but three in five plundered and the possessors driven out of the country and glad to save their lives one of these gentlemen is a very sensible well informed man he considers all rank and all the rights annexed to rank as destroyed in fact in france and that the leaders of the national assembly having no property or very little themselves are determined to attack that also and attempt an equal division the expectation is got among many of the people but whether it takes place or not he considers france as absolutely ruined that i replied was going too far for the destruction of rank did not imply ruin i call nothing ruin he replied but a general and confirmed civil war or dismemberment of the kingdom in my opinion both are inevitable not perhaps this year or the next or the year after that but whatever government is built on the foundation now laying in france cannot stand any rude shocks an unsuccessful or a successful war will equally destroy it—he spoke with great knowledge of historical     events and drew his political conclusions with much acumen i have met very few such men at table dhôtes it may be believed i did not forget m de morveaus appointment he was as good as his word madame picardet is as agreeable in conversation as she is learned in the closet a very pleasing unaffected woman she has translated scheele   from the german and a part of mr kirwan from the english a treasure to m de morveau for she is able and willing to converse with him on chymical subjects and on any others that tend either to instruct or please i accompanied them in their evenings promenade she told me that her brother mons de poule was a great farmer who had sowed large quantities of sainfoin which he used for fattening oxen she was sorry he was engaged so closely in the municipal business at present that he could not attend me to his farm august   dined with mons de morveau by appointment mons professeur chausée and mons picardet of the party it was a rich day to me the great and just reputation of mons de morveau for being not only the first chymist of france but one of the greatest that europe has to boast was alone sufficient to render his company interesting but to find such a man void of affectation free from those airs of superiority which are sometimes found in celebrated characters and that reserve which oftener throws a veil over their talents as well as conceals their deficiencies for which it is intended—was very pleasing mons de morveau is a lively conversable eloquent man who in any station of life would be sought as an agreeable companion even in this eventful moment of revolution the conversation turned almost entirely on chymical subjects i urged him as i have done dr priestley more than once and mons la voisier also to turn his enquiries a little to the application of his science to agriculture that there was a fine field for experiments in that line which could scarcely fail of making discoveries to which he assented but added that he had no time for such enquiries it is clear from his conversation that his views     are entirely occupied by the nonexistence of phlogiston except a little on the means of establishing and enforcing the new nomenclature while we were at dinner a proof of the new encyclopædia was brought him the chymical part of which work is printed at dijon for the convenience of mons de morveau i took the liberty of telling him that a man who can devise the experiments which shall be most conclusive in ascertaining the questions of a science and has talents to draw all the useful conclusions from them should be entirely employed in experiments and their register and if i was king or minister of france i would make that employment so profitable to him that he should do nothing else he laughed and asked me if i was such an advocate for working and such an enemy to writing what i thought of my friend dr priestly and he then explained to the two other gentlemen that great philosophers attention to metaphysics and polemic divinity if an hundred had been at table the sentiment would have been the same in every bosom mons m spoke however with great regard for the experimental talents of the doctor as indeed who in europe does not—i afterwards reflected on mons de morveaus not having time to make experiments that should apply chymistry to agriculture yet have plenty for writing in so voluminous a work as pankoucks 00 i lay it down as a maxim that no man can establish or support a reputation in any branch of experimental philosophy such as shall really descend to posterity otherwise than by experiment and that commonly the more a man works and the less he writes the better at least the more valuable will be his reputation the profit of writing has ruined that of many those who know mons de morveau will be very sure i am far enough from having him in my eye his situation in life puts it out of the question that compression of materials which is luminous that brevity which appropriates facts to their destined points are alike inconsistent with the principles that govern all compilations there are able and respectable     men now in every country for compiling experimenters of genius should range themselves in another class if i were a sovereign and capable consequently of rewarding merit the moment i heard of a man of real genius engaged in such a work i would give him double the booksellers price to let it alone and to employ himself in paths that did not admit a rival at every door there are who will think that this opinion comes oddly from one who has published so many books as i have but i hope it will be admitted to come naturally at least from one who is writing a work from which he does not expect to make one penny who therefore has stronger motives to brevity than temptations to prolixity the view of this great chymists laboratory will show that he is not idle—it consists of two large rooms admirably furnished indeed there are six or seven different furnaces of which macquers is the most powerful and such a variety and extent of apparatus as i have seen no where else with a furniture of specimens from the three kingdoms as looks truly like business there are little writing desks with pens and paper scattered every where and in his library also which is convenient he has a large course of eudiometrical experiments going on at present particularly with fontanas and voltas eudiometers he seems to think eudiometrical trials are to be depended on keeps his nitrous air in quart bottles stopped with common corks but reversed and that the air is always the same if made from the same materials a very simple and elegant method of ascertaining the proportion of vital air he explained to us by making the experiment putting a morsel of phosphorus into a glass retort confined by water or mercury and inflaming it by holding a bougie under it the diminution of air marks the quantity that was vital on the antiphlogistic doctrine after one extinction it will boil but not enflame he has a pair of scales made at paris which when loaded with  000 grains will turn with the twentieth part of one grain an air pump with glass barrels but one of them broken and repaired the count de bussons system of burning lens an absorber a respirator with vital air in a jar on one side and limewater in another and abundance of new and most ingenious inventions for facilitating     enquiries in the new philosophy of air there are so various and at the same time so well contrived to answer the purpose intended that this species of invention seems to be one very great and essential part of mons de morveaus merit i wish he would follow dr priestleys idea of publishing his tools it would add not inconsiderably to his great and well earned reputation and at the same time promote the enquiries he engages in amongst all other experimenters m de morveau had the goodness to accompany me in the afternoon in the academy of sciences they have a very handsome salon ornamented with the busts of dijon worthies of such eminent men as this city has produced bossuet—fevret—de brosses—de crebillon—pyron—bonhier—rameau—and lastly buffon 0  and some future traveller will doubtless see here that of a man inferior to none of those mons de morveau by whom i had now the honour of being conducted in the evening we repaired again to madame picardet and accompanied her promenade i was pleased in conversation on the present disturbances of france to hear mons de morveau remark that the outrages committed by the peasants arose from their defects of lumieres in dijon it had been publicly recommended to the curés to enlighten them somewhat politically in their sermons but all in vain not one would go out of the usual routine of his preaching—quere would not one newspaper enlighten them more than a score of priests i asked mons de morveau how far it was true that the chateaus had been plundered and burnt by the peasants alone or whether by those troops of brigands reported to be formidable he assured me that he has made strict enquiries to ascertain this matter and is of opinion that all the violences in this province that have come to his knowledge have been committed by the peasants only much has been reported of brigands but     nothing proved at besançon i heard of  00 but how could a troop of  00 banditti march through a country and leave their existence the least questionable—as ridiculous as mr bayess 0  army incog the  d to beaune 0  a range of hills to the right under vines and a flat plain to the left all open and too naked at the little insignificant town of nuys 0  forty men mount guard every day and a large corps at beaune i am provided with a passport from the mayor of dijon and a flaming cockade of the tiers état and therefore hope to avoid difficulties though the reports of the riots of the peasants are so formidable that it seems impossible to travel in safety stop at nuys for intelligence concerning the vineyards of this country so famous in france and indeed in all europe and examine the clos de veaugeau 0  of  00 journaux walled in and belonging to a convent of bernardine monks—when are we to find these fellows chusing badly the spots they appropriate shew what a righteous attention they give to things of the spirit—  miles the  d going out of chagnie 0  where i quitted the great lyons road pass by the canal of chaulais 0  which goes on very poorly it is a truly useful undertaking and therefore left undone had it been for boring cannon or coppering men of war it would have been finished long ago to montcenis 0  a disagreeable country singular in its features it is the seat of one mons weelkainsongs establishments for casting and boring cannon i have already described one near nantes the french say that this active englishman is brotherinlaw of dr priestly and therefore a friend of mankind and that he taught them to bore cannon in order to give liberty to america     the establishment is very considerable there are from  00 to  00 men employed besides colliers five steam engines are erected for giving the blasts and for boring and a new one building i conversed with an englishman who works in the glasshouse in the crystal branch there were once many but only two are left at present he complained of the country saying there was nothing good in it but wine and brandy of which things i question not but he makes a sufficient use—   miles the  th by a miserable country most of the way and through hideous roads to autun 0  the first seven or eight miles the agriculture quite contemptible from thence to autun all or nearly all inclosed and the first so for many miles from the hill before autun an immense view down on that town and the flat country of the bourbonnois for a great extent—view at autun the temple of janus—the walls—the cathedral—the abbey the reports here of brigands and burning and plundering are as numerous as before and when it was known in the inn that i came from burgundy and franche compté i had eight or ten people introducing themselves in order to ask for news the rumour of brigands here had got to   00 strong they were much surprized to find that i gave no credit to the existence of brigands as i was well persuaded that all the outrages that had been committed were the work of the peasants only for the sake of plundering this they had no conception of and quoted a list of chateaus burnt by them but on analysing these reports they plainly appeared to be ill founded— 0 miles the  th the extreme heat of yesterday made me feverish and this morning i waked with a sore throat i was inclined to waste a day here for the security of my health but we are all fools in trifling with the things most valuable to us loss of time and vain expence are always in the head of a man who travels as much en philosophe as i am forced to do to maison de bourgogne  0 i thought myself in a new world the road is not only excellent of gravel but the country is inclosed and wooded there are many gentle inequalities and several ponds that     decorate them the weather since the commencement of august has been clear bright and burning too hot to be perfectly agreeable in the middle of the day but no flies and therefore i do not regard the heat this circumstance may i think be fixed on as the test in languedoc c these heats as i have experienced are attended by myriads and consequently they are tormenting one had need be sick at this maison de bourgogne a healthy stomach would not be easily filled yet it is the posthouse in the evening to lusy    another miserable posthouse note through all burgundy the women wear flapped mens hats which have not nearly so good an effect as the straw ones of alsace—   miles the  th to escape the heat out at four in the morning to bourbon lancy    through the same country inclosed but villainously cultivated and all amazingly improveable if i had a large tract in this country i think i should not be long in making a fortune climate prices roads inclosures and every advantage except government all from autun to the loire is a noble field for improvement not by expensive operations of manuring and draining but merely by substituting crops adapted to the soil when i see such a country thus managed and in the hands of starving métayers instead of fat farmers    i know not how to pity the seigneurs great as their present sufferings are i met one of them to whom i opened my mind—he pretended to talk of agriculture finding i attended to it and assured me that he had abbé rozieres corps complete and he believed from his accounts that this country would not do for any thing but rye i asked him whether he or abbé roziere knew the right end of a plough he assured me that he was un homme de grand merite beaucoup dagriculteur cross the loire by a ferry it is here the same nasty scene of shingle as in touraine enter the bourbonnois the same inclosed country and a beautiful gravel road at chavanne le roi    mons joly the aubergiste     informed me of three domains farms to be sold adjoining almost to his house which is new well built i was for appropriating his inn at once in my imagination for a farmhouse and had got hard at work on turnips and clover when he told me that if i would walk behind his stable i might see at a small distance two of the houses he said the price would be about  0 or  0000 liv     l and would altogether make a noble farm if i were twenty years younger i should think seriously of such a speculation but there again is the folly and deficiency of life twenty years ago such a thing would for want of experience have been my ruin and now i have the experience i am too old for the undertaking—   miles the  th moulins    appears to be but a poor ill built town i went to the belle image but found it so bad that i left it and went to the lyon dor which is worse this capital of the bourbonnois and on the great post road to italy has not an inn equal to the little village of chavanne to read the papers i went to the coffeehouse of madame bourgeau the best in the town where i found near twenty tables set for company but as to a newspaper i might as well have demanded an elephant here is a feature of national backwardness ignorance stupidity and poverty in the capital of a great province the seat of an intendant at a moment like the present with a national assembly voting a revolution and not a newspaper to inform the people whether fayette mirabeau or louis xvi is on the throne companies at a coffeehouse numerous enough to fill twenty tables and curiosity not active enough to command one paper what impudence and folly—folly in the customers of such a house not to insist on half a dozen papers and all the journals of the assembly and impudence of the woman not to provide them could such a people as this ever have made a revolution or become free never in a thousand centuries the enlightened mob of paris amidst hundreds of papers and publications have   0 done the whole i demanded why they had no papers they are too dear but she made me pay   f for one dish of coffee with milk and a piece of butter about the size of a walnut it is a great pity there is not a camp of brigands in your coffeeroom madame bourgeau among the many letters for which i am indebted to mons broussonet few have proved more valuable then one i had for mons labbé de barut principal of the college of moulins who entered with intelligence and animation into the object of my journey and took every step that was possible to get me well informed he carried me to mons le count de grimau lieutenant general of the baillage and director of the society of agriculture at moulins who kept us to dinner he appears to be a man of considerable fortune of information and knowledge agreeable and polite he discoursed with me on the state of the bourbonnois and assured me that estates were rather given away than sold that the métayuers were so miserably poor it was impossible for them to cultivate well i started some observations on the modes which ought to be pursued but all conversation of that sort is time lost in france after dinner m grimau carried me to his villa at a small distance from the town which is very prettily situated commanding a view of the vale of the allier letters from paris which contain nothing but accounts truly alarming of the violences committed all over the kingdom and particularly at and in the neighbourhood of the capital m neckers return which it was expected would have calmed every thing has no effect at all and it is particularly noted in the national assembly that there is a violent party evidently bent on driving things to extremity me who from the violence and conflicts of the moment find themselves in a position and of an importance that results merely from public confusion will take effectual care to prevent the settlement order and peace which if established would be a mortal blow to their consequence they mount by the storm and would sink in a calm among other persons to whom mons labbé barut introduced me was the marquis de goutte chef descadre of the french fleet who was taken by admiral boscawen at louisbourg in      and carried to england where he learned english of which he yet retains something i     had mentioned to mons labbé barut that i had a commission from a person of fortune in england to look out for a good purchase in france and knowing that the marquis would sell one of his estates he mentioned it to him mons de goutte gave me such a description of it that i thought though my time was short that it would be very well worth bestowing one day to view it as it was no more than eight miles from moulins and proposing to take me to it the next day in his coach i readily consented at the time appointed i attended the marquis with m labbé barut to his chateau of riaux    which is in the midst of the estate he would sell on such terms that i never was more tempted to speculate i have very little doubt but that the person who gave me a commission to look out for a purchase is long since sickened of the scheme which was that of a residence for pleasure by the disturbances that have broken out here so that i should clearly have the refusal of it myself it would be upon the whole a more beneficial purchase than i had any conception of and confirms mons de grimaus assertion that estates are here rather given away than sold the chateau is large and very well built containing two good rooms either of which would hold a company of thirty people with three smaller ones on the ground floor on the second ten bedchambers and over them good garrets some of which are well fitted up all sorts of offices substantially erected and on a plan proportioned to a large family including barns new built for holding half the corn of the estate in the straw and granaries to contain it when threshed also a wine press and ample cellaring for keeping the produce of the vineyards in the most plentiful years the situation is on the side of an agreeable rising with views not extensive but pleasing and all the country round of the same features i have described being one of the finest provinces in france    adjoining the chateau is a field of five or six arpents well walled in about half of which is in culture as a garden and thoroughly planted with all sorts of fruits there are twelve ponds through a small stream runs     sufficient to turn two mills that let at  000 liv   l   s ayear the ponds supply the proprietors table amply with fine carp tench perch and eels and besides yield a regular revenue of  000 liv there are  0 arpents of vines that yield excellent white and red wine with houses for the vignerons woods more than sufficient to supply the chateau with fuel and lastly nine domains or farms let to metayers tenants at will at half produce producing in cash  0 00 liv    l  s  d consequently the gross produce farms mills and fish is    00 liv the quantity of land i conjecture from viewing it as well as from notes taken may be above  000 arpents or acres lying all contiguous and near the chateau the out goings for those takes paid by the landlord repairs garde de chasse gamekeeper for here are all the seigneural rights haute justice c steward expences on wine c amount to about   00 liv    l  0s it yields therefore net something more than  000 liv   0l a year the price asked is  00000 liv      l but for this price is given in the furniture complete of the chateau all the timber amounting by valuation of oak only to  0000 liv    0l and all the cattle on the estate viz  000 sheep  0 cows    oxen   mares and many hogs knowing as i did that i could on the security of this estate borrow the whole of the purchasemoney i withstood no trifling temptation when i turned my back on it the finest climate in france perhaps in europe a beautiful and healthy country excellent roads a navigation to paris wine game fish and every thing that ever appears on a table except the produce of the tropics a good house a fine garden ready markets for every sort of produce and above all the rest  000 acres of inclosed land capable in a very little time of being without expence quadrupled in its produce altogether formed a picture sufficient to tempt a man who had been fiveandtwenty years in the constant practice of husbandry adapted to this soil but the state of government—the possibility that the leaders of the paris democracy might in their wisdom abolish property as well as rank and that in buying an estate i might be purchasing my share in a civil war—deterred me from engaging at present and induced me only to request that the marquis would give me the refusal     of it before he sold it to any body else when i have to connect with a person for a purchase i shall wish to deal with such an one as the marquis de goutte he has a physiognomy that pleases me the ease and politeness of his nation is mixed with great probity and honour and is not rendered less amiable by an appearance of dignity that flows from an ancient and respectable family to me he seems a man in whom one might in any transaction place implicit confidence i could have spent a month in the bourbonnois looking at estates to be sold adjoining to that of m de gouttes is another of   0000 liv purchase ballain mons labbé barut having made an appointment with the proprietor carried me in the afternoon to see the chateau and a part of the lands all the country is the same soil and in the same management it consists of eight farms stocked with cattle and sheep by the landlords and here too the ponds yield a regular revenue income at present  0000 liv    l  0s a year price   0000 liv      l and  0000 liv for wood—twentyfive years purchase also near st poncin    another of  00000 liv    00l the woods of which   0 acres produce  000 liv a year  0 acres of vines the wine so good as to be sent to paris good land for wheat and much sown a modern chateau avec toutes les aisances c and i heard of many others i conjecture that one of the finest contiguous estates in europe might at present be laid together in the bourbonnois and i am further informed that there are at present  000 estates to be sold in france if things go on as they do at present it will not be a question of buying estates but kingdoms and france itself will be under the hammer i love a system of policy that inspires such confidence as to give a value to land and that renders men so comfortable on their estates as to make the sale of them the last of their ideas return to moulins— 0 miles the  0th took my leave of moulins where estates and farming have driven even maria and the poplar from my head and left me no room for the tombeau de montmorenci having paid extravagantly for the mud walls     cobweb tapestry and unsavoury scents of the lyon dor i turned my mare towards chateauneuf    on the road to auvergne the accompanyment of the river makes the country pleasant i found the inn full busy and bustling to st poncin— 0 miles the   th early to riom  0 in auvergne near that town the country is interesting a fine wooded vale to the left every where bounded by mountains and those nearer to the right of an interesting outline riom part of which is pretty enough is all volcanic it is built of lava from the quarries of volvic which are highly curious to a naturalist the level plain which i passed in going to clermont is the commencement of the famous limagne of auvergne asserted to be the most fertile of all france but that is an error i have seen richer land in both flanders and normandly this plain is as level as a still lake the mountains are all volcanic and consequently interesting—pass a scene of very fine irrigation that will strike a farming eye to mont ferrand    and after that to clermont riom ferrand and clermont and all built or rather perched on the tops of rocks clermont is in the midst of a most curious country all volcanic and is built and paved with lava much of it forms one of the worst built dirtiest and most stinking places i have met with there are many streets that can for blackness dirt and ill scents only be represented by narrow channels cut in a night dunghill the contention of nauseous savours with which the air is impregnated when brisk mountain gales do not ventilate these excrementitious lanes made me envy the nerves of the good people who for what i know may be happy in them it is the fair the town full and the table dhôtes crouded—   miles the   th clermont is partly free from the reproach i throw on moulins and besancon for there is a salle de lecture at a mons bovares a bookseller where i found several newspapers and journals but at the coffeehouse i     enquired for them in vain—they tell me also that the people here are great politicians and attend the arrival of the courier with impatience the consequence is there have been no riots the most ignorant will always be the readiest for mischief the great news just arrived from paris of the utter abolition of tythes feudal rights game warrens pidgeons c has been received with the greatest joy by the mass of the people and by all not immediately interested and some even of the latter approve highly of the declaration but i have had much conversation with two or three very sensible people who complain bitterly of the gross injustice and cruelty of any such declarations of what will be done but is not effected and regulated at the moment of declaring mons labbé arbre to whom mons de broussonets letter introduced me had the goodness not only to give me all the information relative to the curious country around clermont which particularly depended on his enquiries as a naturalist but also introduced me to mons chabrol as a gentleman who has attended much to agriculture and who answered my enquiries in that line with great readiness the   th at roya    near clermont a village in the volcanic mountains which are so curious and of late years so celebrated are some springs reported by philosophical travellers to be the finest and most abundant in france to view these objects and more still a very fine irrigation said also to be practised there i engaged a guide report when it speaks of things of which the reporter is ignorant is sure to magnify the irrigation is nothing more than a mountain side converted by water to some tolerable meadow but done coarsely and not well understood that in the vale between riom and ferrand far exceeds it the springs are curious and powerful they gush or rather burst from the rock in four or five streams each powerful enough to turn a mill into a cave a little below the village about half a league higher there are many others they are indeed so numerous that scarcely a projection of the rocks or hills is without them at the village i found that my guide instead of knowing the country perfectly     was in reality ignorant i therefore took a woman to conduct me to the springs higher up the mountain on my return she was arrested by a soldier of the guarde bourgeois for even this wretched village is not without its national militia for having without permission become the guide of a stranger she was conducted to a heap of stones they call the chateau they told me they had nothing to do with me but as to the woman she should be taught more prudence for the future as the poor devil was in jeopardy on my account i determined at once to accompany them for the chance of getting her cleared by attesting her innocence we were followed by a mob of all the village with the womans children crying bitterly for fear their mother should be imprisoned at the castle we waited some time and were then shewn into another apartment where the town committee was assembled the accusation was heard and it was wisely remarked by all that in such dangerous times as these when all the world knew that so great and powerful a person as the queen was conspiring against france in the most alarming manner for a woman to become the conductor of a stranger—and of a stranger who had been making so many suspicious enquiries as i had was a high offence it was immediately agreed that she ought to be imprisoned i assured them she was perfectly innocent for it was impossible that any guilty motive should be her inducement finding me curious to see the springs having viewed the lower ones and wanting a guide for seeing those higher in the mountains she offered herself that she certainly had no other than the industrious view of getting a few sols for her poor family they then turned their enquiries against myself that if i wanted to see springs only what induced me to ask a multitude of questions concerning the price value and product of the lands what had such enquiries to do with springs and volcanoes i told them that cultivating some land in england rendered such things interesting to me personally and lastly that if they would send to clermont they might know from several respectable persons the truth of all i asserted and therefore i hoped as it was the womans first indiscretion for i could not call it offence they would dismiss her this was refused at first     but assented to at last on my declaring that if they imprioned her they should do the same by me and answer it as they could they consented to let her go with a reprimand and i departed not marvelling for i have done with that at their ignorance in imagining that the queen should conspire so dangerously against their rocks and mountains i found my guide in the midst of the mob who had been very busy in putting as many questions about me as i had done about their crops—there were two opinions one party thought i was a commissaire come to ascertain the damage done by the hail the other that i was an agent of the queens who intended to blow the town up with a mine and send all that escaped to the gallies the care that must have been taken to render the character of that princess detested among the people is incredible and there seems every where to be no absurdities too gross nor circumstances too impossible for their faith in the evening to the theatre the optimist well acted before i leave clermont i must remark that i dined or supped five times at the table dhôte with from twenty to thirty merchants and tradesmen officers c and it is not easy for me to express the insignificance—the inanity of the conversation scarcely any politics at a moment when every bosom ought to beat with none but political sensations the ignorance or the stupidity of these people must be absolutely incredible not a week passes without their country abounding with events that are analyzed and debated by the carpenters and blacksmiths of england the abolition of tythes the destruction of the gabelle game made property and feudal rights destroyed are french topics that are translated into english within six days after they happen and their consequences combinations results and modifications become the disquisition and entertainment of the grocers chandlers drapers and shoemakers of all the towns of england yet the same people in france do not think them worth their conversation except in private why because conversation in private wants little knowledge but in public it demands more and therefore i suppose for i confess there are a thousand difficulties attending the solution they are silent but how many people and how many subjects on     which volubility is proportioned to ignorance account for the fact as you please but it is confirmed with me and admits no doubt the   th to izoire    the country all interesting from the number of conic mountains that rise in every quarter some are crowned with towns—on others are roman castles and the knowledge that the whole is the work of subterranean fire though in ages far too remote for any record to announce keeps the attention perpetually alive mons de larbre had given me a letter to mons brés doctor of physic at izoire i found him with all the townsmen collected at the hotel de ville to hear a newspaper read he conducted me to the upper end of the room and seated me by himself the subject of the paper was the suppression of the religious houses and the commutation of tythes i observed that the auditors among whom were some of the lower class were very attentive and the whole company seemed well pleased with whatever concerned the tythes and the monks mons brés who is a sensible and intelligent gentleman walked with me to his farm about half a league from the town on a soil of superior richness like all other farms this is in the hands of a métayer supped at his house afterwards in an agreeable company with much animated political conversation we discussed the news of the day they were inclined to approved of it very warmly but i contended that the national assembly did not proceed on any regular well digested system that they seemed to have a rage for pulling down but no taste for rebuilding that if they proceeded much further in such a plan destroying every thing but establishing nothing they would at last bring the kingdom into such confusion that they would even themselves be without power to restore it to peace and order and that such a situation would in its nature be on the brink of the precipice of bankruptcy and civil war—i ventured further to declare it as my idea that without an upper house they never could have either a good or a durable constitution we had a difference of opinion on these points but i was glad to find that there could be     a fair discussion—and that in a company of six or seven gentlemen two would venture to agree with a system so unfashionable as mine—   miles the   th the country continues interesting to brioud    on the tops of the mountains of auvergne are many old castles and towns and villages pass the river by a bridge of one great arch to the village of lampdes    at that place wait on mons greyffier de talairat avocat and subdelegué to whom i had a letter and who was so obliging as to answer with attention all my enquiries into the agriculture of the neighbourhood he enquired much after load bristol and was not the worst pleased with me when he heard i came from the same province in england we drank his lordships health in the strong white wine kept four years in the sun which lord bristol had much commended—   miles the   th early in the morning to avoid the heat which has rather incommoded me to fix    cross the river by a ford near the spot where a bridge is building and mount gradually into a country which continues interesting to a naturalist from its volcanic origin for all has been either overturned or formed by fire pass chomet    and descending remark a heap of basaltic columns by the road to the right they are small but regular sexagons poulaget    appears in the plain to the left stopped at st george    where i procured mules and a guide to see the basaltic columns at chilliac  0 which however are hardly striking enough to reward the trouble at fix i saw a field of fine clover a sight that i have not been regaled with i think since alsace i desired to know to whom it belonged to mons coffier doctor of medicine i went to his house to make enquiries which he was obliging enough to gratify and indulged me in a walk over the principal part of his farm he gave me a bottle   0 of excellent vin blanc mousseux made in auvergne i enquired of him the means of going to the mine of antimony four leagues from hence but he said the country was so enragè in that part and had lately been mischievous that he advised me by all means to give up the project this country from climate as well as pines must be very high i have been for three days past melted with heat but today though the sun is bright the heat has been quite moderate like an english summers day and i am assured that they never have it hotter but complain of the winters cold being very severe—and that the snow in the last was sixteen inches deep on the level the interesting circumstance of the whole is the volcanic origin all buildings and walls are of lava the roads are mended with lava pozzuolana and basalts and the face of the country everywhere exhibits the origin in subterranean fire the fertility however is not apparent without reflection the crops are not extraordinary and many bad but then the height is to be considered in no other country that i have seen are such great mountains as these cultivated so high here corn is seen every where even to their tops at heights where it is as usual to find rock wood or ling erica vulgaris—   miles the   th the whole range of the fifteen miles to le puy en velay is wonderfully interesting nature in the production of this country such as we see it at present must have proceeded by means not common elsewhere it is all in its form tempestuous as the billowy ocean mountain rises beyond mountain with endless variety not dark and dreary like those of equal height in other countries but spread with cultivation feeble indeed to the very tops some vales sunk among them of beautiful verdure please the eye towards le puy the scenery is still more striking from the addition of some of the most singular rocks any where to be seen the castle of polignac    from which the duke takes his title is built on a bold and enormous one it is almost of a cubical form and towers perpendicularly above the town which surrounds     it at its foot the family of polignac claim an origin of great antiquity they have pretensions that go back i forget whether to hector or achilles but i never found any one in conversation inclined to allow them more than being in the first class of french families which they undoubtedly are perhaps there is no where to be met with a castle more formed to give a local pride of family than this of polignac the man hardly exists that would not feel a certain vanity at having given his own name from remote antiquity to so singular and so commanding a rock but if with the name it belonged to me i would scarcely sell it for a province the building is of such antiquity and the situation so romantic that all the feudal ages pass in review in ones imagination by a sort of magic influence you recognize it for the residence of a lordly baron who in an age more distant and more respectable though perhaps equally barbarous was the patriot defender of his country against the invasion and tyranny of rome in every age since the horrible combustions of nature which produced it such a spot would be chosen for security and defence to have given ones name to a castle without any lofty preeminence or singularity of nature in the midst for instance of a rich plain is not equally flattering to our feelings all antiquity of family derives from ages of great barbarity when civil commotions and wars swept away and confounded the inhabitants of such situations the bretons of the plains of england were driven to bretagne but the same people in the mountains of wales stuck secure and remain there to this day about a gunshot from polignac is another rock no so large but equally remarkable and in the town of le puy another commanding on rises to a vast height with another more singular for its towerlike form—on the top of which st michaels church is built gypsum and limestone abound and the whole country is volcanic the very meadows are on lava everything in a word is either the product of fire or has been disturbed or tossed about by it at le puy fair day and a table dhôte with ignorance as usual many coffeehouses and even considerable ones but not a single newspaper to be found in any—   miles     the   th leaving puy the hill which the road mounts on the way to costerous    for four or five miles commands a view of the town far more picturesque than that of clermont the mountain covered with its conical town crowned by a vast rock with those of st michael and of polignac form a most singular scene the road is a noble one formed of lava and pozzuolana the adjacent declivities have a strong disposition to run into basaltic pentagons and sexagons the stones put up in the road by way of posts are parts of basaltic columns the inn at pradelles    kept by three sisters pichots is one of the worst i have met with in france contraction poverty dirt and darkness— 0 miles the   th to thuytz    pine woods abound there are saw mills and with ratchet wheels to bring the tree to the saw without the constant attention of a man as in the pyrenees a great improvement pass by a new and beautiful road along the side of immense mountains of granite chesnut trees spread in every quarter and cover with luxuriance of vegetation rocks apparently so naked that earth seems a stranger this beautiful tree is known to delight in volcanic soils and situations many are very large i measured one fifteen feet in circumference at five from the ground and many are nine to ten feet and fifty to sixty high at maisse    the fine road ends and then a rocky almost natural one for some miles but for half a mile before thuytz recover the new one again which is here equal to the finest to be seen formed of volcanic materials forty feet broad without the least stone a firm and naturally level cemented surface they tell me that   00 toises of it or about  ½ miles cost   0000 liv    0l it conducts according to custom to a miserable inn but with a large stable and in every respect mons grenadier excels the demoiselles pichots here mulberries first appear and with them flies for this is the first day i have been incommoded at thuytz i had an object which i suppose would demand a whole day it is within four hours ride of the montagne de la coupe au colet d aisa    of which     m faujas de stfond has given a plate in his researches sur les volcans eteints that shews it to be a remarkable object i began to make enquiries and arrangements for having a mule and a guide to go thither the next morning the man and his wife attended me at dinner and did not seem from the difficulties they raised at every moment to approve my plan having asked them some questions about the price of provisions and other things i suppose they regarded me with suspicious eyes and thought that i had no good intentions i desired however to have the mule—some difficulties were made—i must have two mules—very well get me two then returning a man was not to be bad with fresh expressions of surprise that i should be eager to see mountains that did not concern me after raising fresh difficulties to everything i said they at last plainly told me that i should have neither mule nor man and this with an air that evidently made the case hopeless about an hour after i received a polite message from the marquis deblou seigneur of the parish who hearing that an inquisitive englishman was at the inn enquiring after volcanoes proposed the pleasure of taking a walk with me i accepted the offer with alacrity and going directly towards his house met him in the road i explained to him my motives and my difficulties he said the people had got some absurd suspicions of me from my questions and that the present time was so dangerous and critical to all travellers that he would advise me by no means to think of any such excursions from the great road unless i found much readiness in the people to conduct me that at any other moment than the present he should be happy to do it himself but that at present it was impossible for any person to be too cautious there was no resisting this reasoning and yet to lose the most curious volcanic remains in the country for the crater of the mountain is as distinct in the print of mons de st fond as if the lava was now running from it was a mortifying circumstance the marquis then shewed me his garden and his chateau amidst the mountains behind it is that of     gravene    which is an extinguished volcano likewise but the crater not discernible without difficulty in conversation with him and another gentleman on agriculture particularly the produce of mulberries they mentioned a small piece of land that produced by silk only   0 live  l  s a year and being contiguous to the road we walked to it appearing very small for such a produce i stepped it to ascertain the contents and minuted them in my pocketbook soon after growing dark i took my leave of the gentlemen and retired to my inn what i had done had more witnesses than i dreamt of for at eleven o clock at night a full hour after i had been asleep the commander of a file of twenty milice bourgeois with their musquets or swords or sabres or pikes entered my chamber surrounded my bed and demanded my passport a dialogue ensued too long to minute i was forced first to give them my passport and that not satisfying them my papers they told me that i was undoubtedly a conspirator with the queen the count d artois and the count dentragues who has property here who had employed me as an arpenteur to measure their fields in order to double their taxes my papers being in english saved me they had taken it into their heads that i was not an englishman—only a pretended one for they speak such a jargon themselves that their ears were not good enough to discover by my language that i was an undoubted foreigner their finding no maps or plans nor anything that they could convert by supposition to a cadastre of their parish had its effect as i could see by their manner for they conversed entirely in patois perceiving however that they were not satisfied and talked much of the count dentragues i opened a bundle of letters that were sealed—these gentlemen are my letters of recommendation to various cities of france and italy open which you please and you will find for they are written in french that i am an honest englishman and not the rogue you take me for on this they held a fresh consultation and debate which ended in my favour they refused to open the letters prepared to leave me saying that my numerous questions about lands and     measuring a field while i pretended to come after volcanoes had raise great suspicions which they observed were natural at a time when it was known to a certainty that the queen the count dartois and the count dentragues were in a conspiracy against the vivarais and thus to my entire satisfaction they wished me good night and left me to the bugs which swarmed in the bed like flies in a honeypot i had a narrow escape—it would have been a delicate situation to have been kept prisoner probably in some common gaol or if not guarded at my own expence while they sent a courier to paris for orders and me to pay the piper— 0 miles the  0th the same imposing mountain features continue to villeneuve de berg    the road for half a mile leads under an immense mass of basaltic lava run into configurations of various forms and resting on regular columns this vast range bulges in the center into a sort of promontory the height form and figures and the decisive volcanic character the whole mass has taken render it a most interesting spectacle to the learned and unlearned eye just before aubenas    mistaking the road which is not half finished i had to turn it was on the slope of the declivity and very rare that any wall or defence is found against the precipices my french mare has an ill talent of backing too freely when she begins unfortunately she exercised it at a moment of imminent danger and backed the chaise me and herself down the precipice by great good luck there was at the spot a sort of shelf of rock that made the immediate fall not more than five feet direct i leaped out of the chaise in a moment and fell unhurt the chaise was overthrown and the mare on her side entangled in the harness which kept the carriage from tumbling down a precipice of sixty feet fortunately she lay quietly for had she struggled both must have fallen i called some limeburners to my assistance who were with great difficulty brought to submit to directions and not each pursue his own idea to the certain precipitation of both mare and chaise we extricated     her unhurt secured the chaise and then with still greater difficulty regained the road with both this was by far the narrowest escape i have had a blessed country for a broken limb—confinement for six weeks or two months at the cheval blanc at aubenas an inn that would have been purgatory to one of my hogs—alone—without relation friend or servant and not one person in sixty that speaks french—thanks to the good providence that preserved me what a situation—i shudder at the reflection more than i did falling in the jaws of the precipice before i got from the place there were seven men about me i gave them a   liv piece to drink which for sometime they refused to accept thinking with unaffected modesty that it was too much at aubenas repaired the harness and leaving that place viewed the silk mills which are considerable reach vileneuve de berg i was immediately hunted out by the milice bourgeoise where is your certificate here again the old objection that my features and person were not described—your papers the importance of the case they said was great and looked as big as if a marshals batton was in hand they tormented me with an hundred questions and then pronounced that i was a suspicious looking person they could not conceive why a suffolk farmer could travel into the vivarais near had they heard of any person travelling for agriculture they would take my passport to the hotel de ville—have the permanent council assembled—and place a centinel at my door i told them they might do what they pleased provided they did not prohibit my dinner as i was hungry they then departed in about half an hour a gentlemanlike man a croix de st louis came asked me some questions very politely and seemed not to conclude that maria antonietta and arthur young were at this moment in any very dangerous conspiracy he retired saying he hoped i should not meet with any difficulties in another half hour a soldier came to conduct me to the hotel de ville where i found the council assembled i had a good many questions asked and some expressions of surprise that an english farmer should travel so far for agriculture—they had never heard of such a thing —but all was in a polite liberal manner and though     travelling for agriculture was as new to them as if it had been like the antient philosophers tour of the world on a cows back and living on the milk—yet they did not deem any thing in my recital improbable signed my passport very readily assured me of every assistance and civility i might want and dismissed me with the politeness of gentlemen i described my treatment at thuytz which they loudly condemned i took this opportunity to beg to know where that pradel  0 was to be found in this country of which oliver de serres was seigneur the well known french writer on agriculture in the reign of henry iv they at once pointed out of the window of the room we were in to the house which in this town belonged to him and informed me that pradel was within a league as this was an object i had noted before i came to france the information gave me no slight satisfaction the mayor in the course of the examination presented me to a gentleman who had translated sterne into french but who did not speak english on my return to the auberge i found that this was mons de boissiere avocat general of the parliament of grenoble i did not care to leave the place without knowing something more of one who had distinguished himself himfelf in   0  edition—econlib ed by his attention to english literature and i wrote him a note begging permission to have the pleasure of some conversation with a gentleman who had made our inimitable author speak the language of a people he loved so well mons de boissiere came to me immediately conducted me to his house introduced me to his lady and some friends and as i was much interested concerning oliver de serres he offered to take a walk with me to pradel it may easily be supposed that this was too much to my mind to be refused and few evenings have been more agreeably spent i regarded the residence of the great parent of french agriculture and who was undoubtedly one of the first writers on the subject that had then appeared in the world with that sort of veneration which those only can feel who have addicted themselves strongly to some predominant pursuit and find it in such moments indulged in its most exquisite feelings two     hundred years after his exertions let me do honour to his memory he was an excellent farmer and a true patriot and would not have been fixed on by henry iv as his chief agent in the great project of introducing the culture of silk in france if he had not possessed a considerable reputation a reputation well earned since posterity has confirmed it the period of his practice is too remote to gain anything more than a general outline of what may now be supposed to have been his farm the basis of it is limestone there is a great oak wood near the chateau and many vines with plenty of mulberries some apparently old enough to have been planted by the hand of the venerable genius that has rendered the ground classic the estate of pradel which is about  000 liv    l   s a year belongs at present to the marquis of mirabel who inherits it in right of his wife as the descendant of de serres i hope it is exempted for ever from all taxes he whose writings laid the foundation for the improvement of a kingdom should leave to his posterity some marks of his countrymens gratitude when the present bishop of sisteron was shewn like me the farm of de serres he remarked that the nation ought to erect a statue to his memory    the sentiment is not without merit though no more than common snuffbox chat but if this bishop has a well cultivated farm in his hands it does him honour supped with mons and madame de boissiers c and had the pleasure of an agreeable and interesting conversation—   miles the   st mons de boissiere wishing to take my advice in the improvement of a farm which he had taken into his hands six or seven miles from berg in my road to viviers accompanied me thither i advised him to form one well executed and well improved inclosure every year—to finish as he advances and to do well what he attempts to do at all and i cautioned him against the common abuse of that excellent husbandry paring and burning i suspect however that his homme d affaire will be too potent for the english traveler—i hope he has received the     turnipseed i sent him dine at viviers    and pass the rhone after the wretched inns of the vivarais dirt filth bugs and starving to arrive at the hotel de monsieur at montilimart    a great and excellent inn was something like the arrival in france from spain the contrast is striking and i seemed to hug myself that i was again in a christian country among the milor ninchitreas and my ladi bettis of mons chabot—   miles the   d having a letter to mons faujas de st fond    the celebrated naturalist who has favoured the world with many important works on volcanoes aerostation and various other branches of natural history i had the satisfaction on enquiring to find that he was at montilimart and waiting on him—to perceive that a man of distinguished merit was handsomely lodged with every thing about him that indicated an easy fortune he received me with the frank politeness inherent in his character introduced me on the spot to a mons labbé berenger who resided near his countryseat and was he said an excellent cultivator and likewise to another gentleman whose taste had taken the same good direction in the evening mons faujas took me to call on a female friend who was engaged in the same enquiries madame cheinet whose husband is a member of the national assembly if he has the good luck to find at versailles some other lady as agreeable as her he has left at montilimart his mission will not be a barren one and he may perhaps be better employed than in voting regenerations this lady accompanied us in a walk for viewing the environs of montilimart and it gave me no small pleasure to find that she was an excellent farmeress practises considerably and had the goodness to answer many of my enquiries particularly in the culture of silk i was so charmed with the naiveté of character and pleasing conversation of this very agreeable   0 lady that a longer stay here would have been delicious—but the plough the   d by appointment accompanied mons faujas to his countryseat and farm at loriol    fifteen miles north of montilimart where he is building a good house i was pleased to find his farm amount to   0 septerés    of land i should have liked it better had it not been in the hands of a métayer mons faujas pleases me much the liveliness vivacity phlogiston of his character do not run into pertness foppery or affectation he adheres steadily to a subject and shews that to clear up any dubious point by the attrition of different ideas in conversation gives him pleasure not through a vain fluency of colloquial powers but for better understanding a subject the next day mons labbé berenger and another gentlemen passed it at mons faujas we walked to the abbés farm he is of the good order of beings and pleases me much curé of the parish and president of the permanent council he is at present warm on a project of reuniting the protestants to the church spoke with great pleasure of having persuaded them on occasion of the general thanksgiving for the establishment of liberty to return thanks to god and sing the te deum in the catholic church in common as brethren which from confidence in his character they did his is firmly persuaded that by both parties giving way a little and softening or retrenching reciprocally somewhat in points that are disagreeable they may be brought together the idea is so liberal that i question it for the multitude who are never governed by reason but by trifles and ceremonies—and who are usually attached to their religion in proportion to the absurdities it abounds with i have not the least doubt but the mob in england would be much more scandalized at parting with the creed of st athanasius than the whole bench of bishops whose illumination would perhaps reflect correctly that of the throne mons labbé berenger has prepared a memorial which is ready to be presented to the national assembly proposing and explaining this ideal union of the two religions and     he had the plan of adding a clause proposing that the clergy should have permission to marry he was convinces that it would be for the interest of morals and much for that of the nation that the clergy should not be an insulated body but holding by the same interests and connections as other people he remarked that the life of a curé and especially in the country is melancholy and knowing my passion observed that a man never could be so good a farmer on any possession he might have excluded from being succeeded by his children he shewed me his memoir and i was pleased to find that there is at present great harmony between the two religions owing certainly to such good curés the number of protestants is very considerable in this neighbourhood i strenuously contended for the insertion of the clause respecting marriage assured him that at such a moment as this it would do all who were concerned in this memorial the greatest credit and that they ought to consider it as a demand of the rights of humanity violently injuriously and relative to the nation impolitically withheld yesterday in going with mons faujas we passed a congregation of protestants assembled druidlike    under five or six spreading oaks to offer their thanksgiving to the great parent of their happiness and hope—in such a climate as this is it not a worthier temple built by the great hand they revere than one of brick and mortar—this was one of the richest days i have enjoyed in france we had a long and truly farming dinner drank a langlois success to the plough and had so much agricultural conversation that i wished for my farming friends in suffolk to partake my satisfaction if mons faujus de st fond comes to england as he gives me hope i shall introduce him to them with pleasure in the evening return to montilimart— 0 miles the   th to chateau rochemaur    across the rhone     it is situated on a basaltic rock nearly perpendicular with every columnar proof of its volcanic origin see mons de faujas recherches in the afternoon to piere latte    through a country steril uninteresting and far inferior to the environs of montilimart—   miles the   th to orange  0 the country not much better a range of mountains to the left see nothing of the rhone at that town there are remains of a large roman building seventy or eighty feet high called a circus of a triumphal arch which though a good deal decayed manifests in its remains no ordinary decoration and a pavement in the house of a poor person which is very perfect and beautiful but much inferior to that of nismes the vent de bize has blown strongly for several days with a clear sky tempering the heats which are sometimes sultry and oppressive it may for what i know be wholesome to french constitutions but it is diabolical to mine i found myself very indifferent and as if i was going to be ill a new and unusual sensation over my whole body never dreaming of the wind i knew not what to attribute it to but my complaint coming at the same time puts it out of doubt besides instinct now much more than reason makes me guard as much as i can against it at four or five in the morning it is so cold that no traveller ventures out it is more penetratingly drying than i had any conception of other winds stop the cutaneous perspiration but this piercing through the body seems by its sensation to dessicate all the interior humidity— 0 miles the   th to avignon—whether it was because i had read much of this town in the history of the middle ages or because it had been the residence of the popes or more probably from the still more interesting memoirs which petrarch has left concerning it in poems that will last as long as italian elegance and human feelings shall exist i know not—but i approached the place with a sort of interest attention and expectancy that few towns have kindled lauras tomb is in the church of the cordeliers it is nothing but a stone in the pavement with a figure engraven on it partly effaced surrounded by an inscription in     gothic letters and another in the wall adjoining with the armorial of the family of sade how incredible is the power of great talents when employed in delineating passions common to the human race how many millions of women fair as laura have been beloved as tenderly—but wanting a petrarch to illustrate the passion have lived and died in oblivion whilst his lines not written to die conduct thousands under the impulse of feelings which genius only can excite to mingle in idea their melancholy sighs with those of the poet who consecrated these remains to immortality—there is a monument of the brave crillon    in the same church and i saw other churches and pictures—but petrarch and laura are predominant at avignon—   miles the   th wait upon pere brouillony provincial visitor    who with great politeness procured me the information i wished by introducing me to some gentlemen understanding in agriculture from the rock of the legates palace there is one of the finest views of the windings of the rhone that is to be seen it forms two considerable islands which with the rest of the plain richly watered cultivated and covered with mulberries olives and fruittrees have a fine boundary in the mountains of provence dauphiné and languedoc—the circular road fine i was struck with the resemblance between the women here and in england it did not at once occur in what it consisted but it is their caps they dress their heads quite different from the french women a better particularity is there being no wooden shoes here nor as i have seen in provence    —i have often complained of the stupid ignorance i met with at table dhôtes here if possible it has been worse than common the politeness of the french is proverbial but it never could arise     from the manners of the classes that frequent these tables not one time in forty will a foreigner as such receive the least mark of attention the only political idea here is that if the english should attack france they have a million of men in arms to receive them and their ignorance seems to know no distinction between men in arms in their towns and villages or in action without the kingdom they conceive as sterne observes much better than they combine i put some questions to them but in vain i asked if the union of a rusty firelock and a bourgeois made a soldier—i asked them in which of their wars they had wanted men i demanded whether they had ever felt any other want than that of money and whether the conversion of a million of men into the bearers of musquets would made money more plentiful i asked if personal service was not a tax and whether paying the tax of the service of a million of men increased their faculties of paying other and more useful taxes i begged them to inform me if the regeneration of the kingdom which had put arms into the hands of a million of mob had rendered industry more productive internal peace more secure confidence more enlarged or credit more stable and lastly i assured them that should the english attack them at present they would probably make the weakest figure they had done from the foundation of their monarchy but gentlemen the english in spite of the example you set them in the american war will disdain such a conduct they regret the constitution you are forming because they think it a bad one—but whatever you may establish you will have no interruption but many good wishes from your neighbour it was all in vain they were well persuaded their government was the best in the world that it was a monarchy and no republic which i contended and that the english though it good because they would unquestionably abolish their house of lords in the enjoyment of which accurate idea i left them—in the evening to lille    a town which has lost its name in the world in the more splendid fame of vaucluse there can hardly be met with a richer or better cultivated     sixteen miles the irrigation is superb lille is most agreeably situated on coming to the verge of it i found fine plantations of elms with delicious streams bubbling over pebbles on either side well dressed people were enjoying the evening at a spot i had conceived to be only a mountain village it was a sort of fairy scene to me now thought i how detestable to leave this fine wood and water and enter a nasty beggarly walled hot stinking town one of the contrasts most offensive to my feelings what an agreeable surprise to find the inn without the town in the agreeable surprise to find the inn without the town in the midst of the scenery i had admired and more a good and civil inn i walked on the banks of this classic stream for an hour with the moon gazing on the waters that will run for ever in mellifluous poetry retired to sup on the most exquisite trout and craw fish in the world tomorrow to the famed origing—   miles the   th i am delighted with the environs of lille beautiful roads well planted surround and pass off in different directions as if from a capital town umbrageous enough to form promenades against a hot sun and the river splits and divides into so many streams and is conducted with so much attention that it has a delicious effect especially to an eye that recognises all the fertility or irrigation to the fountain of vaucluse which is justly said to be as celebrated almost as that of helicon crossing a plain which is not so beautiful as ones idea of tempe the mountain presents an almost perpendicular rock at the foot of which is an immense and very fine cavern half filled with a pool of stagnant but clear water this is the famous fountain at other seasons it fills the whole cavern and boils over in a vast stream among rocks its bed now marked by vegetation at present the water gushes out  00 yards lower down from beneath masses of rock and in a very small distance forms a considerable river which almost immediately receives deviations by art for mills and irrigation on the summit of a rock above the village but much below the mountain is a ruin called by the poor people here the chateau of petrarch—who tell you it was inhabited by mons petrarch and madame laura the scene is sublime but what renders it truly interesting to our feelings is the celebrity which great talents have     given it the power of rocks and water and mountains even in their boldest features to arrest attention and fill the bosom with sensations that banish the insipid feelings of common life—holds not of inanimate nature to give energy to such sensations it must receive animation from the creative touch of a vivid fancy described by the poet or connected with the residence actions pursuits or passions of great geniusses it lives as it were personified by talents and commands the interest that breathes around whatever is consecrated by fame to orgon    quit the popes territory by crossing the durance there view the skeleton of the navigation of boisgelin the work of the archbishop of aix a noble project and where finished perfectly well executed a hill is pierced by it for a quarter of a mile a work that rivals the greatest similar exertions it has however stood still many years for want of money the vent de bize gone and the heat increased the wind now sw my health better to a moment which proves how pernicious it is even in august— 0 miles the  0th i forgot to observe that for a few days past i have been pestered with all the mob of the country shooting one would think that every rusty gun in provence is at work killing all sorts of birds the shot has fallen five or six times in my chaise and about my ears the national assembly has declared that every man has a right to kill game on his own land and advancing this maxim so absurd as a declaration though so wise as a law without any statute of provision to secure the right of game to the possessor of the soil according to the tenor of the vote has as i am every where informed filled all the fields of france with sportsmen to an utter nuisance the same effects have flowed from declarations of right relative to tythes taxes feudal rights c in the declarations conditions and compensations are talked of but an unruly ungovernable multitude seize the benefit of the abolition and laugh at the obligations or recompense out by daybreak for salon    in order to view the crau one of the most singular districts in france for its soil or rather want of soil being apparently a region of sea flints     yet feeding great herds of sheep view the improvement of monsieur pasquali who is doing great things but roughly i wished to see and converse with him but unfortunately he was absent from salon at night to st canat    —   miles the   st to aix    many houses without glass windows the women with mens hats and no wooden shoes at aix waited on mons gibelin celebrated for his translations of the works of dr priestley and of the philosophical transactions he received me with that easy and agreeable politeness natural to his character being apparently a friendly man he took every method in his power to procure me the information i wanted and engaged to go with me the next day to tour daigues    to wait on the baron of that name president of the parliament of aix to whom also i had letters and whose essays in the trimestres of the paris society of agriculture are among the most valuable on rural œconomics in that work—   miles september  st tour daigues is twenty miles north of aix on the other side of the durance which we crossed at a ferry the country about the chateau is bold and hilly and swells in four or five miles into rocky mountains the president received me in a very friendly manner with a simplicity of manners that gives a dignity to his character void of affectation he is very fond of agriculture and planting the afternoon was passed in viewing his homefarm and his noble woods which are uncommon in this naked province the chateau of tour daigues before much of it was accidentally consumed by fire must have been one of the most considerable in france but at present a melancholy spectacle is left the baron is an enormous sufferer by the revolution a great extent of country which belonged in absolute right to his ancestors has been granted for quit rent cens and other feudal payments so that there is no comparison between the lands retained and those thus granted by his family the loss of the droits honorifiques is much more than has been     apparent and is an utter loss of all influence it was natural to look for some plain and simple mode of compensation but the declaration of the national assembly allows none and it is feelingly known in this chateau that the solid payments which the assembly have declared to be rachetable are every hour falling to nothing without a shadow or recompense the people are in arms and at this moment very unquiet the situation of the nobility in this country is pitiable they are under apprehensions that nothing will be left them but simply such houses as the mob allows to stand unburnt that the métayers will retain their farms without paying the landlord his half of the produce and that in case of such a refusal there is actually neither law nor authority in the country to prevent it here is however in this house a large and an agreeable society and cheerful to a miracle considering the times and what such a great baron is losing who has inherited from his ancestors immense possessions now frittering to nothing by the revolution this chateau splendid even in ruins the venerable woods park and all the ensigns of family and command with the fortune and even the lives of the owners at the mercy and trampled on by an armed rabble what a spectacle the baron has a very fine and well filled library and one part of it totally with books and tracts on agriculture in all the languages of europe his collection of these is nearly as numerous as my own— 0 miles the  d mons le president dedicated this day for an excursion to his mountainfarm five miles off where he has a great range and one of the finest lakes in provence two thousand toises round and forty feet deep directly from it rises a fine mountain consisting of a mass of shell agglutinated into stone it is a pity this hill is not planted as the water wants the immediate accompanyment of wood carp rise to   lb and eels to   lb note there are carp in the lake bourget in savoy of  0lb a neighbouring gentleman mons jouvent well acquainted with the agriculture of this country accompanied us and spent the rest of the day at the castle i had much valuable information from the baron de tour daigues this gentleman and from mons labbé de—— i forget his name in the evening     i had some conversation on housekeeping with one of the ladies and found among other articles that the wages of a gardener are  00 liv   l  s  d a common manservant   0 liv  l a bourgeois cook    to  0 liv  0 liv are  l   s  d a housemaid  0 to  0 liv  l s  d rent of a good house for a bourgeois  00 or  00 liv    — 0 miles the  d took my leave of mons tour daigues hospitable chateau and returned with mons gibelin to aix— 0 miles the  th the country to marseilles is all mountainous but much cultivated with vines and olives it is however naked and uninteresting and much of the road is left in a scandalous condition for one of the greatest in france not wide enough at places for two carriages to pass with convenience what a deceiving painter is the imagination—i had read i know not what lying exaggerations of the bastides about marseilles being counted not by hundreds but by thousands with anecdotes of louis xiv adding one to the number of citadel—i have seen other towns in france where they are more numerous and the environs of montpellier without external commerce are as highly decorated as those of marseilles yet montpellier is not singular the view of marseilles in the approach is not striking it is well built in the new quarter but like all others in the old close ill built and dirty the population if we may judge from the throng in the streets is very great i have met with none that exceeds it in this respect i went in the evening to the theatre which is new but not striking and not in any respect to be named with that of bourdeaux or even nantes nor is the general magnificence of the town at all equal to bourdeaux the new buildings are neither so extensive nor so good—the number of ships in the port not to be compared and the port itself is a horsepond compared with the garonne— 0 miles the  th marseilles is absolutely exempt from the reproaches i have so often cast on others for want of newspapers i breakfasted at the café d acajon amidst many deliver my letters and receive information concerning commerce but i am disappointed of one i expected for mons   0 labbé raynal the celebrated author at the table dhôte the count de mirabeau both here and at aix a topic of conversation i expected to have found him more popular from the extravagancies committed in his favour in provence and at marseilles they consider him merely as a politician of great abilities whose principles are favourable to theirs as to his private character they think they have nothing to do with it and assert that they had much rather trust to a rogue of abilities than put any confidence in an honest man of a no talents not however meaning to assert that mons de mirabeau deserved any such appellation they say he has an estate in provence i observed that i was glad to hear he had property for in such revolutions it was a necessary hold on a man that he will not drive every thing to confusion in order to possess a consequence and importance which cannot attend him in peaceable and quiet times but to be at marseilles without seeing abbé raynal one of the undoubted precursors of the present revolution in france would be mortifying having no time to wait longer for letters i took the resolution to introduce myself he was at the house of his friend mons bertrand i told him my situation and with that ease and politeness which flows from a mans knowledge of the world he replied that he was always happy to be of use to any gentleman of my nation and turning to his friend said here also is one sir who loves the english and understands their language in conversing on agriculture which i had mentioned as the object of my journey they both expressed their surprise to find by accounts apparently authentic that we imported great quantities of wheat instead of exporting as we formerly did and desired to know if this was really the case to what it was owing and recurring at the same time to the mercure de france for a statement of the export and import of corn he read it as a quotation from mr arthur young this gave me the opportunity of saying that i was the person and it proved a lucky introduction for it was not possible to be received with more politeness or with more offers of service and assistance i explained that the change had taken place in consequence of a vast increase of population a cause still increasing more rapidly     than ever—we had an interesting conversation on the agriculture of france and on the present situation of affairs which they both think going on badly are convinced of the necessity of an upper house in the legislature and dread nothing more than a mere democratical government which they think a species of republic ridiculous for such a kingdom as france i remarked that i had often reflected with amazement that mons necker did not assemble the states in such a form and under such regulations as would have naturally led to adopt the constitution of england free from the few faults which time has discovered in it on which mons bertrand gave me a pamphlet he had published addressed to his friend abbé raynal proposing several circumstances in the english constitution to be adopted in that of france mons labbé raynal remarked that the american revolution had brought the french one in its train i observed that if the result in france should be liberty that revolution had proved a blessing to the world but much more so to england than to america this they both thought such a paradox that i explained it by remarking that i believed the prosperity which england had enjoyed since the peace not only much exceeded that of any other similar period but also that of any other country in any period since the establishment of the european monarchies a fact that was supported by the increase of population of consumption of industry of navigation shipping and sailors by the augmentation and improvement of agriculture manufactures and commerce and in a peculiar mass and aggregate flowing from the whole the rising ease and felicity of the people i mentioned the authentic documents and public registers which supported such a representation and i remarked that abbé raynal who attended closely to what i said had not seen or heard of these circumstances in which he is not singular for i have not met with a single person in france acquainted with them yet they unquestionably form one of the most remarkable and singular experiments in the science of politics that the world has seen for a people to lose an empire—thirteen provinces and to gain by that loss an increase of wealth felicity and power when will the obvious conclusions     to be drawn from that prodigious event be adopted that all transmarine or distant dominions are sources of weakness and that to renounce them would be wisdom apply this in france to st domingo in spain to peru or in england to bengal and mark the ideas and replies that are excited i have no doubt however of the fact i complimented him on his generous gift to the society of agriculture at paris of   00 liv for a premium he said they had thanked him not in the usual form by the secretary signing alone but had every one present signed it he said that he should do the same by the academies of sciences and belles letters and he has given the same sum to the academy at marseilles for a premium relative to their commerce he said also that he had formed a plan which he should execute when he has saved money enough which is to expend by means of the society of agriculture   00 liv a year in purchasing models of all the useful implements of husbandry to be found in other countries especially in england and to spread them over france the idea is an excellent one and merits great praise yet it is to be questioned whether the effect would answer the expence give the tool itself to a farmer and he will not know how to use it or will be too much prejudiced to like it a model he will still less take the trouble to copy gentlemen farming every where their own lands with enthusiasm and passion for the art would apply and use those models but i fear that none such are to be found in france the spirit and pursuits of gentlemen must be changed from their present frivolous turns before any such thing could be effected he approved of my recommending turnips and potatoes but said that good sorts were wanting and mentioned a trial he had made himself a comparison of the english and provencal potatoes in making bread and the english produced onethird more flour than the french—among other causes of bad husbandry in france he named the illegality of usury at present moneyed people in the country locked it up instead of lending it for improvement these sentiments of an illustrious writer do him honour and it was pleasing to me to find that he gave attention to objects which have almost monopolized mine and yet more so to find that     this justly celebrated writer though not young is in good spirits and that he may live many years to enlighten the world by the productions of a pen that has never been employed but for the benefit of the human species the  th the cuges  0 for three or four miles the road leads through rows of bastides and walls it is made of powdered white stone and without exception the most dusty i ever saw the vines for twenty rods on each side were like a dressed head the country all mountains of rocks with poor pines—uninteresting and ugly the plains of no great breadth are covered with vines and olives meet capers first at cuges at aubagne    i dined on six dishes not bad a dessert and a bottle of wine for   f and by myself too for no table dhôte what mons dutens could mean by calling the posthouse at cuges a good auberge is inexplicable it is a miserable hole in which i have one of the best rooms without glass to the windows—   miles the  th the country to toulon is more interesting the mountains are bolder the sea adds to the view and there is one passage among the rocks where area sublime features ninetenths are waste mountain and a wretched country of pines box and miserable aromatics in spite of the climate near toulon especially at olioules    there are pomegranates in the hedges ith fruit as large as nonpareils they have a few oranges also the bason of toulon with ranges of three deckers and other large men of war with a quay of life and business are fine the town has nothing that deserves description the great and only thing that is worth seeing the dockyard i could not see yet i had letter but the regulations forbidding it as at brest all applications were vain—   miles the  0th lady craven    has sent me upon a wildgoose chase to hyeres—one would think this country from hers and many other descriptions was all a garden but it has     been praised much beyond its merit the vale is every where richly cultivated and planted with olives and vines with a mixture of some mulberries figs and other fruit trees the hills are either rocks or spread with a poor vegetation of evergreens pines lentiscus c the vale though scattered with white bastides which animate the scene yet betrays that poverty in the robe of nature which always offends the eye where olives and fruits form the principal cloathing every view is meagre on comparison with the rich foliage of our northern forests the only singular features are the orange and lemon trees they here thrive in the open air are of a great size and render every garden interesting to eyes that travel to the south but last winters frost has shorn them of their glory they are all so nearly destroyed as to be cut almost to the root or to the trunk but are in general shooting again i conjecture that these trees even when in health and foliage however they may be separately taken add but little to the general effect of a view they are all in gardens mixed with walls and houses and consequently lose much beauty as the part of a landscape lady cravens tour sent me to the chapel of notre dame de consolation    and to the hills leading to mons glapiere de st tropes and i asked for father laurent who was however very little sensible of the honour she had done him the views from the hills on both sides of the town are moderate the islands portecroix pourcurolle and levant    the nearest joined to the continent by a causeway and saltmarsh which they call a pond the hills mounts rocks all are naked the pines that spread on some of them have not a much better effect than gorse the verdure of the vale is hurt by the hue of the olives there is a fine outline to the views but for a climate where vegetation is the chief glory it is poor and meagre and does not refresh the imagination with the idea of a thick shade     against the rays of an ardent sun i can hear of no cotton in provence which has been reported in several books but the date and pistachio succeed the myrtle is indigenous everywhere and the jasminum commune and fruticans    in iisle de levant is the genista candescens    and the teucrium herba poma    returning from my ride to the hotel de necker the landlord worried me with a list of english that pass the winter at hyeres there are many houses built for letting from two to six louis a month including all the furniture linen necessary plate c most of these houses command the prospect of the vale and the sea and if they do not feel the vent de bize i should suppose it must be a fine winter climate in december january and february perhaps it may not incommode them but does it not in march and april there is a table dhôte very well served at the hotel de necker in winter at   liv ahead each meal view the kings garden here which may be  0 or    acres and nobly productive in all the fruits of the climate its crop of oranges only last year was   000 liv        s oranges at hyeres have produced as far as two louis each tree dine with mons de st cæsaire who has a pretty new built house a noble garden walled in and an estate around it which he would sell or let he was so obliging as to give me with doctor battaile much useful information concerning the agriculture and produce of this country in the evening return to toulon—   miles the   th the arrangement of my journey in italy occupied some attention i had been often informed and by men that have travelled much in italy that i must not think of going thither with my onehorse the chaise to watch my horse being fed would they assured me take up abundantly too much time and if it was omitted with respect to hay as well as oats both would be equally stolen there are also parts of italy where travelling alone as i did would be very unsafe from the number of robbers that infest the roads persuaded by the opinions of     persons who i suppose must know much better than myself i had determined to sell my mare and chaise and travel in italy by the veturini who are to be had it seems everywhere and at a cheap rate at aix they offered me for both  0 louis at marseilles    so the further i went i expected the price would sink but to get out of the hands of the aubergistes and the garçons décuries who expected everywhere to make a property of me i had it drawn into the street at toulon with a large label written a vendre and the price    louis they had cost me at paris    my plan took and i sold them for    they had brought me above twelve hundred miles but yet were a cheap bargain to an officer that was the purchaser i had next to consider the method to get to nice and will it be believed that from marseilles with  00000 souls and toulon with  0000 lying in the great road to antibes nice and italy there is no diligence or regular voiture a gentleman at the table dhôte assured me they asked him   louis for a place in a voiture to antibes and to wait till some other person would give   more for another seat to a person accustomed to the infinity of machines that fly about england in all directions this must appear hardly credible such great cities in france have not the hundredth part of connection and communication with each other that much inferior places enjoy with us a sure proof of their deficiency in consumption activity and animation a gentleman who knew every part of provence well and had been from nice to toulon by sea advised me to take the common barque for one day from toulon that i might at least pass the isles of hyeres i told him i had been at hyeres and seen the coast i had seen nothing he said if i had not seen them and the coast from the sea which was the finest object in all provence that it would be only one day at sea as i might land at cavalero and take mules for frejus and that i should lose nothing as the common route was the same as what i had seen mountains vines and olives his opinion prevailed and i spoke to the captain of the barque for my passage to cavalero the   th at six in the morning on board the barque captain jassoirs of antibes the weather was delicious     and the passage out of the harbour of toulon and its great bason beautiful and interesting apparently it is impossible to imagine a harbour more completely secure and landlocked the inner one contiguous to the quay is large and seems formed by art a range of mole which it is built on separating it from the great bason only one ship can enter at a time but it could contain a fleet there are now lying moored in two ranges one ship the commerce of marseilles of   0 guns the finest ship in the french navy and seventeen others of  0 guns each with several smaller when in the great bason which is two or three miles across you seem absolutely inclosed by high lands and it is only on the moment of quitting it that you can guess where the outlet is by which you are connected with the sea the town the shipping the high mountain which rises immediately above it the hills covered with plantations and spread every where with bastides unite to form a striking coup dœil but as to the isles of hyeres and the fine views of the coast which i was to enjoy my informant could have no eyes or absolutely without taste they are as well as all the coast miserably barren rocks and hills with only pines to give any idea of vegetation if it was not for a few solitary houses with here and there a square patch of cultivation to change the colour of the mountains i should have imagined that this coast must have borne a near resemblance to those of new zealand or new holland—dark gloomy and silent—a savage sombre air spread over the whole the pines and evergreen shrubs that cover the greatest part cover it with more gloom than verdure landed at night at cavalero which i expected to have found a little town but it consists only of three houses and a more wretched place not to be imagined they spread a mattress on a stone floor for me for bed they had none after starving all day they had nothing but stale eggs bad bread and worse wine and as to the mules which were to take me to frejus there was neither horse ass nor mule in the place and only four oxen for ploughing the ground i was thus in a pretty situation and must have gone on by sea to antibes for which also the wind gave tokens of being contrary if the captain had not promised me two of     his men to carry my baggage to a village two leagues off where mules were certainly to be had with which comfort i betook myself to my mattress—   miles the   th the captain sent three sailors—one a corsican another a mongrel italian and the third a provencal among the three there was not french enough for half an hours conversation we crossed the mountains and wandered by crooked unknown paths and beds of torrents and then found the village of gassang on the top of a mountain which however was more than a league from that to which we intended to go here the sailors refreshed themselves two with wine but the third never drank any thing except water i asked if he had equal strength with the others that drank wine yes they replied as strong for his size as any other man i rather think that i shall not soon find as english sailor who will make the experiment no milk i breakfasted on grapes rye bread and bad wine mules were reported to abound at this village or rather that which we missed but the master of the only two we could hear of being absent i had no other resource than agreeing with a man to take my baggage on an ass and myself to walk a league further to st tropes    for which he demanded   liv in two hours reached that town which is prettily situated and tolerably well built on the banks of a noble inlet of the sea from cavalero hither the country is all mountain eighteentwentieths of it covered with pines or a poor wilderness of evergreen shrubs rocky and miserable cross the inlet which is more than a league wide the ferrymen had been on board a kings ship and complained heavily of their treatment—but said that now they were freemen they should be well treated and in case of a war they should pay the english by a different account—it would now be man to man before it was free men fighting with slaves land at st maxime and there hire two mules and a guide to frejus  0 the country the same mountainous and rocky desert of pines and lentiscus but towards frejus some arbutus very little culture before the plain near frejus i passed today thirty miles     of which five are not cultivated the whole coast of provence is nearly the same desert yet the climate would give on all these mountains productions valuable for feeding sheep and cattle but they are incumbered with shrubs absolutely worthless the effect of liberty had better appear in their cultivation than on the decks of a man of war— 0 miles the   th staid at frejus to rest myself—to examine the neighbourhood which however contains nothing—and to arrange my journey to nice here are remains of an amphitheatre and aqueduct on enquiring for a voiture to go post i found there was no such thing to be had so i had no resource but mules i employed the garçon décurie for a postmaster thinks himself of too much consequence to take the least trouble and he reported that i should be well served for    liv to estrelles this price for ten miles on a miserable mule was a very entertaining idea i bid him half the money he assured me he had named the lowest price and left me certainly thinking me safe in his clutches i took a walk round the town to gather some plants that were in blossom and meeting a woman with an assload of grapes i asked her employment and found by help of an interpreter that she carried grapes from vineyards for hire i proposed loading her ass to estrelles with my baggage—and demanded her price— 0 sols i will give it break of day appointed and i returned to the inn at least an œconomist saving  0 liv by my walk the   th myself my female and her ass jogged merrily over the mountains the only misfortune was we did not know one word of each others language i could just discover that she had a husband and three children i tried to know if he was a good husband and if she loved him very much but our language failed in such explanations—it was no matter her ass was to do my business and not her tongue at estrelles i took posthorses it is a single house and no women with asses to be had or i should have preferred them it is not easy for me to describe how agreeable a walk of ten or fifteen miles is to a man who walks well after sitting a thousand in a carriage todays journey all through the same bad country mountain beyond mountain incumbered with worthless evergreens and   0 not one mile in twenty cultivated the only relief is the gardens at grasse    where very great exertions are made but of singular kind roses are a great article for the famous otter all of which is commonly supposed to come from bengal they say that   00 flowers go to a single drop twenty flowers sell for   sol and an ounce of the otter 00 liv   l  0s tuberoses c are also cultivated for perfumes in immense quantities for paris and london rosemary lavender bergamot and oranges are here capital articles of culture half europe is supplied with essences from hence cannes is prettily situated close on the shore with the isles of st marguerite where is a detestable state prison about two miles off and a distant boundary of the estrelles mountains with a bold broken outline these mountains are barren to excess at all the villages since toulon at frejus estrelles c i asked for milk but no such thing to be had not even of goats or sheep the cows are all in the higher mountains and as to butter the landlord at estrelles told me it was a contraband commodity that came from nice good heaven—what an idea northern people have like myself before i knew better of a fine sun and a delicious climate as it is called that gives myrtles oranges lemons pomegranates jasmines and aloes in the hedges yet are such countries if irrigation be wanted the veriest deserts in the world on the most miserable tracts of our heaths and moors you will find butter milk and cream give me that which will feed a cow and let oranges remain to provence the fault however is in the people more than the climate and as the people have never any faults till they become the masters all is the effect of government the arbutus laurustinus cistus and spanish broom are found scattered about the wastes nobody in the inn but a merchant of bourdeaux returning home from italy we supped together and had a good deal of conversation not uninteresting he was melancholy to think he said what a sad reputation the french revolution has wherever he has been in italy unhappy france was his frequent ejaculation he made many enquiries of me and said his letters confirmed my     accounts the italians seemed all convinced that the rivalry of france and england was at an end and that the english would now have it in their power amply to revenge the american war by seizing st domingo and indeed all the possessions the french have out of france itself i said the idea was a pernicious one and so contrary to the personal interests of the men who governed england that it was not to be thought of he replied that if we did not do it we should be marvellously forbearing and set an example of political purity sufficient to eternize that part of our national character in which the world thought us most deficient moderation he complained bitterly of the conduct of certain leaders of the national assembly who seemed to be determined on a bankruptcy and perhaps a civil war—   miles the   th at cannes i was quite without a choice no posthouse carriage nor horses nor mules to let i was therefore forced again to take refuge in a woman and her ass at five in the morning i walked to antibes    this line of nine miles is chiefly cultivated but the mountains rise so immediately that in a general idea all is waste antibes being a frontier town is regularly fortified the mole is pretty and the view from it pleasing take a postchaise to nice cross the var and bid adieu for the present to france the approach to nice is pleasing the first approach to that country so long and justly celebrated that has produced those who have conquered and those who have decorated the world fills the bosom with too many throbbing feelings to permit a bush a stone a clod to be uninteresting our percipient faculties are expanded we wish to enjoy and then all is attention and willingness to be pleased the approach marks a flourishing town new buildings the neverfailing mark of prosperity are numerous pass many gardens full of oranges arrive in time for dinner at the table dhôte hotel de quatre nations and agree with the master of it for my apartment which is exceedingly good and dinner and supper at five piedmontese livres aday that is five shillings here i am then in the midst of another people language sovereignty     and country—one of the moments of a mans life that will always be interesting because all the springs of curiosity and attention are on the stretch several frenchmen but more italians at the table dhôte and the french revolution only talked of the frenchmen all in favour of it and the italians all against it and absolute victors in the argument—   miles the   th i have no letters for nice and therefore knowing nothing of the insides of the houses i must be content with what meets the eye the new part of the town is very well built the streets straight and broad the seaview is fine and for enjoying it in greater perfection they have an admirable contrivance which i have seen no where else a row of low houses forming one side of a street a quarter of a mile long has flat roofs which are covered with a stucco floor forming a noble terrace opens immediately to the sea raised above the dirt and annoyance of a street and equally free from the sand and shingle of a beach at one end some finely situated lodginghouses open directly on to it the walk this terrace affords is in fine weather delicious the square is handsome and the works which form the port are well built but it is small and difficult to enter except in favourable weather admits ships of near three hundred tons yet though free has but an inconsiderable trade—the number of new streets and houses building at present is an unequivocal proof that the place is flourishing owing very much to the resort of foreigners principally english who pass the winter here for the benefit and pleasure of the climate they are dismally alarmed at present with the news that the disturbances in france will prevent many of the english from coming this winter but they have some consolation in expecting a great resort of french last winter there were fiftyseven english and nine french this winter they think it will be nine english and fiftyseven french at the table dhôte informed that i must have a passport for travelling in italy and that the english consul is the proper person to apply to i went to mr consul green who informed me that it was a mistake there was no want of any passport but if i wished to have one he would very readily give it my name occurring to him he took     the opportunity to be very polite to me and offered any thing in his power to assist me on my telling him the object of my travels he remarked that the gardens here and mixture of half garden half farm were rather singular and if i called on him in the evening he would walk and shew me some i accepted his obliging invitation and when i went again met a colonel ross a gentleman from scotland second in command in the king of sardinias marine and at present in chief having been much in sardinia i made some enquiries of him concerning that island and the circumstances he instanced were curious the intemperia is so prevalent in summer from the quantity of evaporating water leaving mud exposed to the sun as to be death to a stranger but in winter it is a good climate the soil wonderfully rich and fertile but yast plains that would produce any thing are uncultivated he has past one line of fifty miles by thirty all plain and the land good yet without one house and mostly a neglected desert the people are wretched and deplorably ignorant there are districts he has been informed where there are olives and the fruit left rotting under the trees for want of knowing how to make oil in general there are no roads and no inns when a traveller or other person goes into the island he is recommended from convent to convent or curé to curé some of whom are at their ease you are sure to be well entertained—and at no other expence than a trifle to the servants they plenty of game and wildfowl great the horses are small but excellent all stallions one has been known to be rode fourandtwenty hours without drawing bit i demanded to what could be attributed such a neglected state of the island to government i suppose by no means government has manifested every disposition to set things on a better footing it certainly is owing to the feudal rights of the nobility keeping the people in a state of comparative slavery they are too wretched to have the inducement to industry such is the case at present in many other countries besides sardinia when i see and hear of the abominable depredations and enormities committed by the french peasants i detest the democratical principles when i see or hear of such wastes as are found in sardinia     i abhor the aristocratical ones accompany mr green to view some gardens which have a luxuriance of vegetation by means of watering that makes them objects worth attention but the great product and a most valuable one it is are oranges and lemons chiefly the former and a few bergamots for curiosity we examined the garden of a nobleman some under two acres of land that produces  0 louis dor ayear in oranges only besides all the crops of common vegetables the great value of these products such is the perversity of human life is the exact reason why such gardens would be detestable to me if under the œconomical management of the gentry of nice an acre of garden forms an object of some consequence in the income of a nobleman who in point of fortune is reckoned in good circumstances if he has   0  to  00  a year thus the garden which with us is an object of pleasure is here one of œconomy and income circumstances that are incompatible it is like a well furnished room in a mans house which he lets to a lodger—they sell their oranges so strictly that they cannot gather one to eat a certain momentary and careless consumption is a part of the convenience and agreeableness of a garden a system which thus constrains the consumption destroys all the pleasure oranges may certainly be sold with as much propriety as corn or timber but then let them grow at a distance from the house that open apartment of a residence which we call a garden should be free from the shackle of a contract and the scene of pleasure not profit the   th walked to villa franche    another little seaport of the king of sardinias on the other side of the mountain to the east of nice call on mr green the consul who has given me letters to genoa alexandria and padoua he has behaved with so friendly an attention that i cannot omit acknowledging warmly his civilities learn this morning from him that lord bristol is somewhere in italy and that lady erne is probably at turin my stars will not be propitious if i do not see them both     the   th i have now waited two days merely for the means of getting away i can go either by a felucca to genoa or with a vetturino to turin and there is so much for and against both schemes that priority of departure is as good a motive for a preference as any other if i go by genoa to milan i see genoa and a part of its territory which is much but i lose sixty miles of superb irrigation from coni to turin and i lose the line of country between turin and milan which i am told is better than that between genoa and milan as to turin itself i should see it in my return but here is luigi tonini a vetturino from coni who sets out on monday morning for turin which decides me so with mr greens kind assistance i have bargained with him to take me thither for seven french crowns he has got two officers in the sardinian service and is not to wait longer for filling the third place we have every day at the table dhôte a florentine abbé who has been a marvellous traveller—no man names a country in which he has not travelled and he is singular in never having made a note making rather a boast that his memory retains every particular he would wish to know even to numbers correctly the height and measures of the pyramids of egypt of st peters church at rome and st pauls at london c with the exact length and breadth of every fine street in europe he has at his tongues end he is a great critic in the beauty of cities and he classes the four finest in the world thus   rome—  naples—  venice—  london being a little inclined to the marvellous in the idea of an old piedmontese colonel a knight of st maurice a plain and unaffected character and apparently a very worthy man he pecks at the authority of signore abbate and has afforded some amusement to the company the  0th sunday mr consul green continues his friendly attention to the last i dined by invitation with him today and for the honour of piedmontese grazing ate as fine sweet and fat a piece of roast beef as i would ever wish to do in england and such as would not be seen at the table dhôte at the quatre nations in seven years—if in seven ages an english master and mistress of the table with roast beef plumb pudding and porter made me drop     for a moment the idea of the formidable distance that separated me from england unknown and unrecommended at nice i expected nothing but what could be shot flying in any town but i found in mr green both hospitality and something too friendly to call politeness in the evening we had another walk among gardens and conversed with some of the proprietors of prices products c the description mr green gives me of the climate of nice in the winter is the most inviting that can be imagined a clear blue expanse is constantly over head and a sun warm enough to be exhilerating but not hot enough to be disagreeable but sir the vent de bize we are sheltered from it by the mountains and as a proof that this climate is vastly more mild than where you have felt that wind the oranges and lemons which we have in such profusion will not thrive either in genoa or provence except in a very few spots singularly sheltered like this he remarked that dr smollet in his description has done great injustice to the climate and even against the feelings of his own crazy constitution for he never was so well after he left nice as he had been at it and made much interest with lord shelburne to be appointed consul who told him and not without some foundation that he would on no account be such an enemy to a man of genius—that he had libelled the climate of nice so severely that if he were to go again thither the nissards would certainly knock him on the head mr green has seen hay made and well made at christmas december   st    the shortest day in the year for one of the expeditions that demand the longest the passage of mont cenis about which so much has been written to those who from reading are full of expectation of something very sublime it is almost as great a delusion as to be met with in the regions of romance if travellers are to be believed the descent rammassant    on the snow is made with the velocity of a flash of lightning i was not fortunate     enough to meet with any thing so wonderful at the grand croix we seated ourselves in machines of four sticks dignified with the name of traineau a mule draws it and a conductor who walks between the machine and the animal serves chiefly to kick the snow into the face of the rider when arrived at the precipice which leads down to lanebourg    the mule is dismissed and the rammassang begins the weight of two persons the guide seating himself in the front and directing it with his heels in the snow is sufficient to give it motion for most of the way he is content to follow very humbly the path of the mules but now and then crosses to escape a double and in such spots the motion is rapid enough for a few seconds to be agreeable they might very easily shorten the line one half and by that means gratify the english with the velocity they admire so much as it is at present a good english horse would trot as fast as we rammassed the exaggerations we have read of this business have arisen perhaps from travellers passing in summer and accepting the descriptions of the muleteers a journey on snow is commonly productive of laughable incidents the road of the traineau is not wider than the machine and we were always meeting mules c it was sometimes and with reason a question who should turn out for the snow being ten feet deep the mules had sagacity to consider a moment before they buried themselves a young savoyard female riding her mule experienced a complete reversal for attempting to pass my traineau her beast was a little restive and tumbling dismounted his rider the girls head pitched in the snow and sunk deep enough to fix her beauties in the position of a forked post and the wicked muleteers instead of assisting her laughed too heartily to move if it had been one of the ballerini the attitude would have been nothing distressing to her these laughable adventures with the gilding of a bright sun made the day pass pleasantly and we were in good humour enough to swallow with chearfulness a dinner at lanebourg that had we been in england we should have consigned very readily to the dogkennel— 0 miles     the   d the whole day we were among the high alps the villages are apparently poor the houses ill built and the people with few comforts about them except plenty of pine wood the forests of which harbour wolves and bears dine at modane    and sleep st st michel    —   miles the   d pass st jean maurienne    where there is a bishop and near that place we saw what is much better than a bishop the prettiest and indeed the only pretty woman we saw in savoy on enquiry found it was madame de la coste wife of a farmer of tobacco i should have been better pleased if she had belonged to the plough—the mountains now relax their terrific features they recede enough to offer to the willing industry of the poor inhabitants something like a valley but the jealous torrent seizes it with the hand of despotism and like his brother tyrants reigns but to destroy on some slopes vines mulberries begin to appear villages increase but still continue rather shapeless heaps of inhabited stones than ranges of houses yet in these homely cots beneath the snowclad hills where natural light comes with tardy beams and art seems more sedulous to exclude than admit it peace and content the companions of honesty may reside and certainly would were the penury of nature the only evil felt but the hand of despotism may be more heavy in several places the view is picturesque and pleasing inclosures seem hung against the mountain sides as a picture is suspended to the wall of a room the people are in general mortally ugly and dwarfish dine at la chambre  0 sad fare sleep at aguebelle    — 0 miles the   th the country to day that is to chambery improves greatly the mountains though high recede the vallies are wide and the slopes more cultivated and towards the capital of savoy are many country houses which enliven the scene above mal taverne    is chateauneuf    the house of the countess of that name i was     sorry to see at the village a carcan or seigneural standard erected to which a chain and heavy iron collar are fastened as a mark of the lordly arrogance of the nobility and the slavery of the people i asked why it was not burned with the horror it merited the question did not excite the surprize i expected and which it would have done before the french revolution this led to a conversation by which i learned that in the haut savoy there are no seigneurs and the people are generally at their ease possessing little properties and the land in spite of nature almost as valuable as in the lower country where the people are poor and ill at their ease i demanded why because there are seigneurs every where what a vice is it and even a curse that the gentry instead of being the cherishers and benefactors of their poor neighbours should thus by the abomination of feudal rights prove mere tyrants will nothing but revolutions which cause their chateaux to be burnt induce them to give to reason and humanity what will be extorted by violence and commotion we had arranged our journey to arrive early at chambery for an opportunity to see what is most interesting in a place that has but little it is the winter residence of almost all the nobility of savoy the best estate in the dutchy is not more than  0000 piedmontese livres a year  000l but for  0000 liv they live en grand seigneur here if a country gentleman has   0 louis dor a year he will be sure to spend three months in a town the consequence of which must be nine uncomfortable ones in the country in order to make a beggarly figure the other three in town these idle people are this christmas disappointed by the court having refused admittance to the usual company of french comedians—the government fears importing among the rough mountaineers the present spirit of french liberty is this weakness or policy but chambery had objects to me more interesting i was eager to view charmettes the road the house of madame de warens the vineyard the garden every thing in a word that had been described by the inimitable pencil of rousseau there was something so deliciously amiable in her character in spite of her frailties—her constant gaiety and good humour—her tenderness and humanity—her   0 farming speculations—but above all other circumstances the love of rousseau have written her name amongst the few whose memories are connected with us by ties more easily felt than described the house is situated about a mile from chambery fronting the rocky road which leads to that city and the wood of chesnuts in the valley it is small and much of the same size as we should suppose in england would be found on a farm of one hundred acres without the least luxury or pretension and the garden for shrubs and flowers is confined as well as unassuming the scenery is pleasing being so near a city and yet as he observes quite sequestered it could not but interest me and i viewed it with a degree of emotion even in the leafless melancholy of december it pleased i wandered about some hills which were assuredly the walks he has so agreeably described i returned to chambery with my heart full of madame de warens we had with us a young physicians a monsieur bernard of modanne en maurienne an agreeable man connected with people at chambery i was sorry to find that he knew nothing more of the matter than that madame de warens was certainly dead with some trouble i procured the following certificate extract from the mortuary register of the parish church of st peter de lemens the  0th of july      was buried in the burying ground of lemens dame louisa frances eleonor de la tour widow of the seignor baron de warens native of vevay in the canton of berne in switzerland who died yesterday at ten in the evening like a good christian and fortified with her last sacraments aged about sixtythree years she abjured the protestant religion about thirtysix years past since which time she lived in our religion she finished her days in the suburb of nesin where she had lived for about eight years in the house of m crepine she lived heretofore at the rectus during about four years in the house of the marquis dalinge she passed the rest of her life since her abjuration in this city signed gaime rector of lemens     i the underwritten present rector of the said lemens certify that i have extracted this from the mortuary register of the parish church of the said place without any addition or diminution whatsoever and having collated it have found it conformable to the original in witness of all which i have signed the presents at chambery the   th of december      signed a sachod rector of lemens    miles the   th left chambery much dissatisfied for want of knowing more of it rousseau gives a good character    of the people and i wished to know them better it was the worst day i have known for months past a cold thaw of snow and rain and yet in this dreary season when nature so rarely has a smile on her countenance the environs were charming all hill and dale tossed about with so much wildness that the features are bold enough for the irregularity of a forest scene and yet withal softened and melted down by culture and habitation to be eminently beautiful    the country inclosed to the first town in france pont beauvoisin    where we dined and slept the passage of echelles cut in the rock by the sovereign of the country is a noble and stupendous work arrive at pont beauvoisin once more entering this noble kingdom and meeting with the cockades of liberty and those arms in the hands of the people which it is to be wished may be used only for their own and europes peace—   miles the   th dine at tour du pin    and sleep at verpiliere    this is the most advantageous entrance into france in respect of beauty of country from spain england flanders germany or italy by way of antibes all are inferior to this it is really beautiful and well planted has many inclosures and mulberries with some     vines there is hardly a bad feature except the houses which instead of being well built and white as in italy are ugly thatched mud cabins without chimnies the smoke issuing at a hole in the roof or at the windows glass seems unknown and there is an air of poverty and misery about them quite dissonant to the general aspect of the country coming out of tour du pin we see a great common pass bourgoyn    a large town reach verpiliere this days journey is a fine variation of hill and dale well planted with chateaux and farms and cottages spread about it a mild lovely day of sunshine threw no slight gilding over the whole for ten or twelve days past they have had on this side of the alps fine open warm weather with sunshine but on the alps themselves and in the vale of lombardy on the other side we were frozen and buried in snow at pont beauvoisin and bourgoyn our passports where demanded by the milice bourgeoise but no where else they assure us that the country is perfectly quiet every where and have no guards mounted in the villages—nor any suspicions of fugitives as in the summer not far from verpiliere pass the burnt chateau of m de veau in a fine situation with a noble wood behind it mr grundy was here in august and it had then but lately been laid in ashes and a peasant was hanging on one of the trees of the avenue by the road one among many who were seized by the milice bourgeoise for this attrocious act—   miles the   th the country changes at once from one of the finest in france it becomes almost flat and sombre arrive at lyons and there for the last time see the alps on the quay there is a very fine view of mont blanc which i had not seen before leaving italy and savoy and the alps probably never to return has something of a melancholy sensation for all those circumstances that render that classical country illustrious the seat of great men—the theatre of the most distinguished actions—the exclusive field in which the elegant and agreeable arts have loved to range—what country can be compared with italy to please the eye to charm the ear to gratify the     enquiries of a laudable curiosity whither would you travel in every bosom whatever italy is the second country in the world—of all others the surest proof that it is the first to the theatre a musical thing which called all italy by contrast to my ears what stuff is french music the distortions of embodied dissonance the theatre is not equal to that of nantes and very much inferior to that of bourdeaux—   miles the   th i had letters to mons goudard a considerable silk merchant and waiting on him yesterday he appointed me to breakfast with him this morning i tried hard to procure some information relative to the manufactures of lyons but in vain every thing was selon and suivant to mons labbé rozier author of the voluminous dictionary of agriculture in quarto i visited him as a man very much extolled and not with an idea of receiving information in the plain practical line which is the object of my enquiries from the compiler of a dictionary when mons rozier lived at beziers he occupied a considerable farm but on becoming the inhabitant of a city he placed this motto over his door—laudato ingentia rura exiguum colito  0 which is but a bad apology for no farm at all i made one or two efforts towards a little practical conversation but he flew off from that centre in such eccentric radii of science that the vanity of the attempt was obvious in the moment a physician present remarked to me that if i wanted to know common practices and products i should apply to common farmers indicating by his air and manner that such things were beneath the dignity of science mons labbé rozier is however a man of considerable knowledge though no farmer in those pursuits which he has cultivated with inclination he is justly celebrated—and he merits every elogium for having set on foot the journal de physique which take it for all and all is by far the best journal that is to be found in europe his house is beautifully situated commanding a noble prospect his library is furnished with good books and every appearance about     him points out an easy fortune waited then on mons de frossard a protestant minister who with great readiness and liberality gave me much valuable information and for my further instruction on points with which he was not equally acquainted introduced me to mons roland la platière inspector of the lyons fabrics this gentleman had notes upon many subjects which afforded an interesting conversation and as he communicated freely i had the pleasure to find that i should not quit lyons without a good portion of the knowledge i sought this gentleman somewhat advanced in life has a young and beautiful wife    the lady to whom he addressed his letters written in italy and which have been published in five or six volumes mons frossard desiring mons de la platerie to dine with him to meet me we had a great deal of conversation on agriculture manufactures and commerce and differed but little in our opinions except on the treaty of commerce between england and france which that gentleman condemned as i thought unjustly and we debated the point he warmly contended that silk ought to have been included as a benefit to france i urged that the offer was made to the french ministry and refused and i ventured to say that had it been accepted the advantage would have been on the side of england instead of france supposing according to the vulgar ideas that the benefit and the balance of trade are the same things i begged him to give me a reason for believing that france would buy the silk of piedmont and of china and work it up to undersell england while england buys the french cotton and works it into fabrics that undersell those of france even under an accumulation of charges and duties we discussed these and similar subjects with that sort of attention and candour that render them interesting to persons who love a liberal conversation upon important points—among the objects at lyons that are worthy of a strangers curiosity is the point of junction of the two great rivers the soane and the rhone lyons would doubtless be much better situated     if it were really at the junction but there is an unoccupied space sufficient to contain a city half as large as lyons itself this space is a modern embankment that cost six millions and ruined the undertakers i prefer even nantes to lyons when a city is built at the junction of two great rivers the imagination is apt to suppose that those rivers form a part of the maginificence of the scenery without broad clean and well built quays what are rivers to a city but a facility to carry coals or tarbarrels what in point of beauty has london to do with the thames except at the terrace of the adelphi and the new buildings of somersetplace any more than with fleet ditch buried as it is a common shore i know nothing in which our expectations are so horribly disappointed as in cities so very few are built with any general idea of beauty or decoration the   th early in the morning with mons frossard to view a large farm near lyons mons frossard is a steady advocate for the new constitution establishing in france at the same time all those i have conversed with in the city represent the state of the manufacture as melancholy to the last degree twenty thousand people are fed by charity and consequently very ill fed and the mass of distress in all kinds among the lower classes is greater than ever was known—or than any thing of which they had an idea the chief cause of the evil felt here is the stagnation of trade occasioned by the emigrations of the rich from the kingdom and the general want of confidence in merchants and manufacturers whence of course bankruptcies are common at a moment when they are are little able to bear additional burthens they raise by voluntary contributions for the poor immense sums so that including the revenues of the hospitals and other charitable foundations there is not paid at present for the use of the poor less than  0000 louis d or a year my fellow traveller mr grundy being desirous to get soon to paris persuaded me to travel with him in a postchaise a mode of travelling which i detest but the season urged me to it and a still stronger motive was the having of more time to pass in that city for the sake of observing the extraordinary state of things—of a king queen and     dauphin of france actual prisoners i therefore accepted his proposal and we set off after dinner today in about ten miles come to the mountains the country dreary no inclosures no mulberries no vines much waste and nothing that indicates the vicinity of such a city at arnas    sleep at a comfortable inn—   miles the  0th continue early in the morning to tarar    the mountain of which name is more formidable in reputation than in reality to st syphorien    the same features the buildings increase both in number and goodness on approaching the seine which we crossed at roane    it is here a good river and is navigable many miles higher and consequently at a vast distance from the sea there are many flat bottomed barges on it of a considerable size— 0 miles the   st another clear fine sunshiny day rarely do we see any thing like it at this season in england after droiturier    the woods of the bourbonnois commence at st gerund le puy    the country improves enlivened by white houses and chateaux and all continues fine to moulins sought here my old friend mons labbe barut and had another interview with mons le marquis degouttes concerning the sale of his chateaux and estate of riaux i desired still to have the refusal of it which he promised and will i have no doubt keep his word never have i been so tempted on any occasion as with the wish of possessing this agreeable situation in one of the finest parts of france and in the finest climate of europe god grant that should he be pleased to protract my life i may not in a sad old age repent of not closing at once with an offer to which prudence calls and prejudice only forbids heaven send me ease and tranquillity for the close of life be it passed either in suffolk or the bourbonnois—   miles january      0 nevers    makes a fine appearance rising proudly from the loire but on the first entrance it is like a thousand other places towns thus seen resemble     a groupe of women huddled close together you see their nodding plumes and sparkling gems till you fancy that ornament is the herald of beauty but on a nearer inspection the faces are too often but common clay from the hill that descends to pougues    is an extensive view to the north and after

innkeeper who exceeded in knavery all we had met with either in france or italy for supper we had a soupe maigre a partridge and a chicken roasted a plate of celery a small cauliflower two bottles of

carried to the inn not as the star but the écu de france we suspected some deceit and going out to examine the premises we found the sign to be really the écu and learned on enquiry that his own name was roux instead of foulliare he was not prepared for this detection or for the execration we poured on such an infamous conduct but he ran away in an instant and hid himself till we were gone in justice to the world however such a fellow ought to be marked out— 0 miles the  d through the forest of fontainbleau to melun and paris the sixty postes from lyons to paris making three hundred english miles cost us including   louis for     the hire of the postchaise an old french cabriolet of two wheels and the charges at the inns c     english that is to say  s per english miles or  d per head at paris i went to my old quarters the hotel de la rochefoucauld for at lyons i had received a letter from the duke de liancourt who desired me to make his house my home just as in the time of his mother my much lamented friend the dutchess destissac who died while i was in italy i found my friend lazowski well and we were à gorge deployée to converse on the amazing scenes that have taken place in france since since i left paris—   miles the  th after breakfast walk in the gardens of the thuilleries 0  where there is the most extraordinary sight that either french or english eyes could ever behold at paris the king walking with six grenadiers of the milice bourgeoise with an officer or two of his household and a page the doors of the gardens are kept shut in respect to him in order to exclude every body but deputies or those who have admissiontickets when he entered the palace the doors of the gardens were thrown open for all without distinction though the queen was still walking with a lady of her court she also was attended so closely by the gardes bourgeoise that she could not speak but in a low voice without being heard by them a mob followed her talking very loud and paying no other apparent respect than that of taking off their hats wherever she passed which was indeed more than i expected her majesty does not appear to be in health she seems to be much affected     and shews it in her face but the king is as plump as ease can render him by his orders there is a little garden railed off for the dauphin to amuse himself in and a small room is built in it to retire to in case of rain here he was at work with his little hoe and rake but not without a guard of two grenadiers he is a very pretty goodnaturedlooking boy of five or six years old with an agreeable countenance wherever he goes all hats are taken off to him which i was glad to observe all the family being kept thus close prisoners for such they are in effect afford at first view a shocking spectacle and is really so if the act were not absolutely necessary to effect the revolution this i conceive to be impossible but if it were necessary no one can blame the people for taking every measure possible to secure that liberty they had seized in the violence of a revolution at such a moment nothing is to be condemned but what endangers the national freedom i must however freely own that i have my doubts whether this treatment of the royal family can be justly esteemed any security to liberty or on the contrary whether it were not a very dangerous step that exposes to hazard whatever had been gained i have spoken with several persons today and have started objections to the present system stronger even than they appear to me in order to learn their sentiments and it is evident they are at the present moment under an apprehension of an attempt towards a counter revolution the danger of it very much if not absolutely results from the violence which has been used towards the royal family the national assembly was before that period answerable only for the permanent constitutional laws passed for the future since that moment it is equally answerable for the whole conduct of the government of the state executive as well as legislative this critical situation has made a constant spirit of exertion necessary amongst the paris militia the great object of m la fayette and the other military leaders is to improve their discipline and to bring them into such a form as to allow a rational dependence on them in case of their being wanted in the field but such is the spirit of freedom that even in the military there is so little subordination that a man is an officer today and   0 in the ranks tomorrow a mode of proceeding that makes it the more difficult to bring them to the point their leaders see necessary eight thousand men in paris may be called the standing army paid every day   f a man in which number is included the corps of the french guards from versailles that deserted to the people they have also eight hundred horse at an expence each of   00 liv   l   s  d a year and the officers have double the pay of those in the army the  th yesterdays address of the national assembly 0  to the king has done them credit with everybody i have heard it mentioned by people of very different opinions but all concur in commending it it was upon the question of naming the annual sum which should be granted for the civil list they determined to send a deputation to his majesty requesting him to name the sum himself and praying him to consult less his spirit of œconomy than a sense of that dignity which ought to environ the throne with a becoming splendour dine with the duke de liancourt at his apartments in the thuilleries which on the removal from versailles were assigned to him as grand master of the wardrobe he gives a great dinner twice a week to the deputies at which from twenty to forty are usually present half an hour after three was the hour appointed but we waited with some of the deputies that had left the assembly till seven before the duke and the rest of the company came there is in the assembly at present a writer of character 0  the author of a very able book which led me to expect     something much above mediocrity in him but he is made up of so many pretty littlenesses that i stared at him with amazement his voice is that of a feminine whisper as if his nerves would not permit such a boisterous exertion as that of speaking loud enough to be heard when he breathes out his ideas he does it with eyes half closed waves his head in circles as if his sentiments were to be received as oracles and has so much relaxation and pretension to ease and delicacy of manner with no personal appearance to second these prettinesses that i wondered by what artificial means such a mass of heterogeneous parts became compounded how strange that we should read an authors book with great pleasure that we should say this man has no stuff in him all is of consequence here is a character uncontaminated with that rubbish which we see in so many other men—and after this to meet the garb of so much littleness the  th  th and  th the duke of liancourt having an intention of taking a farm into his own hands to be conducted on improved principles after the english manner he desired me to accompany him and my friend lazowski to liancourt to give my opinion of the lands and of the best means towards executing the project which i very readily complied with i was here witness to a scene which made me smile at no great distance from the chateau of liancourt is a piece of waste land close to the road and belonging to the duke i saw some men very busily at work upon it hedging it in in small divisions levelling and digging and bestowing much labour for so poor a spot i asked the steward if he thought that land worth such an expence he replied that the poor people in the town upon the revolution taking place declared that the poor were the nation that the waste belonged to the nation and proceeding from theory to practice took possession without any further authority and began to cultivate the duke not viewing their industry with any displeasure would offer no opposition to it this circumstance shews the universal spirit that is gone forth and proves that were it pushed a little farther it might prove a serious matter for all the property in the kingdom in this case however i cannot but commend it for it there     be one public nuisance greater than another it is a man preserving the possession of waste land which he will neither cultivate himself nor let others cultivate the miserable people die for want of bread in sight of wastes that would feed thousands i think them wise and rational and philosophical in seizing such tracks and i heartily wish there was a law in england for making this action of the french peasants a legal one with us—   miles the  th at breakfast this morning in the thuilleries mons desmarets of the academy of sciences brought a memoire presenté par la societé royale dagriculture a lassemblée nationale on the means of improving the agriculture of france in which among other things they recommend great attention to bees to panification and to the obstetrick art on the establishment of a free and patriotic government to which the national agriculture might look for new and halcyon days these were objects doubtless of the first importance there are some parts of the memoir that really merit attention called on my fellow traveller mons nicolay and find him a considerable person a great hotel many servants his father a marechal of france and himself first president of a chamber in the parliament of paris having been elected deputy by the nobility of that city for the statesgeneral but declined accepting he has desired i would dine with him on sunday when he promises to have mons decretot the celebrated manufacturer and deputy from louviers at the national assembly—the count de mirebeau speaking upon the question of the members of the chamber of vacation in the parliament of rennes was truly eloquent—ardent lively energic and impetuous at night to the assembly of the duchess danville the marquis and mademe condorcet 0  there c not a word but politics     the  0th the chief leaders in the national assembly are target chapellier mirabeau barnave volney 0  the traveller and till the attack upon the property of the clergy labbé syeyes but he has been so much disgusted by that step that he is not near so forward as before the violent democrats who have the reputation of being so much republican in principle that they do not admit any political necessity for having even the name of a king are called the enragés they have a meeting at the jacobins called the revolution club which assembles every night in the very room in which the famous league was formed in the reign of henry iii and they are so numerous that all material business is there decided before it is discussed by the national assembly i called this morning on several persons all of whom are great democrats and mentioning this circumstance to them as one which savoured too much of a paris junto governing the kingdom an idea which must in the long run be unpopular and hazardous i was answered that the predominancy which paris assumed at present was absolutely necessary for the safety of the whole nation for if nothing were done but by procuring a previous common consent all great opportunities would be lost and the national assembly left constantly exposed to the danger of a counterrevolution they however admitted that it did create great jealousies and nowhere more than at versailles where some plots they added are without hatching at this moment which have the kings person for their object riots are frequent there under pretence of the price of bread and such movements are certainly very dangerous for they cannot exist so near paris without the aristocratical party of the old government endeavouring to take advantage     of them and to turn them to a very different end from what was perhaps originally intended i remarked in all these conversations that the belief of plots among the disgusted party for setting the king at liberty is general they seem almost persuaded that the revolution will not be absolutely finished before some such attempts are made and it is curious to observe that the general voice is that if an attempt were to be made in such a manner as to have the least appearance of success it would undoubtedly cost the king his life and so changed is the national character not only in point of affection for the person of their prince but also in that softness and humanity for which it has been so much admired that the supposition is made without horror or compunction in a word the present devotion to liberty is a sort of rage it absorbs every other passion and permits no other object to remain in view than what promises to confirm it dine with a large party at the duke de la rochefoucaulds ladies and gentlemen and all equally politicians but i may remark another effect of this revolution by no means unnatural which is that of lessening or rather reducing to nothing the enormous influence of the sex they mixed themselves before in everything in order to govern everything i think i see an end to it very clearly the men in this kingdom were puppets moved by their wives who instead of giving the ton in questions of national debate must now receive it and must be content to move in the political sphere of some celebrated leader—that is to say they are in fact sinking into what nature intended them for they will become more amiable and the nation better governed the   th the riots at versailles are said to be serious a plot is talked of for eight hundred men to march armed to paris at the instigation of somebody in join somebody the intention to murder la fayette bailly and necker and very wild and improbable reports are propagated every moment they have been sufficient to induce mons la fayette to issue yesterday an order concerning the mode of assembling the militia in case of any sudden alarm two pieces of cannon and eight hundred men mount guard at the thuilleries every day see some royalists     this morning who assert that the public opinion in the kingdom is changing apace that pity for the king and disgust at some proceedings of the assembly have lately done much they say that any attempt at present to rescue the king would be absurd for his present situation is doing more for him than force could effect at this moment as the general feelings of the nation are in his favour they have no scruple in declaring that a well concerted vigorous effort would place him at the head of a powerful army which could not fail of being joined by a great disgusted and injured body i remarked that every honest man must hope no such event would take place for if a counterrevolution should be effected it would establish a despotism much heavier than ever france experienced this they would not allow on the contrary they believed that no government could in future be secure that did not grant to the people more extensive rights and privileges that they possessed under the old one dine with my brother traveller the count de nicolay among the company as the count had promised me was mons decretot the celebrated manufacturer of louviers from whom i learned the magnitude of the distresses at present in normandy the cotton mills which he had shewn me last year at louviers have stood still nine months and so many spinning jennies have been destroyed by the people under the idea that such machines were contrary to their interests that the trade is in a deplorable situation in the evening accompanied mons lazowski to the italian opera la berbiera di seviglia by paiesello which is one of the most agreeable compositions of that truly great master mandini and raffanelli excellent and baletti a sweet voice there is no such comic opera to be seen in italy as this of paris and the house is always full this will work as great a revolution in french music as ever can be be wrought in french government what will they think by and by of lully and rameau and what a triumph for the manes of jean jacques the   th to the national assembly—a debate on the conduct of the chamber of vacation 0  in the parliament     of rennes continued mons labbé maury 0  a zealous royalist made a long and eloquent speech which he delivered with great fluency and precision and without any notes in defence of the parliament he replied to what had been urged by the count de mirabeau on a former day and spoke strongly on his unjustifiable call on the people of bretagne to a redoubtable denombrement he said that it would better become the members of such an assembly to count their own principles and duties and the fruits of their attention to the privileges of the subject than to call for a denombrement that would fill a province with fire and bloodshed he was interrupted by the noise and confusion of the assembly and of the audience six several times but it had no effect on him he waited calmly till it subsided and then proceeded as if no interruption had been given the speech was a very able one and much relished by the royalists but the enragés condemned it as good for nothing no other person spoke without notes the count de clermont  0 read a speech that had some brilliant passages but by no means an answer to l abbé maury as indeed it would have been wonderful if it were being prepared before he heard the abbés oration it can hardly be conceived how flat this mode of debate renders the transactions of the assembly who would be in the gallery of the english house of commons if mr pitt were to bring a written speech to be delivered on a subject on which mr fox was to speak before him and in proportion to its being uninteresting to the hearer is another evil that of lengthening their sittings since there are ten persons who will read their opinions to one that is able to deliver an impromptu the want of order and every kind     of confusion prevails now almost as much as when the assembly sat at versailles the interruptions given are frequent and long and speakers who have no right by the rules to speak will attempt it the count de mirabeau pressed to deliver his opinion after the abbé maury the president put it to the vote whether he should be allowed to speak a second time and the whole house rose up to negative it so that the first orator of the assembly has not the influence even to be heard to explain—we have no conception of such rules and yet their great number must make this necessary i forget to observe that there is a gallery at each end of the saloon which is open to all the world and side ones for admission of the friends of the members by tickets the audience in these galleries are very noisy they clap when any thing pleases them and they have been known to hiss an indecorum which is utterly destructive of freedom of debate i left the house before the whole was finished and repaired to the duke of liancourts apartments in the thuilleries to dine with his customary party of deputies mess chapellier and demeusniers were there who had both been presidents and are still members of considerable distinction m volney the celebrated traveller also was present the prince de poix the count de montmorenci c waiting for the duke of liancourt who did not arrive till half after seven with the greatest part of the company the conversation almost entirely turned upon a strong suspicion entertained of the english having made a remittance for the purpose of embroiling matters in the kingdom the count de thiard cordon blue who commands in bretagne simply stated the fact that some regiments at brest had been regular in their conduct and as much to be depended on as any in the service but that of a sudden money had found its way among the men in considerable sums and from that time their behaviour was changed one of the deputies demanding at what period he was answered    on which he immediately observed that it followed the remittance of   00000 liv        from england that had occasioned so much conjecture and conversation this remittance     which had been particularly enquired into was so mysterious and obscure that the naked fact only could be discovered but every person present asserted the truth of it other gentlemen united the two facts and were ready to suppose them connected i remarked that if england had really interfered which appeared to me incredible it was to be presumed that it would have been either in the line of her supposed interest or in that of the kings supposed inclination that these happened to be exactly the same and if money were remitted from that kingdom most assuredly it would be to support the falling interest of the crown and by no means to detach from it any force whatever in such a case remittance from england might go to metz for keeping troops to their duty but would never be sent to brest to corrupt them the idea of which was grossly absurd all seemed inclined to admit the justness of this remark but they adhered to the two facts in whatever manner they might or might not be connected at this dinner according to custom most of the deputies especially the younger ones were dressed au polisson many of them without powder in their hair and some in boots not above four or five were neatly dressed how times are changed when they had nothing better to attend to the fashionable parisians were correctness itself in all that pertained to the toilette and were therefore thought a frivolous people but now they have something of more importance than dress to occupy them and the light airy character that was usually given them will have no foundation in truth every thing in this world depends on government the   th a great commotion among the populace late last night which is said to have arisen on two accounts—one to get at the baron de besenval    who is in prison in order to hand him the other to demand bread at  f the pound they eat it at present at the rate of twentytwo millions ayear cheaper than the rest of the kingdom and yet they demand a further reduction however the current     discourse is that favras an adventurer also in prison must be hanged to satisfy the people for as to besenval the swiss cantons have remonstrated so firmly that they will not dare to execute him early in the morning the guards were doubled and eight thousand horse and foot are now patrolling the streets the report of plots to carry off the king is in the mouth of every one and it is said these movements of the people as well as those at versailles are not what they appear to be mere mobs but instigated by the aristocrats and if permitted to rise to such a height as to entangle the paris militia will prove the part only of a conspiracy against the new government that they have reason to be alert is undoubted for though there should actually be no plots in existence yet there is so great a temptation to them and such a probability of their being formed that supineness would probably create them i have met with the lieutenantcolonel of a regiment of horse who is come from his quarters and who asserts that his whole regiment officers and men are now at the kings devotion and would march wherever he called and would execute whatever he ordered not contrary to their ancient feelings but that they would not have been inclined to be so obedient before he was brought to paris and from the conversation he has had with the officers of other regiments he believes that the same spirit pervades their corps also if any serious plans have been laid for a counterrevolution or for carrying off the king and their execution has been or shall be prevented posterity will be much more likely to have information of it than this age certainly the eyes of all the sovereigns and of all the great nobility in europe are on the french revolution they look with amazement and even with terror upon a situation which may possibly be hereafter their own case and they must expect with anxiety that some attempts will be made to reverse an example that will not want copies whenever the period is favourable to make them dine at the palais royal with a select party politicians they must be if they are frenchmen the question was discussed are the plots and conspiracies of which we hear so much at present real or are they invented by the leaders of the revolution to keep up the  00 spirits of the militia in order to enable themselves to secure the government on its new foundation irreversibly the   th plots plots—the marquis la fayette last night took two hundred prisoners in the champs elysées out of eleven hundred that were collected they had powder and ball but no musquets who and what are they is the question but an answer is not so easily to be had brigands according to some accounts that have collected in paris for no good purpose people from versailles by others germans by a third but every one would make you believe they are an appendix to a plot laid for a counterrevolution reports are so various and contradictory that no dependence is to be placed on them nor credit given to onetenth of what is asserted it is singular and has been much commented on that la fayette would not trust his standing stoops as they may be called that is the eight thousand regularly paid and of whom the french guards form a considerable portion but he took for the expedition the bourgeoise only which has elated the latter as much as it has disgusted the former the moment seems big with events there is an anxiety an expectation an uncertainty and suspense that is visible in every eye one meets and even the best informed people and the least liable to be led away by popular reports are not a little alarmed at the apprehension of some unknown attempt that may be made to rescue the king and overturn the national assembly many persons are of opinion that it would not be difficult to take the king queen and dauphin away without endangering them for which attempt the thuilleries is particularly well situated provided a body of troops of sufficient force were in readiness to receive them in such a case there would be a civil war which perhaps would end in despotism whatever party came off victorious consequently such an attempt or plan could not originate in any bosom from true patriotism if i have a fair opportunity to pass much of my time in good company at paris i have also no small trouble in turning over books mss and papers which i cannot see in england this employs many hours a day with what i borrow from the night in making notes i  0  have procured also some public records the copying of which demands time he who wishes to give a good account of such a kingdom as france must be indefatigable in the search of materials for let him collect with all the care possible yet when he comes to sit down coolly to the examination and arrangement will find that much has been put into his hands of no real consequence and more possibly that is absolutely useless the   th to the palais royal to view the pictures of the duke of orleans    which i had tried once or twice before to do in vain the collection is known to be very rich in pieces of the dutch and flemish masters some finished with all the exquisite attention which that school gave to minute expression but it is a genre little interesting when the works of the great italian artists are at hand of these the collection is one of the first in the world raphael hanibal carracci titian dominichino correggio and paul veronese the first picture in the collection and one of the finest that ever came from the easel is that of the three maries and the dead christ by h carracci the powers of expression cannot go further there is the st john of raphael the same picture as those of florence and bologna and an inimitable virgin and child by the same great master a venus bathing and a magdalen by titian lucretia by andrea del sarto leda by paul veronese and also by tintoretto mars and venus and several others by paul veronese the naked figure of a woman by bonieu a french painter now living a pleasing piece some noble pictures by poussin and le seur the apartments must disappoint every one—i did not see one good room and all inferior to the rank and immense fortune of the possessor certainly the first subject in europe dine at the duke of liancourts among the company was mons de bougainville    the celebrated circumnavigator agreeable as well as sensible the count de castellane and the count  0  de montmorenci two young legislators as enragés as if their names were only bernave or rabeau in some allusions to the constitution of england i found they hold it very cheap in regard to political liberty the ideas of the moment relative to plots and conspiracies were discussed but they seemed very generally to agree that however the constitution might by such means be delayed it was now absolutely impossible to prevent its taking place at night to the national circus as it is called at the palais royal a building in the gardens or area of that palace the most whimsical and expensive folly that is easily to be imagined it is a large ball room sunk half its height under ground and as if this circumstance were not sufficiently adapted to make it damp enough a garden is planted on the roof and a river is made to flow around it which with the addition of some spirting jets deau have undoubtedly made it a delicious place for a winters entertainment the expence of this gewgaw building the project of some of the duke of orleans friends i suppose and executed at his expence would have established an english farm with all its principles buildings live stock tools and crops on a scale that would have done honour to the first sovereign of europe for it would have converted five thousand arpents of desert into a garden as to the result of the mode that has been pursued of investing such a capital i know no epithet equal to its merits it is meant to be concert ball coffee and billiard room with shops c designed to be something in the style of the amusements of our pantheon there were music and singing to night but the room being almost empty it was on the whole equally cold and sombre the   th the idea of plots and conspiracies has come to such a height as greatly to alarm the leaders of the revolution the disgust that spreads every day at their transactions arises more from the kings situation than from any other circumstance they cannot after the scenes that have passed venture to set him at liberty before the constitution is finished and they dread at the same time a change working in his favour in the minds of the people in this dilemma a plan is laid for persuading his majesty to go suddenly to the national assembly and  0  in a speech to declare himself perfectly satisfied with their proceedings and to consider himself as at the head of the revolution in terms so couched as to take away all idea or pretence of his being in a state of confinement or coercion this is at present a favourite plan the only difficulty will be to persuade the king to take a step that will apparently preclude him from whatever turn or advantage the general feeling of the provinces may work in his favour for after such a measure he will have reason to expect that his friends will second the views of the democratical party from an absolute despair of any other principles becoming efficient it is thought probable that this scheme will be brought about and if it is it will do more to ease their apprehensions of any attempts than any other plan i have been among the booksellers with a catalogue in hand to collect publications which unfortunately for my purse i find i must have on various topics that concern the present state of france—these are now every day so numerous especially on the subjects of commerce colonies finances taxation deficit c not to speak of the subject immediately of the revolution itself that it demands many hours every day to lessen the number to be bought by reading pen in hand the collection the duke of liancourt has made from the very commencement of the revolution at the first meeting of the notables is prodigious and has cost many hundred louis dors it is uncommonly complete and will hereafter be of the greatest value to consult on abundance of curious questions the   th the plan i mentioned yesterday that was proposed to the king was urged in vain his majesty received the proposition in such a manner as does not leave any great hope of the scheme being executed but the marquis la fayette is so strenuous for its being brought about that it will not yet be abandoned but proposed again at a more favourable moment the royalists who know of this plan for the public have it not are delighted at the chance of its failing the refusal is attributed to the queen another circumstance which gives great disquiet at present to the leaders of the revolution are the accounts daily received from all parts of the kingdom of  0  the distress and even starving condition of the manufacturers artists    and sailors which grow more and more serious and must make the idea of an attempt to overturn the revolution so much the more alarming and dangerous the only branch of industry in the kingdom that remains flourishing is the trade to the sugarcolonies and the scheme of emancipating the negroes or at least of putting an end to importing them which they borrowed from england has thrown nantes havre marseilles bourdeaux and all other places connected secondarily with that commerce into the utmost agitation the count de mirabeau says publicly that he is sure of carrying the vote to put an end to negro slavery—it is very much the conversation at present and principally amongst the leaders who say that as the revolution was founded on philosophy and supported by metaphysics such a plan cannot but be congenial but surely trade depends on practice much more than on theory and the planters and merchants who come to paris to oppose the scheme are better prepared to shew the importance of their commerce than to reason philosophically on the demerits of slavery many publications have appeared on the subject—some deserving attention the   th at the duke of liancourts dinner today meet the marquis de casaux the author of the mechanism of societies notwithstanding all the warmth and even fire of argument and vivacity of manner and composition for which his writings are remarkable he is perfectly mild and placid in conversation with little of that effervescence one would look for from his books there was a remarkable assertion made today at table by the count de marguerite before near thirty deputies speaking of the determination on the toulon business    he said it was openly supported by deputies under the avowal that more insurrections were  0  necessary i looked round the table expecting some decisive answer to be given to this and was amazed to find that no one replied a word mons volney the traveller after a pause of some moments declared that he thought the people of toulon had acted right and were justifiable in what they had done the history of this toulon business is known to all the world this count de marguerite has a tetê dure and a steady conduct—it may be believed that he is not an enragé at dinner m blin deputy from spain mentioning the conduct of the revolution club at the jacobins said we have given you a good president and then asked the count why he did not come among them he answered je me trouve heureux en verité de navoir jamais été daucune société politique particulière je pense que mes fonctions sont publiques et quelles peuvent aisêment se remplir sans associations particulières he got no reply here—at night mons decretot and mons blin carried me to the revolution club at the jacobins the room where they assemble is that in which the famous league was signed as it has been observed above there were above one hundred deputies present with a president in the chair i was handed to him and announced as the author of the arithmétique politique the president standing up repeated my name to the company and demanded if there were any objections—none and this is all the ceremony not merely of an introduction but an election for i was told that now i was free to be present when i pleased being a foreigner ten or a dozen other elections were made in this club the business that is to be brought into the national assembly is regularly debated the motions are read that are intended to be made there and rejected or corrected and approved when these have been fully agreed to the whole party are engaged to support them plans of conduct are there determined proper persons nominated for being of committees and presidents of the assembly named and i may add that such is the majority of numbers that whatever passes in this club is almost sure to pass in the assembly in the evening at the dutchess danvilles in whose house i never failed of spending my time agreeably one of the most amusing circumstances of travelling  0  into other countries is the opportunity of remarking the difference of customs amongst different nations in the common occurrences of life in the art of living the french have generally been esteemed by the rest of europe to have made the greatest proficiency and their manners have been accordingly more imitated and their customs more adopted than those of any other nation of their cookery there is but one opinion for every man in europe that can afford a great table either keeps a french cook or one instructed in the same manner that it is far beyond our own i have no doubt in asserting we have about half a dozen real english dishes that exceed any thing in my opinion to be met with in france by english dishes i mean a turbot and lobster sauce—ham and chicken—turtle—a haunch of venison—a turkey and oysters—and after these there is an end of an english table it is an idle prejudice to class roast beef among them for there is not better beef in the world than at paris large handsome pieces were almost constantly on the considerable tables i have dined at the variety given by their cooks to the same thing is astonishing they dress an hundred dishes in an hundred different ways and most of them excellent and all sorts of vegetables have a savouriness and flavour from rich sauces that are absolutely wanted to our greens boiled in water this variety is not striking in the comparison of a great table in france with another in england but it is manifest in an instant between the tables of a french and english family of small fortune the english dinner of a joint of meat and a pudding as it is called or pot luck with a neighbour is bad luck in england the same fortune in france gives by means of cookery only at least four dishes to one among us and spreads a small table incomparably better a regular dessert with us is expected at a considerable table only or at a moderate one when a formal entertainment is given in france it is as essential to the smallest dinner as to the largest if it consists only of a bunch of dried grapes or an apple it will be as regularly served as the soup i have met with persons in england who imagine the sobriety of a french table carried to such a length that one or two glasses of wine are all that a man  0  can get at dinner this is an error your servant mixes the wine and water in what proportion you please and large bowls of clean glasses are set before the master of the house and some friends of the family at different parts of the table for serving the richer and rarer sorts of wines which are drunk in this manner freely enough the whole nation are scrupulously neat in refusing to drink out of glasses used by other people at the house of a carpenter or blacksmith a tumbler is set to every cover this results from the common beverage being wine and water but if at a large table as in england there were porter beer cyder and perry it would be impossible for three or four tumblers or goblets to stand by every plate and equally so for the servants to keep such a number separate and distinct in tablelinen they are i think cleaner and wiser than the english that the change may be incessant it is every where coarse the idea of dining without a napkin seems ridiculous to a frenchman but in england we dine at the tables of people of tolerable fortune without them a journeyman carpenter in france has his napkin as regularly as his fork and at an inn the fille always lays a clean one to every cover that is spread in the kitchen for the lowest order of pedestrian travellers the expence of linen in england is enormous from its fineness surely a great change of that which is coarse would be much more rational in point of cleanliness i think the merit of the two nations is divided the french are cleaner in their persons and the english in their houses i speak of the mass of the people and not of individuals of considerable fortune a bidet in france is as universally in every apartment as a bason to wash your hands which is a trait of personal cleanliness i wish more common in england on the other hand their necessary houses are temples of abomination and the practice of spitting about a room which is amongst the highest as well as the lowest ranks is detestable i have seen a gentleman spit so near the cloaths of a dutchess that i have stared at his unconcern in every thing that concerns the stables the english far exceed the french horses grooms harness and change of equipage in the provinces you see cabriolets undoubtedly of the last century an  0  englishman however small his fortune may be will not be seen in a carriage of the fashion of forty years past if he cannot have another he will walk on foot it is not true that there are no complete equipages at paris i have seen many the carriage horses harness and attendance without fault or blemish—but the number is certainly very much inferior to what are seen at london english horses grooms and carriages have been of late years largely imported in all the articles of the fitting up and furnishing houses including those of all ranks in the estimate the english have made advances far beyond their neighbours mahogany is scarce in france but the use of it is profuse in england some of the hotels in paris are immense in size from a circumstance which would give me a good opinion of the people if nothing else did which is the great mixture of families when the eldest son marries he brings his wife home to the house of his father where there is an apartment provided for them and if a daughter does not wed an eldest son her husband is also received into the family in the same way which makes a joyous number at every table this cannot altogether be attributed to œconomical motives though they certainly influence in many cases because it is found in families possessing the first properties in the kingdom it does with french manners and customs but in england it is sure to fail and equally so amongst all ranks of people may we not conjecture with a great probability of truth that the nation in which it succeeds is therefore better tempered nothing but good humour can render such a jumble of families agreeable or even tolerable in dress they have given the ton to all europe for more than a century but this is not among any but the highest rank an object of such expence as in england where the mass of mankind wear much better things to use the language of common conversation than in france this struck me more amongst ladies who on an average of all ranks do not dress at one half of the expence of english women volatility and changeableness are attributed to the french as national characteristicks—but in the case of dress with the grossest exaggeration fashions change with ten times more rapidity in england in form colour and assemblage  0  the vicissitudes of every part of dress are phantastic with us i see little of this in france and to instance the mode of dressing the gentlemens hair while it has been varied five times at london it has remained the same at paris nothing contributes more to make them a happy people than the chearful and facile pliancy of disposition with which they adapt themselves to the circumstances of life this they possess much more than the high and volatile spirits which have been attributed to them one excellent consequence is a greater exemption from the extravagance of living beyond their fortunes than is met with in england in the highest ranks of life there are instances in all countries but where one gentleman of small property in the provinces of france runs out his fortune there are ten such in england that do it in the blended idea i had formed of the french character from reading i am disappointed from three circumstances which i expected to find predominant on comparison with the english i looked for great talkativeness volatile spirits and universal politeness i think on the contrary that they are not so talkative as the english have not equally good spirits and are not a jot more polite nor do i speak of certain classes of people but of the general mass i think them however incomparably better tempered and i propose it as a question whether good temper be not more reasonably expected under an arbitrary than under a free government the   th my last day in paris and therefore employed in waiting on my friends to take leave amongst whom the duke de liancourt holds the first place a nobleman to whose uninterrupted polite and friendly offices i owe the agreeable and happy hours which i have passed at paris and whose kindness continued so much to the last as to require a promise that if i should return to france his house either in town or country should be my home i shall not omit observing that his conduct in the revolution has been direct and manly from the very beginning his rank family fortune and situation at court all united to make him one of the first subjects in the kingdom and upon the public affairs being sufficiently embroiled to make assemblies of the nobility necessary his   0 determination to render himself master of the great questions which were then in debate was seconded by that attention and application which was necessary in a period when none but men of business could be of importance in the state from the first assembling of the states general he resolved to take the party of freedom and would have joined the tiers at first if the orders of his constituents had not prevented it he desired them however either to consent to that step or to elect another representative and at the same time with equal liberality he declared that if ever the duty he owed his country became incompatible with his office at court he would resign it an act that was not only unnecessary but would have been absurd after the king himself had become a party in the revolution by espousing the popular cause he acted conformably to the principles of all his ancestors who in the civil wars and confusions of the preceding centuries uniformly opposed the arbitrary proceedings of the court the decisive steps which this nobleman took at versailles in advising the king c c are known to all the world he is undoubtedly to be esteemed one of those who have had a principal share in the revolution but he has been invariably guided by constitutional motives for it is certain that he has been as much averse from unnecessary violence and sanguinary measures as those who were the most attached to the ancient government—with my excellent friend lazowski i spent my last evening he endeavouring to persuade me to reside upon a farm in france and i enticing him to quit french bustle for english tranquillity the  0th  th by the diligence to london where i arrived the   th though in the most commodious seat yet languishing for a horse which after all affords the best means of travelling passing from the first company of paris to the rabble which one sometimes meets in diligences is contrast sufficient—but the idea of returning to england to my family and friends made all things appear smooth—    miles the  0th to bradfield and here terminate i hope my travels after having surveyed the agriculture and political resources of england and ireland to do the same     with france was certainly a great object the importance of which animated me to the attempt and however pleasing it may be to hope for the ability of giving a better account of the agriculture of france than has ever been laid before the public yet the greatest satisfaction i feel at present is the prospect of remaining for the future on a farm in that calm and undisturbed retirement which is suitable to my fortune and which i trust will be agreeable to my disposition—   miles     on the revolution of france the gross infamy which attended lettres de cachet and the bastile during the whole reign of louis xv made them esteemed in england by people not well informed as the most prominent features of the despotism of france they were certainly carried to an access hardly credible to the length of being sold with blanks to be filled up with names at the pleasure of the purchaser who was thus able in the gratification of private revenge to tear a man from the bosom of his family and bury him in a dungeon where he would exist forgotten and die unknown —but such excesses could not be common in any     country and they were reduced almost to nothing from the accession of the present king the great mass of the people by which i mean the lower and middle ranks could suffer very little from such engines and as few of them are objects of jealousy had there been nothing else to complain of it is not probable they would ever have been brought to take arms the abuses attending the levy of taxes were heavy and universal the kingdom was parcelled into generalities with an intendant at the head of each into whose hands the whole power of the crown was delegated for every thing except the military authority but particularly for all affairs of finance the generalities were subdivided into elections at the head of which was a subdelegué appointed by the intendant the rolls of the taille capitation vingtiêmes and other taxes were distributed among districts parishes and individuals at the pleasure of the intendant who could exempt change add or diminish at pleasure such an enormous power constantly acting and from which no man was free might in the nature of things degenerate in many cases into absolute tyranny it must be obvious that the friends acquaintances and dependents of the intendant and of all his subdelegués and the friends of these friends to a long chain of dependence might be favoured in taxation at the expence of their miserable neighbours and that noblemen in favour at court to whose protection the intendant himself would naturally look up could find little difficulty in throwing much of the weight of their taxes on others without a similar support instances and even gross ones have been reported to me in many parts of the kingdom that made me shudder at the oppression to which numbers must have been condemned by the undue favours granted to such crooked influence but without recurring to such cases what must have been the state of the poor people paying heavy taxes from which the nobility and clergy were exempted a cruel aggravation of their misery to see those who could best afford to pay exempted because able     —the inrolments for the militia which the cahiers call an injustice without example  were another dreadful scourge on the peasantry and as married men were exempted from it occasioned in some degree that mischievous population which brought beings into the world in order for little else than to be starved the corvées or police of the roads were annually the ruin of many hundreds of farmers more than  00 were reduced to beggary in filling up one vale in loraine all these oppressions fell on the tiers état only the nobility and clergy having been equally exempted from tailles militia and corvées the penal code of finance makes one shudder at the horrors of punishment inadequate to the crime  a few features will sufficiently characterize the old government of france   smugglers of salt armed and assembled to the number of five in provence a fine of  00 liv and nine years gallies—in all the rest of the kingdom death   smugglers armed assembled but in number under five a fine of  00 liv and three years gallies second offence death   smugglers without arms but with

the saltworks or the revenue if smugglers death and such as assist in the theft of salt in the transport hanged   soldiers smuggling with arms are hanged without arms gallies for life  0 buying smuggled salt to resell it the same punishments as for smuggling    persons in the salt employments empowered if two or one with two witnesses to enter and examine houses even of the privileged orders    all families and persons liable to the taille in the provinces of the grandes gabelles inrolled and their consumption of salt for the pot and saliére that is the daily consumption exclusive of salting meat c c estimated at  lb a head per annum which quantity they are forced to buy whether they want it or not under the pain of various fines according to the case the capitaineries were a dreadful scourge on all the occupiers of land by this term is to be understood the paramountship of certain districts granted by the king to princes of the blood by which they were put in possession of the property of all game even on lands not belonging to them and what is very singular on manors granted long before to individuals so that the erecting of a district into a capitainerie was an annihilation of all manorial rights to game within it this was a trifling business in comparison to other circumstances for in speaking of the preservation of the game in these capitaineries it must be observed that by game it must be understood whole droves of wild boars and herds of deer not confined by any wall or pale but wandering at pleasure over the whole country to the destruction of crops and to the peopling of the gallies by the wretched peasants who presumed to kill them in     order to save that food which was to support their helpless children the game in the capitainerie of montceau in four parishes only did mischief to the amount of        liv per annum  no wonder then that we should find the people asking nous demandons à grand cris la destruction des capitaineries  celle de toute sorte de gibier  and what are we to think of demanding as a favour the permission—de nettoyer ses grains de faucher les prés artificiels  denlever ses chaumes sans égard pour la perdrix on tout autre gibier  now an english reader will scarcely understand it without being told that there were numerous edicts for preserving the game which prohibited weeding and hoeing lest the young partridges should be disturbed steeping seed lest it should injure the game manuring with night soil lest the flavour of the partridges should be injured by feeding on the corn so produced mowing hay c before a certain time so late as to spoil many crops and taking away the stubble which would deprive the birds of shelter the tyranny exercised in these capitaineries which extended over  00 leagues of country was so great that many cahiers demanded the utter suppression of them  such were the exertions of arbitrary power which the lower orders felt directly from the royal authority but heavy as they were it is a question whether the others suffered circuitously through the nobility and the clergy were not yet more oppressive nothing can exceed the complaints made in the cahiers under this head they speak of the dispensation of justice in the manorial courts as comprizing every species of despotism the districts indeterminate—appeals endless—irreconcileable to liberty and prosperity—and irrevocably proscribed in the opinion of the public  —augmenting litigations—favouring every species of chicane—ruining     the parties—not only by enormous expences on the most petty objects but by a dreadful loss of time the judges commonly ignorant pretenders who hold their courts in cabarets and are absolutely dependent on the seigneurs in consequence of their feudal powers they are vexations

be free and hope that posterity if possible may be ignorant that feudal tyranny in bretagne armed with the judicial power has not blushed even in these times at breaking handmills and at selling annually to the miserable the faculty of     bruising between two stones a measure of buckwheat or barley   the very terms of these complaints are unknown in england and consequently untranslatable

civerage taillabilité vingtain   sterlage bordelage   minage   ban de vendanges droit daccapte   in passing through many of the french provinces i was struck with the various and heavy complaints of the farmers and little proprietors of the feudal grievances with the weight of which their industry was burthened but i could not then conceive the multiplicity of the shackles which kept them poor and depressed i understood it better afterwards from the conversation and complaints of some grand seigneurs as the revolution advanced and i then learned that the principal rental of many estates consisted in services and feudal tenures by the baneful influence of which the industry of the people was almost exterminated in regard to the oppressions of the clergy as to tythes i must do   0 that body a justice to which a claim cannot be laid in england though the ecclesiastical tenth was levied in france more severely than usual in italy yet was it never exacted with such horrid greediness as is at present the disgrace of england when taken in kind no such thing was known in any part of france where i made inquiries as a tenth it was always a twelfth or a thirteenth or even a twentieth of the produce and in no part of the kingdom did a new article of culture pay any thing thus turnips cabbages clover chicorée potatoes c c paid nothing in many parts meadows were exempted silk worms nothing olives in some places paid—in more they did not cows nothing lambs from the   th to the   st wool nothing—such mildness in the levy of this odious tax is absolutely unknown in england but mild as it was the burthen to people groaning under so many other oppressions united to render their situation so bad that no change could be for the worse but these were not all the evils with which the people struggled the administration of justice was partial venal infamous i have in conversation with many very sensible men in different parts of the kingdom met with something of content with their government in all other respects than this but upon the question of expecting justice to be really and fairly administered every one confessed there was no such thing to be looked for the conduct of the parliaments was profligate and atrocious upon almost every cause that came before them interest was openly made with the judges and woe betided the man who with a cause to support had no means of conciliating favour either by the beauty of a handsome wife or by other methods it has been said by many writers that property was as secure under the old government of france as it is in england and the assertion might possibly be true as far as any violence from the king his ministers or the great was concerned but for all that mass of property which comes in every country to be litigated in courts of justice there was not even the shadow of security unless the parties were totally and equally unknown and totally and equally honest in every other case he who had the best interest with the judges was sure to be the winner to reflecting minds the     cruelty and abominable practice attending such courts are sufficiently apparent there was also a circumstance in the constitution of these parliaments but little known in england and which under such a government as that of france must be considered as very singular they had the power and were in the constant practice of issuing decrees without the consent of the crown and which had the force of laws through the whole of their jurisdiction and of all other laws these were sure to be the best obeyed for as all infringements of them were brought before sovereign courts composed of the same persons who had enacted these laws a horrible system of tyranny they were certain of being punished with the last severity it must appear strange in a government so despotic in some respects as that of france to see the parliaments in every part of the kingdom making laws without the kings consent and even in defiance of his authority the english whom i met in france in      were surprized to see some of these bodies issuing arrêts against the export of corn out out of the provinces subject to their jurisdiction into the neighbouring provinces at the same time that the king through the organ of so popular a minister as mons necker was decreeing an absolutely free transport of corn throughout the kingdom and even at the requisition of the national assembly itself but this was nothing new it was their common practice the parliament of rouen passed an arrêt against killing of calves it was a preposterous one and opposed by administration but it had its full force and had a butcher dared to offend against it he would have found by the rigour of his punishment who was his master innoculation was favoured by the court in louis xvs time but the parliament of paris passed an arrêt against it much more effective in prohibiting than the favour of the court in encouraging that practice instances are innumerable and i may remark that the bigotry ignorance false principles and tyranny of these bodies were generally conspicuous and that the court taxation excepted never had a dispute with a parliament but the parliament was sure to be wrong their constitution in respect to the administration of justice was so truly rotten that the members sat as judges     even in causes of private property in which they were themselves the parties and have in this capacity been guilty of oppressions and cruelties which the crown has rarely dared to attempt it is impossible to justify the excesses of the people on their taking up arms they were certainly guilty of cruelties it is idle to deny the facts for they have been proved too clearly to admit of a doubt but is it really the people to whom we are to impute the whole—or to their oppressors who had kept them so long in a state of bondage he who chooses to be served by slaves and by illtreated slaves must know that he holds both his property and life by a tenure far different from those who prefer the service of well treated freemen and he who dines to the music of groaning sufferers must not in the moment of insurrection complain that his daughters are ravished and then destroyed and that his sons throats are cut when such evils happen they surely are more imputable to the tyranny of the master than to the cruelty of the servant the analogy holds with the french peasants—the murder of a seigneur or a chateau in flames is recorded in every newspaper the rank of the person who suffers attracts notice but where do we find the register of that seigneurs oppressions of his peasantry and his exactions of feudal services from those whose children were dying around them for want of bread   where do we find the minutes that assigned these starving wretches to some vile pettyfogger to be fleeced by impositions and a mockery of justice in the seigneural courts who gives us the awards of the intendant and his subdelegués which took off the taxes of a man of fashion and laid them with accumulated weight on the poor who were so unfortunate as to be his neighbours who has dwelt sufficiently upon explaining all the ramifications of despotism regal aristocratical and ecclesiastical pervading the whole mass of the people reaching like a circulating fluid the most distant capillary tubes of poverty and wretchedness in these cases the sufferers are too ignoble to be known and the mass too indiscriminate to be pitied but should a philosopher     feel and reason thus should he mistake the cause for the effect and giving all his pity to the few feel no compassion for the many because they suffer in his eyes not individually but by millions the excesses of the people cannot i repeat be justified it would undoubtedly have done them credit both as men and christians if they had possessed their new acquired power with moderation but let it be remembered that the populace in no country ever use power with moderation excess is inherent in their aggregate constitution and as every government in the world knows that violence infallibly attends power in such hands it is doubly bound in common sense and for common safety so to conduct itself that the people may not find an interest in public confusions they will always suffer much and long before they are effectually roused nothing therefore can kindle the flame but such oppressions of some classes or order in the society as give able men the opportunity of seconding the general mass discontent will soon diffuse itself around and if the government take not warning in time it is alone answerable for all the burnings and plunderings and devastation and blood that follow the true judgment to be formed of the french revolution must surely be gained from an attentive consideration of the evils of the old government when these are well understood—and when the extent and universality of the oppression under which the people groaned—oppression which bore upon them from every quarter it will scarcely be attempted to be urged that a revolution was not absolutely necessary to the welfare of the kingdom not one opposing voice   can with reason be raised against this assertion     abuses ought certainly to be corrected and corrected effectually this could not be done without the establishment of a new form of government whether the form that has been adopted were the best is another question absolutely distinct but that the abovementioned detail of enormities practised on the people required some great change is sufficiently apparent and i cannot better conclude such a list of detestable oppressions than in the words of the tiers etat of nivernois who hailed the approaching day of liberty with an eloquence worthy of the subject les plaintes du peuple se sont longtems perdues dans lespace immense qui le sépare du trône cette classe la plus nombreuse  la plus intéressante de la societé cette classe qui mérite les premiers soins du gouvernement

raison léquité lopinion générale la bienfaisance connue de notre auguste souverain tout concours à assurer le succès de nos doléances having seen the propriety or rather the necessity of some change in the government let us next briefly inquire into the effects of the revolution on the principal interests in the kingdom in respect to all the honours power and profit derived to the nobility from the feudal system which was of an extent in france beyond any thing known in england since the revolution or long parliament of    0 all is laid in the dust without a rag or remnant being spared   the importance of these both in influence and revenue was so great that the result is all but ruin to numbers however as these properties were really tyrannies as they rendered the possession of one spot of land ruinous to all round it—and equally subversive of agriculture and the common rights of mankind the utter destruction brought on all this species of property does not ill deserve the epithet they are so fond of in france it is a real regeneration of the people to the privileges of human nature no man of common feelings can regret the fall of all of that abominable system which made a whole parish slaves to the lord of the manor but the effects of the revolution     have gone much farther and have been attended with consequences not equally justifiable the rents of land which are as legal under the new government as they were under the old are no longer paid with regularity i have been lately informed august      on authority not to be doubted that associations among tenantry to a great amount and extent have been formed even within fifty miles of paris for the nonpayment of rent saying in direct terms we are strong enough to detain the rent and you are not strong enough to enforce the payment in a country where such things are possible property of every kind it must be allowed is in a dubious situation very evil consequences will result from this arrears will accumulate too great for landlords to lose or for the peasants to pay who will not easily be brought to relish that order and legal government which must necessarily secure these arrears to their right owners in addition to all the rest by the new system of taxation there is laid a landtax of  00 millions or not to exceed  s in the pound but under the old government their vingtiemes did not amount to the seventh part of such an impost in whatever light therefore the case of french landlords is viewed it will appear that they have suffered immensely by the revolution—that many of them deserved it cannot however be doubted since we see their cahiers demanding steadily that all their feudal rights should be confirmed   that the carrying of arms should be strictly prohibited to every body but noblemen   that the infamous arrangements of the militia should remain on its old footing 0 that breaking up wastes and inclosing commons should be prohibited   that the nobility alone should be eligible to enter into the army church c   that lettres de cachet should continue       that the press should not be free   and in fine that there should be no free corn trade   to the clergy the revolution has been yet more fatal one word will dispatch this inquiry the revolution was a decided benefit to all the lower clergy of the kingdom but it was destructive of all the rest it is not easy to know what they lost on the one hand or what the national account will gain on the other mons necker calculates their revenue at   0000000 liv of which only    00000 liv were in the hands of the curés of the kingdom their wealth has been much exaggerated a late writer says they possessed half the kingdom   their number was as little known as their revenue one writer makes them  00000   another    00   a third  0000   the clergy in france have been supposed by many persons in england to merit their fate from their peculiar profligacy but the idea is not accurate that so large a body of men possessed of very great revenues should be free from vice would be improbable or rather impossible but they preserved what is not always preserved in england an exterior decency of behaviour—one did not find among them poachers or foxhunters who having spent the morning in scampering after hounds dedicate the evening to the bottle and reel from inebriety to the pulpit such advertisements were never seen in france as i have heard of in england—wanted a curacy in a good sporting country     where the duty is light and the neighbourhood convivial the proper exercise for a country clergyman is the employment of agriculture which demands strength and activity—and which vigorously followed will fatigue enough to give ease its best relish a sportsman parson may be as as he often is in england a good sort of man and an honest fellow but certainly this pursuit and the resorting to obscene comedies and kicking their heels in the jig of an assembly are not the occupations for which we can suppose tythes are given 0 whoever will give any attention to the demands of the clergy in their cahiers will see that there was on many topics an ill spirit in that body they maintain for instance that the liberty of the press ought rather to be restrained than extended   that the laws against it should be renewed and executed   that admission into religious orders should be as formerly at sixteen years of age   that lettres de cachet are useful and even necessary   they solicit to prohibit all division of commons   —to revoke the edict allowing inclosures   that the export of corn be not allowed   and that public granaries be established    a the ill effects of the revolution have been felt more severely by the manufacturers of the kingdom than by any other class of the people the rivalry of the english fabrics in      and      was strong and successful and the confusions that followed in all parts of the kingdom had the effect of lessening the incomes of so many landlords clergy and men in public employments and such numbers fled from the kingdom that the general mass of the consumption of national fabrics sunk perhaps threefourths the men whose incomes were untouched lessened their consumption greatly from an apprehension of the     unsettled state of things the prospects of a civil war suggested to every man that his safety perhaps his future bread depended on the money which he could hoard the inevitable consequence was turning absolutely out of employment immense numbers of workmen i have in the diary of the journey noticed the misery to which i was a witness at lyons abbeville amiens c and by intelligence i understood that it was still worse at rouen the fact could hardly be otherwise this effect which was absolute death by starving many thousands of families was a result that in my opinion might have been avoided it flowed only from carrying things to extremities—from driving the nobility out of the kingdom and seizing instead of regulating the whole regal authority these violences were not necessary to liberty they even destroyed true liberty by giving the government of the kingdom in too great a degree to paris and to the populace of every town the effect of the revolution to the small proprietors of the kingdom must according to common nature of events be in the end remarkably happy and had the new government adopted any principles of taxation except those of the œconomistes establishing at the same time an absolute freedom in the business of inclosure and in the police of corn the result would probably have been advantageous even at this recent period the committee of imposts   mention and i doubt not their accuracy the prosperity of agriculture in the same page in which they lament the depression of every other brance of the national industry upon a moderate calculation there remained in the hands of the classes depending on land on the account of taxes in the years      and    0 at least  00000000 liv the execution of corvées was as lax as the payment of taxes to this we are to add two years tythe which i cannot estimate at less than  00000000 liv more the abolition of all feudal rents and payments of every sort during those two years could not be less than  00000000 liv including services but all these articles great as they were amounting to near  00000000 liv were less than the immense sums that came into the hands of the farmers   0 by the high price of corn throughout the year      a price arising almost entirely from mons neckers fine operations in the corn trade as it has been proved at large it is true there is a deduction to be made on account of the unavoidable diminution of consumption in every article of land produce not essentially necessary to life every object of luxury or tending to it is lessened greatly but after this discount is allowed the balance in favour of the little proprietor farmers must be very great the benefit of such a sum being added as it is to the capital of husbandry needs no explanation their agriculture must be invigorated by such wealth—by the freedom enjoyed by its its professors by the destruction of its innumerable shackles and even by the distresses of other employments occasioning new and great investments of capital in land and these leading facts will appear in a clearer light when the prodigious division of landed property in france is well considered probably half perhaps twothirds of the kingdom are in the possession of little proprietors who paid quitrents and feudal duties for the spots they farmed such men are placed at once in comparative affluence and as ease is thus acquired by at least half the kingdom it must not be set down as a point of trifling importance should france escape a civil war she will in the prosperity of these men find a resource which politicians at a distance do not calculate with rents the case is certainly different for beyond all doubt landlords will sooner or later avail themselves of these circumstances by advancing their rents acting in this respect as in every other country is common but they will find it impossible to deprive the tenantry of a vast advantage necessarily flowing from their emancipation the confusion which has since arisen in the finances owing almost entirely to the mode of taxation adopted by the assembly has had the effect of continuing to the present moment      a freedom from all impost to the little proprietors which however dreadful its general effects on the national affairs has tended strongly to enrich this class the effects of the revolution not on any particular class of cultivators but on agriculture in general is with me i must confess very questionable i see no benefits flowing     particularly to agriculture liberty applies equally to all classes and is not yet sufficiently established for the protection of property except the case of tythes but i see the rise of many evils restrictions and prohibitions on the trade of corn—a varying landtax—and impeded inclosures are mischiefs on principle that may have a generative faculty and will prove infinite drawbacks from the prosperity which certainly was attainable it is to be hoped that the good sense of the assembly will reverse this system by degrees for if it is not reversed agriculture cannot flourish the effect of the revolution on the public revenue is one great point on which mons de calonne lays considerable stress and it has been since urged in france that the ruin of  0000 families thrown absolutely out of employment and consequently out of bread in the collection of taxes on salt and tobacco only has had a powerful influence in spreading universal distress and misery the public revenue sunk in one year     millions this was not a loss of that sum the people to whom assignats were paid on that account lost no more than the discount the loss therefore to the people to whom that revenue was paid could amount to no more than from   to  0 per cent   but was it a loss to the miserable subjects who formerly paid those taxes and who paid them by the sweat of their brows at the expence of the bread out of their childrens mouths assessed with tyranny and levied in blood do they feel a loss in having     millions in their pockets in      more than they had in      and in possessing other     millions more in    0 and the inheritance in future is not such a change ease wealth life and animation to those classes who while the pens of political satirists slander all innovations are every moment reviving by inheriting from that revolution something which the old government assuredly did not give the revenue of the clergy may be called the revenue of the public—those to whom the difference between the present payment of one     hundred and forty millions and the old tythes are a deduction of all revenue are beyond doubt in great distress but what say the farmers throughout the kingdom from whom the detestable burthen of those taxes were extorted do not they find their culture lightened their industry freed their products their own go to the aristocratical politician at paris or at london and you hear only of the ruin of france—go to the cottage of the métayer or the house of the farmer and demand of him what the result has been—there will be but one voice from calais to bayonne if tythes were to be at one stroke abolished in england 0 no doubt the clergy would suffer but would not the agriculture of the kingdom with every man dependent on it rise with a vigour never before experienced future effects it would betray no inconsiderable presumption to attempt to predict what will be the event of the revolution now passing in france i am not so imprudent but there are considerations that may be offered to the attention of those who love to speculate on future events better than i do there are three apparent benefits in an aristocracy forming the part of a constitution first the fixed consolidated and hereditary importance of the great nobility is for the most part a bar to the dangerous pretensions and illegal views of a victorious and highly popular king president or leader assemblies so elected as to be swayed absolutely by the opinion of the people would frequently under such a prince be ready to grant him much more than a well constituted aristocratic senate secondly such popular assemblies as i have just described are sometimes led to adopt decisions too hastily and too     imprudently and particularly in the case of wars with neighbouring nations in the free countries we have known the commonalty have been too apt to call lightly for them an aristocracy not unduly influenced by the crown stands like a rock against such phrenzies and hath a direct interest in the encouragement and support of peaceable maxims the remark is applicable to many other subjects in which mature deliberation is wanted to ballast the impetuosity of the people i always suppose the aristocratic body well constituted upon the basis of a sufficient property and at the same time no unlimited power in the crown to throw all the property of the kingdom into the same scale which is the case in england thirdly whatever benefits may arise from the existence of an executive power distinct from the legislative must absolutely depend on some intermediate and independent body between the people and the executive power every one must grant that if there be no such body the people are enabled when they please to annihilate the executive authority—and assign it as in the case of the long parliament to committees of their own representatives or which is the same thing they may appear as they did at versailles armed before the king and insist on his consent to any propositions they bring him in these cases the seeming advantages derived from a distinct executive power are lost and it must be obvious that in such a constitution as the present one of france the kingly office can be put down as easily and a readily as a secretary can be reprimanded for a false entry in the journals if a constitution be good all great changes in it should be esteemed a matter of great difficulty and hazard it is in bad ones only that alterations should not be looked upon in a formidable light that these circumstances may prove advantages in an aristocratical portion of a legislature there is reason to believe the inquiry is whether they be counterbalanced by possible or probable evils may there not come within this description the danger of an aristocracy uniting with crown against the people that is to say influencing by weight of property and power a great mass of the people dependent—against the rest of the people who are independent do we not see this to be very much the case in     england at this moment to what other part of our constitution is it imputable that we have been infamously involved in perpetual wars from which none reap any benefit but that tribe of vermin which thrive most when a nation most declines contractors victuallers paymasters stockjobbers and moneyscriveners a set by whom ministers are surrounded and in favour of whom whole classes amongst the people are beggared and ruined those who will assert a constitution can be good   which suffers these things ought at least to agree that such an one as would not suffer them would be much better   if an aristocracy have thus its advantages and disadvantages it is natural to inquire whether the french nation be likely to establish something of a senate that shall have the advantages without the evils if there should be none no popular representatives will ever be brought with the consent of their constituents to give up a power in their own possession and enjoyment it is experience alone and long experience that can satisfy the doubts which every one must entertain on this subject what can be know experimentally of a government which has not stood the brunt of unsuccessful and of successful wars the english constitution has stood this test and has been found deficient or rather as far as this test can decide any thing has been proved worthless since in a single century it has involved     the nation in a debt of so vast   a magnitude that every blessing which might otherwise have been perpetuated is put to the stake so that if the nation do not make some change in its constitution it is much to be dreaded that the constitution will ruin the nation where practice and experience have so utterly failed it would be vain to reason from theory and especially on a subject on which a very able writer has seen his own prediction so totally erroneous in the monarchical states of europe it is highly improbable that any form of properly equal government should be established for many ages the people in general and especially in france being proud of their monarchs even when they are oppressed by them   in regard to the future consequences of this singular revolution as an example to other nations there can be no doubt but the spirit which has produced it will sooner or later spread throughout europe according to the different degrees of illumination amongst the common people and it will prove either mischievous or beneficial in proportion to the previous steps taken by governments it is unquestionably the subject of all others the most interesting to every class and even to every individual of a modern state the great line of division into which the people divides is  st those that have property and  d others that have none the events that have taken place in france in many respects have been subversive of property and have been effected by the lower people in direct opposition to the nominal legislature yet their constitution began its establishment with a much greater degree of regularity by a formal election of representatives than there is any probability of seeing in other countries revolutions will there be blown up from riotous mobs—from the military called out to quell them but refusing obedience and joining the insurgents such a flame spreading rapidly through a country must prove more hostile and more fatal     to property than any thing that has prevailed in france the probability of such events every one must allow to be not inconsiderable the ruin that must attend them cannot be doubted for they would tend not to produce a national assembly and a free constitution but an universal anarchy and confusion the first attempt towards a democracy in england would be the common people demanding an admission and voice in the vestries and voting to themselves whatever rates they thought proper to appropriate which in fact would be an agrarian law can there be so much supineness in the present governments of europe as to suppose that old principles and maxims will avail any longer can such ignorance of the human heart and such blindness to the natural course of events be found as the plan of rejecting all innovations lest they should lead to greater there is no government to be found that does not depend in the last resort on a military power and if that fail them is not the consequence easily seen a new policy must either be adopted or all the governments we know will be swept from their very foundations this policy must consist first in making it the interest as much as possible of every class in the state except those absolutely without property   to support the established government and also to render it as palatable as the security of property will allow even to these farther than this none can look for it is so directly the interest of the people without property to divide with those who have it that no government can be established which shall give the poor an equal interest in it with the rich   —the visible tangible interest     of the poor if i may use the expressions and not the ultimate and remote which they will never voluntarily regard is a pure democracy and a consequent division of property the sure path to anarchy and despotism the means of making a government respected and beloved are in england obvious taxes must be immensely reduced assessments on malt leather candles soap salt and windows must be abolished or lightened the funding system the parent of taxation annihilated for ever by taxing the interest of the public debt—the constitution that admits a debt carries in its vitals the seeds of its destruction tythes   and tests abolished the representation of parliament reformed and its duration shortened not to give the people without property a predominancy but to prevent that corruption in which our debts and taxes have originated the utter destruction of all monopolies and among them of all charters and corporations gamemade property and belonging to the possessor of one acre as much as to him who has a thousand and lastly the laws both criminal and civil to be thoroughly reformed—these circumstances include the great evils of the british constitution     if they be remedied it may enjoy even a venetian longevity but if they be allowed like cancerous humours to prey on the nobler parts of the political system this boasted fabric may not exist even twenty years to guard property effectually and to give permanency to the new system the militia laws ought all to be repealed when we see as in all the monarchies of europe the government only armed despotism is established when those who have property alone are armed how secure the people from oppression—when those who have no property are armed how prevent their seizing the property of others—perhaps the best method of guarding against these contrary evils is to embody in a national militia all who have property and at the same time to allow arms unembodied to all citizens indiscriminately we see in the case of berne that the people being armed keeps an aristocracy in such order that great oppressions are unknown an army was always dangerous and in the probable state of europe it may be doubly so discipline preserved it cemented despotism undisciplined it may unite with the people of no property and produce anarchy and ruin there seems to be no sufficient guard upon it but a national militia formed of every man that possesses a certain degree of property rank and file as well as officers   such a force in this island would probably amount to above  00000 men and would be amply sufficient for repressing all those riots whose object might be immediately or ultimately the democratic mischief of transferring property   this for a     free government—despotic ones that would wish to escape destruction must emancipate their subjects because no military conformation can long secure the obedience of ill   0 treated slaves and while such governments are giving to their people a constitution worth preserving they should by an absolute renunciation of all the views of conquest make a small army as efficient for good purposes as a large force for ambitious ones this newmodelled military should consist rank and file of men interested in the preservation of property and order were this army to consist merely of nobility it would form a military aristocracy as dangerous to the prince as to the people it should be composed indiscriminately of individuals drawn from all classes but possessing a given property—a good government thus supported may be durable bad ones will be shivered to pieces by the new spirit that ferments in europe the candid reader will i trust see that in whatever i have ventured to advance on so critical a subject as this great and unexampled revolution i have assigned the merit i think due to it which is the destruction of the old government and not the establishment of the new all that i saw and much that i heard in france gave me the clearest conviction that a change was necessary for the happiness of the people a change that should limit the royal authority that should restrain the feudal tyranny of the nobility that should reduce the church to the level of good citizens that should correct the abuses of finance that should give purity to the administration of justice and that should place the people in a state of ease and give them weight enough to secure this blessing thus far i must suppose every friend of mankind agreed but whether in order to effect thus much all france were to be overthrown ranks annihilated property attacked the     monarchy abolished and the king and royal family trampled upon and above all the rest the whole effect of the revolution good or bad put on the issue of a conduct which to speak in the mildest language made a civil war probable—this is a question absolutely distinct in my private opinion these extremities were not necessary france might have been free without violence a necessitous court a weak ministry and a timid prince could have refused nothing to the demands of the states essential to public happiness the power of the purse would have done all that ought to have been done the weight of the commons would have been predominant but it would have had checks and a controul without which power is not constitution but tyranny—while however i thus venture to think that the revolution might have been accomplished upon better principles because probably more durable ones i do not therefore assign the first national assembly in the gross to that total condemnation they have received from some very intemperate pens and for this plain reason because it is certain that they have not done much which was not called for by the people before the revolution is condemned in the gross it should be considered what extent of liberty was demanded by the three orders in their cahiers and this in particular is necessary since those very cahiers are quoted to show the mischievous proceedings of the national assembly here are a few of the ameliorations demanded to have the trial by jury and the habeas corpus of england 0 to deliberate by head and not by order demanded by the nobility themselves   to declare all taxes illegal and suppressed—but to grant them anew for a year to establish for ever the capitaineries   to establish a caisse nationale separée inaccessible à toute influence du pouvoir executiff   that all the intendants     should be suppressed   that no treaties of commerce should be made but with the consent of the states   that the orders of begging monks be suppressed   that all monks be suppressed and their goods and estates sold   that tythes be for ever suppressed   that all feudal right duties payments and services be abolished   that salaries traitement pécuniare be paid to the deputies 0 that the permanence of the national assembly is a necessary part of its existence   that the bastile be demolished   that the duties of aides on wine brandy tobacco salt leather paper iron oil and soap be suppressed   that the apanages be abolished   that the domaines of the king be alienated   that the kings studs haras be suppressed   that the pay of the soldiers be augmented   that the kingdom be divided into districts and the elections proportioned to population and to contributions   that all citizens paying a determinate quota of taxes vote in the parochial assemblies   that it is indispensable in the statesgeneral to consult the rights of man 0 that the deputies shall accept of no place pension grace or favour       from this detail of the instructions given by the nation i will not assert that every thing which the national assembly has decreed is justifiable but it may be very fairly concluded that much the greater part of their arrets and many that have been the most violently arraigned are here expressly demanded to reply that these demands are not those of the nation at large but of particular bodies only is very wide from the argument especially as the most virulent enemies of the revolution and particularly mess burke and de calonne have from these cahiers deduced such conclusions as suited their purpose and if they are made authority for condemning the transactions in that kingdom they certainly are equal authority for supporting those transactions i shall make but one observation on these demands the assemblies that drew them up most certainly never demanded in express terms the abolition of the monarchy or the transfer of all the regal authority to the deputies but let it be coolly considered what sort of a monarchy must necessarily remain while an assembly is permanent with power to abolish tythes to suppress the intendants not only to vote but to keep the public money to alienate the kings domains and to suppress his studs to abolish the capitaineries and destroy the bastile—the assembly that is called upon to do all this is plainly meant to be a body solely possessing the legislative authority it is evidently not meant to petition the king to do it because they would have used in this case the form of expression so common in other parts of the cahiers that his majesty will have the goodness c the result of the whole inquiry cannot but induce temperate men to conclude that the abolition of tythe of feudal services and payments of the gabelle or salttax of that on tobacco of the entreés of all excises on manufacturers and of all duties on transit of the infamous proceedings in the old courts of justice of the despotic practices of the old monarchy of the militia regulations of the monasteries and nunneries and of numberless other abuses i say that temperate men must conclude that the advantages derived to the nation are of the very first importance     and such as must inevitably secure to it as long as they continue an uncommon degree of prosperity the men who deny the benefit of such events must have something sinister in their views or muddy in their understandings on the other hand the extensive and unnecessary ruin brought on so many thousands of families of all descriptions by violence plunder terror and injustice to an amount that is shewn in the utter want of the precious metals the stagnation of industry and the poverty and misery found amongst many is an evil of too great a magnitude to be palliated the nourishment of the most pernicious cancer in the state public credit the deluge of paper money the violent and frivolous extinction of rank   the new system of taxation apparently so hurtful to landed property and a restricted corn trade all these are great deductions from public felicity and weigh the heavier in the scale because unnecessary to effect the revolution of the nature and durableness of the constitution established prudent men will not be eager to prophesy it is a new experiment   and cannot be tried or examined on     old ideas but the effects good and bad here arranged in opposition to each other are visible to every eye the advantages are recognized the evils are felt on these circumstances we are competent to reason        it may afford the reader some satisfaction to note a few circumstances of the state of france at the opening of      which i draw from the correspondence of some friends on whose accuracy i can rely agriculture—small proprietors who farm their own lands are in a very improved and easy situation renters are proportionally so to the degree in which their landlords have not been able to acquire in new rents the payments from which the land has been freed owners of meadows woods and a variety of articles for which no tythe was paid before gain much less than others whose property used to be subject to that burthen in regard to the payment of rent there is a distinction between the north and south of     the loire in the former rents continue to be paid but to the south many landlords have been unable to receive a penny and here a difference is observable absentees who were not beloved or whose agents are disliked are in an ill situation but others who reside or who though absent are beloved are paid proportionally to the ability of the métayer which species of tenant is chiefly found south of the loire the last crop of      is said to have been short in a good year in picardy  0 sheaves gave a septier of wheat of   0 lb but now it takes  0 to  0 this circumstance however cannot be general as the price plainly proves for january  th      price at paris of wheat was    to    liv with assignats at    per cent discount a remarkable proof that the most depreciated paper currency will answer every purpose for objects of physical necessity and daily consumption the discount on this paper is greater than ever was foretold by those who predicted an enormous rise of all the necessaries of life a proof how new the science of politics is and how little able the most ingenious men are to foretell the effects of any specified event the sale of the national estates has been of late very slow which is a strange circumstance since the rapidity of their transfer ought to have been proportioned to the discount upon assignats for an obvious reason for while land is to be acquired with money the more depreciated paper is the greater the benefit to the purchaser while the sale of the estates lasted with any degree of briskness the common price of such as have come to my knowledge was  0 to  0 and even more years purchase at which rate the advantages attending investments may be great commerce and manufactures—the result of the vast discount upon assignats has in relation to the national industry been almost contrary to what many persons not ill informed expected early in the confusion of the revolution nothing suffered so severely as manufactures but i am now      informed that there is much more motion and employment in them than some time past when the general aspect of affairs was less alarming the very circumstance which according to common ideas should have continued their depression has most unaccountably revived     them in some measure i mean the depreciation of the assignats paper currency has been at so low a pitch that every species of goods has been preferred in payments master manufacturers paying their workmen c in assignats by which bread is purchased at a price proportioned to the crop can sell the product of that labour to such an advantage as to create demand enough to animate their business a most curious political combination which seems to shew that in circumstances where evils are of the most alarming tendency there is a reaction an undercurrent that works against the apparent tide and brings relief even from the very nature of the misfortune combine this with the point of depression of england in all her wars as explained with such talents by the ingenious mr chalmers and something of a similarity will strike the reflecting reader the loss by the depression of assignats has not been by any interior transactions but by those with foreign powers in consequence of it the course of exchange rose at last so high that the loss to the kingdom has been great but by no means so great as some have imagined who supposed the intercourse to be moving in the same ratio as in preceding periods but this is no light error the evil of exchange like all other political evils corrects itself when it is very much against a people they necessarily lessen their consumption of foreign commodities and on the contrary foreign nations consume theirs very freely because so easily paid for through the month of january      the course of exchange between us and paris has been about    on an average reckoning the par at  0 which however is not exact here is  0 per cent against france deduct    for the discount on assignats and this apparent enormity of evil is reduced to   per cent through the month of january      the course was   ½ this was    per cent disadvantage and deducting   for the discount on assignats the real disadvantage was  0 thus the exchange in january      is   per cent more favourable to france than in      a remark however which must not be extended to any other case and touches not on the internal mischiefs of a depreciated currency it seems to shew that the evils of their situation so little understood by the generality of people here are correcting     themselves relative to foreigners through the operation of the causes i have mentioned it is at the same time to be remarked that while the price of corn and other things in which there is no competition by foreigners rises merely on account of a scarcity real or apprehensive at the same time every thing bought by foreigners or which can be bought by them has risen greatly for instance the cloth of abbeville a french commodity has risen from  0 liv to    liv the aulne and copper a foreign commodity has increased it is asserted in the petition of the norman manufactures to the national assembly  0 per cent such a fabric may suffer but if their pins fell proportionably with other things the evil it must be admitted tends to correct itself finances—the prominent feature is the immensity of the debt which increases every hour that which bears interest may be about  000000000 liv and assignats or the debt not bearing interest may be grossly estimated at   00000000 liv in all   00000000 liv or       000l sterling a debt of such enormity that nothing but the most regular and well paid revenue could enable the kingdom to support it the annual deficit may be reckoned about   0000000 liv at present but improveable by a better collection of the revenue the following is the account for the month of february      recette  0000000 dépenses extraordinaire de        000000 id pour       000000 avances au depart de paris  000000 deficit   000000     000000 i am afraid that any attempt to support such infinite burthens must continue to deluge the kingdom with paper till like congress dollars in america circulation ceases altogether there seems to be no remedy but a bankruptcy which is the best easiest and most beneficial measure to the nation that can be embraced it is also the     most just and the most honourable all shifting expedients are in fact more mischievous to the people and yet leave government as deeply involved as if no recourse had been made to them if the milice bourgeoise of paris is so interested in the funds as to render this too dangerous there does not appear to be any other rule of conduct than one great and last appeal to the nation declaring that they must either destroy public credit or be destroyed by it if the national assembly have not virtue and courage enough thus to extricate france she must at all events remain however free in a state of political debility the impossibility of levying the œconomistes landtax is found in france to be as great in practice as the principles of it were absurd in theory i am informed february      that the confusion arising from this cause in almost every part of the kingdom is great the tax of  00 millions laid on the rental of france would not be more than  s  d in the pound too great a burthen on just political principles but not a very oppressive one had it been once fairly assessed and never afterwards varied but by pursuing the jargon of the produit net and making it variable instead of fixed every species of inconvenience and uncertainty has arisen the assembly divided the total among the departments the departments the quotas among the districts the districts among the municipalities and the municipalities assembled for the assessment of individuals the same decree that fixed the tax at  00 millions limited it also not to exceed onefifth of the produit net every man had therefore a power to reject any assessment that exceeded that proportion the consequence was the total assigned to the municipalities was scarcely any where to be found but upon large farms let at a moneyrent in the north of france among the small proprietors of a few acres which spread over so large a part of the kingdom they all screened themselves under definitions of what the produit net meant and the result was that the month of december which ought to have produced  0 millions really produced but    so practicable has this visionary nonsense of the produit net proved under the dispensations of a mere democracy though acting   0 nominally   by representatives the fact has been that this illconceived and illlaid landtax which under a different management and under the orderly government of the settled part of america might have been effectively productive has been so contrived that it never will and never can produce what it was estimated at in france the people without property have a direct interest in seconding the refusals of others to pay that are in the lowest classes of property and who can really ill afford it one great objection to all landtaxes where possessions are much divided with power in such hands the refusal is effective and the national treasury is empty but supposing such enormous difficulties overcome and these little properties valued and taxed on some practicable plan from that moment there must be a new valuation every year for if one has wealth enough to improve beyond the capacity of the rest they immediately shift a proportion of their tax on him and this has accordingly happened early as it is in the day and indeed is inherent in the nature of the tax as promulgated by the assembly   thus annual assessments annual confusion annual quarrels and heartburnings and annual oppression must be the consequence and all this because a plain simple and practicable mode of assessment was not laid down by the legislature itself instead of leaving it to be debated and fought through  00 legislatures on the plan purely ideal and theoretical of the œconomistes police of corn—the national assembly has been of late repeatedly employed in receiving complaints from various departments relative to the scarcity and high price of corn and debates on it arise and votes pass which are printed to satisfy the people that all precautions are taken to prevent exportation such a conduct shews that they tread in the steps of mons necker and that they consequently may     expect with a crop but slightly deficient to see a famine in the gazette nationale of march        i read in the journal of the assembly inquiétudes—précautions prises—commissaires envoyés—veiller à la subsistance du peuple—fonds pour acheter des grains chez létranger—dix millions—c now this is precisely the blind and infatuated conduct of mons necker if these steps ere necessary to be taken which is impossible why talk of and print them why alarm the people by shewing yourselves alarmed fortyfive millions loss in the hands of m necker purchased not three days corn from france ten millions will not purchase one days consumption but the report and parade of it will do more mischief than the loss of five times the quantity without being in france i am clear and can rely enough upon principles to know that these measures will raise not sink the price one of the many instances in legislation that proves the immense difference regarding the cases of france and the united states between a representation of mere population and one of property m—pour prévenir les inquietudes qui pourraient arriver lannée prochaine et les suivantes lassemblée doit soccuper dès ce moment dun plan general sur les subsistances—there is but one plan absolute freedom and you will shew by accepting or rejecting it what class of the people it is that you represent proclaim a free trade and from that moment ordain that an inkstand be crammed instantly into the throat of the first member that pronounces the word corn prohibition of the export of the raw materials of manufactures—the last information i have had from france is a confirmation of the intelligence our newspapers gave that the national assembly had ordered a decree to be prepared for this prohibition it seems that the master manufacturers of various towns taking advantage of the great decline of the national fabrics made heavy complaints to the national assembly and among other means of redress demanded a prohibition of the export of cotton silk wool leather and in general of all raw materials it was strenuously opposed by a few men better acquainted than the common mass with political principles but in vain and orders were given to prepare the decree which     i am assured will pass as i have in various papers in the annals of agriculture entered much at large into this question i shall only mention a few circumstances here to convince france if possible of the mischievous and most pernicious tendency of such a system which will be attended with events little thought of at present in that kingdom as it is idle to have recourse to reasoning when facts are hand it is only necessary to describe the effect of a similar prohibition in the case of wool in england—  the price is sunk by it  0 per cent below that of all the countries around us which as is proved by documents unquestionable amounts to a landtax of between three and four millions sterling being so much taken from land and given to manufactures  d not to make them flourish for a second curious fact is that of all the great fabrics of england that of wool is least prosperous and has been regularly most complaining of which the proofs are before the public the policy therefore has failed and because it fails in england it is going to be adopted in france the home monopoly of wool gives to the manufacturers so great a profit that they are not solicitous about any extension of their trade beyond the home product and to this it is owing that no foreign wool spanish alone excepted which is not produced here is imported into england the same thing will happen in france the homeprice will fall the landed interest will be robbed and the manufacturer tasting the sweets of monopoly will no longer import as before the fabric at large will receive no increase and all the effect will be to give the master manufacturer a great profit on a small trade he will gain but the nation will lose  d the most flourishing manufacture of england is that of cotton of which the manufacturer is so far from having a monopoly the    0ths of the material are imported under a duty and our own exportable duty free the next possibly the first is that of hardware english iron is exported duty free and the import of foreign pays  l   s  d a ton english coals exported in vast quantities glass exhibits the same spectacle english kelp exportable duty free and   s  d a ton on foreign raw silk pays  s a lb on import export of british hemp and flax undressed is free foreign pays a duty on import british rags for     making paper exportable duty free unwrought tin lead and copper all exportable either free or under a slight duty the immense progress made by these manufactures particularly hardware cotton glass flax and earthernware another in which no monopoly of material can exist is known to all europe they are among the greatest fabrics in the world and have risen rapidly but note for it merits the attention of france that wool has experienced no such rise   our policy in wool stands on fact therefore convicted of rottenness and this is precisely the policy which the new government of france copies and extends to every raw material  th the free trade in raw materials is necessary like the free trade in corn not to send those materials abroad but to secure their production at home and lowering the price by giving a monopoly to the buyer is not the way to encourage farmers to produce  th france imports silk and wool to the amount of  0 and  0 millions a year and exports none or next to none why prohibit an export which in settled times does not take place at the present moment the export either takes place or it does not take place if the latter why prohibit a trade which has no existence if it does take place it proves that the manufacturers cannot buy it as heretofore is that a reason why the farmers should not produce it your manufacturers cannot buy and you will not let foreigners what is that but telling your husbandmen that they shall not produce why then do the manufacturers ask this favour they are cunning they very well know why they have the same view as their brethren in england—solely that of sinking the price and thereby putting money in their own pockets at the expence of the landed interests  th all the towns of france contain but six millions of people the manufacturing towns not two millions why are twenty millions in the country to be cheated out of their property in order to favour onetenth of that number in towns  th in various passages of these travels i have shown the wretched state of french agriculture for want of more sheep the new system is a curious way to effect an increase     —by lowering the profit of keeping them  th the french manufacturers under the old system of freedom bought raw materials from other nations to the amount of several millions besides working up all the produce of france if sinking the price be not their object what is can they desire to do more than this if under the new government their fabrics do not flourish as under the old one is that a reason for prohibition and restriction for robbery and plunder of the landed interest to make good their own losses and if such a demand is good logic in a manufacturers countinghouse is that a reason for its being received in a national assembly one of the most curious inquiries that can be made by a traveller is to endeavour to ascertain how much per cent a capital invested in land and in farmingstock will return for cultivation in different countries no person according to my knowledge has attempted to explain this very important but difficult problem the price of land the interest of money the wages of labour the rates of all sorts of products and the amount of taxes must be calculated with some degree of precision in order to analyze this combination i have for many years attempted to gain information on this curious point concerning various countries if a man in england buys land rented at   s an acre at thirty years purchase and cultivates it himself making five rents he will make not more than from  ½ to   per cent and at most   speaking of general culture and not estimating singular spots or circumstances and including the capital invested in both land and stock i learn from the correspondence of the best farmer and the greatest character the new world has produced certain circumstances which enable me to assert with confidence that money invested on the same principles in the middle states of north america will yield considerably more than double the return in england and in many instances the treble of it to compare france with these two cases is very difficult—had the national assembly done for the agriculture of the kingdom what france had a right to expect from freedom the account would have been advantageous for buying at  0 years purchase stocking the same as in england and reckoning products   per cent lower in     price about the fact the total capital would have paid from  ½ to  ½ per cent landtax reckoned at  s in the pound which is the proportion of the total tax to the rental of the kingdom   it is true that the course of exchange would make an enormous difference for when exchange is at    this ratio per cent instead of  ½ becomes    if the capital is remitted from britain but as that immense loss  0 per cent on the exchange of france arises from the political state of the kingdom the same circumstances which cause it would be estimated at so much hazard and danger but bring to account the operations of the national assembly relating to the noninclosure of commons the landtax variable with improvements an article sufficient to stifle the thoughts of such a thing the export of corn at an end the transport every where impeded and your granaries burnt and plundered at the pleasure of the populace if they do not like the price and above all the prohibition of the export of all materials of manufactures as wool c and it is sufficiently clear that america offers a vastly more eligible field for the investment of capital in land than france does a proof that the measures of the national assembly have been illjudged illadvised and unpolitical i had serious thoughts of settling in that kingdom in order to farm there but the two measures adopted of a variable landtax and a prohibition of the export of wool damped my hopes ardent as they were that i might have breathed that fine climate free from the extortions of a government stupid in this respect as that of england it is however plain enough that america is the only country that affords an adequate     profit and in which a man who calculates with intelligence and precision can think of investing his capital how different would this have been had the national assembly conducted themselves on principles directly contrary had they avoided all landtaxes   had they preserved the free corntrade a trade of import more than export had they been silent upon inclosures and done nothing in relation to raw materials the profit of investments would have been higher in france than in america or any country in the world and immense capitals would have flowed into the kingdom from every part of europe scarcity and famine would not have been heard of and the national wealth would have been equal to all the exigencies of the period april         in the last moment which the preparation for publication allows me to use the intelligence is arrived of a declaration of war on the part of france against the house of austria—the gentlemen in whose company i hear it all announce destruction to france—they will be beat—they want discipline—they have no subordination—and     this idea i find general so cautiously as i have avoided prophetic presumption through the preceding pages i shall scarcely assume it so late in my labours—but thus much i may venture—that the expectation of destruction to france has many difficulties to encounter give all you please to power of field evolution depending on the utmost strictness of discipline—you must admit that it bears only on the question of battles but guarded as france is by the most important frontier fortresses the world knows why hazard battles undisciplined troops behind walls and within works are known on experience to be effective and where are the resources to be found that shall attack those strong holds  00 miles from home i was at lisle metz and strasbourg and if the military intelligence i had was accurate it would demand  00000 men completely provided with everything for a siege three months to take either of those towns supposing them well provided and well defended we know on positive experience what the austrians and prussians led by some of the greatest men that have existed were able to do in sieges when undertaken at their own doors—what will they effect against places ten times as strong and  00 miles from home it is a matter of calculation—of pounds and shillings—not of discipline and obedience but many depend on the deranged state of the french finances that derangement flows absolutely from a vain attempt at preserving public credit—the national assembly will see its futility misery ruin the nation must be preserved—what on comparison is public credit the divisions factions and internal disturbances offer to others the hope of a civil war it ought to be a vain hope during peace such difficulties fill the papers and are dwelt upon till men are apt to think them terrible in war they are treason and the gallows sweeps from the world and the columns of a gazette the actors and the recital oil and vinegar—fire and water—prussians and austrians are united to carry war amongst    millions of men arranged behind  00 of the strongest fortresses in the world—if we are deceived and frenchmen are not fond of freedom but will fight for despotism—something may     be done for then france falls by the power of france but if united but tolerably the attack will be full of difficulties in a country where every man woman and child is an enemy that fights for freedom but suppose this idea erroneous—suppose an impression made—and that the german banners were flying at paris—where is the security of the rest of europe is the division of poland forgotten is an unforeseen union of two or three great powers to protrude through europe a predominancy dangerous to all gentlemen who indulge their wishes for a counterrevolution in france do not perhaps wish to see the prussian colours at the tower nor the austrian at amsterdam yet success to the cause might plant them there should real danger arise to france which i hold to be problematical it is the business and direct interest of her neighbours to support her the revolution and antirevolution parties of england have exhausted themselves on the french question but there can be none if that people should be in danger—we hold at present the balance of the world and have but to speak and it is secure

have been raised but so little to their credit that i leave the passage as it was written long ago the abuses that are rooted in all the old governments of europe give such numbers of men a direct interest in supporting cherishing and defending abuses that no wonder advocates for tyranny of every species are found in every country and almost in every company what a mass of people in every part of england are some way or other interested in the present representation of the people tythes charters corporations monopolies and taxation and not merely to the things themselves but to all the abuses attending them and how many are there who derive their profit or their consideration in life not merely from such institutions but from the evils they engender the great mass of the people however is free from such influence and will be enlightened by degrees assuredly they will find out in every country of europe that by combinations on the principles of liberty and property aimed equally against regal aristocratical and mobbish tyranny they will be able to resist successfully that variety of combination which on principles of plunder and despotism is every where at work to enslave them    it is to be observed that the orders of knighthood were at first preserved when the national assembly with a forbearance that did them honour refused to abolish those orders because personal of merit and not hereditary they were guilty of one gross error they ought immediately to have addressed the king to institute a new order of knighthood—knights of the plough there are doubtless little souls that will smile at this and think a thistle a garter or an eagle more significant and more honourable i say nothing of orders that exceed common sense and common chronology such

numerous inquiries which i am still pursuing i have reason to believe this opinion to be founded on insufficient data    it ought not to be allowed even tolerable for this plain reason such public extravagance engenders taxes to an amount that will sooner or later force the people into resistance which is always the destruction of a constitution and surely that must be admitted bad which carries to the most careless eye the seeds of its own destruction two hundred and forty millions of public debt in a century is in a ratio impossible to be supported and therefore evidently ruinous    the direct power of the king of england says mr burke is considerable his indirect is great indeed when was it that a king of england wanted wherewithal to make him respected courted or perhaps even feared in every state in europe it is in such passages as these that this elegant writer lays himself open to the attacks formidable because just of men who have not an hundredth part of his talents who questions or can question the power of a prince that in less than a century has expended above  000 millions and involved his people in a debt of   0 the point in debate is not the existence of power but its excess what is the constitution that generates or allows of such expences the very mischief complained of is here wrought into a merit and brought in argument to prove that poison is salutary    this debt and our enormous taxation are the best answer the national assembly gives to those who would have had the english government with all its faults on its head adopted in france nor was it without reason said by a popular writer that a government formed like the english obtains more revenue than it could do either by direct despotism or in a full state of freedom    dr priestlys lectures on hist  to      p        the representation of mere population is as gross a violation of sense reason and theory as it is found pernicious in practice it gives to ignorance to govern knowledge to uncultivated intellect the lead of intelligence to savage force the guide of law and justice and to folly the governance of wisdom knowledge intelligence information learning and wisdom ought to govern nations and these are all found to reside most in the middle classes of mankind weakened by the habits and prejudices of the great and stifled by the ignorance of the vulgar    those who have not attended much to french affairs might easily mistake the representation of territory and contribution in the french constitution as something similar to what i contend for—but nothing is more remote the number chosen is of little consequence while persons without property are the electors yet mr christie says vol i p     that property is a base on which representation ought to be founded and it is plain he thinks that property is represented though the representatives of the property are elected by men that do not possess a shilling it is not that the proprietors of property should have voices in the election proportioned to their property but that men who have a direct interest in the plunder or division of property should be kept at a distance from power here lies the great difficulty of modern legislation to secure property and at the same time secure freedom to those that have no property in england there is much of this effected for the small portion of every mans income that is left to him after public plunder is satiated the poor the parson and the king take  0 to  0 per cent of every mans rent—but the rest is secure in america the poor the parson and the king take nothing or next to nothing and the whole is secure in france all seems to be at the mercy of the populace    the exaction of tythes is so absurd and tyrannical an attack on the property of mankind that it is almost impossible for them to continue in any country in the world half a century longer to pay a man by force  000l a year for doing by deputy what would be much better done for  00l is too gross an imposition to be endured to levy that  000l in the most pernicious method that can wound both property and liberty are circumstances congenial to the tenth century but not to the eighteenth italy france and america have set noble examples for the imitation of mankind and those countries that do not follow them will soon be as inferior in cultivation as they are in policy    the late riots at birmingham riots against persons commemorating the french revolution july     —ed ought to convince every man who looks to the preservation of peace that a militia of property is absolutely necessary had it existed at that town no such infamous transactions could have taken place to the disgrace of the age and nation those riots may convince us how insecure our property really is in england and how very imperfect that political system which could twice in twelve years see two of the greatest towns in england at the mercy of a vile mob the military must in relation to the greater part of the kingdom be always at a distance but a militia is on the spot and easy to be collected by previous regulations at a moments warning    the class of writers who wish to spread the taste of revolutions and make them every where the order of the day affect to confound the governments of france and america as if established on the same principles if so it is a remarkable fact that the result should to appearance turn out so differently but a little examination will convince us that there is scarcely any thing in common between those governments except the general principle of being free in france the populace are electors and to so low a degree that the exclusions are of little account and the qualifications for a seat in the provincial assemblies and in the national one are so low that the whole chain may be completed from the first elector to the legislator without a single link of what merits the name of property the very reverse is the case in america there is not a single state in which voters must not have a qualification of property in massachussets and new hampshire a freehold of  l a year or other estate of  0l value connecticut is a country of substantial freeholders and the old government remains in new york electors of the senate must have a property of  00l free from debts and those of the assembly freeholds of  0s a year rated and paying taxes in pensylvania payment of taxes is necessary in maryland the possession of  0 acres of land or other estate worth  0l in virginia    cultivated acres with a house on it in north carolina for the senate  0 acres and for the assembly payment of taxes and in all the states there are qualifications much more considerable necessary for being eligible to be elected in general it should be remembered that taxes being so very few the qualification of paying them excludes vastly more voters than a similar regulation in europe in constituting the legislatures also the states all have two houses except pensylvania and congress itself meets in the same form thus a ready explanation is found of that order and regularity and security of property which strikes every eye in america a contrast to the spectacle which france has exhibited where confusion of every sort has operated in which property is very far from safe in which the populace legislate and then execute not laws of their representatives but of their own ambulatory wills in which at this moment march      they are a scene of anarchy with every sign of a civil war commencing these two great experiments as far as they have gone ought to pour conviction in every mind that order and property never can be safe if the right of election is personal instead of being attached to property and whenever propositions for the reformation of our representation shall be seriously considered which is certainly necessary nothing ought to be in contemplation but taking power from the crown and the aristocracy—not to give it to the mob but to the middle classes of moderate fortune the proprietor of an estate of  0l a year is as much interested in the preservation of order and of property as the possessor of fifty thousand but the people without property have a direct and positive interest in public confusion and the consequent division of that property of which they are destitute hence the necessity a pressing one in the present moment of a militia rank and file of property the essential counterpoise to assemblies in alehouse kitchens clubbing their pence to have the rights of man read to them by which should be understood in europe not in america the right to plunder let the state of france at present be coolly considered and it will be found to originate absolutely in population without property being represented it exhibits scenes such as can never take place in america see the national assembly of a great empire at the crisis of its fate listening to the harrangues of the paris populace the female populace of st antoine and the president formally answering and flattering them will such spectacles ever be seen in the american congress can that be a well constituted government in which the

were the people of france whilst they were in that state in no one of their instructions did they charge or even hint at any of those things which have drawn upon the usurping assembly the detestation of the rational part of mankind    it is so because the inequality remains as great as if titles had remained but built on its worst basis wealth the nobility were bad but not so bad as mr christie

    but the nobility assembled at the louvre dec  0      addressed the king declaring that intention    after all that has been said of late years on the subject of constitutions and governments by various writers in england but more especially in france one circumstance must strike any attentive reader it is that none of the writers who have pushed the most forward in favour of new systems have said any thing to convince the unprejudiced part of mankind that experiment is not as necessary a means of knowledge in relation to government as in agriculture or any other branch of natural philosophy much has been said in favour of the american government and i believe with perfect justice reasoning as far as the experiment extends but it is fair to consider it as an imperfect experiment extending no further than the energy of personal virtue seconded by the moderation attendant on a circulation not remarkably active we learn by mr payne that general washington accepted no salary as commander of their troops nor any as president of their legislature—an instance that does honour to their government their country and to human nature but it may be doubted whether any such instances will occur two hundred years hence the exports of the united states now amount to  0 millions of dollars when they amount to  00 millions when great wealth vast cities a rapid circulation and by consequence immense private fortunes are formed will such spectacles be found will their government then be as faultless as it appears at present it may probably it will still be found excellent but we have no convictions no proof it is in the womb of time—the experiment is not made such remarks however ought always to be accompanied with the admission that the british government has been experimented—with what result—let a debt of   0 millions—let seven wars—let bengal and gibraltar—let  0 millions sterling of national burthens taxes rates tythes and monopolies—let these answer    the gross abuse which has been thrown on the french nation and particularly on their assemblies in certain pamphlets and without interruption in several of our newspapers ought to be deprecated by every man who feels for the future interests of this country it is in some instances carried to so scandalous an excess that we must necessarily give extreme disgust to thousands of people who may hereafter have an ample opportunity to vote and act under the influence of impressions unfavourable towards a country that unprovoked has loaded them with so much contumely for a nation groaning under a debt of   0 millions that deadens the very idea of future energy this seems to use the mildest language to be at least very imprudent    whether nominally or really is not of consequence if effective qualifications of property be not at every step the guard as in the american constitutions    aussitot que les opérations preliminaires seront termineés les officiers

impossible to estimate accurately if you remain no better farmers than your french neighbours it is so much but if you improve you are raised and they are sunk all that has and can be said against tythes bears with equal force against such a tax and though this imposition cannot go by the present law beyond  s in the pound it would be very easy to shew by a plain calculation that  s in the pound rising with improvement is a tax impossible to be borne by one who improves and consequently that it is a direct tax on improvement and it is a tax in the very worst form since the power to lay and inforce it is not in the government of the kingdom but in the municipal government of the parish your neighbour with whom you may be on ill terms has the power to tax you no such private heartburnings and tyranny are found in excises    to have avoided landtaxes might very easily have been made a most popular measure in a kingdom so divided into little properties as france is no tax is so heavy upon a small proprietor and the œconomistes might have foreseen what has happened that such little democratic owners would not pay the tax but taxes on consumption laid as in england and not in the infamous methods of the old government of france would have been paid by them in a light proportion without knowing it but the œconomistes to be consistent with their old pernicious doctrines took every step to make all except landtaxes unpopular and the people were ignorant enough to be deceived into the opinion that it was better to pay a tax on the bread put into their childrens mouths—and what is worse on the land which ought but does not produce that bread than to pay an excise on tobacco and salt better to pay a tax which is demanded equally whether they have or have not the money to pay it than a duty which mingled with the price of a luxury is paid in the easiest mode and at the most convenient moment in the writings of the œconomistes you hear of a free corn trade and free export of every thing being the recompence for a landtax but see their actions in power—they impose the burthen and forget the recompence
