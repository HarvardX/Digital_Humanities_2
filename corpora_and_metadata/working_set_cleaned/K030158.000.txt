splendorvilles adjoining a ball room enter bluntly meeting a servant in livery bluntly come come is not every thing ready is not the ballroom prepared yet it is past ten oclock   servant we have only to fix up the new chandedelier   bluntly i will have no new chandelier   servant my master said the last ball he gave the company were in the dark   bluntly and if you blind them with too much light they will be in the dark still   servant the musicians sir wish for some wine   blunty what before the ball begins no tell them if they are tipsy at the end of if it will be quite soon enough   servant you are always so cross mr blunty when my master is going to have company   bluntly have not i a right to be cross for while the whole house is in good humor if there was not one person cross enough to take a little care every thing would be wasted and ruined through extreme good temper a man crosses the stage here you  mister  pray are you the person who was sent with the chandelier   shopman yes sir   bluntly then please to take it back again  we dont want it   shopman what is your objection to it sir   bluntly it will cost too much   shopman mr bluntly all the trades people are more frightened at you than at your master  sir george heaven bless him never cares how much a thing costs   bluntly that is because he never cares whether he pays for it or not  but if he did depend upon it he would be very particular tradesmen all wish to be paid for their ware dont they   shopman certainly sir   bluntly then why will they force so many unnecessary things and make so many extravagant charges as to put all power of payment out of the question   enter evans  the tradesman goes off at the opposite door bluntly how do you do mrs evans suddenly   evans what makes you sigh mr bluntly   bluntly what makes you smile   evans to see all the grand preparations for the ball this evening i anticipate the joy my lady will take here and i smile for her   bluntly and i sigh for my master  i foresee all the bills that will be brought in for this evenings expense and i anticipate the sorrow it will one day be to him   evans but consider mr bluntly your master has my ladys fortune to take   bluntly yes but i consider he has your lady to take along with it and i prophecy one will sick by him some time after the other is gone   evans for shame  my lady i have no doubt will soon cure sir george of his extravagance   bluntly it will then be by taking away the means  why lady caroline is as extravagant as himself   evans you are mistaken  she never gives routs masquerades balls or entertainments of any kind   bluntly but she constantly goes to them whenever she is invited   evans that i call but a slight imprudence  she has no wasteful indiscretions like sir george for instance she never makes a lavish present   bluntly no but she takes a lavish present as readily as if she did   evans and surely you cannot call that imprudence   bluntly no i call it something worse   evans then although she loves gaming to distraction and plays deep yet she never loses   bluntly no but she always wins  and that i call something worse   a loud rapping at the street door evans here is the company will you permit me mr bluntly to stand in one corner and have a peep at them   bluntly if you please rapping again what spirit there is in that rat tat tat tat  and what life frolic and joy the whole house is going to experience except myself as for me i am ready to cry at the thoughts of it all exit   enter lady caroline l caroline here the first of the company i am sorry for it evans comes forward evans what has brought you hither   evans i came my lady to see the preparations making on your account  for it is upon your account alone that sir george gives this grand fee   l caroline why i do flatter myself it is  but where is he what is it oclock  it was impossible to stay at the stupid opera  how do i look i once did intend to wear those set of diamonds sir george presented me with the other morning  but then i reflected again that if    evans ah my lady what a charming thing to have such a lover  sir george prevents every wish  he must make the best of husbands   l caroline and yet my father wishes to break off the marriage  he talks of his prodigality  and certainly sir george lives above his income   evans but then madam so does every body else   l caroline but sir george ought undoubtedly to change his conduct and not be thus continually giving balls and entertainments  and inviting to his table acquaintance that not only come to devour his dinners and suppers but him   evans and there are people malicious enough to call your ladyship one of his devourers too   l caroline as a treaty of marriage is so nearly concluded between us i think mrs evans i am at liberty to visit sir george or to receive his presents without having my character or my delicacy called in question a loud rapping the company are coming is it not strange he is not here to receive them exit evans   enter two ladies and a gentleman who curtsy and bow to lady caroline  sir george enters at the opposite door magnificently dressed sir george ladies i entreat your pardon dear lady caroline excuse me i have been in the country all the morning and have had scarce time to return to town and dress for your reception   another rapping enter mr lucre lord hazard lady bridget sqander etc sir george dear lucre i am glad to see you   mr lucre my dear sir george i had above ten engagements this evening but they all gave place to your invitation   sir george thank you  my dear lady bridget    l bridget it is impossible to resist an invitation from the most polished man alive sir george bows what a superb dress in his hearing as he turns away and what an elegant deportment   mr lucre after speaking apart with sir george no i am not in a state to take any part at pharo  i am ruined  would you believe it sir george i am not worth a farthing in the world   sir george yes i believed it long ago   mr lucre now we are on that subject  could you lend me a hundred pounds   sir george taking out his pocketbook i have about me only this bill for two hundred   mr lucre that will do as well  i am not circumstantial takes it and my dear sir george command my purse at any time  all it contains will ever be at your service   sir george i thank you   mr lucre nay though i have no money of my own yet you know i can always raise friends  and by heaven my dear sir george i often wish to see you reduced to my circumstances merely to prove how much i could and would do to serve you   sir george i sincerely thank you   mr lucre and one can better ask a favor for ones friend than for onesself you know for when one wants to borrow money on ones own account there are so many little delicacies to get the better of  such as i felt just now  i was as pale as death i dare say when i asked you for this money  did not you perceive i was   sir george i cannot say i did   mr lucre but you must have observed i hesitated and looked very foolish   sir george i thought for my part that i looked as foolish  but i hope i did not hesitate   mr lucre nor ever will when a friend applys to you i will answer for it  nor ever shall a friend hesitate when you apply   lord hazard taking sir george aside the obligations i am under to you for extricating me from that dangerous business    sir george never name it   lord hazard not only name it sir george but shortly i hope to return the kindness and if i do but live    sir george to the company permit me to conduct you to the next apartment   lady caroline most willingly sir george i was the first who arrived which proves my eagerness to dance   sir george aside to her but let me hope passion for dancing was not the only one that caused your impatience   as the company move toward the ballroom mr lucre and lord hazard come forward mr lucre oh there never was such a man in the world as the master of this house there never was such a friendly generous noble heart he has the best heart in the world and the best taste in dress   the company exeunt and the music is heard to begin scene ii an apartment which denotes the poverty of the inhabitants henry and eleanor discovered eleanor it is very late and very cold too brother and yet we have neither of us heart to bid each other good night   henry no  beds were made for rest   eleanor and that noise of carriages and linkboys at sir george splendorvilles next door would keep us awake if our sorrows did not   henry the poor have still more to complain of when chance throws them thus near the rich  it forces upon their minds a comparison might drive them to despair if    eleanor  if they should not have good sense enough to reflect that all this bustle and show of pleasure may fall very short of happiness as all the distress we feel has not yet thank heaven reached to misery   henry what do you call it then   eleanor a trial sent to make us patient   henry it may make you so but cannot me good morning to you going   eleanor nay it is night yet where are you going   henry i dont know  to take a walk  the streets are not more uncomfortable than this place and scarcely colder   eleanor oh my dear brother i cannot express half the uneasiness i feel when you part from me though but for the shortest space   henry why   eleanor because i know your temper you are impatient under adversity you rashly think providence is unkind and you would snatch those favors which are only valuable when bestowed   henry what do you mean   eleanor nay do not be angry but every time you go out into this tempting town where superfluous riches continually meet the eye of the poor i tremble lest you should forfeit your honesty for that which heaven decreed should not belong to you   henry and if i did you would despise and desert me   eleanor no not desert you for i am convinced you would only take to bring to me but this is to assure you i do not want for any thing   henry not want  nor does my father   eleanor scarcely while we visit him every time he sees us we make him happy but he would never behold us again if we behaved unworthy of him   henry what banish us from a prison   eleanor and although it is a prison you could not be happy under such a restriction   henry happy  when was i happy last   eleanor yesterday when your father thanked you for your kindness to him did we not all three weep with affection for each other and was not that happiness   henry it was  nor will i give up such satisfaction for any enticement that can offer  be contented eleanor  for your sake and my fathers i will be honest  nay more  i will be scrupulously proud  and that line of conduct which my own honor could not force me to follow my love so you and him shall compel me to  when through necessity i am tempted to plunder your blushes and my fathers anguish shall hold my hand  and when i am urged through impatience to take away my own life your lingering death and his shall check the horrid suggestion and i will live for you   eleanor then do not ever trust yourself away at least from one of us   henry dear sister do you imagine that your power is less when separated from me do you suppose i think less frequently on my father and his dismal prison because we are not always together oh no he comes even more forcibly to my thoughts in his absence  and then more bitterly do i feel his misery than while the patient old man before my eyes talks to me of his consolations hi in eal comforts from a conscience pure a mind without malice and a heart where every virtue occupy a place  therefore do not fear that i should forget either him or you though i might possibly forget myself   exit eleanor if before him i am cheerful yet to myself i must complain weeps and that sound of festivity at the house adjoining is insupportable especially when i reflect that a very small portion of what will be wasted there only this one night would be sufficient to give my dear father liberty   a rapping at the door of her chamber on the opposite entrance eleanor who is there   mr blackman open the door without   eleanor the voice of our landlord goes to the door is it you mr blackman   blackman yes open the door rapping louder   she opens it  blackman enters followed by bluntly blackman what a time have you made me wait i  and in the name of wonder why do you lock your door have you any thing to lose have not you already sold all the furniture you brought hither and are you afraid of being stolen yourself   eleanor retires to the back of the stage bluntly is this the chamber   blackman yes sir yes mr bluntly this is it   blackman assumes a very different tone of voice in speaking to bluntly and eleanor to the one be is all submissive humility to the other all harshness bluntly this contemptuously   blackman why yes sir  this is the only place i have left in my own house since your master has been pleased to occupy that next door while his own magnificent one has been repairing  lock yourself up indeed looking at eleanor  you have been continually asking me for more rooms mr bluntly and have not i made near half a dozen doors already from one house to the other on purpose to accommodate your good family  upon my hanour i have not now a single chamber but what i have let to these lodgers and what i have absolute occasion for myself   bluntly and if you do put yourself to a little inconvenience mr blackman surely my master    blackman your master mr bluntly is a very good man  a very generous man  and i hope at least he has found me a very lucky one for good luck is all the recommendation which i in my humble station aspire to  and since i have been sir georges attorney i have gained him no less than two lawsuits   bluntly i know it i know also that you have lost him four   blackman well drop the subject  and in regard to this room sir it does not suit you say   bluntly no for i feel the cold wind blow through every crevice   blackman but suppose i was to have it put a little into repair that window for instance shall have a pane or two of glass put in the cracks of the door shall be stopped up and then every thing will have a very different appearance   bluntly and why has not this been done before   blackman would you have me be laying out my money while i only let the place at a paltry price to people who i am obliged to threaten to turn into the streets every quarter before i can get my rent from them   bluntly is that the situation of your lodgers at present   blackman yes  but they made a better appearance when they first came or i bad not taken such persons to live thus near to your master   bluntly that girl looking at eleanor seems very pretty  and i dare say my master would not care if he was nearer to her   blackman pshaw pshaw  she is a poor creature  she is in great distress she is misery itself   bluntly i feel quite charmed with misery  who belongs to her   blackman a young man who says he is her brother  very likely he is not  but that i should not enquire about if they could pay my rent if people will pay me i dont care what they are addressing himself to eleanor i desire you will tell your brother when he comes in that i have occasion for the money which will be due to me tomorrow  and if i dont receive it before tomorrow night he must seek some other habitation   bluntly hush mr blackman  if you speak so loud you will have our company in the next house hear you   blackman and if they did do you think it would spoil their dancing no mr bluntly  and in that respect i am a person of fashion  i never suffer any distress to interfere with my enjoyments   eleanor coming to him dear sir have but patience a little while longer  indeed i hope you will lose nothing   blackman i will not lose any thing   going eleanor following him sir i would speak a single word to you if you will be so good as to hear me   bluntly ay stay and hear her   eleanor looking at bluntly but i wish to speak to him by ourselves   bluntly then i will withdraw   blackman what have you to say in anger   bluntly hear her mr blackman  or may none of her sex ever listen to you exit   blackman if it is only to entreat me to let you continue here i am gone in an instant  come speak quickly for i have no time to lose  come speak speak   eleanor but are you resolved to have no pity you know in what a helpless situation we are  and the deplorable state of my poor father   weeping blackman ay i thought what you had to say  farewl farewell   eleanor lying hold of him oh do not plunge us into more distress than we can bear but open your heart to compassion   blackman i cannot  it is a thing i never did in my life   going he meets bluntly who stops him bluntly well have you granted her request   blackman i would do a great deal to oblige you mr bluntly  and if you will only give your word for the trifle of rent owing why i am not so hardhearted but i will suffer her to stay   bluntly well well  i will give my word   blackman but remember it is not to be put down to your masters account but to your own  i am not to give credit   eleanor not am i to lay my brother under an obligation of this nature to bluntly i thank you for your offer sir but i cannot accept it   blackman in extreme anger what do you mean by that   bluntly perhaps she is right   eleanor my brother would resent my acceptance of a favor from a stranger   blackman your brother resent a poor man resent did you ever hear of any bodys regarding a poor mans resentment   eleanor no  nor a poor womans prayers   blackman yes i will regard your prayers if you will suffer this gentleman to be your friend   eleanor any acquaintance of yours mr blackman i must distrust   blackman do you hear with what contempt she treats us both   bluntly but perhaps she is right  at least in treating one of us so i am sure she is  and i will forgive her wronging the one for the sake of her doing justice to the other   enter henry he starts at seeing blackman and bluntly henry who are these   blackman who are these did you ever hear such impertinence going up to him pray who are you sir   henry i am a man   blackman yes  but i am a lawyer   henry whatever you are this apartment is mine not yours  and i desire you to leave it   blackman but tomorrow it will be mine and then i shall desire you to leave it and force you to leave it   henry eleanor retire to the other chamber am i sorry i left you   leads her off blackman and i am sorry that i and my friend should come here to be affronted   bluntly mr blackman i will not be called names   blackman names sir what names did i call you   bluntly did not you call me your friend i assure you sir i am not used to be called names i am but a servant whose character is every thing  and i will let you know that i am not your friend   blackman why you blockhead does not your master call himself my friend   bluntly yes my master is a great man and he can get a place without a character  but if i lose mine i am ruined therefore take care how you miscal me for the future for i assure you i will not bear it i am not your friend and you shall find i am not   exit in great anger blackman following end of the first act act ii scene i an apartment at sir george splendorvilles enter sir george followed by bluntly sir george what is oclock rubbing his eyes   bluntly just noon sir   sir george why was i waked so early   bluntly you were not waked sir  you rung   sir george then it was in my sleep  and could not you suppose so  after going to bed at five to make me rise at noon in a violent passion what am i to do with myself sir till it is time to go out for the evening   bluntly you have company to dinner you know sir   sir george no it is to supper  and what am i to do with myself till that time   bluntly company again to supper sir   sir george yes and the selfsame company i had last night  i invited them upon lady carolines account  to give her an opportunity of revenge for the money she lost here yesterday evening  and i am all weariness  i am all lassitude and fretfulness till the time arrives  but now i call to mind i have an affair that may engage my attention a few hours you were giving me an account bluntly of that beautiful girl i saw enter at blackmans   bluntly yes sir i saw her late last night in mr blackmans house  she lodges there   sir george indeed in blackmans house i am glad to hear it   bluntly and he has assured me sir that she and her family are in the greatest poverty imaginable   sir george i am glad to hear it   bluntly they have been it seems above a twelvemonth in london in search of some rich relations but instead of meeting with them the father was seen and remembered by an old creditor who has thrown him into prison   sir george i am very glad to hear it   bluntly but the young woman sir has been so short a time in town she has seemingly a great deal of modesty and virtue   sir george and i am very glad to hear of that too  i like her the better  you know i do  for i am weary of that ready compliance i meet with from the sex   bluntly but if i might presume to advise sir  as you are so soon to be married to her ladyship whom you love with sincere affection you should give up this pursuit   sir george and i shall give it up bluntly before my marriage takes place  for short as that time may be i expect this passion will be over and forgotten long before the interval has passed away  but that brother you were mentioning    bluntly i have some reason to think that with all his poverty he has a notion of honor   sir george laughing oh i have often tried the effect of a purse of gold with people of honor  have you desired them to be sent for as i ordered   bluntly i have sir   sir george see if they are come exit bluntly ah my dear lady caroline it is you and only you whom i love with a sincere passion but in waiting this long expected event of our marriage permit me to indulge some less exalted wishes   enter bluntly sir gorge are they come   bluntly the young man is in the antichamber sir but his sister is not with him speaking to henry who is without please to walk this way  my master desires to see you   sir george no no no  i do not desire to see him if his sister is not there  zounds you scoundrel what did you call him in for   enter henry and bows sir george looks at him with a careless familiarity  bluntly leaves the room sir george young man i am told you are very poor  you may have heard that i am very rich  and i suppose you are acquainted with the extensive meaning of the word  generosity   henry after an hesitation perhaps not sir   sir george the meaning of it as i comprehend is for the rich to give to the poor  have you any thing to ask of me in which i can serve you   henry your proposal is so general i am at a loss what to answer  but you are no doubt acquainted with the extensive meaning of the word pride  and that will apologize for the seeming indifference with which i receive your offer   sir george your pride seems extensive indeed  i heard your father was in prison and i pitied him   henry did you sir  did you pity my father  i beg your pardon  if i have said any thing to offend you pray forgive it  nor let my rudeness turn your compassion away from him to any other object   sir george would a small sum release him from confinement would about a hundred pounds    henry i have no doubt but it would   sir george then take that note  be not surprised  i mean to dispose of a thousand guineas this way instead of fitting up a theater in my own house  that giving him the note is a mere trifle my box at the opera or my dinner i mean to dine alone tomorrow instead of inviting company   henry sir george i spoke so rudely to you at first that i know no other way to show my humility than to accept your present without reluctance  i do therefore as the gift of benevolence not as the insult of better for une   sir george you have a brother have not you   henry no sir  and only one sister   sir george a sister is it well let me see your father and your brother  your sister i mean  did not you say  you said a sister did not you   henry yes sir   sir george we will let me see your father and her they will rejoice at their good fortune i imagine and i wish to be a witness of their joy   henry i will this moment go to our lawyer extricate my father and we will all return and make you the spectator of the happiness you have bestowed  forgive my eagerness to disclose your bounty sir if before i have said half i feel i fly to reveal it to my father to whom i can more powerfully express my sensations  than in your presence exit   sir george that bait has taken  and now if the sister will only be as grateful   enter bluntly bluntly dear sir what can you have said to the young man i never saw a person so much affected   sir george in what manner   bluntly the tears ran down his cheeks as he passed along and he held something in his land which he pressed to his lips and then to his heart as if it was a treasure   sir george it is a treasure bluntly  a hundred guineas   bluntly but for which i believe you expect a greater treasure in return   sir george do think so bluntly  do think the girl is worth a hundred pounds   bluntly if she refuses she is worth a thousand  but if the complies you have thrown away your money   sir george just the reverse   bluntly but i hope sir you do not mean to throw away any more thus  for although this sum by way of charity may be well applied yet indeed sir i know some of your creditors as much in want as this poor family   sir george how  you are in pay by some of my creditors i suppose   bluntly no sir you must pay them before they can pay any body   sir george you are impertinent  leave the room instantly and go in search of this sister now while the son is gone to release his father  tell her her brother is here and bring her hither immediately   bluntly but sir if you will only give me leave to speak one word    sir george do speak goes to the chimney piece and takes down a pistol only speak a single syllable and i will send a ball instantly through your head  bluntly i am dumb sir  i dont speak indeed sir  upon my life i dont i wish i may die if i speak a word   sir george go on the errand i told you and if you dare to return without the girl this is your fate   holding up the pistol bluntly yes sir exit   sir george laying the pistol on the table impertinent puppy to ruffle the temper of a man of fashion with hints of prudence and morality and paying his debts  all this from a servant too the insolent chattering    enter bluntly bluntly may i speak now sir   sir george what have you to say   bluntly mr blackman sir   sir george bid him come in   enter blackman exit bluntly sir george good morning mr blackman come sit down   blackman bowing respectfully i am glad sir george i have found you alone for i come to speak to you on important business   sir george business  no  not now if you please   blackman but i must sir  i have been here ten times before and have been put off but now you must hear what i have to say   sir george dont be long then  dont be tedious mr blackman  for i expect a a  in short i expect a pretty woman   blackman when she comes i will go   sir george very well speak quickly then what have you to say   blackman i come to speak upon the subject of your fathers will by which you know you run the hazard of losing great part of what he left behind   sir george but what am i to do   blackman there is no time to be lost consider that mr manly the lawyer whom your father employed is a man who pretends to a great deal of morality and it was he who when your father found himself dying alarmed his conscience and persuaded him to make this will in favor of a second person now i think that you and i both together ought to have a meeting with this conscientious lawyer   sir george but i should imagine mr blackman that if he is really a conscientious man you and he will not be upon good terms   blackman oh people of our avocation differ in respect to conscience puzzle confound and abuse each other and yet are upon good terms   sir george but i fear    blackman fear nothing  there are a vast number o resources in our art  it is so spacious and yet so confined  so sublime and yet so profound  so dstinct and yet so complicated  that if ever this person with whom your fortune is divided should be found i know how to envelope her in a labyrinth where she shall be lost again in a hurry  but your fathers lawyer being a very honest  i mean a very prticular man in his profession  i have reason to fear we cannot gain him over to our purpose  if therefore    enter bluntly sir george my visitor is come as i told you   blackman rising and i am gone as i told you going   enter eleanor blackman aside my lodger ah ah to her in a whisper you may stay another quarter   exit sir george to eleanor i am glad to see you  bluntly  makes a sig to him to leave the room   bluntly sir   sir george waves his hand and nods his head a second time bluntly sr    stil affecting not to understand him sir george i id you go angrily   bluntly you bid me go sir  oh yes sir  very well sir  but indeed sir i did not hear you before sir  indeed i did not   bows and exit with reluctance which eleanor observes eleanor pardon me sir  i understood my brother was here but i find he is not   sir george he is but this instant gone and will return immediately  stay then with me till he comes takes her hand surely you cannot refuse to remain with me a few moments especially as i hive a great deal to say to you that may tend to your advantage  why do you cst your eyes with such impatience on that do goes and locks it there now you may look at it in vain   eleanor for heaven sake why am i locked in   sir george because you should not escape   eleanor that makes me resolve i will  open the door sir going to it   sir george nay listen to me your sentiments i make no doubt are formed from books   eleanor no from misfortunes  yet more instructive   sir george you shall never know misfortune more you nor your relations  but this moment i presented your brother with a sum of money and he left me with professions of the deepest gratitude   eleanor my brother  has he received money from you ah he promised me he would not disgrace his family   sir george how family indeed   eleanor i cannot remain here a moment longer open the door sir  open it immediately   raising her voice bluntly without sir sir sir  open the door if you please  you are wanted sir   sir george gods death who can want me in such haste opens the door and appears confounded   enter bluntly sir george well sir   bluntly  did you call sir   sir george it was you who called sir   bluntly who i sir   sir george yes sir you  who wants me   bluntly looking at eleanor perhaps it was you that called maam   eleanor it was i that called and pray be so kind as to conduct me to my own lodgings   bluntly offers her his hand sir george dare not touch her  or to stay another moment in the room  begone   bluntly looks at eleanor aside and points to the pistol then bows humbly and retires sir george and now my fair lucretia    he is going to seize her  she takes up the pistol and presents it eleanor no it is not myself i will kill  it is you   sir george starting nay nay nay lay it down  lay that foolish thing down i beg you will trembling it is charged  it may go off   eleanor i mean it to go off   sir george but no jesting  i never liked jesting in my life   eleanor nor i  but am always serious  dare not therefore insult me again but let me go to my wretched apartments   passes by him presenting the pistol sir george go to the    she turns short at the door and presents it again sir

more as i am worth   blackman draws a chair sits dawn with great familiarity and stares sir george rudely in the face blackman lost all you are worth he he he he laughs maliciously pretty news truly

george bluntly leave us a moment exit bluntly well mr blackman what is this grand secret   blackman why in the state to which you have reduced yourself there is certainly no one hope for you but in that portion that half of your fortune which the will of your father keeps you out of   sir george but how am i to obtain it the lawyer in whose hands it is placed will not give it up without being insured from any future demand by some certain proofs   blackman and suppose i should search and find proofs suppose i have them already by me  but upon this occasion you must not only rely implicitly on what i say but it is necessary you should say the same yourself   sir george if you advance no falsehood i cannot have any objection   blackman falsehood  falsehood  i apprehend sir george you do not consider that there is a particular construction put upon words and phrases in the practice of the law which the rest of the world out of that study are not clearly acquainted with for instance falsehood with us is not exactly what it is with other people   sir george how is truth immutable truth to be corrupted and confounded by men of the law   blackman i was not speaking of truth  that we have nothing to do with   sir george i must not say so however sir  and in this crisis of my sufferings it is the only comfort the only consolatory reflection left me that truth and i will never separate   blackman stick to your truth  but confide in me as usual  you will go with me then to mr manly your fathers lawyer and corroborate all that i shall say   sir george tell me but what you intend to say   blackman i cannot do that in the practice of the law we never know what we intend to say  and therefore our blunders when we make them are in some measure excusable  and if i should chance to make a blunder or two i mean any trivial mistake when we come before this lawyer you must promise not to interfere or in any shape contradict me   sir george a mere lapse of memory i have nothing to do with   blackman and my memory grows very bad therefore you must not disconcert me   sir george come let us begone  i am ready to go with you this moment   blackman i must first go home and prepare a few writings   sir george but call to mind that i rely upon your honor   blackman do you think bluntly your servant is an honest man   sir george i am sure he is   blackman then to quiet your fears i will take him along with us and you will depend on what he shall say i make no doubt   sir george i would stake my being upon his veracity   blackman call him in then and bid him do as i command him   sir george here bluntly enter bluntly mr blackman has some business with you  listen to him with attention and follow his directions   exit blackman you know i suppose the perilous situation of your master   bluntly shakes his head and wipes his eyes blackman good fellow good fellow  and you would i dare say do any thing to rescue him from the misery with which he is surrounded   bluntly i would lay down my life   blackman you can do it for less only put on a black coat and the business is done   bluntly what is that all oh if i can save him by putting on a black coat i will go buy mourning and wear it all my life   blakman there is a good fellow i sincerely thank you for this attachment to your master   shaking him by the hand bluntly my dear blackman i beg your pardon for what i am going to say but as you behave thus friendly on this unfortunate occasion i must confess to you  that till now i always hated you  i could not bear the sight of you  for i thought you i wish i may die if i did not one of the greatest rogues in the world i fancied you only waited on and advised my master to make your market of him  but now your attention to him in his distress when all his friends have forsaken him is so kind  heaven bless you  heaven bless you  i will go buy a black coat   going blackman i have something more to say to you  when you have put on this coat you must meet your master and meat mr manleys the lawyer and when we are all there you must mind and say exactly what i say   bluntly and what will that be   blackman oh something   bluntly i have no objection to say something  but i hope you will not make me say any thing   blackman you seem to doubt me once more sir   bluntly no i am doubling you now for the first time for i always thought i was certain before   blackman and will you not venture to say yes and no to what i shall advance   bluntly why  i think i may venture to say yes to your no and no to your yes with a safe conscience   blackman if you do not instantly follow me and do all that i shall propose your master is ruined  would you see him dragged to prison   bluntly no i would sooner go myself   blackman then why do you stand talking about a safe conscience half my clients would have been ruined if i had shown my zeal as you do conscience indeed why this is a matter of law to serve your master in his necessity   bluntly i have heard necessity has no law  but if it has no conscience it is a much worse thing than i took it for  no matter for that  come along  oh my poor master  i would even tell a lie to save

child  i now find it is myself  and i aver it to be a sorrow for which all the fortune i am going to possess will not repay me   sir george then my dearest sister indulge the hope you may yet be his
