and j bell near exeterchange in the strand  a summary view of the english scots and irish stages the utility and dignity of the stage when properly conducted has never been disputed in any age or nation by men of liberal sentiments in church or state some exclamatory blasts of enthusiasm have indeed at different times made virulent yet feeble attacks some faint remains of these now and then issue officially from tottenhamcourtroad and moorfields instructors but even they only utter invectives to preserve custom and affected sanctity while their hearers as well as themselves laugh at the unnecessary frivolous delusion the stage should not complain of this abuse as every institution may be and certainly is misconducted as well as misrepresented indeed as to the scandalous irrational and most illiberal roman act adopted ridiculously by our legislature which stigmatizes performers while not only the matter and manner of their performances have been and are legally authorized and universally encouraged it deserves general reprobation and theatrical contempt  roscius ciceros idol if his profession could be originally deemed bad should receive no credit from excellence in pursuing an infamous path as well might a dexterous highwayman claim praise for excelling in actions totally unsufferable  some three years since i publicly invited a bigoted preacher in scotland to bring one text of scripture in corroboration of his rigid opinions i asked if dramatic compositions were inconsistent with strict christianity why saint paul should have quoted from a greek author in that sphere with some other pinching interrogations which appeared unanswerable and occasioned what i did not wish or mean the defection of many subscribers to this persons preaching a manifest temporal injury to him  in the course of what i have to offer i shall be desultory consequently unmethodical i shall produce nothing which does not in my idea deserve notice but as to arrangement i shall let circumstances and anecdotes fall in as they may the more to sport with and amuse attention i shall endeavor to pursue othellos rule and nothing extenuate even respecting myself nor ought let down in malice concerning others while impartiality is my guide i wish to be  the moment i pass that line may contempt be my portion the same contempt i have ever entertained for envy malevolence and adulation three common attendants upon  actors and every degree of public life a strng symptom of pride may appear in this declaration but a strict attentin to the several degrees of human nature with many severe ubs some gleams of sunshine many selfdelusions more relative ones and rigid inspection into social connections have made me i presume a tolerable judge of the subject i now enter upon  from every historical circumstance we have reason to believe that such entertainments as a theater affords could not be in a state of regularity or elegance for many years after their existence the reformation in its infancy the grand spanish invasion not only threatened but prosecuted these and other succeeding circumstances all contributed to prevent that justice of exhibition for shakespeares inimitable productions which they deserved no amendment could be expected in the quibbling sanctified pedantic witchhunting period of james the first as to the miserable monarch his son charles his time of royalty was so perplexed so turbulent and so fatal to himself nothing gentle elegant amusing or instructive could possibly prevail cromwells prevalence though a glorious era for the nation was very unfavourable and necessarily so to the drama after the interregnum if i may so call an admirable and spirited administration of government  a volatile and we may add politic monarch came forward who perceiving a settled gloom on the nation determined to work a change by introducing the levity of wit the glare of show the bat of gallantry and a general plan of dissipation to shake off attention from matters of serious concern if ever the stage was prostituted it was at this time amidst a flow of great of original powerful genius dryden may stand a proof of the whole who ranted pompously enthusiastically in his tragedies and descended to the lowest most fulsome stuff in his comedies however in this reign we may commence the first degree of theatrical excellence as to performers and upon a retrospect we find great uniformity in the cast of plays as it is phrased every one like a good soldier kept his place and by not being misplaced we may conclude made a good figure nay from the best accounts we are taught to believe so even the printed dramas strengthen this opinion and this is one of the best methods to judge by both comparatively and decisively as in examining the present stage hereafter i will clearly demonstrate from this period composition and representation have save the comedies of cve  and farquhar with rowes tragedies been improving i mean as approaching nearer nature i do not contend for spirit character or invention in favor of the present age but a claim to superior propriety may b justly maintained upon comparion  the era of wilkes booth and cibber has been highly blazened and there is reason to credit tradition in many points but from the imitators of them i have seen who though they had by no means equal execution certainly possessed their manner it was offensive to chaste criticism thus quins turgid swell was derived from booth who catched his from betterton young cibbers caricature grimace and snipsnap expression were but the remnants of his fathers oddity and the late mr giffards genteel comedy which he valued himself upon was but a costive retail of that formal gentility which obtained for mr wilkes when fullbottomed wigs mechanic utterance and stiff deportment were in fashion general applause  from their time to mr garricks introduction of nature upon the stage dramatic entertainments were miserably mangled amidst wretched anarchy and most disgraceful management  the irish stage till mr sheridans assuming the reins of direction was from all i have been able to learn scarce worth mention in my own remembrance four elringtons the most deplorable manglers of dialogue serious or comic that ever disgraced a theater royal monopolized all the principal characters the women were perfect mopsqueezers and the decorations mere puppetshow trumpery mr sheridan labored for and in a great measure effected a reformation if his execution as an actor had been equal to his judgment and his general succes as a manager been equal to his liberality  spirit his condescension to performers and his zeal for the stage he would have made ere now a very genteel fortune but being in some points capricious and rather too fond of rigid exercise of authority he incurred at various times very prejudicial public resentment and though supported by many friends he was frequently attacked both by public and private foes till at length from a riculous attachment to court principles for he was wonderfully fond of a smile at the castle levees he drew upon himself a storm which blighted all his fairest hopes and bre away with it the fruit of much labor and several favorable harvests  to this gentleman for whom i shall always entertain a proper degree of respect i stand indebted for an introduction to the stage an introduction more like that of a friend than a manager from whom had i chosen to stay in his theater i had reason to expect the most lberal encouragement here to anticipate any biographical manufacturer who might in future as actor or author gibbet me up to the view of posterity i shall give an impartial narrative of my coming into and general progress through life which will naturally take in by connexions some schoolfellows and public cotemporaries whom i wish to preserve from misrepresentation as much as i do myself  without any boast of parentage suffice it to say my father had the general repute of an honest man who without any brilliance of parts possessed a share of sense to command respect he had seen much of the world and from thence laid in a stock of liberal notions by forty years service in the army during which time he had seen many coxcombs of fortune titles or interest put over his head he obtained a captains commission in this station most unfortunately for me he died when i was but seventeen he was blessed with a wife and i with a mother who by invariable conduct proved herself a worthy pattern of both characters  the   d of october      gave me to this mortal stage my state of infancy was most affectionately attended to and by unremitting care an imperfect constitution rendered very strong at ten or a little after i was put under the care of mr butler a clergyman who kept a grammar school in diggesstreet dublin here my first acquaintance and intimacy began with messrs mossop and dexter both within a year of my age mr mossops father residing at his rectory his son henry was sent to the care of an uncle who then kept a booksellers shop this uncle put him to mr butlers school and lodged him at an obscure butchers in an obscure market as i presume for cheapness sake not very happy in his situation he frequently by leave passed a few days at my fathers with me and being of a grave cast was much liked by all the family as well as myself  during the space of five years we were inseparable and as i thought that kind of esteem daily grew upon us which seldom terminates but with life at fifteen i had the misfortune to obtain a commission in the same regiment with my father the inconveniency of which station i did not experience till the death of my best friend brought it to light indeed before that melancholy event i began to dislike the school of mars which was then and i am afraid is too much so still a scene of dissipation and excess exceedingly dangerous for a young unformed mind possessed of warm passions  in the year of the rebellion a camp of  000 men was formed at bennetsbridge near kilkenny which though a pleasing show was certainly an idle affair discipline being in a most relaxed state our marchings and countermarchings our sweatings and our swimmings were almost as laughable as major surgeons expedition to acton ealing etc however we furnished many important paragraphs for the dublin newspapers one of which i well remember though we were but fifty miles from the capital killed  00 of us by an epidemical distemper which had never been heard of in the camp a strong proof of what authentic intelligence those political vehicles convey  from bennetsbridge we returned to dublin duty here i found messrs mossop and dexter members of trinitycollege the former complained grievously at the narrowness of his allowance lamenting his discontent in a romantic fit of friendship i gave him my commission purposing to accomplish myself for the church this circumstance he has often mentioned as i have been informed however he had not interest to get the tranfer ratified by government from dublin we were ordered into separate quarters the company i belonged to was destined for cashell neither the captain nor lieutenant attending  a pretty circumstance in time of war the care of a hundred men fell to my share the route pointed out our way and we pursued it with commendable regularity save as i suspected the plunder of some henroosts on our arrival at cashell a well situated pleasant plentiful city i received a complimentary message from the new mayor who was that day giving a feast on commencing magistracy to partake of the festivity  i attended was received with most polite hospitality and found myself immediately acquainted with near thirty leading gentlemen thus far was well but it being a kind of custom in that county to drink a visiters senses away i sustained a most formidable attack surrounded by seasoned veterans at length my prudence head and heels gave way and i fell a sacrifice to bacchus but not till three aldermen and two parsons had previously fallen prostrate  this was rather an unfavourable commencement but during my stay in the place afterward i kept rather aloof and was better enabled thereto by passing much time in the family of a gentleman who had three very agreeable daughters one of whom though at least twelve years older than myself had rearly captivated me however cupid perhaps thinking me a trifling conquest let me for that time escape dr price then archbishop of the sea was another strong motive of prevention from excess for as that liberalminded prelate very condescendingly gave me a general invitation to his palace and to ride with him which took place every fair morning i was edifyingly drawn from the company of those who prefer hunting and the bottle to every mental enjoyment  i was not above four months in this very agreeable and i may add profitable situation till my party was ordered to kinsale where a large number of french prisoners were rather refractory at cork i found two hundred of those gently waiting to be conducted to kinsale by me i took them in charge but never recollected till we had marched eight miles that there was not a grain of ammunition in the whole party however nothing amiss happened  at kinsale discipline took place and the young officers were commendably attentive but being altogether in a mess we misled one another abominably both as to expenses and constitutions our propensity to dissipation was considerably increased by the goodnatured volatility of capt henry boil walsingham son of the then speaker of the house of commons whose unbounded goodnature and uncommon flow of spirits rendered him amiably delusive and persons who had little but their pay endeavoring to associate with him ran into difficulties which however his generosity having a large income besides a captains commission often removed  i cannot pay a just tribute to the merits of this young gentleman taken out of life too soon as with a few more years and reflection he would have been a very complete ornament of society and a most valuable friend to his country  while we were at kinsale together an account reached us that liberty was given to raise two regiments for the dutch service being tired of a life so inactive in the military view as ours then was we determined to apply for commissions of an advanced rank in one of those regiments he promised to take me by the hand which would have insured me success and even offered to assist with money if any thing of that kind seemed necessary the dutch design being dropped on a view of peace i was foolish enough to give a hundred guineas for advance of rank in the same regiment without considering it took me from a station wherein i stood secure from reduction and placed me in one of the four additional companies which about eight months after were reduced here i found myself within the penurious limits of halfpay i had a right to some freehold property but being under age could not dispose of it and was cheated out of the rent all but a trifle by a knavish tenant  here i flew to the stage without any great affection for it as a performer and found a most gentlemanlike reception from mr sheridan who judiciously recommended aboan in ooonko for my trial in which notwithstanding a most unconsequential figure and uncommon timidity i succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectations but this did by no means reconcile me to the back of the curtain as the spirit of malevolence envy and scandal was hourly invading my ears a season and a half passed without one symptom of ambition to urge for parts and at a time when mr sheridan had marked out a very reputable cast for me i declined so precipitate a retreat was in a great measure occasioned by receiving a letter that an uncle of mine till then totally unknown to me even by name had died in the east indies and left me  00 l this gave me a turn for domestic life as the sale of my little freehold was likely exclusive of a  00 l mortgage to produce me  00 l more when of age i was advised that on coming to london or by sending proper authority i might receive my indian legacy desirous of seeing the english capital i set out  here i shall return a little  during my connection with the dublin theater i received a letter from mr mossop then in london that he had been drawn from ireland by the invitation of an uncle who as he said would do nothing material for him that he had offered himself to mr garrick and mr rich who both the latter is not surprising deemed him unworthy acceptance and therefore requested i would mention him to mr sheridan i did and was informed that a mr marshall with whom we were both intimate had previously mentioned the matter i was asked some questions which i answered with all the friendship and impartiality my ever favorite principle would allow mr sheridan always above envy gave him a cordial invitation he came over and had his choice of parts he very judiciously chose zanga in the revenge and displayed in it an astonishing degree of beautiful wildness his amazing powers of voice were clearly perceived and unanimously approved his action was what in a great measure it ever remained forced awkward and unpicturesque his emphasis mechanical and laborious however a whole pit full of collegians terrified criticism from any exertion for two nights and indeed his merit went so far before his faults that the encouragement though enthusiastic was right  the same week which produced mr mossop to public view furnished the stage with another very considerable ornament mr digges who had been an officer a young gentleman furnished with very agreeable and essential requisites such as a graceful person a comely countenance marking eyes and a fulltoned distinct though not harmonious voice  these two competitors set off in the race of fame nearly together and emulated with becoming spirit however mr mossop both in diligence and powers rather outstripped his competitor though mr digges has since shown himself a much more general performer by so powerful a reinforcement mr sheridan had a brilliant season nor did he as has been practiced since bind rising merit to a kind of an apprenticeship upon penurious terms he rewarded them liberally and brought them forward with rapid speed  a ludicrous instance of mr mossops capricious haughtiness may out of many be produced after performing the part of zanga three nights he chose richard for a fourth appearance and most unaccountably dressed the character in puckered white satin mr sheridan very justly observing that it had a most coxcombly appearance the remark reached mr mossops ear who next morning went to the managers room and most emphatically addressed him thus mr she  ri  dan i hear you said i dressed richard like a cox  comb that is an af  front you wear a sword pull it out of the scab  bard i will draw mine and thrust it into your bell  ly this furious attack was smiled off and had an amicable conclusion  a circumstance here strikes recollection painfully which is that success in less than a month raised my schoolfellow so high on tragedystilts that a most ungracious reserve prevailed in his deportment and even to me he was the great man though civil though i ever admired merit and respected preeminence i never did nor never will idolize either this he wanted in both respects i would not flatter my friendship forbad it he grew shy according to the dictates of his pride thus fell gradually into decay what i wished a permanent friendship i may have been too ready to catch offense but he certainly was too ready to furnish cause i was rather concerned at such a divorce of an early regard yet i believe we still entertained good wishes for each other and am willing to style it the jarring of two oddities who had not forbearance sufficient for each others foibles  this supposed defection of a friend hastened my expedition to england i reached chester at a time when mr macklin had brought an excellent company to that city knowing several of the members and wishing to know others i protracted my journey a matter of three months which passed pleasantly and rationally save too great expense loss of time and a near chance of matrimony which would then have been peculiarly indiscreet one leading defect of my disposition has been procrastination which has operated most powerfully however i was not totally idle for during my stay i altered ben johnsons sejanus which i shall speak of in future just previous to setting off for london mr derrick another early acquaintance pursued my steps not liking the avocation he was placed to viz that of a linendraper very bare of cash and little acquainted i was obliged to stand forth for him which i had great pleasure in doing  soon after coming to london for sake of better air i took lodgings at richmond mr derrick remained with me there near a year and was most of the time using his admirable talents for pushing into an extensive acquaintance while i waited with philosophic patience though not proper economy for my expected legacy passed most of my time in reading  the employment of my pen a strong degree of theatrical frenzy having seized poor derrick who contrary to  sense and void of every executive requisite would make a stage attempt in friendly compassion i prevailed on him to assume a character wherein his diminutive and deformed figure would not be so laughable he in consequence murdered gloucester in jane shore and i believe convinced himself a well as the audience that he could never be bearable for i recollect no similar attempt  well for the stage if many others had followed so sensible an example  during my stay at richmond i published the alteration of johnsons sejanus and from a connection my father had with the orrery family i dedicated it to the late earl john whose literary abilities and extreme liberal turn of mind reflected honor on nobility and even on the name of boil being ever of a distant nature in matters of this sort i referred presentation of the copy to mr derrick who never was better pleased than when employed in this manner he brought me a verbal account that my piece was politely received and that his lordship wished to see me at his house then in leicesterfields i obeyed the summons and never experienced more affability or good sense than at this interview he was pleased to say that i had given some marks of genius but feared if i should in future show much improved abilities they would be but of little advantage for as he emphatically observed the fountainhead of critical taste was frozen and benumbed if you have a turn for politics continues his lordship and will prostitute principle to profit either for or against administration some lucrative consequences will doubtless ensue but if you are an honest principled writer ten to one but laudatur and alget is a proper motto for you how far i have found this veriied i will not pretend to say but heartily wish i had been fated to use an awl and end sooner than the pen for nothing but a pensioned defender of government a sycophant to managers or a slave to booksellers can do any thing more than crawl  in about a week after i had seen lord orrery i received from him a letter with an order on mr hoare his banker for twenty guineas and an observation that he wished more substantial approbation to attend every future production of mine after this the only profit from dedication i ever experienced and indeed did not expect i never saw his lordship  however mr derrick made such good use of his first visit that he pursued and at length  miraculous to think  drew his lordship as well as some other distinguished characters unto a cordial epistolary correspondence a little after this period i was saluted with an account that my legacy was arrived and payable but how was i surprised to find that three honest lawyers here had upon perusing my uncles will explained away  00l out of the  00l i expected this disagreeable stroke precipitated me into fresh dissipation which shortly narrowed my circumstances much and occasioed me to accept an engagement for mr simpsons theater at bath  before my expedition thither under the gothic management of one mr phillips an old theatrical coxcomb vain of playing and covetous of money i had the pleasure to see both town houses in a very reputable state of performance but as to tragedy save some of mr garricks peculiar parts if i may so speak covent garden was much superior in comedy drury lane claimed manifest precedence there never was a more masterly performance than every man in his humor from kitely to cash every part was supported with a proportional degree of pleasant propriety  mr mossop who had reached the english stage had the dublin audiences approbation cordially therefore essentially confirmed here yet though he possessed undoubted merit some share of what may be styled good fortune attended him in both places for what the irish collegians began with animation the london templars finished with zeal would he had been as friendly to himself as the public was to his endeavors here as in dublin too much illconcerted expense attended his pride yet i cannot recollect his circumstances were at this period so much reduced as those of some other successful knightserrant of the stage i have known no intimacy prevailed between us considerably owing i believe to my rigid remembrance of his sudden contemptible exaltation of deportmnt and unfriendly precision of conversation below the idea of a liberal education and much more so of a liberal mind however before leaving town i paid him a complimentary visit when he wished me and i believe with friendly meaning all possible success  when arrived at bath where the campaign was begun i found a very imperfect odd jumbled crew and according to many of the undertakings i was forced upon most of my endeavors only tended to make the groupe more ridiculous for being chiefly in a much varied capital line i must necessarily have been often capitally wrong however in the most unjustifiable attempts i always met with forbearance without the aid of a single puff or any support from personal acquaintances for i neither sought  obtained above twelve during eight months residence multiplicity of acquaintance and especially upon an interested plan i ever despised  so many repetitions of self are disagreeable but as they are unavoidable and as what i shall advance can be corrobolated o contradicted by many persons living egotism becomes less painful and may be the more credible amidst the study of a multiplicity of parts i wrote the suita a tragedy which was well received though weakly performed even mr quin vouchsafed to say it was a tolerable thing but the male performers were mere sprats of mussulmen a remark not amiss for there were several light figures however that gentleman with more than usual condescension gave me on my night two guineas for a ticket wishing me a better trade than a bath author or actor for says he the people of fashion come here only to tipple water or game and as to the towns people they understand little save extortion two points i found amply confirmed  the second season i produced zaphira a tragedy on the same story of dr browns barbarossa but performed before that gentlemans piece came out at drury lane it was better represented and better received than the sultan though with less profit to me the same season i fitted up an alteration of shakespeares richard the second which though incumbered with too many characters of importance to be adequately supported by a country company for such bath might then be called was also very well received indeed the performance of one miss ibbot the best declamatory actress i ever heard contributed much to the pieces reputation the manuscripts of these two tragedies have i know not how been purloined from me  during summer between the second and third seasons at bath i came to london and found mr derrick studying law and practical philosophy in that agreeable academy the  where his situation would have been painfully exigent had not the late sir francis delaval mr foot a dr thompson and through their assistance other gentlemen liberally subscribed for his support the mens of which was placed in mr vaillas hands from whom he received it weekly  luckily when this supply was near exhausted i recommended his situation to the notice of a most benevolent gentlemn who served him essentially as he has me on many occasions mr c  not only raised him twenty pounds subscription to a volume of poems but by means of the late sergeant hd got him out of confinement this pleasing point d i went to bath and there sound the company under the direction of mr king whose spirited performances drawing better audiences than ever had been known there before and whose regular yet mild and gentlemanlike management rendered the theater much more agreeable than to me it ever had been and to the proprietors much more proft  departing from bath i shall omit several excursions made to places of less note and only observe that during a years vacation from dramatic connections i had an opportunity to see the london stages in their meridian glory and a very noble emulation carried on with great spirit and ability on each side the uniformity of each cast filled by persons devoted to a particular department was now strictly adhered to the managers did not then play the game of cross and pile as they do now nor make what is head one night tail another the policy of this scheme i shall presently elucidate as also endeavor at showing its manifest detriment to the stage in general and hackneyd drudges in particular  having received an invitation from edinburgh i went thither and met there on my arrival an extreme disagreeable disappointment mr digges and mrs ward two very popular favorites instead of joining the company as was expected decamped to dublin leaving nothing to apologize for them and reduced me to the same disadvantageous state i was first in at bath obliging me to take a porters load on a schoolboys back judge of my regret when i was obliged to march on with a very insignificant figure the first night in othello and the second in hotspur parts i would ever have wished to decline after all i met indulgence and the season for six weeks during which time i had the misfortune to be acting manager  a most disagreeable station  went smoothly on at length considering some friends i had brought to the company and without whom it would have been truly deplorable ill used i resigned with secret joy the reins of painful government painful except where a thirst of power even in a pageant state stifles delicacy of feeling several theatrical maneuvers were practiced to make me uneasy but finding me vulnerable only through the sides of my friends i was so closely attacked that way that an entire breach ensued and at the end of the season i parted with the managers as they styled themselves on terms not the most polite however i was well pleased to get rid of such a disagreeable shuffling connection and wishing to see glasgow a city i had heard much of i went thither without any public view  the place upon examination answered the description i had heard of it in the disposal of streets and elegance of buildings as well as in briskness of trade and opulence of merchants i was unexpectedly invited by some gentlemen who had seen me in edinburgh to stay a few months and assist some persons of respectable families in the proper pronunciation of english some gentlemen of the university soon after applied to me for the same purpose i undertook the task with some reluctance but at length went through it pleasingly and profitably just before my departure it was intimated to me by persons of some influence that if i would settle there it was more than probable that a professorship for english oratory might be obtained for me with a settled salary and the advantage of pupils which i make no doubt would have turned out a comfortable establishment yet strange is the mind of man though from early years i had wished for a calm retreat now a very eligible and practicable one appeared a sudden wandering seized my brain and i would set off for london but not without returning warm and grateful acknowledgements for favors received and those proposed  from glasgow i went to carlisle over a country rather wild but good road rendered it agreeable at carlisle which is a pretty little agreeable city peopled with genteel affable inhabitants but not much enriched with trade i expected a remittance from ireland through london i waited a fortnight with patience then received information that my draft had been evaded highly chagrined at this and being ever more prone to revenge injuries on myself than other people i precipitately in the heat of vexation joined a company of thespians then exhibiting there this is the only scene of real theatrical wretchedness both as to performance and finances i ever met indeed from the former nothing of the latter could be expected however i was only a pitying spectator of surrounding woes for some remains of cash and a tolerable benefit brought me through bareably  by means of the philosophy i always possessed upon a little reflection time would have passed agreeably enough here had not sympathetic feelings for the penury around me rather encumbered it two men of the company were rational and well behaved my landlord boniface had a smart prattling agreeable daughter and there was lodged in the house a very affable young french prisoner by these with two or three honest blades of cumberland my mind though not improved was innocently and often cheerfully relaxed  at the end of five weeks i received an invitation from mr whitley whom i heard of as and found to be a reputable bustling judicious manager also a good actor in his line out of which the state of his company often forced him and perhaps sometimes inclination yet this admitted it is only what much greater performers have been guilty of many considerable towns have been and are much indebted to him for regularity good dresses and as suitable decorations as they could expect he also deserves praise for sustaining the stage with spirited resolution against much malevolence and many oppressive attacks  i took the road to scarbro which place as i staid there only a week i should not now have mentioned but for the following ludicrous affair  on my road thither i set up at a small house in a small village called kirkleatham here i fell in for want of better company with half a dozen farmers and some servants of mr turner lord of the manor as it has been always an invariable rule with me to conform to the humors of every strange company as one method of knowing the general disposition of mankind i said as they did this conformity pleasing even to brutes with some compliments on mr turner obtained me the titles of honest fellow hearty cock etc accompanied by several slaps on the shoulder and squeezes by the hand which from their roughness i would most gladly have excused however this social sunshine did not last long for happening to pull out my handkerchief a piece of paper dropped on which a person had traced out my road from carlisle and specified the towns to prevent my mistaking a due direction from sunderland to the place i have mentioned is all on the seacoast  happening to go out of the room this paper was picked up by one who for a miracle could read they had while i saw my horse dispatch a feed of oats laid their politic noddles together and as i found had discovered me to be a french spy on coming in i perceived looks of great distance consequence and curiosity silence reigned for about a minute when my making the trite observation that it was a right english meeting look ye there says the oneeyed clerk of the parish did not i tell ye neighbors there are french papists about ay says another turning to his right hand man i told thee giles the pigtail was suspicious and do see what a skeleton it is  he never eat beef or plumpudding in his life  not by any means comprehending these disjointed remarks i applied to my landlord for an explanation who said we all suspect thee to be a french spy though for my part i cannot say but you have called for supper like an englishman and drank like one but our parish clerk and schoolmaster and the rest of the neighbors suspect you to be what i have said now as i am constable and magistrate do you see in his worships absence who is gone to richmond races i must look sharp right mr constable says a smart prig in a green coat and coachmanlike wig it is time to be wigilance i was born a cockney and know that there man is as sure french as i sit at this here table i have a right to be cunning aant i groom to a justice of peace and wasnt i whipperin to the lord chancellor sure i should know law in warmth i exclaimed whip the lord chancellor and squire too for having such fools as you about them  high treason was now echoed through the room for calling a  said the chancellor and squire fools the wise and patriotic company here after giving solemn charge of me to my h retired with no small apprehensions in their countenances my supper now approached and rather laughing upon recollection at so ridiculous an affair i sat down to it with good appetite asking my landlord to partake who with the resolution of a caesar joined me in the attack declaring he did not think i would do him any harm  my room being guarded all night by a couple of stout laborers who first searched my pockets and pilfered as i found afterward two very good razors in the morning i was conducted on horseback for there was no justice nearer than eight miles this was the first and indeed the last time i was ever admired by females for my beauty but they i suppose thinking the rope about my neck where ever we passed pitifully exclaimed he is a likely weel fared mon its a pity of him i hope as how may get off on our road too the tenderhearted constable with a most solemn face told me it was a pity that men should be hanged but it could not be helped and advised me to prepare for the worst i have a regard for you says he for you made me a good reckoning  when we came before the justice at a place called ayton or vulgarly yatton the matter was settled at once by my showing some letters i had about me particularly one from a gentleman whose person and handwriting he both knew after a sharp rebuff and some severe strictures from his worship upon the constables illtimed activity we departed mr longstaff with all the penitence and politeness which defeated vermin of the law are capable of declared that we must not part till we had drank friends i rather declined this ceremony but complied to save worse trouble half a crowns worth of punch was called for with some cold beef etc etc several ludicrous observations passed from my companions among the rest my landlord declared that unless i would drink a glass of forgiveness to the parish clerk who had caused all this he knew the poor man so well his conscience would not let him sleep for putting an innocent man in the way of hanging for continues he if his worship had been as foolish as we folks of kirkleatham who knows what might have happened  our repast over and a general forgiveness both for soul and body offered on my side my rejoiced conductor paid the reckoning i offered to be yorkshire club but with a side insinuation he told me it was not out of his pocket the parish should pay it ay and his time the attendants horsehie etc which when we have another halfcrowns worth says he will make up about forty shillings  i know how to make up a constables bill after two glasses of the second bowl i departed without a grain of resentment and i dare say my friends staid at the parish expense till they were as happy as princes  having observed that i should at present only make bare mention of scarbro let us pass at once to manchester and open to view a convenient though not an elegant theater with a very good apparatus and a tolerable company the season was successful beyond my expectation the performers were cordial easy circumstances promote good humor the towns people were affable and social indeed i never met with more ease amidst opulence more industry with less selfishness or more critical taste with steady judgment than in this flourishing mart of trade the great capital excepted the audiences are liberal without levity and goodnatured without weakness  during the season i produced a dramatic satire called the mentalist which through the uncommonly excellent performance of mr ryder now a respectable manager and deserving actor in one of the dublin theaters met a truly favorable reception and rendered me pecuniary advantage  by the scandalous artifices of a person whom i had essentially served at bath by tittletattle misrepresentations carried to both sides near the close of the season a difference somewhat serious in its nature arose between mr whitley and me from what i soon discovered i found and acknowledged then as i do now that he behaved with spirit and candor while i proceeded with censurable impetuosity though i believe no animosity remained on either side at the conclusion of the season i left his party determining again for london  i shall now for some time drop myself to pursue mr mossop and the general circumstances of the stage  in the theater both male and female performers are in general the most discontented mortals breathing the top want to be higher and the bottom want to be top i know a performer of distinguished abilities no matter for his name who four and twenty years ago lamentingly told me that he had but one guinea and a half per week now continues he if i could but rise to four guineas i should reach my utmost ambition this same person by some happy requisites and about seven years practice without a grain of diligence attained to twice the extent of his wish yet was then as poor or poorer than when he first complained he has since trebled the advantages of his first idea yet though he may live more luxuriantly i cannot learn that he either has or ever had much money to spare  discontent is the most irrational yet the most common perturbation of human nature it invaes the wisest as well as the weakest and wherever admitted turns philosophy headlong out of doors somewhat of this having invaded mr mossop and occasioned him when well established with the london audience when possessed of a salary and other emolumnt more than sufficient for every reasonable and some refined enjoyment of life considering him as a single man without one matrimonial wish in his heart when treated as he since told me with great gentility by mr garrick transported himself i may justly so phrase it to ireland let it be observed that mr barry and mr woodward acted on the same wise plan but as the latter exhibited his penitence publicly and the former i am told recollects his splendid but impoverishing reign with sincere inward compunction well cast a shade over the whole lavish blunder dublin was never made for two theaters nor ever will properly support that number one real good company rather bears hard on the theatrical finances of that metropolis for what avails general spirit without money to support that spirit  hence messrs barry and woodward who had money to lose lost it and my old schoolfellow who had little more than public merit and private character to sacrifice impaired both very much during the greatest part of his mock monarchy he was but ruler of a crew not much above the mendicant tribe if he had pompous dresses for himself an unlimited round of characters some quality acquaintance who stripped him of more by private gaming than they served him in public and the free exercise of his own infallible opinion he was happy though hourly solicited by starving actors and daily watched by keenscented bailiffs he prostituted native honesty which i am sure he possessed to insuperable pride and immovable obstinacy when the disposal of parts was in his own power thinking the kings name a tower of defense he undertook as many things out of his way as he did in it hence in the general view he resembled a man who wears a suit of clothes of contrast materials look at his right side he is velvet and elegance turn to his left he is coarse frize which though warm and convenient is offensively misplaced  for some seasons this unhappy and in the main great man maintained painful unprofitable and perturbed authority he was all through an entire slave to his passions and most part of the time a prisoner to his circumstances and he who thought one half if not all mankind beneath him could for occasional forbearance bribe and truckle to the most contemptible rascally set of the human species  need the word bailiffs be added  however paradoxical this may appear it is certainly true and shows how very contradictory the human heart is often to itself after toiling through much more than i am able or think necessary to relate  outlines of misery are sufficient he was seized with a malignant fever which unfortunately for himself and i may add for all his wellwishers did not take him off yet shattered his constitution so much that to my immediate knowledge he could never have made in public a figure equal to his original abilities of this i shall mention more and more properly hereafter  my next trip from manchester was to join a company as it was called of kidnapped comedians picked up from london dublin etc led by one bardin a noted adventurer who without any consent obtained from the magistrates most ignorantly and impudently intruded himself and unhappy co upon the town of liverpool where the wise mayor had at that time conceived a wise prejudice against theatrical performances why or wherefore he knew not but power is power however used a set of people who innocent with regard to their general intentions were decoyed there by threats of prosecution curiously fabricated in the chicanery of law the performers were not only intimidated but their finances were so much reduced that they neither knew how to return or how to stay upon honest principles indeed i believe two or three were capable of any retreat not possessing the lastmentioned ingredient  the principle of selfdefence in the first place and a social concern for persons trepanned into a praemunire made me strike out a rational evasion of that childish or rancorous law which makes that in common prosecutable which a royal patent can sanctify my scheme was to style and to occupy the theater as a school of oratory for the explanation of moral and practical philosophy both according to the ancients and moderns to render this plausible and indeed incontrovertible as to both law equity and common sense i gave before each of the pieces a short introductory lecture upon the general subject and tendency of the play a point not amiss to be practiced here instead of farcical unmeaning prologues  for six or seven nights that we performed our little hovel was filled and every thing bore a pleasing prospect as to profit nor did any storm immediately threaten our quiet but mr mayor  a wonderful man thinking the territory of his jurisdiction was invaded determined sense or no sense to suppress the same kind of entertainment in winter which at a most improper season the summer he was an encourager of to say a disagreeable truth it was on good authority reported that the london company who had been excluded that summer had interposed to effect our exclusion which took place accordingly but not in the ungenteel tyranical manner designed by our adversaries for sorry am i to say that the late mr holland going from manchester to london took liverpool in his way and offered liberally to lay a gentleman who told me of it live guineas that the itenerants  what was he at the time would all be shopd his polite phrase in less than a week he was deceived in this point and would have been in the whole of his expectations had not a miserable illiterate wretch who has since played at drury lane on being interrogated how he lived answered by the stage which was equally mean and false mean as he had been instructed otherwise and false as it was impossible he could live by what he in no shape understood  on the day before our defeat from the above paltry explanation took place our valorous manager ever renowned for being the first in and the first out of a scrape secreted himself as i was credibly informed in a coalhouse and a person who now fancies himself the paragon of actors  oh dire necessity of the stage  sculked out of town accompanied by a flimzy female his then wife  the noble group of heroes and heroines dissolved some scrambled back to london with this small difference of carriage that several who came down in the coach were glad to return in the basket others swam upon credit to dublin while mr hurst of drury lane and i remained we gave two or three lectures were indulged with genteel audiences and put some essential pounds in our pockets i also delivered two for servants as they are styled of the company who i understood to be pennyless they were by this effort to my very great satisfaction decently relieved thus ended an expedition well conceived miserably conducted and pitifully marred  from this mingled scene of laughter and woe i went to chester where i again met mr whitley having several cordial and respectable friends in the city i resolved to pass some time there as a private visiter at my leisure hours i wrote the modish wife and though i had no connection with or emolument from the company i gave my manuscript to the manager to use it he chose it he received the offer politely and got the piece up with care it was very well performed and most kindly received for four nights though full three quarters of an hour longer of performance than in its present state mr hurst who did a material part can testify this  during my stay i also pieced together a little interlude calculated for an admirable set of children called the fairy court this trifle was so excellently presented so indescribably supported by the little ones especially by one miss wheeler not then eight years of age that it ran fifteen nights  benefits a circumstance scarce ever known in a country town save in the case of the beggars opera when it find came out i dont mention this any further in praise of myself than in furnishing ideas which the children so aptly conceived and so excellently expressed besides i had novelty on my side as so very young a dramatis personae had never been seen there  at this period being near dublin i was much inclined to visit my native soil but a fresh and material disappointment irritated me to a new theatrical expedition to which i was the more readily induced by the formation of a new company set on foot by two persons i wished extremely well i joined the infant society which was very regular  and respectable in private though thee was not much stage merit to boast of i made a tour of twelve months and though some rubs interrupted us yet i had the pleasure at parting to know that my friend mr bates then sole proprietor was if not quite very near established indeed a few monhs proved the matter he has since maintained a very advantageous circuit in yorkshire wherein from his complacent disposition good regulations and punctual honesty he has acquired universal esteem and i heartily hope a cmfortable competency no man deserves it better either as a conductor of a theater or as a member of society  it may seem odd that i make particular mention of persons little it at all known here but i shall always be glad of acknowledging worth when and wherever i find it  having by my own desire and on the utmost terms of friendship quitted this connection just when profits began to be considerable i went from scarbro a place like bath made up in the summer of fantastical people of quality and ravenous tradesmen who prey on them let me except however the seafaring part who are blunt hospitable and sincere  i now went once more sick of public life to an agreeable and reasonable market town about twenty miles from york called malton remained there a year and married a most deserving female  excuse a sigh and tear to her loved memory  i remained in this domestic retreat four years and experienced from the inhabitants save one with whom i had some dealings in the bill way very kind friendly treatment as also from some leading gentlemen in the neighborhood during my residence here i wrote a thing in two volumes called a trip to the moon which had uncommon praise in that part of the world and was not severely treated by those critical dictators the monthly reviewers yet the success of that publication was no way considerable  my pen was next employed by advice of a gentleman consequ n fortune and connexions in composing a set of fables for his royal highness the prince of wales the work was perused and approved by several acknowledged judges it was corrected and published under the inspection of a gentleman here whom i should think it an honor to name were such freedom consistent with delicacy it was dedicated by permission to his royal highness was presented and graciously received i had in consequence a very polite letter from a lady of quality eminent in her station at court  but further on this point we say not  after this moonshine gleam of advantage had passed over a sh prospect the more agreeable as unexpected started up i mean the patronage of that justly and generally lamented friend of his country the late marqss of granby a gentleman who knew my fathers and my former ation recommended me to his lordship showing him at the same time some of my productions the consequence was that he would provide comfortably for me a promise i had afterward from the marquisss own mouth near twelve months i waited in pleasing expectation then came to town and had not been above a quarter of a year when death my frequent friend in such cases before and since robbed me of my foremost hope and a favorite son in the sm day  with essential philosophy i looked forward and endeavored to avoid casting a glance behind notwithstanding a peevish state of circumstances urged perturbation at this time i waited on mr foot who had the following comedy recommended by the late sir francis delaval two years in his possession he waved bringing it out pleading the insufficiency of his company to do a five act piec  in lieu of rejecting my piece mr foot very kindly and then conveniently for me offered a summer engagement which i gratefully accepted played and was without any agreement gratified by mr fotes generosity with a aly which according to the state of his theater and the little trouble performers have there beyond my own opinion with this gentleman i passed three agreeable and advantageous summers an expedition to edinburgh one of the intervening winters was though pleasant rather a balance against me as i took no benefit however renewing some valuable acquaintanceships and having the pleasure to see a great improvement not only in the city but in customs manners and critical task i by no means lamented pecuniary deficiencies during my connection with the haymarket i fabricated two after pieces the obamist and cupids revenge which were exceedingly well received yet again pl grlick received but trifling advantage march      most fatally deprived me of a companion equal to every idea of matrimonial happiness whose loved memory no revolutions fortunate or adverse will ever eraze great indeed have been the prejudices of mind and circumstances accruing from this very fatal and most unexpected catastrophe health recollection and every mental exertion were for some months thrown into absolute confusion  about a fortnight before mr footes theater began i was struck with an information that he had no more occasion for my assistance this at a time of peculiar embarrassment embarrassment known to the manager was what i could not at that time account for nor have i to the present moment a single idea of explanation  notwithstanding i was thus unaccountably detached from a place my warm wishes and utmost endeavors were attached to i wrote intentionally for mr weston the panthenites how that piece written in four days and sent into the world without a procured friend to support it succeeded is too recent a circumstance to repeat here i cannot help remarking on a ridiculous custom of authors reading their pieces to the performers this is giving a false consequence in general to the former and is making mere machines of the latter unless such instructors as mr garrick and mr foot step forth the former from his extreme intimacy with nature and from adequate power of expression must give useful striking ideas even to the happiest natural conceptions the latter having a very bold singular caricature imagination of character is indispensibly necessary for the exhibition of his own pieces but after all it is to be wished that the instructed did not catch up the peculiarities instead of the beauties of the instructors it may be advanced that an author best knows his own ideas i grant it intellectually but expressively makes a wide difference i have known some write very tolerably who could not read decently and i have heard parsons preach very good borrowed sermons who could not write a paragraph fit for a schoolboys theme  the season before my separation from mr foot i was astonished by a most friendly line from mr mossop wishing to see me at an appointed hour at forests coffeehouse charing cross though so long at a distance i punctually and cheerfully attended he received me like and i hope as a friend talked of his theater in dublin asked my connection and salary with mr foot i gave him faithful information he sounded my inclination for dublin in a theatrical capacity and suggested not only my assistance to raise recruits but to accept the style of managerdepute i declined all but the recommendation of some performers and even there told him i supposed they would expect collateral security for payment of their salaries here the great man broke out in the syllabled utterance of the word se  cu  ri  ty however i sent two of diligence and merit to him warning them of his situation as i never chose nor ever will be a kidnapper in any shape his being arrested put an end to the negotiation two days before he got into salva custodia a circumstance i very sincerely lamented in a tete a tete i asked him why he did not close with one house or the other here he observed that mrs yates was the only theatrical lady who could play consonantly with him that she was then at covent garden and as there was a particular reason why he could not properly be where mr colman was manager the reason i dont choose to elate he was indifferent about engaging i then suggested his obtaining which he certainly might have done license for six nights at mr footes after the season by which i told him he might at least get  00l and if his original powers remained by presenting himself to public view might oblige the managers of either house to comply with his terms  whether conscious of that natural inward decay i plainly saw or rather more plainly heard or whether through native pride he replied thus old schoolfellow and friend i would not appear at mr footes theater in london to clear  000l in the time you mention  here is a great light thrown on character after the circumstance of his bankruptcy i saw him not but heard that he passed his time dependantly in the south of france  dismal situation for a proud man when he returned here i know not nor did i know of his precipitate decline however of his penury and obscure death i painfully heard too soon mr garrick i am informed offered to bury him but an uncle most generously took that enormous task to himself here we place to rest an actor of as great natural powers as ever graced the stage for tragedy and as great defects as ever cast a damp on merit even in that style  shall we in opposition to that charitable maxim de mortuis nil nisi bonum enter a little into private character as i wish to be done by myself so will i do in this case with truth and brevity  as a schoolboy he was diligent in study goodnatured and strictly honest but rather abstracted as a member of the college he was tolerably oeconomical free from debauchery and equally attentive as at school transplanted to the stage he almost instantaneously grew selfsufficient and arrogant having very little money to command before and rushing into what i may call a profusion for him he forgot not only hs early friends but even himself was in short a bashaw off as well as on the stage on coming to london his arrogance rather abated but success still cherished pride  as to his connections with the female sex i will say no more than this that at the age of eighteen he had as far as i could judge a just and generous idea of their influence but commencing a great man he was intimidated at marriage fearing any invasion of lordly rule however by credible informations he was a dupe to artful females especially an old noble lady in dublin who used to make a tolerable audience for her dear harry as she styled him and after the play stripped him at her route of twice what her interest had procured thus starving actors were deprived of their salaries and the daped imperious manager was worn out of all circumstances  of his management it may be said he never consulted any thing but self not so much for gain as selfish vanity from the whole it may be collected that he had original integrity strongly planted in his breast that he was by nature a gentleman by opportunity and assiduity a scholar by uncommon requisites a great actor and by particular failings a very reprehensible man i ardetly wish to cast a veil over the dark shades but as i profess myself realy an enthusiast of impartiality i cannot disguise or varnish that so little respect was paid by the theatrical word to such an ornament is a reproach to the communities of both houses save those who attended but he who lived rich in abilities went to the grave poor in commemoration very little consquence to the ded but shameful to the living  great things were proposed respecting the amiable worthy dr goldsmith but the great folks dropped off and he went to his grave to their disgrace silently as a common balladsinger after tus were at an end  oh life what are thy strange variations the idol of to day either as a man of power or of genius when breath departs and that power or genius operates no more is neglected not only by the multitude but also by persons who plume themselves on superior or perhap inferior abilities this is an irefragabl proof that all worldly applause more than a man can conscientiously approve is contemptible and highly below sensible regard  having left mr mossop in that final state of liberation from sublunary cares which we must all by one means or other reach i shall proceed to a general view of the london stages from my arrival in town six years ago to the present time  after ten years absence i found a most dreadful declension of tragic merit comedy indeed has not suffered so much i both eard and judged without prejudice and grieved i was to find so little room for approbation most of the faults i had formerly discovered appeared now in an enlarged state and few ver few of the beauties remained though it would be peevish criticism to deny mr holland and mr powell capital merit in some views yet it must be acknowledged that both were very confined the former should never have uttered a tender sentiment the latter should have been entirely limited to pathetic and generous characters mr powells macbeth was boyish to the last degree and mr holland making love was totally preposterous yet were these two the main props of the stage in a variety of inconsistent lights death letting fall the curtain of mortality closed their scenes of action  what remained mr garrick ever excepted and mr barry also while he has half a leg to stand or hop on  mr reddish steps forth in alexander when lysimachus is as far as with credit to himself or justice to the public he should go in that play mr smith did every thing at the other house and every thing the same way mr cantherley another capital actor has figured away in hamlet when laertes would rather overload him mr brereton has  i will not mention for his sake what he has done mr bensley went to school or college as i have been informed with mr colman so of necessity must be as exquisite in acting as the late manager was and may be in writing to say truth absurd elevation has reduced very good second and third rate actors into miserable apologies for the first style and drawn upon them frequent censures they might otherwise have reputably escaped  i promised to give some light into the managerical artifice in making actors so exceedingly ridiculous and metamorphosable an actor really capital is missed by the audience and therefore will have adequate terms without being under slavish subjection to the manager if therefore an hungry appetite for seeing plays however mangled prevails through the public and a man for seven or eight pounds per week is sent on to bungle through principal parts which properly sustained would deserve twice that sum so much is really or supposed to be saved besides a stopgap of this kind should he assume any importance is immediately removed because next ours may succeed him without any public complaint thus actors and audiences are brought effectually into the gripe of pattentees  let us only view comparatively the cast of one play as i have seen it done the orphan castalio mr barry polydore mr sheridan chamont mr garrick the other view  oh lamentable castalio mr reddish polydore mr cantherley chamont mr brereton after several instances nearly equal to this can complaint be unjust or censure cruel  it i somewhat odd tha female merit keeps much nearer its predecessors than that of the males ms barry mrs yates and miss young in tragedy mrs abington  herself lone  mrs bulely miss pope mrs mattocks and mrs green in comedy with the excellent support of messs king particularly woodward shuter weston quick dodd parsons n the soc deserve a large share of approbation how could imagination accept even in most uncommon abilities such contraste transitions as follow one night we see mr palmer who has considerable merit properly applied exhibiting dionisyus a blustering tyrant the next brush a coxcombly valet now tamerlane a cool philosophical declaimer then wilding a rhapsodical pert incoherent volatile young fellow observe mr clinch at covent garden one night stuck up for alexander and the next stuck up for pylades i grant the latter much more within his compass than the former this is annihilating the real talents of performers it is setting a waggonhorse to run a race and yoking a galloper into a cart  let us suppose mrs yates put into comedy chambermaids and miss pope into tragedy heroines would not the former promote sleep and the latter laughter beyond doubt  why then should the men be made butts of ridicule mr reddish kept from all violent passions might be extremely respectable mr smith more applied to comedy must be more pleasing and mr palmer freed from umbling parts which he is apt to overdo might in his proper place be a theatrical ornament  here a remark occurs  after mr mossop quitted the english stage his original part of barbarossa which he shone exceedingly in was supplied by mr bransby a worthy man and very decent actor in his road mr mossop with the consequence i have already mentioned asked an acquaintance in dublin if he could think  who was his successor in one of his principal parts receiving no answer he imperiously but satirically continued the frigid bransby now represents barbarossa incapable politicians have exposed themselves as ministers of state and why not actors vainly mistakenly or compulsively render themselves or be rendered pitiable and contemptible objects  i could point out a number of faults in decorum and enunciation but presuming i shall be deemed rather severe for saying so much as i have done i shall contract myself on these points and only observe that in respect of the former i have frequently and lately seen the side wings of a chamber continued three or four minutes through a grove a garden scene etc i have seen gothic pillars leading to a summer house and wood wings to a hall i have observed attendant lords and ladies pay no more attention or respect to their principals than if they were merely leading puppets i have observed friends assist orestes in his madness without a gleam of concern in their countenances and even pages neglect the trains of queens though spreading those royal ornaments is the only purpose they are sent on for and indeed necessary for a dignified display of figure  in point of enunciation the blunders are innumerable and as to emphasis the misapplication incredible take one instance for all from head to foot it is now become fashionable if the words thou or thy are uttered to mark them strongly without any doubt of meaning as for instance our present tragedy orators in saying give me thy hand though no hand but one is meant childishly or rather pedantically pronounce thy hand  thou art a villain this without comparison should be directly opposite thou art a villain but these and many other essentials are below the notice of all accomplished infallible performers who are as repugnant to the tickling of criticism as a country girl to the approaches of her lover in early hours of courship  action one most graceful and expletive ornament is almost totally neglected as to correctness a needless extravagant misplaced expansion of arms is substituted for that descriptive and impressive disposition of limbs which renders the meaning more obvious and delights the view if the wings of a paper kite an emblem of some arms on the stage did not move so invariably even they would be more diverting  among the heroines a strange exertion of masculine gestures take places which though it may enforce expression destroys essential delicacy there is also a dreadful misapplication here such as pointing to the ground or depressing the hand when elevation of the heart or mind is expressed  standing further back than where the curtain falls is another constant and very prejudicial error as in that situation the voice is devoured and the features are obscured nay sometimes rendered scarce distinguishable it is also very objectionable for those who do or apologize for capital parts to monopolize what they think the most favorable points of view thus a great man stands full fronted to the pit while another character perhaps of consquence is obliged to speak with his back three parts to the audience forming a picture rude and unsatisfactory characters too in general pay too little atention to each other male and female acquaintances in pit or boxes too often call off eyes that should be rivetted to the subject and business of the stage  i have freely and perhaps it will be thought severely as i have determined to sacrifice all other feelings at the shrine of truth exposed the lamentable declension of capital merit it behooves me to give some reason musical pieces have been a most detrimental alternative and pantomime with luxuriant scenery have nearly swallowed up all regard for intrinsic genius and smothered every generous useful sympathetic feeling  before i quit this part of my subject a part disagreeably insisted on i think it a duty to congratulate the public the patentees and the performers that so dispassionate a regulator is appointed at covent garden as mr hall whose head and heart from particular knowledge i can farely pronounce capable of ornamenting any station except that of a politician there impartiality and liberal feelings are an obstacle i sincerely wish for the credit of the stage that every performer either would or was obliged to keep so uniformly within their powers as this gentleman does i cannot be unreasonable enough to wish every son of the buskin to understand his author so well that never was nor can be  of mr garricks management the policy and success have been so long and so universally known that it will suffice as a proof of his generalship to say that he has often particularly of late gained conquests without many front rank men sorry are all true lovers of the drama that he has condescended to call upon as mercenaries or allies the patched coat wooden sword fete champetre etc there is not a single article of that sort but renders capital acting merit unnecessary suffer a mourning friend of the stage to utter this lamentable truth with emphatic feeling  mr footes institution extremely peculiar in its nature is scarce describable i believe he does not wish it so if in his temple of momus local characters temporary sarcasms and biting witticisms enriched with caricature features and grimace will do the whole end is answered and indeed no place of public exhibition ever answered the purpose so well let me not here be supposed scanty or churlsh of praise since according to my own opinion there is more wit satire sentiment and pleasantry in the comic productions in this swallow season theater than either of the winter ones considering the quantity of matter produced  the english scots and irish stages viewed as to critical taste a very short opinion will let in sufficient light upon the whole  in london the audience are judicious forbearing and fond of catching beauties ready to make every allowance slow to find fault keen to seize all occasions of applause tardy to resentment yet treated properly easy to forgive they know best what is right and yet will soonest forgive what is wrong they are prone to the dignity but not the malevolence of criticism  in scotland they well know bad performance and bear it with inconceivable sufferance in public yet are sure to remember it in private and if a public conviction generally takes place it is rigorously enforced the point of criticism in which they are most judicious is declamation here judgment holds a very nice scale and among them would sooner gain applause for a cool deliberate sentiment well delivered than for all the enthusiastic rants of lee poured forth with force their idea of players in a private capacity has been much but justly vitiated by the misconduct of individuals who under public favor and great emoluments for that place have shamefully evaded the engagements of honesty i could name particulars but wish to be excused however be it enough to say that those who should have preserved the stage from shame in that part of the world and had it most in their power have labored most for its reprobation  as to the dublin stage which has been a most excellent nursery for this metropolis a variety of storms has assailed it some owing to proud obstinate managers others to proud luxuriant managers and several to proud ignorant managers to say truth though they are excellent critics in the hibernian metropolis yet the warmth of passion occasions unwarrantable prejudice and savage opposition support is equally violent and a stranger has exceeding fair hospitable play they as well as we here have been from vicssitudes and want of leading genius most miserably off for some seasons insomuch that not a performer has been thought worth importing but mr lewis who we freely admit a pleasant comedian  keep him out of tragedy his and our good stars  the taste of bath in and out of the theater is frippery governed by coxcombly fashion people of consequence there think dramatic entertainments mere time killing amusement the box customers are inattentive and insolent the pit and galleries made up of their domestics or tradesmen are submissive and ignorant if a lady of quality commands a case common there that play must be liked as a proof of profound judgment a royal personage in my remembrance bespoke shakespeares as you like it there was a very pleasant rosalind and a good touchstone the rest could not be much out of the way scarce a creature appeard in the boxes till  the glorious farce of chrononotonthologos was beginning thn came the grandes  oh wonderful  lord chesterfield among the rest but it may be easily conceived he politely sacrificed to folly though it never could be his favoue what i have advanced of bath may serve all the watering places in the kingdom  manchester i have already mentioned as a place of opulence affability and spirit the upper class are not very keen yet they are very sensible and very candid critics they would rather praise than fin fault yet they expect somewhat more than bare decency attention is the chiefest put of their applause and indeed the best any audience can give that cannot be obtaind by puffing the lower class freed from their industrious avocations are willing to receive relaxation in the most agreeable manner  at chester having had many excellent companies from london and many of the inhabitants going frequently to dublin there is a capricious opinion prevails and they are rather to be taken with a theater royal name than real merit without that very honorable addition there is much politeness hospitality and friendship in this city but too much affectation in their criticism  york is goodnaturedly dull audiences there are remarkable for fixing public regard on individuals whom they pronounce incomparable they are a kind of parents to such actors and maintain them from youth to gray hairs even against judgment private character much to the citys honor is peculiarly considered and when good is sure to be patronized mr wilkinson the present pattentee has given in a few years much spirit both to the theater performers and frequenters of it  thus much for the stage  my school fellows deuter and derrick paid the debt of nature under the age of thirty the former was placid in public and private life gave no particular offense or pleasure on or off the stage he was liberal a gentleman and a scholar an unhappy matrimonal connection breaking his temper broke his heart  mr derrick when astonishingly chosen master of the ceremonies at bath without a single requisite for the place promised a grateful return and actually began to make it but being involved amongst ladies of easy virtue he soon forgot his friend and sacrificed his unhappy life to the shrine of venus  as to myself i am still scrambling on the surface of existence with more offenses at my beck etc as to them let some future commemorator set them down and if i have any good qualities join them from my heart i wish to be treated with the same honest veritable freedom with which i have treated others if anatomizing my mind even while living and anatomizing my body when dead can render any public use i freely subscribe to both one favorable circumstance only i shall advance and venture to maintain that i would in no case nor upon any view flatter a monarch or insult a beggar  to the right honorable the countess of mexborough as a

for having an eye to the main chance as every day shows us that interest rules all ranks from the general to the sentinel from the duchess to the chambermaid   col true and you have a right to all the favor i can show for rescuing me from those whiskerd hussars at warbourg  what think you therefore of being provided with a good wife   fusee and a good fortune too sir   col certainly suppose sir scrapealls sister old mother busy   fusee and a sad supposition too sir i think for if she had lived in scotland some century ago her looks would have brought her to the faggot for a witch   col what i suppose nothing will go down with you but the roses and lillies of youth dont you know numscull that beauty is one of the most fading and perishable commodities in the world now old busy having received most of the injuries that time can do human nature will be as engaging at last as at first besides you need not fear a rival   fusee really i believe not sir unless the devil himself turns gallant   col besides she has five hundred a year jointure   fusee has she so sir that makes a very great alteration why she is not half so disagreeable as she was  your honors humble servant is not so nice but he can find roses and lillies in the solemn hue of old gold and the harmony of the spheres from chinking of guinea sbut sir there is one rub still if i should make prize of this old crazy galleon i must try to keep her above water as the cargo is to sink with her if i could but keep the gold and send her to the bottom it would be making a good cruise of it   col i warrant she has an old chest that will afford good spoil and i have no doubt of your success   fusee ah sir i must be a dull scholar indeed not to have learned from you how to tickle female ears and the view of a snug retreat will make me encounter wrinkled cheeks sunk eyes toothless gums and gray hairs with as much alacrity as if youth and beauty were the prize   col on that will depend your success  mother sly shall prepare the way for a proper introduction   fusee but sir there is another rub we had like to forget  your honor knows that i have been forced to make some advances to mrs ruelle lady brainlesss woman now what shall i do to quiet her she is a good friend and may be a bitter foe   col well observed she is a necessary agent and must not be lost should she know you in your disguise you must have recourse to your old method of lying and if that will not prevail my purse shall produce some irresistible arguments she is a politic jade and seems to know the value of a few guineas extremely well   fusee yes truly i believe she does sir and though possessed of a nimble tongue can always be silent when interest tips her the wink   col retire i see sir charles  i shall furnish you with necessary materials and full instruction after dinner exit fusee   enter sir charles prudent sir char colonel good morrow is not my visit unfashionably early   col not at all sir charles an agreeable companion can never come unseasonably save a wench in the case as to fashion she is a capricious jade and below the regard of a sensible man   sir char how can that be when no body in general pays a stricter regard to her rules than my friend   col you must not imagine that every custom i conform to commands my approbation but as peculiarities however rational are rather offensive to the general eye why should a man render himself disagreeably wiser than his neighbors it is a peevish characteristic of age to idolize the modes of its youth for my part i think revolutions in taste necessary and cannot suppose that either the morals or understandings of mankind are injured by a social conformity   sir char most certainly they are not   col so far then i am the voluntary subject but never can become the slave of fashion   sir char to be free colonel does not this sensible compliance proceed chiefly from the influence of the ladies   col to confess the truth i believe it may and among us soldiers it is no more than duty by our commissions we are ranked under the banners of fame and beauty to render the cause of the former service and the dictates of the latter obedience   sir char in which light you have happily distinguished yourself and if report speaks true the ladies have not proved insensible to your merit what fame may do    col gives me very little concern she is an empty airy glittering bubble as the song says when my country calls my best endeavors are at her service but for a mistress let me have warm flesh and blood lips to melt and eyes to fire the heart   sir char like those of emmeline fairlove   col right my friend what were the glory of an alexander to possession of such charms   sir char a mere aerial phantoms but prithee frank has that lady had the power to touch your heart in reality   col touch why she has shot it through and through with cupids arrows made a perfect riddle of it and notwithstanding my love of freedom i begin to think that matrimony alone can work its cure   sir char ha ha ha what the gay gallant and universal lover colonel parapet monopolized by a single happy fair one after all my friend i am afraid that roving dissipated heart of thine will hardly bear limitation   col why so sir charles when that limitation proceeds from choice gallantry is a pretty agreeable amusement for some years at a mans first entrance into life but like other light appendages of youth should give place to more serious enjoyments   sir char so then you have at last determined to become a grave citylike fellow   col not that neither a husband may have spirit without running at large and a wife gaiety without indiscretion   sir char dear colonel you have perfectly expressed pressed my opinion should one happy day give lady charlotte to my arms and emmeline to yours i have no more to ask of fortune   col nor i but you my friend have much the nearer prospect however fortune favors the bold and having laid siege i am determined to carry on my operations with vigor could i but secure the outworks i should have no doubt of the town   sir char by the outworks i presume you mean lady brainless and the amiable mrs busy   col you are right  and sure no mortal had ever greater contrasts to deal with as to the former being young handsome sprightly and good natured it is not a disagreeable point to flatter her vanity but the old beldam is quite intolerable however i have warm hopes of getting her off my hands immediately   sir char by what means   col that you shall know hereafter  the hour calls me at my agents to sign some accounts if you will take a place in my chariot and accompany me thither i shall not detain you above five minutes then i am yours as you please   sir char with all my heart   col allons exeunt   scene ii lady charlotte meeting emmeline l charlo good morning to my dear emmeline   emme lady charlotte your servant   l charlo oh emmy i begin to think quality a sad encumbrance so much ceremony such fatigue and so little society that inexhaustable spirits and very pliant reason are necessary to go through the whimsical round why last night now at lady ombres route was i obliged to stay till the telltale sun rendered flambeaux unnecessary and had not your colonel gallanted me most pleasantly i should have made a very humdrum pitiful figure   emme my colonel   l charlo nay nay dont change color child every honest heart like yours speaks through the eyes therefore you may as well confess but you are diffident and require help in these cases so let me say for you that colonel parapet is a pretty fellow   emme dear lady charlotte your cordial regard commands my utmost confidence and obliges me to acknowledge i have always thought him a man of merit   l charlo very well my dear and when a woman of sense in the single state allows a bachelor merit take my word for it love is not far off but i hope you have not betrayed your good opinion to his knowledge for the men like us emmy grow vain upon being admired   emme i hope and believe no word or action has revealed my opinion   l charlo so much the better hope kept at a distance in the affairs of love causes a more eager pursuit there is my swain sir charles prudent has paid his addresses to me these twelve months yet has arrived at no point of certainty nor do i know when he will notwithstanding he has an exalted place in my esteem   emme your ladyships caution is the effect of good sense and i flatter myself with considerable advantage from so prudent an example  oh i see my agreeable tutoress approaching   l charlo mercy deliver us

day and i danced with such an air that mr deputy stiffrump always chose me for his partner  i might have been a lady too if my husband had my spirit  but its no matter there are so many paltry creatures with titles now adays i give myself very little concern about it   l charlo you are certainly right madam it is better to deserve a title than to wear one without merit   mrs b most

would your ladyship believe it a cousin of my own over the way  but i shant say all i know neither   l charlo you are perfectly right madam your humanity does not at all check my curiosity   mrs b nay

obedient humble servant  curtsies after lady charlotte to the door what a proud conceited piece of stuff it is  dont you think so emmeline   emme no really madam   mrs b that is so stange now  because madam has got some quality blood in her veins and wears some trinkumbob jewels there is nobody so good as her i warrant but for ought i know she is no better than her neighbors  it is not for nothing that sir charles prudent has dangled after her and a swarm of fellows besides but as the proverb says a blots no blot till it is hit   emme nay madam such innuendos are too severe for the world allows lady charlotte wit beauty and virtue   mrs b the world  what world pray and how come you to know the world mind your needle child that becomes you better than to contradict your elders  her ladyship i suppose would make you as great a rantipole as herself and bring fellows about you there is her virtue but i will take care my brother shall look sharp  go  order a pen and ink to my chamber  exit

but sprightly widows never stand shilly shally  end of the second act act iii scene i fusee dressed as captain spontoon well if what i have heard the colonel say be true that the outside of a man is mostly considered i am in a fair way of being as much respected as my betters so monmouthstreet i thank thee for this gaudy title page i wish the volume of my brain like many modern pieces may not fall short of what is promised  if that should be the case i shall be still the more like a fine gentleman and at worst may make a brazen front stand for the unfurnished inside that is some comfort however and has been the road to preferment of many an enterprising blade  soft let me recollect my instructions for what is a military man without his plan of operations  fusee says my master i know women and he that courts a widow must throw aside modesty  i know that too sir says i for i have courted ah and married several of your honors oceasional widows  well no matter for that fusee this

bargain i shall have there will be no need of any deaths head but her face i shall never see it in a morning but it will put me in mind of the other world and to say the truth i have not much inclination to think that way yet but damn it the hopes of plunder have made many a man run his head against cannon balls then why should i be afraid of a witch so most engaging glibtongued ancient lady  have at you  exit fusee scene ii colonel parapet meeting sir charles col well met sir charles  why this unusual anxiety in your countenance it is not philosophical i assure you   sir char nay frank all our resolution natural and speculative must give way upon particular occasions  i am miserable   col marry heaven forbid  why man your acres are not swallowed up by an earthquake   sir char pshaw that were a trifle  i could bear any thing calmly but the disappointment of my heart  i fear lady charlotte has a tincture of that inconstancy which is charged against her sex in general   col how so whence your suspicion has she started a rival to amuse you   sir char not that i know of though i may fear it  i was to have paid her a visit as this hour but calling at her house a servant told me she had set off for her brothers the earl of greenhills two hours ago and that without leaving any apology or the slightest hint of return   col and this is the mighty source of care oh love love what a capricious deity are thou who can so turn our wits the seamy side without as shakespeare has it  prithee my friend dont take trifles to heart this flight of lady charlottes is only the whim of a fine lady who has the prerogative of custom to give herself as many affected and inconsistent airs as she pleases   sir char nay dear colonel dont be too severe i cannot think her good sense descends to so trifling a character as you mean by a fine lady she has spirits without wildness goodnature without weakness dignity without affectation and humility without meanness therefore this unaccountable behavior surprises me the more   col unaccountable behavior not at all  your gravity is an excellent subject for wit and vivacity to play upon  come come sir charles rest assured that he who so palpably devotes himself to a single object will be liable to such rubs i love one yet gallant half a dozen at a time had you taken the same course ten to one but her volatle ladyship had long ere now flown into your arms upon the wings of jealousy   sir char well frank i acknowledge your superiority in the affairs of love what then would you advise upon the present case   col faith sir charles there seems to be but a limited choice of proceedings you have an excellent set of nags and if you wish for an immediate ecclaircissement even pursue and tell her you will not be treated with such indifference for the future or rather take no notice of the matter till her ladyship chooses to come back which if i am any judge of woman she very shortly will   sir char your latter opinion shall guide me  her servant mentioned the arrival of lord frederic bloom her younger brother could i obtain an intimacy with him it might be useful   col most certainly as you would thereby know the motions of the enemy   enter a servant serve lord frederic blooms compliments and this letter sir   col very well wait a moment  lord frederics compliments this is somewhat odd as i never knew any of the family but lady charlotte  eh what have we here  charlotte bloom  suppose this should be a loveletter  upon my honor sir charles i never made any advances   sir char dear colonel you have alarmed my curiosity and if the purport is not very particular your communication will oblige me   col purport  gad you shall have it all  you shall read it kiss it and take it as a relic for adoration if you will  there   sir char  reads sir meeting my brother lord frederic on the road and knowing after three years travel commenced upon his leaving the university that he must be rather deficient of acquaintance i have taken the liberty of introducing him to you as a gentleman highly deserving his observation and regard your most etc charlotte bloom  this may be a lucky hit for me colonel   col right sir charles my interest may be of some use as the lady honors me with so kind an opinion  here friend  is his lordship at lady charlottes   serve he is sir and desires to know what time will be most convenient for his lordship to wait on you   col oh my compliments and i will save the trouble by waiting upon him immediately  exit servant well my friend i am a notable spy i assure you and if any thing falls in my way you may depend upon diligence   sir char i can never doubt or repay your friendship but as i know your disposition i shall refer you to the delicate pleasure which results to a generous mind from goodnatured actions  i will not detain you from this visit  when it is over shall i see you at my house   col you shall so adieu  but harkee charles in the mean time i desire for philosophys sake that you will sigh as little as you possibly can   exeunt severally enter lady charlotte dressed as lord frederic and emmeline emme well lady charlotte there is somewhat so unexpected and so romantic in this metamorphose of yours that positively i cannot help laughing even at the expense of good manners  ha ha ha ha  you will excuse me   l charlo excuse ha ha ha i will laugh with you my dear i am never better pleased than when laughing at myself and certainly i was never a better subject for it than at present  but come give me your opinion dont i make a tolerable smart figure in this masculine outside  a little upon the coxcomb or so  eh   emme not at all you have a much better right to the title of a fine gentleman than many who claim it  but after all to what extraordinary purpose have you done this is it merely to torment poor sir charles  bless us what confusion the poor man seemed in on hearing you had left town so abruptly   l charlo why ay i grant you sir charles has all the appearance of an arcadian swain and i believe him sincere but this is only surmise and when all the happiness of life depends upon a single choice that one should certainly be well grounded my disguise is an endeavor at this and for my friend emmelines sake as well as my own   emme for my sake in what shape pray   l charlo in short child i want to see you a happy wife as well as myself and to be plain i have always imagined your colonel to be as suspicious a piece of gallantry as any within the sphere of my observation now in this form i shall be able to sound the very bottom of his heart which is more than you could ever be able to do until it was perhaps too late   emme i have always thought myself under infinite obligations to dear lady charlottes goodnature but this extraordinary instance of friendship makes gratitude blush for its poverty   l charlo not at all emmeline you would put on a pair of breeches to oblige me and then the account is balanced  enter a servant colonel parapet to wait on your lordship   l charlo very well  conduct him up  exit servant so his complaisance anticipates my intention of visiting him and i am glad of it for if you will step into my dressing room there you may hear how i play my part  exit emmeline i hope this colonel may stand proof for poor emmelines sake however at any rate before knowledge is better than late repentance   enter colonel col my lord your most obedient humble servant   l charlo colonel your servant i am extremely concerned to give you this trouble   col it is a pleasure my lord to wait upon so near a relation to lady charlotte and i hope to merit the very favorable opinion her ladyship has indulged me with   l charlo when there is so much prepossession as i feel a small share of attention must certainly effect that besides i know my sister is not apt to flatter  but come colonel as i have been upon my travels these three years i must trespass upon you for some account of matters here at home   col faith my lord i imagine them to be just the same they always were and the uncharitable spirit of ridicule as prevalent among persons of different dispositions as ever scarce any thing spoken of but the follies and vices of our neighbors while the censors themselves are hourly committing greater enormities than those they stigmatize as to the polite and trading world the first are endeavoring to ruin each other at cards and horseracing and the latter are studying to overreach one another by deceitful bargains and papercurrency in short reputations and circumstances are a general prey for scandal and knavery to hunt through the world while poor honesty is thrown out of the chase   l charlo a very comfortable prospect truly but i presume colonel you are more attached to and better acquainted with the sphere of gallantry than any other   col why my lord it is part of a soldiers profession the indulgence of peace for his fatigues in war and it would be ungrateful to reject the blessing besides mars and venus should never be divorced for whatever may be said of glorys charms i believe there is more courage derived from the influence of corporeal beauty than from the love of fame nor can any better reason be offered why britons are the bravest of men than that nature has blessed them with the fairest of women   l charlo the ladies are obliged to you colonel and since we have touched upon them pray do you know emmeline fairlove sir scrapeall brainlesss ward   col yes my lord i have seen the lady very often   l charlo i am glad of it since i must presume you are a better judge of female merit than my sister but she has possessed me with so high an idea of the lady that i am in love with her before i see her   col the devil  aside in love with her my lord   l charlo yes truly and if she answers the description my sister gave of her i really dont know how far i may go in the road to matrimony   col confusion a rival and a lord too  i must throw some rubs in the way if possible  aside matrimony ha ha ha i presume your lordship will hardly drop so soon into a domestic life   l charlo why it is somewhat early as you observe colonel but beauty and merit joined are irresistible therefore i am quite impatient to hear your opinion and i dont doubt its being impartial as i flatter myself with your friendship   emme  listening now for it   col your question my lord is somewhat peculiar however to be ingenuous i think the lady might make a tolerable decent kind of a citizens wife but i am afraid that quality would sit very aukwardly upon her   emme a very hopeful beginning truly   l charlo you surprise me colonel   col besides she lives in such a queer odd sort of a family that your lordship would find any approaches very disagreeable unless there was a much greater share of beauty to reward your pains   emme beyond bearing deceitful villain   l charlo so then she is not handsome   col but very middling i assure your lordship   emme perfidious  blind wretch   l charlo how could my sister be so egregiously mistaken   col so the bait will take i hope  aside why my lord i imagine lady charlottes goodnature here got the better of her judgment i have heard her profess a strict friendship for emmeline besides your lordship knows that beauty is not a recommendation of one female to another   emme still complimenting   l charlo well colonel as the case is so i shall just pay her a ceremonious visit to deliver my sisters letter   col oons if he sees her all is over  aside letter my lord   l charlo yes one of introduction  if you will favor me with your company to her guardians colonel i shall get away the sooner   col to her guardians  to be sure my lord  you honor me  but then as i told your lordship it is such a motley unaccountable family that you will undoubtedly meet a very unpolite reception   l charlo pray what are they who compose this extraordinary family   col why my lord there is the old knight made up of avarice jealousy and rudeness  his lady emmelines sister a scatterbrained piece of inconsistent affectation    emme so so my sister has her share too   col and ha ha ha ha an old widow sir scrapealls sister who fancys herself a blooming beauty and torments every thing in breeches that goes near the house though she is more like an antiquated tapestry figure than any animal of the present age   l charlo ha ha ha ha a most hopeful society indeed   col so that i believe if your lordship would send lady charlottes letter it would do better than a visit   l charlo oh by no means for i promised to deliver it besides i love curiosities  i presume the citizen will not set his great dog at me as to any thing else i can enjoy it for once  here  get the chariot ready   col so i have been lying so long to no purpose  this affair must end in a scrape i see  aside   l charlo well colonel shall i have the honor of your company to sir scrapealls   col i must beg your lordships excuse i am to call upon sir charles prudent about this hour   l charlo sir charles prudent  if i dont mistake i have heard of that gentlemans paying his addresses to my sister if he is seriously in love with her i pity him for she is now gone into the country upon a treaty of marriage   col a treaty of marriage   l charlo yes and i believe it is entirely settled   col so here is comfort for my friend too  aside my lord i will take my leave   l charlo well colonel i shall depend upon seeing you often   col certainly my lord  but it must not be as a rival  aside   l charlo give me leave to wait on you colonel   col it is needless ceremony my lord   l charlo nay i insist upon it exit  emmeline sola false man how unguarded how credulous are we women to take in the poison of flattery  this discovery of his baseness unexpected and mortifying as it is i must esteem fortunate  enter lady charlotte well emily what think you of the colonel now   emme think why that he is like all men treacherous and base   l charlo come child i see this trial has put your heart into a horrid palpitation but be comforted i entertain a better opinion of your favorite than i did   emme how lady charlotte after he could treat me so disrespectfully so rudely and in every article contradict what he has a thousand times vowed and swore to me   l charlo come you must not judge unfavourably if i can read countenances right the thoughts of a rival alarmed him more than a battery of cannon would   emme but what could be the cause of his treating me so lightly   l charlo a stroke of policy to secure you to himself it is very common in those affairs as well as those of love to affect an indifference for or even to dispraise those things we like best  but come i must be an assiduous lover of yours so make haste home that i may visit you in form  keep good spirits and fear nothing   emme my lord your most obedient   l char madam your devoted slave  nay i must gallant you to your chair

infallibly be blown up  aside   ruelle bless me captain does your welltried assurance fail you  pray what scheme what military trick is your honor upon in this disguise   fusee since it is in vain to dissemble i will even tell you  my master wanting to get the old lady of this house off his hands has put me into masquerade  i have had but one conference and yet by the help of mother sly want nothing but a parson to finish the affair   ruelle mighty well and what then becomes of all your fine spun protestations to me mr saucebox   fusee why you know mrs ruelle pyramus and thisbe never loved so well but you was allways throwing dependence and poverty in my teeth so i thought it high time to mend myself   ruelle a very fine comeoff indeed but i will spoil your masters project and yours mr impudence i will and discover all this moment   fusee nay dear ruelle dont be so cruel as that neither   ruelle dear ruelle  not so much familiarity puppy you and your master are a couple of deceitful forsworn rakehells and ought to be exposed   fusee what will nothing pacify you nothing bridle that harmonious tongue   ruelle no wretch  not all the eloquence you have   fusee why then let my master speak  he desired me to present his compliments and this gives a purse the first i had no scruple to give but the latter i thought to have saved   ruelle very honest indeed noble captain and like the rest of your tricks  let me see  hum  hum  ten guineas why ah these are compliments worth receiving and shows the colonel knows how to speak most feelingly  yet after all must i not only lose so sweet a swain but as i have read in some play be made myself the instrument must i not only die but plunge the dagger in my heart myself this is indeed refining on calamity   fusee tender loving soul  i never thought her so fond as this  poor pretty soft rogue let me kiss off thy tears   ruelle tears  ha ha ha ha not so foolish as that neither good mr captain and since your sincerity is brought to light i will show you that i was prepared against it   fusee what does the jade mean   ruelle mean why i mean there is a sea captain worth ten thousand pounds my masters brotherinlaw whose heart i have so engaged by helping him to some bowls of punch more than sir scrapeall allowed that he has given me several kind glances squeezed my hands almost to a jelly and sworn if i have a mind he will get a parson to splice us together tomorrow morning   fusee oh snap him by all means and when we have made the double match you and i can be on better terms than ever mrs ruelle   ruelle stand off jackanapes and learn a proper distance to your betters  you and your old madam must not put yourself on a footing with a real captains lady for my messmate as he calls himself though he is but a scurvy original has the recommendation of a fine gilded frame to set him off  i shall so gall madam fusee by taking place of her  for i am resolved when once mrs starboard to hold my own to pay as many visits to wear as fine clothes and have as grand a route as any city lady of them all   fusee hoity toity what whirligigs fortune has planted in the wenchs head already   ruelle captain to your arms the generals at hand exit   fusee sblood this mistress of mine has the same effect upon me that a labelled bottle has upon the stomach of a sick man  but i must take the dose to cure the consumptive state of my pockets  enter mrs busy captain your very most humble servant   fusee madam your eternal slave   mrs b lard captain i am most infinitely concerned at the rudeness of having made you wait so long and scarce know how to apologize but my poor neighbor mrs doleful who has a sad fellow of a husband came to consult me and would not let me stir   fusee madam though your absence to me is worse than riding the wooden horse standing upon the picket being tied up to the halberts or even running the gantelope upon so goodnatured an occasion of delay as comforting a distressed neighbor i must be not only satisfied but pleased also at the beauty of your mind as much as i am captivated with the beauty of your person madam   mrs b bless me sir the force and delicacy of your compliment makes me blush i profess it does  yet who would ever trust a man after what my good friend mrs sly related of the colonel   fusee oh name him not madam the young fellow is indeed plausible enough but nothing of a soldier except the title  good friends no merit and as to gallantry i know he makes it his business to boast of favors from the ladies   mrs b nay sir i defy him there he could never boast of favors from me but in an honorable way  i dont flaunt about with profligate young fellows  no  i act with discretion  i have an unsullied character to support  ay ay  if some forward flirting minxs of the age would take half so much care of reputations as they do of complexions there would not be such wicked and sensual doings   fusee very true madam  ravishing sentiments  killing eyes  let me swear by the horrors of war that though i have had my hat taken off by a four and twenty pounder though my beard has been close singed by the flash of a cannon though my teeth have been picked with bayonets though a whole platoon of musket balls has passed through my body and though i have been three times blown up on the forlorn hope yet never did my heart feel such palpitation as those charms have caused   mrs b oh dear that is a most powerful impression  well military gentlemen undergo great hardship  and i presume you are forced to kill people in your own defense sir   fusee certainly madam  why now in the battle of  of  pshaw pox i have been in so many i dont know which it was  but this single arm demolished two french marquis four counts and above a dozen rank and file but such bloody deeds are at an end the promise of your fair hand madam has made me determine to throw up my commission   mrs b obliging and tender to the last degree   fusee but i shall not quit the service of my country entirely i have a borough waiting for me and i believe i shall accept of it  but madam say when shall the special license i have obtained take effect   mrs b you are so zealous sir but since you are determined even when you please   fusee tomorrow morning then my fair the chaplain of our regiment shall attend and i will fly upon the wings of love to give you notice   mrs b dear sir you are so irresistably persuading  i shall certainly attend your call   fusee transporting sound   mrs b bless me i hear somebody coming and i would keep all snug till things are done

are welcome   col your ladyships most obedient  pray madam was not that lord frederic who parted from you just now   l brain the same sir   col so then here is anticipation against me  aside   l brain i profess colonel your coming has given me great pleasure i began to almost despair of you and my route would have been as insipid in your absence as a humdrum society of countryfolks set to cards in a winters evening   col your ladyship does me particular honor   l brain well after all this matrimony is a very sad thing  siberia i think you called it did not you colonel  notwithstanding which my sister i believe will shortly travel to that desert clime  well i hope she may find it a pleasanter spot than i have done   col your sister madam   l brain yes truly  lord frederic though his first visit i find has hinted something that way and my sister seems to have no objection   col sdeath it is as i feared  aside  this is a very sudden affair indeed madam but perhaps the match may not be so agreeable to sir scrapeall and she cannot marry without his consent   l brain that is true as you say colonel but i believe his generous worship considers her as a saleable piece of goods and would be glad to make a profitable affair of his consent   col that hint may be of use to me  aside i should hardly have supposed your ladyships sister capable of so precipitate a compliance   l brain why its a little out of the common course but the impressions of love are lightningwinged and very variable in their flight  witness those tender expressions and the profusion of regard you have lavished upon me colonel  though any woman might be vain of the conquest yet i never sought it however i am really concerned you should be so much in love with me but what can i possibly do   col a hopeful theme for my perplexity  aside i am much debtor to your ladyships humanity and must be content to sigh away my passion in absence   l brain absence nay that looks like absolute despair  and despair is a very sad thing  i should grieve to be the cause of it  come who knows colonel my agreeable lord and master cannot live always and when he is gone    col i wish i was gone with all my heart  aside your ladyship is so much in the right that hope though ever so distant beams cheering rays but if lord frederic should prevail and blast    l brain lord frederic why you know colonel he addresses my sister   col true madam  he does so  i  i mistook  you will excuse my confusion   l brain poor man i protest i pity him i never saw him so much affected before but i cannot help the bewitching power of my eyes  aside  nay colonel be comforted within the bounds of honor you may command me   col i cannot in the least doubt your ladyships goodness but ardent love is impatient of delay and fearful of defeat therefore if your sister should resolve to check my wishes and favor a rival   l brain my sister  you dont imagine she shall direct my choice   col no madam  i did not mean that  but then in case  i say that if your ladyship  a  oons i dont know what to say   l brain i see my staying does but perplex him the more  humanity instructs me to withdraw that he may have time to recover  well colonel perhaps the company will compose your spirits and banish the train of impertinent thoughts which so busily intrude upon your quiet  i will leave you with lord frederic till we sit down to cards and i must positively insist upon your being of my party exit   col pox oparty cards and company every moment till i see emmeline is torture   enter lady charlotte l charlo well colonel i must say you are a gentleman of very difficult taste for as i remember you told me that emmeline was very middling in point of beauty now i think her exquisitey charming   col it may be so my lord   l charlo may be so  nay it is so colonel  i profess myself the ladys champion my sword is devoted to her service as well as my heart and i shall esteem any insinuation against her charms as high treason against the queen of beauty   col your lordship is very rapturous upon the occasion and i dont doubt but your sword is as ready as you speak it however since matters are come so far i must take the liberty to inform you that the lady does not stand in need of your knight errantry for i have professed my service which having been accepted i cannot now decline   l charlo hey day why certainly we are got to cross purposes what a person of colonel parapets taste interfere with such an odd family as this and devote himself to a young lady who can only make a tolerable citizens wife on whom quality would sit very aukwardly ha ha ha ha now i shall take the pains to polish this rough diamond   col your lordship is facetious but to dash your lordships hopes know that a previous claim to the ladys favor has been made by me and countenanced by her which i presume my lord will put an end to your pretensions   l charlo put an end to my pretensions as soon to my life colonel   col if that be your resolution my lord i know but of one decision  you have in appearance an excellent sword and i cannot doubt either your lordships skill or courage in the use of it   l charlo a very rational method of argument truly right military logic and in regard of us young fellows may be salutary our constitutions are too sanguine and breathing a vain must be useful so i shall not baulk your resolution  come sir  draws   col spoke with the generous pleasantry of true courage and strict honor it will be some pleasure if i should fall to fall by so brave a hand draws   l charlo let me warn you colonel to keep at a distance for there is not a man in england could stand long before me at close quarters   col you are particularly generous my lord but i am prepared for all events   l charlo very well sir  come on then  yet hold  two points we have forgot it will not be so decent to throw the family into confusion with our private animosity and if in this combat the ladys favorite which ever it is should fall the conqueror will have no cause for trumph so that being somewhat between hawk and buzzard i think the lady should be consulted and if she declines an explanation we can but appeal to our swords at last   col true my lord and on that footing let me have the honor to call myself your lordships friend   l charlo i cordially embrace your proposal and here the lady comes most opportunely if you will open the case you shall have all the justice imaginable   enter emmeline emme colonel your humble servant   col madam your most obedient  i am sorry there should be any occasion to desire an explanation of what for particular reasons i have endeavored to conceal but his lordship informing me of acl he either has or intends to put in for your favor i am under the necessity madam of requesting that you will do justice to the previous right i assert   emme right colonel  i protest you astonish me i am an entire stranger to the meaning of this formal address   col a stranger madam   emme quite so i assure you sir  you talk of right and favor and justice but upon what cause and between what parties i really cannot conceive   col how madam   emme and if i did not having been used to the law it is very probable i might not be able to decide however the curiosity incident to my sex induces me to request an explanation   col i am thunderstruck  is it possible madam you can need an explanation   l charlo come come colonel this affected surprise and these distant insinuations are unfair i will deal more heartily and set the lady right at onee  you must know madam that happening to mention the impression your charms have made upon my heart this gentleman my friend declared that he had already preferred his addresses    emme what his addresses to me   l char yes madam and that you had received them most favorably   emme favorably  is it possible you could advance this colonel   col why madam did you not   l charlo so upon this supposition the colonel very kindly proposed his cutting my throat or my cutting his and if you had not appeared madam like the dove with the olive branch i know not what might have been the consequence for our resolutions seemed very terrible on both sides   col your lordship is very fanciful and merry but i am not in a mood of temper to bear sneers at present   l charlo nay now colonel you are quite too severe that you will neither allow me to love pattle nor laugh ha ha ha ha   col fire and fury   emme so so so now the mystery begins to clear up and i perceive that what appeared rudeness is merely the unhappy effects of frenzy   col sdeath madam frenzy   emm most certainly could any thing else have introduced such romantic chimaers my lord   col madam this affected ignorance of what you too well know may prove insincerity but cannot add to the reputation of candor and judgment  choice is undoubtedly free but that choice once fixed does not admit of alteration without some material reason   emme ay there sir i entirely come in with your opinion had any such choice been made but i see you are quite too violent for argument therefore i think it will be most prudent to retire   col hold madam   l charlo nay no violence   col sdeath sir dare you interpose  draws   emme ah  screams   l charlo sheath your sword colonel i shall not fight a lunatic positively   enter lady brainless and mrs busy

lordship   l brain what you in love with him   emme yes truly and talks of having paid his addresses in form asserts they were favorably received and charges me with insincerity   l brain what were his professions to make a cats paw of me  my pride is hurt  aside   mrs b ah have a care child  he is a most dangerous fellow he would have imposed upon me if he could   col yes i shall have it now

colonel ha ha ha ha a pretty situation you had got into among the females however my discovery of the pretended lord frederic has occasioned a considerable revolution in your countenance colonel  col ay and in my heart too sir charles but i am impatient to know the method of your discovery   sir cha know then i went in search of lord frederic and being told he was gone to lady brainlesss route i followed where i was so thoroughly mortified with an account of lady charlottes marriage that to collect my spirits i retired and took a moonlight turn in the garden   col a proper place and fit season for melancholy reflection   sir cha i had not been long there when her masquerading ladyship and emmeline came down a neighboring walk enjoying aloud the perplexity they had given us encouraged by the subject i drew near and received conviction that your rival is no other than my mistress who concluded with remarking that she thought they had played upon us sufficiently   col yes truly i think they have so long that i began to be most horridly out of tune  but prithee what could be at the bottom of this quixote scheme   sir cha to gain some assurance of our sincerity which after laughing at us a little they seemed satisfied with   col dear sir charles let me embrace you so prudent and spirited a design makes the little gypsies ten times dearer than ever  did you let them know the discovery   sir cha not for the world  i hastened from the garden joined the company some minutes before them shook off all concern was unusually gay and gallanted lady betty ombre so warmly that poor lord charles was in his turn utterly discontented   col ha ha ha ha bravissimo that was turning the tables upon them with strict justice and i think it would not be amiss to have a little more of it   sir char by all means i sought you for that purpose i am to call at sir scrapealls this morning and would have you drop in occasionally for as the politicians played a double game into each others hands it is but fit we should return like for like   col with all my heart it will be notable revenge mischief on it had your discovery been made a little sooner it might have saved me five thousand pounds for ought i know   sir char what mean you   col why in the heat of my passion i went to the knight made known my passion for emmeline and offered half her fortune for his consent   sir char ha  a substantial compliment to the lady colonel but we must try to settle matters otherwise  but come the hour calls me to the citizens  i will lead the van do you bring up the rear   col fear not i am ever punctual to my orders   exeunt enter lady charlotte and emmeline emme dear lady charlotte i am concerned to see your natural vivacity so much disconcerted by a slight supposition   l charlo slight supposition alas emmeline in your case you dont see with the eyes of love else you would put another construction upon sir charless behavior   emme i admit there was something extraordinary but the feelings he confessed when you told him of the intended marriage were strong and sincere the gaiety he afterward assumed was if i judge right a slight veil occasionally thrown over a gloomy heart   l brain i cannot think so  forced spirits are easily seen through and such could never have carried him so far as to gallant that forward shallow piece of coquetry lady betty   emme there i must acknowledge he was somewhat mysterious   l charlo would i had not taken this disguise though it has been so far useful as to prove the sincerity of your lover it has only purchased pain for me  i cannot blame sir charles  the fault is mine  i have acted like a foolish boy who plays with and teizes a favorite bird till breaking bondage it takes wing never to be recalled dear friend what step shall i take   emme i would hope the best still you know by appointment he will soon be here sound him a little further and i dare believe he will yet fulfill my good opinion of him   l charlo i would indulge that hope but strong doubts press forward to exclude it   emme i see him coming and shall leave you to a private conference exit   enter sir charles l charlo sir charles good morning  i have according to promise prepared a letter for my sister charlotte wherein i have enlarged upon your previous pretensions as much as possible   sir char i am infinitely obliged to your lordship but upon second thought i have determined not to offend lady charlotte by a visit   l charlo your resolution so warmly urged is very soon changed sir   sir char why my lord upon cool deliberation i think it better not to proceed any further in the affair it is possible i might have interpreted the ladys good nature too partially in my own favor and as freedom of choice is undoubtedly just it would be rude and cruel to interrupt her present scheme of happiness   l charlo you are of a very happy disposition sir charles that can so soon and so coolly reconcile an affair which seemed so interesting    sir cha yes my lord i am tolerably philosophical in these matters besides to own the truth i had amongst other conversation talked so much of love to lady charlotte that i fancied our hearts engaged when there was nothing meant i believe but a little fashionable gallantry   l charlo then all my fears are true  aside but suppose sir my sisters affection should have been seriously engaged   sir char nay my lord she is too much a fine lady to be in any danger that way   enter colonel colonel parrapet your most humble servant   col sir charles yours my lord i kiss your hand   l char sir i dont think your behavior and our last parting admit of such familiarity   col nay my lord i came on purpose to solicit pardon too free a glass had flustered my temper without the least intention of offense acknowledgement of error is i know sufficient to a man of honor but i must confess myself a little puzzled for an apology to this lady   enter emmeline emme sir charles your servant  oh the colonel  may we hope that night and reflection sir have given your thoughts a calm   col most certainly madam and i hope your good nature will grant indulgence to unlimited confession especially as i am come to make all atonement possible by offering any assistance which may promote his lordships happiness and yours   l charlo so this swain is changed about too    aside emme your condescension is very forward sir but i presume his lordship can take care of his own happiness without your assistance   col doubtless madam  but if i could any way contribute    emme oh sir you are exceeding liberal and courtly in your professions and promises i can witness that   col how so madam for by your own declaration i never had the honor of promising or professing to you    emme it is no matter sir but i believe if you had you are very capable of forswearing it   col oh dear madam i am sorry you have so terrible an opinion of me but i perceive this subject grows too interesting  adso i had almost forgot to tell you sir charles that i met lady betty ombre just now and to use her own phrase she dies till she sees you   l charlo i shall go distracted  aside   sir char colonel i am obliged to you for delivering so kind a message and from so accomplished a lady when your match with her sister lady frances is completed of friends we shall become brothers   emme confident faithess wretches  aside   col that will be double pleasure pray madam are you intimate with the family of the ombres   emme i dont know i cannot tell  insolent tormenting man  aside   col your lordship will be happy in an acquaintance there  sir charles will introduce you and if your lordships choice was not already fixed upon this lady there is a third sister who has a most bewitching pair of eyes   l charlo i can hold no longer   sir char a very dangerous pair of sparklers indeed my lord   l charlo sir you are a villain   emme and sir you are the worst of villains   sir char amazing   col wonderful   emme oh that i were a man for justice sake   l charlo and i too   sir char and i too  what self betrayed ha ha ha ha this is more than i expected and hastens the comedy to a conclusion  what think you ladies have we balanced the account of perplexity or not   l charlo ladies   emme what do you mean sir   sir char nay never look strange your scheme was well laid and had not chance directed me to a moonlight walk in the garden last night we might have continued food for mirth at the expense of our peace   emme i am glad its no worse  aside   l charlo i am so confused and so pleased i know not what to say  aside   sir char the palpitation of our hearts will i hope ladies make this trespass on your patience appear excusable   l charlo well gentlemen since it is in vain to deny i admit your discovery and cannot but acknowledge your treatment has been founded on strict justice   col spoke with your usual candor and generosity lady charlotte and hence let mutual confidence ensue as to you madam i have sir scrapealls promise to make you mine   l charlo so so here is counterworking  was it fair to undermine me but pray how did you prevail upon the knight   col by the rhetoric of five thousand pounds that is offering to surrender half the ladys fortune   emme generous indeed   col and had it been twenty times as much i should have only thought it a fit sacrifice to so much merit   l charlo an excellent proof of disinterested love colonel  but you are outbid for i proposed to take the lady without any fortune at all and am to have the honest citizens written consent within   col contemptible reptile   sir cha ha ha ha ha upon my honor colonel you have been fairly outsoldiered beat at your own weapons   emme and poor i set up at auction to the best bidder   l charlo ha ha ha even so emmeline but all for the better i hope  oh i see lady brainless i have some business with her in my lordly capacity and shall beg of you to retire   sir cha you command us madam   exeunt emme sir cha and col l charlo now must i play a part severely kind in hopes of good effects your ladyships most obedient  enter lady brainless my lord your humble servant   l charlo your ladyship had a bad run at cards last night   l brain oh terrible my lord it seemed as if fortune had determined to cross me   l charlo were not such things common madam in matters of chance they would press hard upon patience  i think your ladyship lost fifteen hundred pounds one thousand to me and five hundred to lord robert whist   l brain thereabouts i believe my lord   l charlo i am sorry to urge your ladyship but being myself a good deal out of cash at present and having a bill of eight hundred to pay this forenoon should be obliged to you for the trifle depending between us   l brain really my lord your demand takes me rather at a disadvantage   l charl you know madam it is not like the impertinent bill of a troublesome mechanic for work done or goods delivered it is a debt of honor and such you know takes place of all other payments among people of fashion   l brain that is very true my lord and i would always act up to the fashion but inclination must give way where ability is totally wanting and though sir scrapeall deals in cash i am almost as bare as if he was not worth a single shilling   l charl if this be the case i find i ventured real against imaginary sums and must therefore be more cautious of my company   l brain really my lord there is much less politeness in that inuendo than i should have expected from a man of fashion   l charlo politeness madam is very well upon particular occasions but in gaming there is no such thing we win of whom and when we can like death it cuts off all distinction of rank relations and friends and stakes must be paid or persons exposed but as your ladyship is a fine woman matters should be made as easy as possible and if    l brain if what my lord   l charlo i presume there could not be much love in your match with sir scrapeall  i have conceived a passion give it suitable return and let the thousand pounds    l brain insolent man no more what part of my conduct though perhaps ungarded could encourage so gross an insult  gratify your malice expose the sum due and set me up the sport of laughing libertines i will bear all patiently as the fruit and punishment of my own indiscretion secure in this pleasing reflection that though you publish my poverty you cannot taint my virtue   l charlo come come madam colonel parapet would have received a gentler answer   l brain no my lord there you are mistaken also for though that gentleman may have been allowed a particular intimacy and may have improved or misconstrued appearances he must be a consumate villain if ever he dropped a prejudicial insinuation for let me say to you to him and all the world that however i have dipped into follies the vices of life could never make me a proselyte   l charlo it is as i always thought dear lady brainless these just and noble sentiments force off false appearances and reveal me instead of a gaming lord your disinterested and inviolable friend charlotte bloom   l brain lady charlotte why then this disguise or why would friendship alarm such painful sensations   l charlo as to the motive of this appearance you shall know in due time  why i have wounded your delicate feeling was to awaken a sense of what you justly call follies which have long obscured many valuable qualifications and subjected you to the reproach of several who have lss real merit but more external caution   l brain dear lady charlotte i shall be ever debtor to your kind opinion and friendly design reflection tells me i have given too just cause for censure yet not without some plea of justification   l charlo i am certain of it your most disproportionate marriage if not an entire excuse is at least a powerful palliation   l brain marriage there you have said all at once those who should have studied and judged better for my future happiness warmly urged the match young and unexperienced i was allured by the hopes of a title and unlimited command ever since i have been almost hourly rendered unhappy by the selfish and perverse temper of sir scrapeall which has occasioned me to despise and cross him in every particular and most of my extravagncies have been more calculated for killing time than any pleasure  pity me dear charlotte for i find my scheme of life widely different from what i wish and yet in self defense i am obliged to follow it when avarice jealousy and discord prevail at home peace must be sought abroad   l charlo i have no reason to doubt your friendship  but tell me did the colonel use any freedom with my character   l charlo no upon my honor what i hinted was from observation last night and repeated to alarm you though i sincerely believe you meant nothing   l brain your interpretation my friend is kind and just i own my horrid situation made me fond of his engaging conversation and female vanity was flattered in some compliments he passed upon me nothing more i assure you and yet now i look back such gallant trifling is like sporting on the unstedfast margin of a lucid stream where while we admire the beautiful reflection in its liquid bosom one false step hurries us to certain destruction   l charlo your similitude my friend is fancifully just but we are too grave sir charles the colonel and emmeline are but in the next room shall we join them and prattle away gloomy ideas   l brain excuse me for the present dear lady charlotte the reflections you have awakened render my spirits unfit for conversation therefore give me leave to retire  think for me gentle friend and if any means can be found to free from or alleviate my bondage i promise that future conduct shall prove my errors the effect of disagreeable circumstances of a tormented but not a dishonest heart exit   l charlo how good a heart may inadvertently be led into unfavourable appearance   enter sir charles colonel and emmeline emme knowing your design lady charlotte i ventured to make these gentlemen ear witnesses of the work of reformation and they admire it vastly   l charlo i am glad of it and hope you will all join to set her ladyship free   col sdeath if there be no other method i will chuck old cent per cent out of the window and her t liberty that way   l charlo come come i hope to effect it by some less furious means  i will slep to him for a few minutes exit   sir char heyday what have we here   col as i live

designs   col designs madam what could you see but the most faithful the most ardent passion but i suppose you tax me with inconstancy to justify your own falsehood and will give yourself away to blast all my hopes   mrs b ah that wheedling tongue and that deceitful fae if my virtue had not been impregnable if i had not been as cold as ice to unlawful love i dont know what might have been the consequence but as i am not to be imposed upon i know the world and the difference of people  captain spontoon my husband has heard your baseness   col how husband  ah cruel fair  are you then married
