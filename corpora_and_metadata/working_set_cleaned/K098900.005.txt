the lucubrations of isaac bickerstaff esquire  by w h  n esquire dr s  t a h  y esquire deceased and several other hands  vol v  london printed for john morphew near stationers hall mdccxii  to the reader the following papers were published and several of em written by a gentleman now abroad many of em came from the same hands which contributed to the other volumes several of which i fancy will easily distinguish themselves to have been the productions of a gentleman lately dead one who to the advantages of a large estate and good education had acquired learning and an exact knowledge of the best sort of men both at home and abroad and withal was master of so much wit and humor that there are few people whose conversations could be more desirable his friends and the public equally regret his loss since he was serviceable and agreeable to em both in a very eminent degree the rest of these papers are to live upon what commendations they can give themselves and perhaps may be thought not altogether unworthy of the honor of serving as a supplement to the former volumes  the no   tatler by isaac bickerstaff esquire vol v quis ergo sum saltem si non sum sofia te interrogo plaut amphitruo saturday january       0 it is impossible perhaps for the best and wisest amongst us to keep so constant a guard upon our temper but that we may at one time or other lie open to the strokes of fortune and such incidents as we cannot foresee with sentiments of this kind i came home to my lodgings last night much fatigued with a long and sudden journey from the country and full of the ungrateful occasion of it twas natural for me to have immediate recourse to my pen and ink but before i would offer to make use of them i resolved deliberately to tell over a hundred and when i came to the end of that sum i found it more advisable to defer drawing up my intended remonstrance till i had slept soundly on my resentments without any other preface than this i shall give the world a fair account of the treatment i have lately met with and leave them to judge whether the uneasiness i have suffered be inconsistent with the character i have generally pretended to about three weeks since i received an invitation from a kinsman in staffordshire to spend my christmas in those parts upon taking leave of mr morphew i put as many papers into his hands as would serve till my return and charged him at parting to be very punctual with the town in what manner he and mr lilly have been tampered with since i cannot say they have given me my revenge if i desired any by allowing their names to an idle paper that in all humane probability cannot live a fortnight to an end my self and the family i was with were in the midst of gaiety and a plentiful entertainment when i received a letter from my sister jenny who after mentioning some little affairs i had entrusted to her goes on thus the enclosed i believe will give you some surprise as it has already astonished every body here who mr steel is that subscribes it i dont know any more than i can comprehend what could induce him to it morphew and lilly i am told are both in the secret i shall not presume to instruct you but hope you will use some means to disappoint the ill nature of those who are taking pains to deprive the world of one of its most reasonable entertainments i am etc  i am to thank my sister for her compliment but be that as it will i shall not easily be discouraged from my former undertaking in pursuance of it i was obliged upon this notice to take places in the coach for my self and my maid with the utmost expedition lest i should in a short time be rallied out of my existence as some people will needs fancy mr partridge has been and the real isaac bickerstaff have passed for a creature of mr steeles imagination this illusion might have hoped for some tolerable success if i had not more than once produced my person in a crowded theater and such a person as mr steel if i am not misinformed in the gentleman would hardly think it an advantage to own though i should throw him in all the little honor i have gained by my lucubrations i may be allowed perhaps to understand pleasantry as well as other men and can in the usual phrase take a jest without being angry but i appeal to the world whether the gentleman has not carried it too far and whether he ought not to make a public recantation if the credulity of some unthinking people should force me to insist upon it the following letter is just come to hand and i think it not improper to be inserted in this paper  to isaac bickerstaff esquire sir i am extremely glad to hear you are come to town for in your absence we were all mightily surprised with an unaccountable paper signed richard steel who is esteemed by those that know him to be a man of wit and honor and therefore we took it either to be a counterseit or a perfect christmas frolic of that ingenious gentleman but then your paper ceasing immediately after we were at a loss what to think if you were weary of the work you had so long carried on and had given this mr steel orders to signify so to the public he should have said it in plain terms but as that paper is worded one would be apt to judge that he had a mind to persuade the town that there was some analogy between isaac bickerstaff and himpossibly possibly there may be a secret in this which i cannot enter into but i flatter my self that you never had any thoughts of giving over your labors for the benefit of mankind when you cannot but know how many subjects are yet unexhausted and how many others as being less obvious are wholly untouched i dare promise not only for my self but many other abler friends that we shall still continue to furnish you with hints on all proper occasions which is all your genius requires i think by the way you cannot in honor have any more to do with morphew and lilly who have gone beyond the ordinary pitch of assurance and transgressed the very letter of the proverb by endeavoring to cheat you of your christian and surname too wishing you sir long to live for our instruction and diversion and to the defeating of all impostors i remain  your most obedient humble servant and affectionate kinsman humphry wagstaff   advertisement whereas the tatler has been omitted for some time by the neglect of those who had the care of it in the absence of isaac bickerstaff esquire and whereas a gentleman was pleased to publish a paper insinuating himself to have been author of the tatler and to have now laid it down and lastly whereas several spurious papers have since come out under the said title the said isaac bickerstaff declares he is a perfect stranger to the said gentleman and does hereby give notice that he had no intention to discontinue the said paper which shall be published every tuesday and saturday only as a mark of his displeasure he has thought fit to change his printer and publisher it is therefore desired that all letters be from henceforward directed to isaac bickerstaff esquire at mrs baldwins at the oxfordarms in warwick lane  the tatler no   alios viri reverentia vultusque ad continendum populum mire formatus alios etiam quibus ipse interesse non potuit vis scribendi tamen and magni nominis autoritas pervicers tull epist from saturd jan    to tuesd jan       0 i remember menage tells a story of monsieur racan who had appointed a day and hour to meet a certain lady of great wit whom he had never seen in order to make an acquaintance between them two of racans friends who had heard of the appointment resolved to play him a trick the first went to the lady two hours before the time said his name was racan and talked with her an hour they were both mightily pleased began a great friendship and parted with much satisfaction a few minutes after comes the second and sends up the same name the lady wonders at the meaning and tells him mr racan had just left her the gentleman says it was some rascally impostor and that he had been frequently used in that manner the lady is convinced and they laugh at the oddness of the adventures she now calls to mind several passages which confirms her that the former was a cheat he appoints a second meeting and takes his leave he was no sooner gone but the true racan comes to the door and desires under that name to see the lady she was out of all patience sends for him up rates him for an impostor and after a thousand injuries flings a slipper at his head it was impossible to pacify or disabuse her he was forced to retire and it was not without some time and the intervention of friends that they could come to an eclaircisement this as i take it is exactly the case with mr s  le the pretended tatler from morphew and my self only i presume the world will be sooner undeceived than the lady in mnage the very day my last paper came out my printer brought me another of the same date called the tatler by isaac bickerstaff esquire and which was still more pleasant with an advertisement at the end calling me the female tatler it is not enough to rob me of my name but now they must impose a sex on me when my years have long since determined me to be of none at all there is only one thing wanting in the operation that they would renew my age and then i will heartily forgive them all the rest in the mean time whatever uneasiness i have suffered from the little malice of these men and my retirement in the country the pleasures i have received from the same occasion will fairly balance the account on the one hand i have been highly delighted to see my name and character assumed by the scribblers of the age in order to recommend themselves to it and on the other to observe the good taste of the town in distinguishing and exploding them through every disguise and sacrificing their trifles to the supposed manes of isaac bickerstaff esquire but the greatest merit of my journey into staffordshire is that it has opened to me a new fund of unreprovd follies and errors that have hitherto lain out of my view and by their situation escaped my censure for as i have lived generally in town the images i had of the country were such only as my senses received very early and my memory has since preserved with all the advantages they first appeared in  hence it was that i thought our parish church the noblest structure in england and the squires placehouse as we called it a most magnificent palace i had the same opinion of the almshouse in the churchyard and of a bridge over the brook that parts our parish from the next twas the common vogue of our school that the master was the best scholar in europe and the usher the second not happening to correct these notions by comparing them with what i saw when i came into the world upon returning back i began to resume my former imaginations and expected all things should appear in the same view as i left them when i was a boy but to my utter disappointment i found them wonderfully shrunk and lessened almost out of my knowledge i looked with contempt on the tribes painted on the church walls which i once so much admired and on the carved chimneypiece in the squires hall i found my old master to be a poor ignorant pedant and in short the whole scene to be extremely changed for the worse this i could not help mentioning because though it be of no consequence in it self yet it is certain that most prejudices are contracted and retained by this narrow way of thinking which in matters of the greatest moment are hardly shook off and which we only think true because we were made to believe so before we were capable to distinguish between truth and falsehood but there was one prepossession which i confess to have parted with much to my regret i mean the opinion of that native honesty and simplicity of manners which i had always imagined to be inherent in country people i soon observed it was with them and us as they say of animals that every species at land has one to resemble it at sea for twas easy to discover the seeds and principles of every vice and folly that one meets with in the more known world though shooting up in different forms i took a fancy out of the several inhabitants round to furnish the camp the bar and the exchange and some certain chocolate and coffeehouses with exact parallels to what in many instances they already produce there was a drunken quarrelsome smith whom i have a hundred times fancied at the head of a troop of dragoons a weaver within two doors of my kinsman was perpetually setting neighbors together by the ears i lamented to see how his talents were misplaced and imagined what a figure he might make in westminster hall goodman crop of comptonfarm wants nothing but a plumb and a goldchain to qualify him for the government of the city my kinsmans stableboy was a gibbing companion that would always have his jest he would often put cowitch in the maids bed pull stools from under folks and lay a coal upon their shoes when they were asleep he was at last turned off for some notable piece of roguery and when i came away was loitering among the alehouses bless me thought i what a prodigious wit would this have been with us i could have matched all the sharpers between st jamess and covent garden with a notable fellow in the same neighborhood since hanged for picking pockets at fairs could he have had the advantages of their education so nearly are the corruptions of the country allied to those of the town with no further difference than what is made by another turn of thought and method of living  many more grievances though not of equal importance have been laid before me from several parts of this kingdom which as they fall not under any ones cognizance so properly as my own oblige me to a speedy and effectual regulation of them when i was prevailed upon to act as censor of great britain i did not enough consider the extent of that province nor how difficult it would be to make my authority understood in the remoter parts of this island for most of the natives being strangers to literature i cannot hope my lucubrations should meet with a general reception amongst them and therefore i have now resolved on an expedient which i shall explain by the following order  saturday january       0 to all and every one of the churchwardens and sidesmen in their respective parishes throughout the kingdom of great britain isaac bickerstaff esquire censor of the said kingdom wishes health and many happy new years gentlemen whereas i have from many parts of the kingdom as well villages as country towns received credible information of several innovations abuses and offenses lately crept into them much derogating from their honor nor less pernicious to the quiet of society and at the same time not punishable by any law common or municipal as yet in force and whereas my age growing infirmities and necessary residence in this place will not give me leave to come in person and put a stop to these evils i do hereby charge and require you and every one of you within five days after receipt of this to repair forthwith to the vestry or what other place shall to your wisdom seem most proper there to choose elect and nominate some candid sober and understanding person being not above the dignity of a squire nor under that of clerk of the parish aged fifty years at least whom so chosen elected and nominated i do hereby authorize and depute under the title of a rural censor to remark examine and take cognizance of all such offenses provided always that he does not presume to pronounce sentence or make any final determination not having first communicated to me by letter the persons quality circumstances etc or not having received my instructions therein  in witness whereof i have set my hand the day and date above isaac bickerstaff signed kidney clerk of the court during the incapacity of charles lilly whose petition relating to his suspension is referred to the next courtday in the mean time all letters and advices are to be directed to mrs baldwins  this day the case of john morphew came on he was indicted for having made many scandalous reflections on the censor as likewise for breach of trust and being found guilty of the same was sentenced to continue printing shamtatlers and one or two more such papers six other causes were heard afterward which it is not thought proper to make public many noble persons yet alive being concerned therein  the tatler no   sie teneros animos aliena opprobria sape absterrent vitris hor from tuesd jan    to saturday jan  0    0 when i left the town as i said before i did not only make a sufficient provision for the continuance of my lucubrations till the time i had fixed for my return but took care to substitute one who in case my stay should happen to be longer than i designed would much better have furnished out the usual entertainment the public expected from me sam trusty of whom i made mention in a former paper was the person i pitched upon to execute that office fifty years and upwards we have lived in so strict an intimacy in so perfect an union that neither times interest passions nor opinions have ever been able to make the least flaw in our friendship i am not ashamed to own i have received more advantage from his conversation than from all the academick exercises it is to his instructions i owe the improvement of my understanding to his precepts and example the forming of my manners and to his observations the principal remarks i have made upon the several states and conditions of mankind as his genius at our first setting out in the world was much above mine so he has ever since maintained the same superiority his words were always few his arguments weighty his reflections just his intentions sincere and his connexions were mixed with such an agreeable mirth that i have often taken pleasure in putting my self in the wrong on purpose to excite him to so delightful a reproof a sudden indisposition defeated me of his assistance and has exposed me to the difficulties i have been under in reinstating my self in my former authority however that he designed to serve me effectually will appear by the ensuing discourse which he intended to publish the day after my departure where in his ludicrous way he has pursued the directions i left him as he takes notice himself in his introduction i was unwilling the world should be deprived of one line of his writing and consequently could not well omit what the excess of his affection prompted him to say in my favor and which is perhaps the only instance that can be given of his partiality  my very good friend isaac bickerstaff being indispensably obliged to visit some relations in the country these holy days that there may be no interruption of justice in his absence has deputed me to officiate for him till his return and his last instructions were to have a particular regard to the interest of the fair sex of which he has all along shown himself a professed and constant admirer i am sensible how unequal my talents are for so important a task nor are our different sentiments upon that subject a less obstruction to the performance of what he has enjoined me than my want of abilities to fill the place of so worthy and great a person but to proceed to the business in hand  if we were to ake mankinds character from one another there never could have been so seasonable a time to exercise the office of censor with the utmost severity because there never was a time by universal consent when the iniquities of the age were so full blown and consequently the world stood so much in need of correction it has ever been thought natural to people advanced in years as i am to declaim upon the vices of the age they live in but i am far from believing we are half so wicked as we say we are and being a pretty strict enquirer into humane nature and endeavoring to trace all things up to their original causes i am fully persuaded that a malignant love of detraction is the reigning vice of our times and could we but eradicate the pernicious practice of railing and defamation we should appear to be much upon the level with our predecessors and not worse than the nations round about us zeno the founder of the stoic philosophy had so little indulgence for the frailties and infirmities of mankind that he esteemed the minutest deviation from the rules of reason and justice to be of equal weight with the most horrid crimes and grossest impieties so stealing an apple by his account was as great a sin as committing sacrilege and the throwing at cocks on shrovetuesday would have been reckoned as heinous an offense as murdering ones father in cold blood we seem to pursue his principles in the judgments we make of other peoples actions every little error the most harmless irregularities are subject to have names of infamy affixed to them and ranked among deeds of the blackest complexion  jenny filch is a lamentable instance of this barbarous custom they have lately set upon her reputation at my lady swaddles the general rendezvous of reverend female elders consisting of antiquated prudes superannuated belles and coquets of fifty five her ladyship stroaking the downy honors of her chin with a hoarse masculine voice pronounced her guilty of incontinency cheating at play theft and drinking to excess what an accumulation of enormities how severe are these reflections upon the reputation of a young lady and had she not a greatness of mind superior to their malice which some no doubt will ascribe to impudence i cannot see how she could dare show her face but i who have known her from her infancy think it incumbent on me to vindicate her character and make no question in very few words of convincing all impartial judges how innocent she is of what they lay to her charge jenny filch was brought up at a boardingschool where children of both sexes were promiscuously received from a girl she hated a sedentary life so little progress was made in the sampler her humor was brisk and jovial her constitution sanguine and vigorous which led her to delight in robust diversions such as trapball jugglecat britishhoppers ninepins and whipping tops to share in their sports she was fain to be much among the boys she grew from thence to love their company extremely and has gradually continued the affection ever since i am forced to explain this matter very particularly because she has been often twitted by the ladies for liking to be with the fellows rather than with them as she is a very little observer of forms she seldom could endure to be under the restraint of a set dress but rather choose with some one friend to go in a mob and a mask into the pit at a play than to sit in a box the vivacity of her wit and the smartness of her repartees drew constantly all the young beaux about her this humor of hers it seems took mightily and she would often prevail upon those ladies of her acquaintance whose husbands were beyond sea purely out of compassion rather than to sit moping and melancholy at home to go along with her and in short did all she could to procure them such diversions as might make them less sensible of their spouses absence when the play was near done no body was more nice in choosing some of the most civil and harmless men to lead them to a coach and because hackneycoachmen are often very rude and imposing they would now and then for protection permit them to step in and perhaps drive to phillipss just to refresh their spirits sometimes if they were very well assured of the gentlemens behavior they would in a frolic venture to ear a frigasee at pontacks but never failed to be back by twelve i remember there was a great pother about two or three of her companions who at their husbands return were very near increasing their family but how she is to blame all this while no body can say twas her doing let every one answer for their own follies and this is all i ever heard alleged against her upon the first article  now as to cheating at play i suppose what mislead them into that opinion was her great skill and dexterity in all tricks at cards for having very fine fingers she took a great deal of pleasure in learning whatever the famous high german could teach her in that art wherein she grew so great a proficient that in a short time she outdid her master twice or thrice a week merely for amusement she would pass the evening at langteral and truly twas very entertaining for any standers by to observe what a superior genius she had in handling the cards above the people she played with she would make nothing of showing three loos in five deals to the great wonder and surprise of all the company but as this was only done for diversion she chose to play so low that she seldom carried off above four or five pounds just to pay her chair and buy clean gloves what they mean by theft i cannot imagine unless twas slipping now and then a china cup into her pocket at an indian house to adorn her cabinet this it seems is a hereditary piece of furniture she is very fond of it came from italy long ago the inside is curiously painted wherein are represented the loves of endymion and the m cupid and psyche venus and adonis with several other fabulous stories she ever loved to have things neat about her and only wanted some few pieces of china to place upon the top of this cabinet but being a notable housewife she could not endure to squander away her money upon such baubles so when she went with any of her acquaintance to shops that deal in thse things she would pick up in one place a cup in the next a saucer in a third something of another sort either china or japan just as it came to hand and by degrees got as complete a collection together as any body in short there never was a more agreeable variety for no two pieces were alike in the whole parcel it is ten to one some scrupulous people will be apt to call this pilfering but let them consider no body ever more exactly observed the rules of justice in all the measures she took to supply her self with those conveniences every shop contributed but barely its share and the burden being equally laid so far from giving occasion of complaint the loss was scarce felt by any body besides she made them ample amends by commending their goods and bringing them custom i may add in her behalf that what she did was merely in conformity of the fashion every ladys cabinet was covered with china she could not well afford to buy it what should she do it has been a received saying one had as good be out of the world as out of the fashion from whence we may conclude those things are as necessary as meat and drink and no body was ever accounted a criminal for taking as much as would suffice nature let it be at whose expense it would indeed had this been done in any be view for filthy lucre and to sell again i readily grant she were to blame but in her case it is no more than stealing the custom of wine for ones own table and we all know how commonly that is practiced by people of very tender consciences  what remains to be spoken of is her immoderate love of wine nor will she be less clear in this than in all the rest jenny has a voluble tongue and loves to exercise it that i cannot but own she often talks her self into a heat and that causes thirst sometimes by an absence of mind pretty incident to her she will call for glass after glass without remembering she drank but the minute before now this may prove she has a short memory indeed but how to infer the love of wine from hence i cannot see the mistake however is easy to be accounted for the negligence of her dress her flusterd complexion her great loquacity sometimes and her incoherent answers to others when her thoughts are wandering often concur to make her look as if she were actually in drink but is this an equitable way of judging if once we suffer our selves to be imposed on by appearances farewell all hopes of having truth established among us in our generation  before i dismiss this subject i cannot but express a sincere concern for a multitude of injured women who have suffered in their characters for want of a champion to defend their cause and i will take upon me to affirm as much might have been said for a hundred about this town who have been basely abused as i have done for jenny filch but i refer their justification to my friend isaac to whom that province does most properly belong  the tatler no    tibi luditur effluis amens contemnere  per from saturday jan  0 to tuesday jan       0 channelrow january  0 leaning out of my window this morning i observed a young gentleman pass under it whose face i was sure to have seen but could not presently recollect his name the oddness of his figure helped to disguise him for though otherwise decent enough he had a napkincap on his head and at the same time by the negligence of his air gave one to understand that he thought himself dressed for the whole day in this manner he walked on to the end of our lane then turned short upon his heel and hurried back again with the utmost precipitation by this time i had made a shift to remember that this was the same young gentleman whom i formerly made mention of in order to recommend a play of his to the world there was merit enough in that performance to make me a wellwisher to the author and as much wit as might make him capable of an odd turn in his understanding  i was sorry to see him thus exposed and beckoned him up to me he came in great confusion and without giving me time to ask any questions told me he was particularly ashamed to be seen by a man of my character in so heedless a way that indeed he had come out in some have and forgt his hat and perriwig by his awkward manner of excusing himself i soon found the cause of his disorder that it was purely artificial and lay rather in his heart than his head twas with great indignation i heard his apology and had not i been strongly prejudiced in the young mans behalf i should hardly have afforded him the favor of a rebuke after some enquiry i found by him that this inadvertency had cost him much pains and industry to acquire and that by long use it was now improved into a habit  he freely owned that this was a method he had often took to distinguish and recommend himself as a wit and that he had hitherto met with good success i was a little pacified with the frankness of this confession and encouraged him to proceed in it  to tell you the truth sir says he i was led into this error very young and the occasion of it perhaps may give you diversion twas a custom at the great school where i was bred frequently to call over the names of the boys in the presence of the master this happened one day just after the public prayers were over and when it came to my turn to say adsum through mistake i answered amen would you believe sir that from this very moment i came immediately into vogue i was cried up for a boy of great parts and of a wild but extraordinary genius as i grew more careless i was still more admired and by a thousand little premeditated blunders i at last established a reputation when i came to the university i expected to be laughed out of my fooleries but instead of that i was every day more confirmed in them there was hardly a man of distinction but was as they call it in the university cant a sht and a rattle to be a very great sloven in dress was some degree of merit and i particularly remember one of the beaux esprits that valued himself upon being the dirtiest fellow that ever writ a good line twas a matter of emulation amongst us whose rooms should be worst furnished and lie in the greatest disorder so that with a little wresting of the sense we might have writ over our doors  hic vivimus ambitiosa paupertate  harry heedless whose works you may have heard of has lately taken an allegorical inventory of his goods in heroic verse suffer me sir to put it into your hands and to beg a place for it in your next lucubrations here the young gentleman took his leave and thanked me for my friendship with an air of sincerity that could not be dissembled his readiness to understand his error and his resolution to reform it have indeed convinced me that in matters of this kind a man of great parts may repeat more in half an hour than one of ordinary capacity can in many years but i must not omit the verses  where c  c  towers in pompous pride are dressed sublime and far superior to the rest over distant piles presides a garret high that braves the gods and borders on the sky within whose jutting walls and vaulted roof disorder frantic goddess dwells aloof banished the court despairing to be great the wretched exile flies to this retreat pensive and sad she sits with ragged grace on tottering chair the tripos of the place in muddy ale there wastes the lingering day or in mundungus clouds whiffs care away at nights approach on bed unmade she lies whose softness with the polished marble vies not stuffed from fowls at lordly banquets dressed they made for luxury their plumes for rest but from those flocks that feed by harmless swains on hampshire downs or wiltshires spreading plains mean while the winds a dreadful consort keep and with hrse music lull her fast asleep i cannot help adding a word or two upon this humor of setting up for a wit by personating a different conduct from others in the common actions of life the rather because within the compass of my own observation it has deprived the world of many useful persons and eclipsed many valuable qualifications it has certainly been the misfortune of several great men to have had something singular in their gate their diet and even in their conversation it self they who have followed the profounder studies appear often to have their thoughts distracted as it is particularly observed of mathematicians their minds being so steddily fixed that they cannot easily unbend them  hence it is that others imagining the merit lies in the singularity are glad to find it so easy a matter to distinguish themselves the desire of doing which i take to be the root of all affectation to say truth the men of wit have naturally their share in these imperfections for as more severe studies require a very close application theirs perhaps engage it too little and their spirits are too volatile to give a long and constant attention this absence of theirs if i may so speak my cousin humphry calls a tax upon great geniuss and says he thinks it a happiness when a man of eminent parts has nothing particular to be known by either when he walks the street or appears in company for which reason in talking over the characters of ingenious men i am frequently offended to hear people dwell upon some odd circumstances in their behavior a certain author about town is much celebrated for writing all his works upon backs of letters and scraps of paper another writ the best part of his poem upon old cards and had like to have lost ten of the finest lines in it upon an ace of diamonds which he had unluckily misplaced a third of immortal memory was wont to lie in his perriwig and caught a cold that destroyed him by washing his hands these and many other singularities observable in men of extraordinary talents might for ought one knows be natural to them but when papilio studies for incoherent answers to every question that is asked him and makes appointments on purpose to forget them it is a question amongst the curious whether the humor be natural or affected i think it the most favorable opinion that there is a mixture of both i have often with great pleasure considered the character of my friend urbanus whose great wit and learning are indeed accompanied with singularities such as are altogether natural but will i doubt meet with few imitators i mean his excessive candor modesty and good nature the affectation of these qualities would sufficiently distinguish any one that would be at the pains to transcribe them and the consequences of it would be of service to the world but to copy the infirmities only of great men and to quote their example in our defense is making precedents of them where they least desire to be so and perverting their authority to give a sanction to folly  the tatler no    laceratque trahitque molle pecus  vir from tuesday jan    to saturday jan       0 amongst other severities i have met with from some critics the cruelest for an old man is that they will not let me be at quiet in my bed but pursue me to my very dreams i must not dream but when they please nor upon long continued subjects however visionary in their own natures because there is a manifest moral quite through them which to produce as a dream is improbable and unnatural the pain i might have had from this objection is prevented by considering they have missed another against which i should have been at a loss to defend my self they should have asked me whether the dreams i publish can properly be called lucubrations which is the name i have given to all my papers whether in volumes or halfsheets so manifest a contradiction in terminis that i wonder no sophister ever thought of it but the other is a cavil i remember when i was a boy at school i have often dreamed out the whole passages of a day that i rode a journey baited supped went to bed and rose the next morning and i have known young ladies who would dream a whole contexture of adventures in one night large enough to make a novel in youth the imagination is strong not mixed with cares nor tinged with those passions that most disturb and confound it such as avarice ambition and many others now as old men are said to grow children again so in this article of dreaming i am returned to my childhood my imagination is at full ease without care avarice or ambition to clog it by which among many others i have this advantage of doubling the small remainder of my time and living four and twenty hours in the day however the dream i am now going to relate is as wild as can well be imagined and to please these refiners upon sleep without any moral that i can discover it happened that my maid left on the table in my bedchamber one of her storybooks as she calls them which i took up and found full of strange impertinences fitted to her taste and condition of poor servants that came to be ladies and servingmen of low degree who married kings daughters among other things i met this sage observation that a lion would never hurt a true virgin with this medly of nonsense in my fancy i went to bed and dreamed that a friend waked me in the morning and proposed for pastime to spend a few hours in seeing the parishlions which he had not done since he came to town and because they showed but once a week he would not miss the opportunity i said i would humor him though to speak the truth i was not fond of those cruel spectacles and if it were not so ancient a custom founded as i had heard upon the wisest maxims i should be apt to censure the inhumanity of those who introduced it all this will be a riddle to the waking reader till i discover the scene my imagination had formed upon the maxim that a lion would never hurt a true virgin i dreamed that by a law of immemorial time a helion was kept in every parish at the common charge and in a place provided adjoining to the churchyard that before any one of the fair sex was married if she affirmed her self to be a virgin she must on her wedding day and in her weddingcloaths perform the ceremony of going alone into the den and stay an hour with the lion let loose and kept fasting four and twenty hours on purpose at a proper height above the den were convenient galleries for the relations and friends of the young couple and open to all spectators no maiden was forced to offer her self to the lion but if she refused it was a disgrace to marry her and every one might have liberty of calling her a whore and methought it was as usual a diversion to see the parishlions as with us to go to a play or an opera and it was reckoned convenient to be near the church either for marrying the virgin if she escaped the trial or for burying the bones when the lion had devoured the rest as he constantly did  to go on therefore with the dream we called first as i remember to see st dunstans lion but we were told they did not show to day from thence we went to that of covent garden which to my great surprise we found as lean as a skeleton when i expected quite the contrary but the keeper said twas no wonder at all because the poor beast had not got an ounce of womans flesh since he came into the parish this amazed me more than the other and i was forming to my self a mighty veneration for the ladies in that quarter of the town when the keeper went on and said he wondered the parish would be at the charge of maintaining a lion for nothing friend said i do you call it nothing to justify the virtue of so many ladies or has your lion lost his distinguishing faculty can there be any thing more for the honor of your parish than that all the ladies married in your church were pure virgins that is true said he and the doctor knows it to his sorrow for there has not been a couple married in our church since his worship has been amongst us the virgins hereabouts are too wise to venture the claws of the lion and because no body will marry them have all entered into vows of virginity so that in proportion we have much the largest nunnery in the whole town this manner of ladies entering into a vow of virginity because they were not virgins i easily conceived and my dream told me that the whole kingdom was full of nunneries plentifully stocked from the same reason we went to see another lion where we found much company met in the gallery the keeper told us we should see sport enough as he called it and in a little time we saw a young beautiful lady put into the den who walked up toward the lion with all imaginable security in her countenance and looked smiling upon her lover and friends in the gallery which i thought nothing extraordinary because it was never known that any lion had been mistaken but however we were all disappointed for the lion lifted up his right paw which was the fatal sign and advancing forward seized her by the arm and began to tear it the poor lady gave a terrible shriek and cried out the lion is just i am no true virgin oh sappho sappho she could say no more for the lion gave her the coup de grace by a squeeze in the throat and she expired at his feet the keeper dragged away her body to feed the animal when the company was gone for the parish lions never used to eat in public after a little pause another lady came on toward the lion in the same manner as the former we observed the beast smell her with great diligence he scratched both her hands with lifting them to his nose and clapping a claw on her bosom drew blood however he let her go and at the same time turned from her with a sot of contempt at which she was not a little mortified and retired with some confusion to her friends in the gallery methought the whole company immediately understood the meaning of this that the easiness of the lady had suffered her to admit certain impudent and dangerous familiarities bordering too much upon what is criminal neither was it sure whether the lover then present had not some sharers with him in those freedoms of which a lady can never be too sparing  this happened to be an extraordinary day for a third lady came into the den laughing loud playing with her fan tossing her head and smiling round on the young fellows in the gallery however the lion leaped on her with great fury and we gave her for gone but on a sudden he let go his hold turned from her as if he were nauseated then gave her a lash with his tail after which she returned to the gallery not the least out of countenance and this it seems was the usual treatment of coquets  i thought we had now seen enough but my friend would needs have us go and visit one or two lions in the city we called at two or three dens where they happened not to show but we generally found half a score young girls between eight and eleven years old playing with each lion sitting on his back and putting their heads into his mouth some of them would now and then get a scratch but we always discovered upon examining that they had been hoydening with the young apprentices one of them was calling to a pretty girl of about twelve years that stood by us in the gallery to come down to the lion and upon her refusal said ah miss betty we could never get you to come near the lion since you played at hoop and hide with my brother in the garret we followed a couple with the wedding folks goint to the church of st maryaxs the lady though well stricken in years extremely crooked and deformed was dressed out beyond the gaiety of fifteen having jumbled together as i imagined all the tawdry remains of aunts godmothers and grandmothers for some generations past one of the neighbors whispered me that she was an old maid and had the clearest reputation of any in the parish there is nothing strange in that thought i but was much surprised when i observed afterward that she went toward the lion with distrust and concern the beast was lying down but upon sight of her snuffd up his nose two or three times and then giving the sign of death proceeded instantly to execution in the midst of her agonies she was heard to name the words italy and artifices with the utmost horror and several repeated execrations and at last concluded feel that i was to put so much confidence in the toughness of my skin  the keeper immediately set all in order again for another customer which happened to be a famous prude whom her parents after long threatenings and much persuasion had with the extremest difficulty prevailed on to accept a young handsome goldsmith that might have pretended to five times her fortune the fathers and mothers in the neighborhood used to quote her for an example to their daughters her elbows were rivetted to her sides and her whole person so ordered as to inform every body that she was afraid they should touch her she only dreaded to approach the lion because it was a he one and abhorred to think an animal of that sex should presume to breathe on her the sight of a man at twenty yards distance made her draw back her head she always sat upon the farther corner of the chair though there were six chairs between her and her lover and with the door wide open and her little sister in the room she was never saluted but at the tip of her ear and her father had much ado to make her dine without her gloves when there was a man at table she entered the den with some fear which we took to proceed from the height of her modesty offended at the sight of so many men in the gallery the lion beholding her at a distance immediately gave the deadly sign at which the poor creature methinks i see her still miscarried in a fright before us all the lion seemed to be surprised as much as we and gave her time to make her confession that she was four months gone by the foreman of her fathers shop that this was her third big belly and when her friends asked why she would venture the trial she said her nurse assured her that a lion would never hurt a woman with child upon this i immediately waked and could not help wishing that the deputycensors of my late institution were indud with the same instinct as these parish lions were    the

their vices were doing my self no pleasure and them the greatest disservice imaginable this may be some apology for my last paper which i should not have apprehended to need any but that the very evening after it was published i received the following letter  to isaac bickerstaff esquire censor of great britain sir i have just now read your tatler of this day in which let me tell you you have highly disobliged great numbers of ladies and gentlemen by endeavoring to debar them of many freedoms with each other before thought allowable for my own part if i were a man or a woman i would either cut your throat or get you poisoned for it as i am neither i judge impartially and write this without passion  castraccio bellechantini   i am to understand by this that both sexes are up in arms against me and that the signior is inclined strictly to observe a venetian neutrality  to comfort me under this misfortune the same post brought me the appearance of a compliment though to say truth i dont know how far to depend upon it  to isaac bickerstaff esquire the humble address of as many virgins as could be conveniently assembled to that purpose from all parts of the city of london may it please your honor we whose names are underwritten being honest maids and true and not fearing upon a good occasion to look the hungriest of your lions in the face though all of us as appears by the parishbooks turned of the age of twelve do hereby give you thanks for the exemplary justice you have done in this days paper on the prudes sapphos coquets etc who by their evil courses have drawn just satyr on themselves and undeserved scandal on others it were to be wished indeed that the expedient your honor was pleased to dream of could actually and immediately be put in force throughout every parish in this kingdom to the confusion of all such offenders and the justification of those who abhor their practices in the mean time placing a great confidence in the truth of the ancient tradition by you mentioned as well as in our own innocence we humbly beg leave to propose to your honor that as many of them and us as to your wisdom shall seem proper may forthwith be ordered to the dens in the tower in witness whereof all here present have set their names as follow  saturday night given at the hall belonging to our company ordered that a committee of the said virgins do attend mr

and true interest of the fair many sleepless nights and days of anxiety they have cost me yet for all this i do not find that i have any degree of interest in their persons or any restraint upon their conduct not a furbelow has been sunk nor a yard of whalebone parted with to oblige me even my most gentle corrections and pennypost intimations have met with neglect scorn and defiance bellaria is a provoking instance of this kind it has in good earnest stood me in threepence to reform her and i do not find that she is one farthing the better for it she is young it is true and may live to be wiser as her beauty goes off prudence perhaps will grow upon her but to be discreet in the height of her charms would be a much greater merit she knows the faults i have charged her with and must thank her self if she should hereafter oblige me to be more open and particular sempronia with the same aggravation continues to be haughty insolent and unnatural she is the mother of five beautiful children the eldest not above seven years old whom she never speaks to but with a design to teize them and uses worse than any animals that belong to her going to her coach the other day she observed two or three of them diverting themselves in the hall and turning to her people asked the reason why those brats lay littring about the house miss molly was severely whipped within this week for calling her mother behind her back and master neddy taken from table for seeming only to want his dinner before the italian greyhound had been fed  i have met with a case yet more extraordinary and which has given me much uneasiness though i cannot say of so criminal a nature as the latter taking a turn in the park about a month since i saw a paper lie upon the ground which i had the curiosity to stoop for and found to be a recipe  for clorinda vineagar of squills verjuice of each five ounces oil of vitriol as much as is sufficient six spoonfuls of this mixture to be taken every morning plain coffee or water gruel for common drink r b a c   i was very much surprised at so odd a prescription and having formerly had the honor to know the lady for whose use it was intended could not help inquiring into the occasion of it with some difficulty i informed my self that clorinda whom all the world admired was very lately displeased with her own person some good natured friend it seems had put it in her head that she was growing too fat and in a little time would be out of all shape this sufficiently alarmed her and from a gaiety of temper that was peculiar to her she fell into spleen vapors and a thousand imaginary disquiets there was no absurdity so gross that her fears did not impose upon her as she passed the streets in her chair she expected every moment that the fellows would sink under their burden and would often say to her self bless me how the poor creatures blow my lady killchairmans shape was become the object of her envy as it had formerly been the subject of her ridicule in short a consultation of the most eminent physicians was resolved on and a course of acids cum regimine was it seems the result of it as soon as this came to my knowledge i sent clorinda a letter full of such pressing remonstrances as the occasion suggested to me i conjured her with all the tenderness of a gallant not to suffer so much beauty to be lost to the world by being overcurious to preserve it nor that bloom to wither through an irreligious mortification of her self  after taking so much pains to see my advice neglected and other measures pursued has i own sensibly touched me both as an old man and a graduate physician however it is yet in the power of clorinda to retrieve what is passed she has nothing more to do than to eat drink and sleep to make her self again the joy of her friends the desire of mankind and what is yet greater without vanity be it said to be heartily forgiven by the censor of great britain  the tatler no   his lachrymis vitam

too closely woven into our constitutions ever to be removed by any pains or application of our own had i suffered my self to believe this i had been now one of the peevishest old fellows as i was formerly one of the most passionate youths in the world till the age of sixteen i was never in good humor two hours together i thought my self affronted by every one i met and grew into a proverb for the violence of my resentments i no sooner came to the use of my reason but i began to cool apace and have ever since preserved such an evenness of temper as is not easily ruffled and which under the greatest difficulties and distresses has made me superior to them all  i remember one thing of my self in the days of my minority that was pleasant enough whenever any body had done me an ill office i used in the bitterness of my heart to wish my self parson of the parish for their sake he i observed had once a week the privilege of speaking his mind in public and of telling his parishioners their own this i thought was a mighty relief to his spleen and indeed the doctor made use of it as if he had been of the same opinion he had a particular felicity in finding out texts to his purpose and no one offense could be committed against him that did not appear the next sunday to be literally forbidden in scripture the top gentleman in the parish having one day made him a visit in a striped nightgown he looked upon this dishabilee as a mark of contempt and the very next time the pulpit was his own giving a sideglance toward the squires pew he pronounced with a loud voice stripes are for the backs of fools etc a poor tailor had cabbaged some black cloth that was put into his hands and the text chosen for his reprimand was hell and destruction are before them though toward the end of the discourse it was allowed that a remnant should be saved  this petulant humor of prostituting a public capacity to particular resentments is what i have industriously avoided throughout the whole course of my lucubrations after the many observations i have made upon humane nature it is i confess some pleasure to communicate them to the public in the manner i have chose to do it but unless in cases where my reputation has been openly attacked i have never once interested the world in any disputes relating to my self every body knows what provocations mr powell gave me and in how crowded a theater before i would descend to take any notice of him when i did it was in such a manner i thought as all controversy ought to be managed between scholars and gentlemen mr morphew and mr lilly obliged me to draw my pen against them by a piece of ingratitude that is hardly to be matched in history i had always treated those persons with a respect due to their characters and as our interests were mutual i flattered my self that our affections were so too i know i shall suffer in the opinion of some unforgiving people when i make it known that after such repeated indignities i have again taken them into favor but as the following petition was introduced to me by some of the first quality in this kingdom i can deny nothing to their commands nor indeed to the dictates of my own humanity  to isaac bickerstaff esquire undoubted censor of the kingdom of great britain the petition of john morphew stationer and charles lilly perfumer humbly shows that whereas during your honors late retirement in the remoter parts of this kingdom we the said charles lilly and john morphew by and through the means of evil and clandestine practices insinuations and instigations set on foot by the avowed enemies of your person and authority were unhappily moved and seduced to forfeit the duty we owed to both by printing publishing dispersing and causing to be dispersed several false spurious and illiterate papers as well as by affixing your honors name thereunto we do hereby humbly crave leave to throw our selves at your feet in such manner and posture as you in your wisdom shall judge most suitable to our late offenses further craving that we your petitioners may be restored to our former places together with all the fees profits and perquisites thereof in order to which we in the most humble sense of our crimes and filled with a deep and hearty sorrow for the same do beg for our selves and for each other that the suspension now lying on the said charles lilly as also the late sentence of deprivation pronounced on the said john morphew may be cancelled and reversed in full form order and method pursuant to the rules and statutes of the court  and your petitioners shall ever pray etc and the said petitioners were restored etc according to the tenor and meaning of the abovewritten petition  signed charles lilly  it was an infinite pleasure to me the day after i had reinstated the petitioners to see the faces of my old officers about me however i would not have mr kidney be in the least discouraged the little time he has been in employment has raised in me a just

or other at his first coming from the university he set up for a great unbeliever for which reason as likewise because he was afraid to be in a room by himself he spent most of his time at the grecian but not arriving to any great eminence in infidelity he turned himself with great application to the calling of a virtuoso to equip himself for this he traveled twice into italy from whence at great expense he brought back a solemn face with the reputation of knowing as much as he did when he went out being now greatly accomplished for the service of his country he thought it was high time to take care of the constitution and to that end without fear or wit leaped at once over head and ears into public business from that time to this he has lived in a professed course of gravity i have had more frequent opportunities of conversing with him than i could have wished for taking me by my age to be a man for his purpose he has in a manner forced himself upon my acquaintance he has told me with great frankness that he thinks it below a reasonable man either to laugh or drink wine and that he has laid down some rules to himself as essential to the character he affects to preserve a steadfast countenance to whisper in coffeehouses to shave but twice a week and to wear but one loop to his hat to read nothing but the votes and to keep company with his father he has sometimes said with as much pleasure as his face is capable of well mr bickerstaff nothing sure is so solid a satisfaction as business  for my part i love it so well that i cannot like a proposal the worse for having been rejected and to do him justice he has been a true friend to distressed projects and as good as a father to bills in disgrace he receives more petitions than a first minister and solicits the affairs of all the mad beggars about town monday last i was obliged upon some business to go to his levee i found with him over bohea and bread and butter justice upperside and sir paul marmalade upon my coming in mr worthless who sat next the fire rose up and forced me into his chair the justice with an innocent smile in his face and his cane at his mouth said mr bickerstaff you can tell us pray sir what are all these insurances upon births and marriages will they come to any thing or no before i could answer he went on why really sir i would be glad gentlemen would consider every nation consists chiefly of men and women how says sir paul do you make nothing of children the justice shaking his head said my good friend sir paul you dont take me but what i would offer is this if marriages are hindered procreation in a legal way will cease and the consequence of that every one knows however if no body else takes notice of it i am sure i shall not  it is not my business to find faults  mr worthless stopping him short cried pray take me along with you for unless the persons marrying be equal to the persons married where is your balance for i take it a nation may be over as well as under married well says sir paul i dont love disputing in company but you would have a hard matter to make that out this weighty conversation was interrupted by captain mystery who came in

joined with the miserable habit he was in was a most exquisite burlesque upon the humor of his country he had in his hand a bundle of papers much obscured with filth and of a fragrancy not to be endured these he presented to the patriot who gave me to understand that they contained a short and easy expedient to settle the house of austria on the throne of spain whispering at the same time that he verily believed this gentleman to be of the blood royal  the next as i understood from him was one mrs james a little ancient gentlewoman in a pair of very high pattins who with much anxiety and hunger in her countenance desired his honor with a low voice and in a language that i hardly understood to attend her business in the house for that it was now just ready to come on and it seems it has been in the same forwardness for these thirty years past she withdrew with great humility and repeated courtesies to make room for a third mr worthless took me aside and told me that this was a gentleman who in his younger days studied the law but having failed in that had now put himself into the fantastical habit i saw and under it was one of the deepest heads in the world he has attended

of his parishioners that he was ever making up quarrels and doing good offices in the neighborhood that he had been often left sole guardian to orphans and discharged his trust with the utmost fidelity that he constantly visited the sick and having some knowledge in physic and the composition of medicines had assigned part of his income to that use when he came first to the place there was a conventicle hard by which had drawn away most of the people from the church but by the exemplariess of his life his great hospitality for so lender a fortune and the gentleness of his nature joined with the force of his perswaons the people returned by degrees the dissenting minister went off and the barn hey met in was applied to its proper use  i was pleased with the figure of the man as e came into my room somewhat tall incliing to be lean his hair gray of a fair but flod complexion with a certain sweetness and mplicity in his countenance  in our conversation he seemed to show that sort of diffidence which usually attends men of the best sense after having passed their lives in retirement upon all occasions he submitted with great deference to me as one who had studied humane nature and attaed to a perfect knowledge of the world after an hours talk having industriously led him through several subjects i found him to be of an excellent understanding cultivated by the knowledge of the best author of antiquity and of a perfect good taste to point out their beauties amongst the rest he showed me many instances of the sublime in the holy writings which i had not heard any one before observe so that upon the whole all the difference i could find between us both in point of knowing the world was that he had been chiefly conversant with the best part of it and i with the worst  this day sevennight in the morning mr trusty presented me another new acquaintance mr bickerstaff says he this is dr  i know you will be pleased with one another having never heard the name before i concluded him not very eminent in his profession he had no haste in his countenance and sat with me above two hours without any visible impatience to be going he appeared to have abundance of good nature without the sneaking mercenary affectation of it and mentioned with honor as many of his own profession as are allowed to deserve it he received no message all the while we were together and i observed particularly that he discoursed often as if he believed revealed religion we dined together and he carved up a pullet without reading a lecture of anatomy upon it he seemed to be of a facetious wit and after a few glasses of wine would now and then let off a quibble without thinking it any disparagement to his understanding i took the first opportunity to enquire of my friend into the character of this gentleman whose account was that he had many years belonged to the faculty that he was an admirable scholar and very knowing in his profession but being born a gentleman and to a competent fortune of his own he disdained the servile ways of making court to nurses and apothecaries and therefore his chief practice lay among the poor he never valued his reputation equal to the life of a patient and often preserved the latter though by transgressing against form and method he was once coming into business but lost it by persuading his patients they were not sick and refusing their fees  the other mr trusty has recommended to me is a young gentleman under twenty and a nephew of his own his person is graceful his eyes quick and lively the tone of his voice agreeable his look open affable and serene his constitution vigorous and sanguine his air dress and behavior easy modest and unaffected he has been bred under the care and direction of his uncle who i remember often used to say to me i will undertake isaac to make this boy have as much useful knowledge at nineteen as you or i have at fifty this he has effected beyond what i could possibly have conceived and the methods he has taken to do it shall hereafter in one or more of these papers be communicated to the public in the mean time it is an infinite delight to me to find this young man frequently making such just observations as are in others the result of long experience to hear him reason closely without prejudice passion or conceit at other times to see him gay cheerful and entertaining without running into indecent liberty or straining for the character of a wit and upon all occasions to observe in him a generous detestation of every thing that is base and unworthy an integrity founded on good sense and superior to every temptation what inexpressible pleasure must arise from the reflection of having furnished the world with so extraordinary a person who if his merit does not hinder him may for half a century in the highest stations and most honorable employments be of public importance to the world  the letter from drumstick and trencher of edinburgh is received and shall shortly be taken into consideration  the tatler no    from saturd febr  0 to tuesd febr       0 from my own apartment in channelrow february    sitting last night over a cheerful fire and a glass of spanish wine with my friend samuel trusty i happened to say with a freedom peculiar to our manner of conversing that i could not but admire our mutual constancy in the friendship that had so long been between us why it is right isaac says he and i hope we may look upon it as an argument of virtue on both sides for my own part i do not remember that i ever wished my self from you when our affairs would give us leave to be together but this agreement says i is so far from being common in the world that if the institution at dunmowe were in favor of friendship as it is of matrimony i am confident there are few besides our selves would have any right to the pramium no says he and i remember a story of two pretty remarkable friends of our own time that you remind me of on this occasion they had lived some time about town and being weary of mixed company noise and impertinence agreed to retire where they might without interruption enjoy one another nottingham was the place resolved on but they had not continued there a week in close and constant conversation before they grew insufferably sick of each other some third person must be engaged into their relief and being accidentally lodged in a house next the gaol where a cup of good liquor was to be had they sent a message to the jailer to tell him if he was at leisure there were two gentlemen that were alone would come and smoke a pipe with him being otherwise employed he sent his excuse upon which they went in person and asked him if there was never an honest highwayman in the house that would be glad of company he told them he was quite out at present and that if it was to save their lives he had no body but an old woman that was under sentence of death for exercising the black art and he was sure they would not take up with her he happened to be mistaken for they immediately obtained leave to go down into the dungeon and there solaced themselves with ale brandy and the society of this poor unfortunate creature till within two hours of her execution  what a levity of mind is this that will not suffer us to acquiesce in the most reasonable enjoyments of life what a want of principle reflection and ordinary resolution as one every day sees the wretched effects of this viciated taste in conversation dress and behavior i for my own part am made more particularly sensible of them in the prosecution of this work to say as much as is proper on the same subject is wearing it out as they call it and a half sheet without four or five breaks has a dull heavy look and is offensive to the eyes of curious readers so that for their relief more than my own i am forced sometimes to diversify my paper by dating it from several parts of the town or else which is my present case to call in the assistance of such correspondents as come first to hand  to mr isaac bickerstaff alias   saturday two of the clock sir i think it not of much consequence whether your isaacship be real or assumed much less whether the papers you publish are your own or chiefly raised by contribution from able hands as to the first of these objections i confess for my own part that i am not the less diverted or instructed by a fable for knowing that it is such but have often found my self bettered and entertained by the imaginary conversations of chanticleer and reynard the fox for the other if you are as little fond of praise as a good and wise man ought to be you will content your self with being in any sort the instrument of doing a service to mankind without expecting or desiring their applause for it though perhaps it may hereafter reflect some honor on your name that in an age when wit and learning were at a great height in this kingdom you were admitted to a degree of intimacy with the top geniuss of it and at the same time had so much regard to the public as always to prefer their writings to your own to tell you the truth i am at present more sollicitous about the existence of another person than that of mr bickerstaff and would enquire very seriously of you whether there be really any such young gentleman in the world as is described in the tatler of this day i confess my self very much enamored with the copy if i may so speak and will venture to offer my eldest daughter who is young beautiful and virtuous with eight thousand pounds sterling for the original rather than fail i would stretch hard for the other two but i conjure you sir not to make this letter public which if you answer privately and to my satisfaction by the pennypost i will afterward meet either your self or wh you shall depute to talk further on this affair my true name shall be a secret till i hear from you in the mean time give me leave to be  your most humble servant under that of w wealthy please to direct to me at linderts chocolatehouse in king street near bloomsburysquare     the alias on the cover of this letter the omission of my title on the same as well as some passages in the said letter leave me at full liberty to treat both that and the writer of it in what manner i please and i do hereby give notice that i will hereafter neither answer read open nor receive nor suffer to be answered read opened nor received any letter or packet otherwise directed than to isaac bickerstaff esquire etc according to the order by me formerly issued on that behalf  to isaac bickerstaff esquire charing cross febr    0 sir i am a gentleman of the broad sword and desire to be heard before your honor touching a point that nearly concerns mine which is this being in company this evening with a youth of more than ordinary fire he observed my nose to be somewhat larger than his upon which he took a dislike to my face and toward the end of the night could not forbear telling me that he thought it an affront to thrust the said nose into civil company without giving me leave to answer for so inoffensive a member he instantly drew and took off a piece of it at once that reduced it to the size of his own this i returned with so sound a blow that swelled his to the bigness of mine before its amputation now sir the question is whether i may not in honor cut off his nose in its present circumstances for the same reason he did mine before a speedy decision whereof will oblige me to be for ever  your most obedient servant tho huff   ordered that a caustic be forthwith applied to the nose of the defendant there to remain for the space of four hours and that the plaintiff do attend the operation three days after which he the said defendant is hereby summoned to appear in court there further to answer for the offense by him committed before his peers of the horseguards  the tatler no     praetextatos referunt artaxata mores juv from tuesday febr    to thursd febr       0 from my own apartment in channelrow february    it is now something more than three weeks since i issued forth my order for the election of rural censors throughout every parish in the kingdom of great britain this in most places has been punctually observed and with great regularity and order but in others it has produced discord division and tumult the last post brought me an account from smallworth wiltshire that there were actually two censors chosen for the me parish who upon all occasions unavoidably clash and interfere with each other at briewell in hampshire very indirect practices have been made use of and a person elected that had not lived two days in the place a bad effect this of a most useful institution if churchwardens and sidesmen are thus open to corruption where is justice and integrity to be found the love of power is without doubt very natural to us all and there are many temptations in the office of a censor to justify the desire of attaining to it but to pursue this ambition through unwarrantable means is in my opinion no less absurd than criminal because it defeats the very purpose we have in view and at once disqualifies us for the employment we affect it is a violence to my nature to act any thing that is rigid and severe but i very much question whether i shall not be shortly obliged to do exemplary justice on the aforementioned account i have now under consideration a great number of complaints from several parts of the kingdom which in due time shall be laid before the public as for those gentlemen who have been duly elected to so weighty a post i shall always treat them with a regard due to their character and as the following remonstrance came first to my hands it does of course claim precedence of all others  fatland febr   honored sir your order dated the   th of january came to hand the   th of the same month and within the time by you limited the churchwardens and sidesmen of this our parish of fatland repaired to the vestry thereunto belonging and having debated for the space of three quarters of an hour without eating or drinking all that time they did then and there choose elect and nominate me john heart gent to act in full power and authority as rural censor of the said parish and did notify the same to me by jeremiah solfa clerk of the said parish who by order of the said church wardens and sidesmen having first washed his hands and face attended me to the vestry in form and manner by them prescribed where being introduced and the door shut they did unanimously vote pronounce and declare me the said john heart to be from and after the time then being rural censor for the said parish of fatland and accordingly entered this their act and deed in a book provided for that purpose  i am very sensible honored sir how unworthy i am to represent so great a man as your self in so high a station having little more to brag of than the honesty of my intentions and a hearty desire to be serviceable to my country i will be bold to say that no body shall outdo me in those points whatever they may in some others since i have come into employment it has been my whole business to observe and remark carefully the behavior of my fellow parishioners which is for the most part as i could wish i was always well esteemed among them but upon this preferment i am in a manner worshipped i have already been invited to two christenings and several junketings which i hope will be no reflection upon my character having heard that you your self sir will take a chirping cup upon occasion i shall endeavor to imitate you in all things though i am apt to think i shall hardly ever write so well as you do not but i have had some education and might by this time have been a pretty scholar if my father had not wanted me in the stables and for that reason taken me from school as i was saying sir i am mightily respected at present and very often dine with the best gentleman in the parish in whose family i have observed some matters which i think it my duty to acquaint you with his eldest daughter mrs susan and his second son mr bnaby who had before lived altogether in the country have been up at london three weeks of this winter and by the improvements they have made there are become a trouble to the whole neighborhood the young lady takes upon her to laugh at every thing and every body that comes in her way and is ever and anon twitting the good lady her mother with having never seen any thing of the world i believe if the truth were known she has invented fifty fooleries in her dress on purpose to bring em into fashion and in process of time make the whole county ridiculous the very heels of her shoes are laced her head not above an inch high she has stuff enough in her petticoat to cloth all her brothers and sisters and at the same time is naked her self half way down her back i observed the other day a little spoon in her snuff box and could not help asking her whether she hid it there upon a report we had lately about calling in the plate  the young gentleman is to the full as bad in his way his clothes are intolerably apish and fantastical and he will face us down that a thousand of the same make were seen on her majestys birthday he has brought down a set of new words to the great confusion of common conversation and pretends that he had them from the top wits of the age he talks of plays operas and assemblies as he calls em to every farmer he meets and instead of the queen and church makes all his fathers tenants toast the charming duchess of  upon their knees these and many other grievances of the same kind are in these young gentlefolks the effects of having seen the world which as in duty bound i humbly offer to your consideration and remain  honored sir your most

february    it is certain that most of our errors whether in conversation or conduct are owing to want of reflection and a right way of thinking the privilege of applying our faculties that way is the noblest distinction of our nature and of the last consequence to the regulation of our lives this i do not offer as a new observation but only as the general neglect of it and at the same time the importance of its being rightly understood make it necessary to be put often in our way whatever improvements or acquisitions we make without this foundation are but superficial and ornamental at best and will never support us through any figure or character in the world for which reason when the business of the day and the innocent entertainments of the evening are at an end i constantly set apart an hour at least to descend into my self to weigh and examine my past behavior and the principles i have acted upon the little leisure i thus steal from the public is returned to them by endeavoring to become more perfect in the several relations i bear to mankind  in this manner i was employing my thoughts some nights ago when going toward my window i heard a watchman in the street cry past twelve of the clock and a moonlight morning another who came just after him called the same hour and a cloudy morning he who had declared himself first thinking his veracity in question turned round in some anger and in a low sullen voice gave the other the lie words were multiplied upon it and blows followed i immediately threw up my sash and had authority enough to part them for my own part i looked upon it to be a very bright sky and therefore gave the fellow a reprimand that had pronounced it otherwise but when he assured me that at the very instant he did so a cloud was just coming over the moon the cause was puzzled and i did not know justly where to lay the blame however having made up the matter i pulled down my window and retired to bed before i fell asleep i could not help reflecting on the oddness of this dispute and to make it of some use to my self resolved i would never more engage in controversy with mr powell or any other person  soon after i happened to have some trial of my temper for amongst other letters i received that which follows from my old adversary mr powell  sir i presume you will be convinced by this that in attacking me you have ventured upon one who is something more than your match having lately had the honor to furnish the house in the haymarkes with half a dozen of my seas tacked together and a sail of weatherbeaten ships for the opera of et this i had never mentioned but that the persons concerned therein have had the assurance to make frequent use of four hundred yards and upwards of my old waves without so much as quoting me in the margin  your humble servant  powell   i could not but be much surprised at so extraordinary an account and doubting the truth of it went incognito the next night to the house where i found my correspondent had but too good grounds for triumphing over me in the manner he had done  after being heartily tired with the first act i had leisure to consider the extraordinary reception of these foreign entertainments and the discouragement of our own music i could no otherwise account for it than by having recourse to a certain journal that had a little before fallen into my hands in which i find that on the first of november last the house of ladies came to this resolution resolved that mr waller never writ a good song that mr clayton cannot set one no mrs tofts sing one  in this debate i am told they all spoke and all at once so it being impossible for them to know what each other said i could never learn the reasons that induced that honorable house to pass so cruel a vote two are chiefly alleged without doors to justify this severity the first is that our language is so uncooth as not to be endured and calculated only for acts of parliament the gentleman that made this objection appeared at my court yesterday where being tried for slander after having made a smooth defense in the english tongue he was found guilty and sentenced to speak no other words than otway and waller for the space of nine days as likewise to translate the mira of mr g   into high dutch  the second reason which is the want of performers has been pressed to me with all assurance of success but the persons who presumed so far upon a very solemn trial were found guilty also by a very fair jury sentenced to beg mrs toftss and mr leveridges pardon upon their knees and fined one thousand pound each for the use of the queen of cyprus whose treasures are exhausted and her territories invaded i who am advanced in years and have neither leisure nor application for the attainment of a language i as yet know little of have more than ordinary reason to be apprehensive of its encroaching too far upon us should it universally prevail i am in a manner debarred the commerce of mankind and my lucubrations of course fall to the ground i could wish it were further considered how great sufferers a considerable part of my fellow subjects would be if we took away only the use of a few words and whether any that can be substituted in their stead would make amends for the loss as for instance you deprive the lover of angel goddess cupid charms darts flames fire sigh die it is plain he is undone for ever take from the critic delicacy of thought turn of words propriety of speech diction image genius sublime the peevish man will have very little left rob the politician of balance of power limited monarchy hereditary right church state ministry most of the coffeehouses would break and even that of st jamess be very thin  after all i am credibly informed by some of the royal society that there is something in the formation of a tramontane ear that will not suffer it to relish the softness of italian airs and further that sound it self at so many degrees northward was never known to come to perfect maturity only that of drums trumpets hautboys and here and there as much of the vocal as will serve to keep a private family in order being of our own growth and agreeing tolerably well with the climate  for my sentiments of music in general fitly introduced and in its proper circumstances i leave them to be expressed by shakespeare wanting words of my own for that occasion  antonio in the jew of venice speaks thus to bassanio o bassanio there sits a heaviness upon my heart which wine cannot remove i know not but music ever makes me thus  bass the reason is your spirits are attenti for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of skittish and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud if they but hear by chance some trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you strait perceive em make a mutual stand their savage eyes turned to attentive gaze by the soft power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus melted stones and rocks for what so hard so stubborn or so fierce but music for the time will change its nature the man who has not music in his soul or is not touched with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasous stratagems and spoils the motions of his mind are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted     n b mr bickerstaff does not by this paper  to interest himself

any thing in them of what the world calls good sense they turn it wholly to the getting of money they have but that one point in view and consequently overlook all either difficult or indirect ways which lead to it  if they attain their end and become rich toward their middle age before they decline in years and decay in strength and that their appetite of getting is not yet turned into an avarice of hoarding if they have any fire remaining they commonly feel themselves warmed with a kind of ambition of being somebody as well as something they find a want of that respect which they observe to be paid to such who are called gentlemen and persons of condition though of small fortunes they would give any consideration to be of an honorable descent and alter the spelling of their names to bring them on as near as possible to some name or seat of antiquity if that cannot be brought about they push for a knighthood or an alliance with some family of name or title whose follies or misfortunes have reduced them to match themselves or children to money however basely lodged or infamously obtained  i fell into this reflection after a visit made me some days since by one whom i remember to have known a linkboy and who has often lighted me formerly from the greendragon in fleet street to my lodgings in sheerlane we used to call him foundling a name given him by his godfather the parish and which he has not yet been able to part with or vary though he has found the secret to be worth very near what they call a plumb and upon change has obtained the appellation of a good man he came to me with much frankness owning both his past and present circumstances but what made me smile was the request he made me to accompany him to a house in our row where lives one randall as he called him a creature merchant this person is a great virtuoso and deals in birds and beasts though not either as a butcher or poulterer for he nourishes nothing that is eatable nor ever utters any commodity but while it is alive  as we walked toward this virtuosos habitation which i may call an abridgment of the ark my friend foundling told me he had purchased a fair seat in the country that he had a mind to appear well in the world and since he had a gentlemans estate he would endeavor to have every thing suitable to it that he had bargained already with the heralds college for a coat of arms and that his present errand to randalls was from among his variety of animals to fancy himself a crest in which he mightily desired my assistance and approbation i was delighted with the folly and frankness of the man but it happened he saw nothing that pleased him as we returned i advised him to an honest homebred crest out of his own farmers yard which was a cocks head untrimd with the gills and comb entire this he approved and took his leave i was about to reflect on what had passed when suddenly returning he called to me and coming nearer told me he would let me into all his project and desired i would step with him to a watermans house hard by where he had lodged a set of ancestors which were to go up next tide to his seat upon the river he desired my judgment of the choice he had made of three generations to furnish his parlor i went with him not readily comprehending what he meant till we entered the house where he explained to me that at fleetditch he had bought the pictures of three men and three women which were suited well enough to each other and were to personate his family up to his greatgrandfather and greatgrandmother which he thought was pretending far enough for one who was in truth related to no body that he knew of in the world as i was extremely diverted with the oddness and extravagance of the mans fancy i was no less satisfied with his judgment in the choice of the pictures the habits and dispositions of the figures being suited to three different periods and fashions of time and concluding or rather beginning in the greatgrandfather and greatgrandmother with a pair of trunkhose a ruff and a farthingale i pleased him with my approbation and took leave of him entertaining my self often since with the reflections which naturally arise from the contemplation of vanity wealth and titular happiness i have since heard there is a marriage likely to be concluded betwixt his daughter mrs priscilla foundling and the

my self to the company at the long table i could not but be surpised to find serus who has himself an admirable taste learning and a good insight into politic surrounded with a set of vain and empty ptenders to both amongst the rest i took pticular notice of one whom i had formerly  his proper capacity made honorable mention of it is true he affected little of the stateman but in all matters relating to poetry seemed to consider himself as the ultimate judg and with great volubility of speech dictated  all about him he had a perfect command  that critical cant i mentioned in my last  applied it in a very magisterial manner to several passages of shakespeare johnson and dryden i sat some time at the table before  offered to take any notice of me and he did  at last with such an air of superiority as  he imagined his name had done honor to  paper instead of receiving any from it or  f it had been a piece of condescension in one f his figure to own an acquaintance with the censor of great britain from his usage of me he gave e a fair occasion of calling him side and telling him of what other faults i ad observed in his behavior  sir says i it is a real grief to me to find that

this excellent piec very masterly strokes of ridicule upon all occasions but as it was calculated for a people in point of gallantry the most romantic in the world the passion of love under all the fantastical forms and dresses it wore in that age and nation is severely treated and inimitably exposed throughout the whole  a work of this nature was no less necessary to the spaniard than it afterward proved successful and whoever will be at the pains of entering into the humor that reigned among them cannot fail of being infinitely entertained with so fine a satyr upon it but a reader merely english who never took it in his head to buckle on a helmet or mount a palfrey for the fair to encounter giants besiege moated astles or rescue imprisoned damsels from chantment nor yet has any

example and indeed the occasion of it very extraordinary it is now three years and upwards since two young gentlemen of birth and fortune who had lived together in the strictest friendship became rivals on her account both so equally merited her esteem that for some time she knew not on which to bestow her love the one was of an open behavior warm in his pretensions but not over constant in his application the other close assiduous and importunate however it happened she was at last determined in favor of the latter and with a heart never before engaged in an affair of this kind gave at once into all the softnesses and indearments of it polydor if i may so call the neglected lover now found himself but coldly received yet with an unexpected evenness of temper continued still to visit my sister upon the foot of a friend a platonic or what else she would please to call him in the mean time the father of castalio his rival had some intimation given him of his intrigue and that he intended to marry fidelia whose fortune though better than six thousand pounds was by no means answerable to what he proposed for his son without taking any further notice he sent for him and having a

vows to each other two years almost past before any thing was heard of him then came the news of his death confirmed by so many hands and such particular circumstances that there was no room to doubt the truth of it polydor all this while had gone on in the same road of an innocent acquaintance with my sister and as she ever preserved a good respect for him now under her affliction she found the use of his friendship who could so properly condole with her the loss of castalio as the man who had loved him beyond his own quiet and happiness to whom could she so freely communicate her grief as to one who knew her weakness and had long since forgiven her the cruelest effects of it thus sir by mingling their sorrows they fell insensibly into a tenderness for each other his flame revived with greater violence than ever and she on a sudden wondered at the progress she had made before she well knew where she was considering her self as a kind of widow she resolved to continue such till a twelvemonth was expired she did so and having appointed thursday last for her wedding day just as she was going out she was met by castalio at the door in the midst of joy and confusion she flew to him and fainted in his arms what measures good mr bickerstaff can be taken in this affair polydor raves like a madman walks the streets with his sword drawn and in case he is disappointed threatens destruction to all about him castalio bewails fidelia and himself commiserates his friend and upbraids his father that had intercepted his letters and purchased of several irish men the report of his death but my sister  she alas is lost to all reason and if she were not the truth is i have none to offer upon this emergency instruct me dear sir but to mitigate her afflictions and you shall find me from that moment a more cheerful correspondent and upon all occasions  your most obedient most humble servant fidelio   the case of fidelia as well as that of the pretenders to her is indeed very deplorable and the more so because having carefully perused the records belonging to the court of honor i cannot from thence inform my self how to proceed or in whom to vest the right of her person however if necessary a special verdict may be had without much trouble or expense in the mean time to speak upon it in an extrajudicial way if the lady happens to be of the romish persuasion i advise her to a nunnery if not and she be qualified as her brother has represented i know a certain old gentleman who will be well enough pleased to take her off with all her misfortunes and infirmities about her by having frequent opportunities of instilling the precepts of philosophy he may in time alleviate her disquiets at least under the protection of such a one she may as many others do enjoy

though not as a principal remedy may yet as a succedaneum prove effectual to his recovery a method very familiar to us in our practice of physic and who knows but the old clothes and tarnished habiliments together with the cast airs and secondhand simagreex of the original beauty may have a virtue in them like that said to have been in achilles spear the rust of which never failed to heal

i was yesterday with my spectacles on cutting out for him the figures of kings milkmaids trees and the like in paper we happened to be in warm debate upon some important circumstance in our business

till he was gone and young master and my self had resumed our entertainment having a king to finish who wanted only his crown and a pair of hands i have since reflected with some contempt on those who think that wisdom consists in a constant tenor of gravity and that they can never put off their seriousness without breaking into their character how ill judges such people are of humane nature may be determined not only from the opinions of poets and philosophers but from the practice of the wisest and greatest men socrates who i think may be reckoned in the first rank of mankind was at fourscore taken by some of his scholars in the fact whistling and dancing by himself scipio and laelius used to amuse themselves with gathering shells on the seashore and augustus to play at cobnut with some favorite boys  as all exercise whether of body or mind requires some relaxation so we may observe a sort of analogy or agreement between mens several employments and the amusements they fall into thus the labourer after the toil of the day refreshes himself in the evening with wrestling dancing or flinging the bar the dull plodders in business as soon as they are disingaged from it fall insensibly asleep or doze over a pint men of great genius naturally fall into these trifles which at the same time that they give ease and respite to the faculties serve to enliven in some degree and keep them in a gentle motion this i take to have been the ease of those great men whose examples i have produced and i am so far gone in this opinion that i believe every person understands the art of trifling agreeably in proportion to his share of wit and good sense those who are defective in either being as incapable of doing it themselves as of relishing it in others the only inconvenience is when men in great or grave stations are not cautious enough to distinguish before whom they give themselves a liberty this way  will moody amongst many others has furnished me with this observation after much formal advice against doing things unsuitable to my age and telling me how much it would have reflected upon me if any but a friend had come in he added that he was mightily shocked some time ago by a person of reputation for learning and virtue that had entertained him for half an hour together with the particularities of a puppetshow which he carried his little grandson to see the night before the truth is such sow and grovelling spirits as these have some reason for their censure who possessing no good qualities able to gain or to raise esteem should not presume to act a part that would serve only to make em ridiculous a man who hopes to establish his character and fortune by the solemnity of his countenance would be in the wrong to part with it upon every slight occasion should he once deviate from the road he is in he knows not where it might end nor how to recover his mistake even a smile might be of dangerous consequence and therefore he arms himself with an impregnable gravity against all the fooleries and gaieties that may happen in his way  democritulus is equally a coxcomb though of a very different mould he laughs for laughings sake in the wrong place and is a trifler upon all occasions in pursuit of this humor he regards neither time person nor circumstance but lays about him without distinction and is a kind of drawcansir in conversation his nearest acquaintance and their tenderest concerns are the subjects of his wit and ridicule and he seems to value himself for nothing more than for having got the better of modesty good manners and humanity how an inclination to raillery may betray one into offenses of this kind i must produce my self as an instance and as the following letter has awakened in me a sense of my error my willingness to insert it here will i hope in some measure atone for it  mr bickerstaff as i take it all vices are altered by their circumstances and more or less affect the multitude in proportion to the character of the person that commits them this consideration obliges me though with all due respect and humble submission to the authority of the censor of great britain unwillingly to charge isaac bickerstaff esquire with ridiculing the misfortunes of those who were properly the objects of his care and compassion twas with the greatest satisfaction i read fidelias letter and the introduction to it in your tatler of the   d the case of that unhappy fair is so moving in it self and so well described and her brother so earnestly and passionately entreats your assistance that i cannot without indignation reflect on your barbarous insults under the cover of your court of honor and a nunnery but what is yet infinitely worse to aggravate her deplorable condition by tendering your flannel corpse to supply the place of her beloved castalio or the unfortunately successful polydor is inhumanity and the result of detestable avarice the darling vice of an old man who for a prospect of  000 l can forget those many good instructions a certain author used to abound in especially relating to the choice of companions for life and the government of our prevailing passions example and precept are the best comments on each other and he that acts inconsistently seems not in the least to be affected with what he says mr bickerstaff your lucubrations tell me you understand humane nature too well to think that an old man or philosophical precepts will either raise or alleviate the misfortunes of a young lady especially under fidelias circumstances therefore to be consonant with your self which you know is a prime excellency you are obliged either to vindicate your proceedings or make a public acknowledgment of your mistake according to the consequence of which i shall continue or cease to be  sir your admirer and humble servant   from the excessive tenderness i have for the fair sex i was inclined to hope that the distress of fidelia was not real else i had applied thy self to the

bestowed suitable advice upon them and to the best of my power improved both their morals and understanding by this means they have gradually commenced humble companions and served to amuse me with a kind of low conversation at the same time that they were doing the little necessary offices about my person my maid who is now turned of fifty is of singular use in this way as she is warming my bed she tells me a hundred stories of spirits without heads black dogs and several kinds of apparitions that have for sarten been seen in the parish where she was born in a morning when she brings me my candle she acquaints me how the world goes and entertains me with her simple remarks on the most considerable men and most important affairs in it this is making the most of her capacity but pacolet my other servant was a much greater genius and adorned with many excellent qualities the high station of premiere ministre to the censor of great britain  as the public has been frequently obliged to his intelligence for the detection of several secret enormities i cannot think it improper to give some account of him here of his absence for six months past and his late return to these parts about the latter end of august last he came to me and after talking over some affairs i had employed him in he told me in short he was grown weary of acting altogether within the narrow limits of this kingdom that if i would please to allow him a salary and send him abroad with a character he would in a short time visit all the courts of europe and bring from thence many secrets and curiosities worthy of my knowledge and acceptance my correspondents being numerous and the accounts they sent me very faithful and material i could the better spare pacolet at that time accordingly mr lilly prepared his credentials in which he was styled legate a latere from isaac bickerstaff esquire astrologer student in physic and censor of the kingdom of great britain he set out soon after and having made the promised tour with an expedition peculiar to his way of traveling he arrived again at sheerlane from whence he was directed to channelrow the   d instant i received him with much pleasure together with the many presents letters etc he brought me from connoisseurs great princes and writers of almanacks i find by him that my predictions first introduced me to their knowledge and laid a foundation for the fame of my succeeding lucubrations he was it seems particularly well received in the north the contending powers in those parts alternately persuading him to declare in my name for their interest which he prudently declined alleging for his excuse that he had particular instructions from the censor his master not to meddle in those affairs amongst other things he produced from his portmanteau two large folios each of which he told me contained an account of his travels the same in substance but differing in style and the manner of writing he added that which i approved should have the preference and shortly be made ready for the press in the first place therefore he read as follows  august       0 this morning having taken leave of my master i mounted my flyinghorse at the lower end of sheerlane and without observing much the roads i passed over soon arrived at amsterdam i baited there at the cat and fiddle and after kissing my lanladys daughter in the cellar proceeded on my journey to the court of vienna which i reached about noon the same day very well pacolet says i ah sir replies he this is but a plain narration  then taking up the other volume he begun thus the vehemence of the summer solstice was now much abated when invited by the agreeable temperature of the charming season i resolved to make an excursion into remote climates accordingly having by long premeditation determined the time of my departure i applied my self to that illustrious person i have the honor of appertaining unto and having obtained a gentle indulgence for my intended peregrination i gave orders for my winged palfrey to be brought to the extremity of sheerlane where amongst other noble pieces of architecture which salute the wondering eye that vulgarly distinguished by the denomination of temple bar is by no means inferior to any round about it it consists of a noble arch through which as through a mighty channel gay gilded chariots obsolete coaches and rumbling draycarts are backwards and forwards incessantly disembogued whilst on either side of it footpassengers like silent streams glide smoothly on and divide themselves afterward into numberless rivulets through all parts of the metropolis  here i started up in some disorder and snatching the book out of his hand told him he should never more see my face if he did not that moment go his ways and sleep till he had recovered his understanding after he had left me i could not forbear running my eye along the margin of his manuscript which pointed out some of the contents in the following order  a description of autumn another of temple bar strange and pleasant fancies moral reflections love affairs should be kept secret a kissing custom revenge no new passion a proof from

old haunts but in vain i was doomed to pass the night with all the pangs that tortured love and jealousy could inflict i write this in my bed  it is scarce light i cannot defer chiding my soft tender

sighed and muttered over your dear name i punished my self in this company till twelve  clock and then came home where the only pleasure i had was wrapping my sel in the cherrycolourd gown which has s

fall short of it but nothing  effectually defeats us in this pursuit than  wrong estimate of our selves either in point f the good qualities we pretend to or of the tuation in life that fortune has assigned us  want of due attention to either of these circumstances will unavoidably betray us into requent miscarriages in our conduct somees lay us open to envy at others to conempt and in the end eclipse even that merit  are really masters of from this considetion when i was a very young fellow hower desirous i might be of being distinguished  the world i kept a strict guard upon my anity resolved to content my self with pasng through the ordinary forms and methods f rising into repute and at due distance of time took my several degrees in conversation at first setting out it was my constant rule to pay a deference to as many as had any pretense to it to smile modestly when they were pleased to be facetious and often stand their raillery without offering to return it it was not without some difficulty that i got this mastery of my self in spite of which toward the latter end of an evening i now and then made an imprudent sally and endeavored to be as sprightly as my betters but as it happened i never said a good thing over night that was invidiously remembered the next morning the truth is the smallness of my fortune laid some restraint upon my genius i seldom rightly enjoyed my self till the reckoning was paid and by this means my gaiety begun when that of other people was at an end at length by an habitual dullness and other innocent arts in my behavior i worked my self into the esteem of my acquaintance and in something more than four years was allowed to be one of the company then it was that i began to exert my talents and by assuming every day more and more at length established an indisputable authority in the world though the impatience and fire of youth may suggest otherwise these are certainly the steps that lead safely to consummate greatness in whatever form or profession we aspire after it  i am indeed of opinion that some years of our lives are in a manner thrown away and lost by means of a wrong education which nothing has more effectually convinced me of than the great and early improvements that my friend sam trustys nephew mentioned in one of my former papers has made under the particular care and direction of his uncle but till the same method can be brought into general practice we must even take the world as we find it we must submit to the rules universally received and instead of weighing our own merits abstractedly consider them as they are placed in relation to and dependence upon those about us amongst other gradations necessary to be observed in life there is one which for the benefit of those who come strangers to this city i cannot but take notice of that of coffeehouses i mean the violation of which may otherwise lead them into many inconveniences and indecorums the following letter which came to hand this evening has partly occasioned this reection  to isaac bickerstaff esquire friday morning sir i came to town with my sister last night by the reading coach and having both of us a great longing to see colonel  who quartered formerly at my fathers house we prevailed upon the coachman to drive directly to whites chocolatehouse in st jamess street which was the place he told us to enquire at for him if ever we came to london we both alighted and went in it is true i was somewhat ashamed to see so much fine company and the more so because my sister who is always sick in a coach had but a little before pewkd upon my clothes however the place i suppose is free for any body and for all their silver and gold lace perhaps i had as much money in my pocket as the best of em they were civil enough to her that is true but they all laughed out at me and an ugly lame rogue there was ready to shove me out at the door and told me i was mistaken in the house if you think this to be good manners i have no more to say if not i dont see why you should not take notice of it you have put foolisher things in your paper but whether you do or no i am resolved i will go thither every day whilst i am in town and show em that i am not so much a put but that i can say bo to a goose  w l   there seems to be a true english spirit in the resentment of my correspondent but if i might advise he should let this matter rest for the present in less than three winters i will undertake he shall be able to look the enemy in the face provided he lives regular and takes the measures i prescribe there is scarce any part of the town so destitute where he may not find out a little coffeehouse to drink a cup of sage in every morning and peruse the tatler as often as it comes out here i confine him for two months if in that time he can compass to have a place kept for him by the fire to talk without being contradicted and to read my paper to the company he shall then by virtue of a pass from charles lilly be allowed the liberty of the rainbow near temple bar there to continue till the booksellers thereabouts have found him out for a wit and employed him in some libel against the late or present ministry he will of course pass afterward to the grecian and may if he thinks fit call in at toms in devereuxcourt it will by this time be proper that he should make himself a new suit of clothes i could wish they might not be too gay which will by no means become a person whom i am conducting through the world according to the best calculation i can make he will by december the   th anno domini      arrive at wills where if he is capable of further improvement he may soon furnish himself with good sense politics and good manners enough to carry him through the rest of his journey and set him upon an equal foot with the inhabitants of st jamess coffeehouse whites or the cocoatree  n b if mr w l will please to acquaint the censor where he may be spoken with charles lilly to prevent his being imposed on shall be ordered to wait on him with a table containing the several prices of warm liquors in an about this town together with the variations of the said prices

from saturday mar   to tuesday mar      0 from my own apartment in channelrow march   those inferior duties of life which the french call les petite morale or the smaller morals are with us distinguished by the name of good manners or breeding this i look upon in the general notion of it to be a sort of artificial good sense adapted to the meanest capacities and introduced to make mankind easy in their commerce with each other low and little understandings without some rules of this kind would be perpetually wandering into a thousand indecencies and irregularities in behavior and in their ordinary conversation fall into the same boisterous familiarities that one observes amongst them when a debauch has quite taken away the use of their reason in other instances it is odd to consider that for want of common discretion the very end of good breeding is wholly perverted and civility intended to make us easy is employed in laying chains and fetters upon us in debarring us of our wishes and in crossing our most reasonable desires and inclinations this abuse reigns chiefly in the country as i found to my vexation when i was last there in a visit i made to a neighbor about two miles from my cousin as soon as i entered the parlour they forced me into the great chair that stood close by a huge fire and kept me there by force till i was almost stifled then a boy came in great hurry to pull off my boots which i in vain opposed urging that i must return soon after dinner in the mean time the good lady whispered her eldest daughter and slipped a key into her hand she returned instantly with a beer glass half full of aqua mirabilis and syrrup of gillyflowers i took as much as i had a mind for but madam vowed i should drink it off for she was sure it would do me good after coming out of the cold air and i was forced to obey which absolutely took away my stomach when dinner came in i had a mind to sit at a distance from the fire but they told me it was as much as my life was worth and set me with my back just against it though my appetite was quite gone i resolved to force down as much as i could and desired the leg of a pullet indeed mr bickerstaff says the lady you must eat a wing to oblige me and so put a couple upon my plate i was persecuted at this rate during the whole meal as often as i called for small beer the master tipped the wink and the servant brought me a brimmer of october some time after dinner i ordered my cousins man who came with me to get ready the horses but it was resolved i should not stir that night and when i seemed pretty much bent upon going they ordered the stable door to be locked and the children hid away my cloak and boots the next question was what i would have  supper i said i never eat any thing at nigh but was at last in my own defense obliged t name the first thing that came into my head after three hours spent chiefly in apology for my entertainment insinuating to me tha this was the worst time of the year for provisions that they were at a great distance from any market that they were afraid i should be starved and they knew they kept me to my loss the lady went and left me to her husband for they took special care i should never be alone as soon as her back was turned the little misses ran backwards and forwards every moment and constantly as they came in or went out made a courtefie directly at me which in good manners i was forced to return with a bow and your humble servant pretty miss exactly at eight the mother came up and discovered by the redness of her face that supper was not far off it was twice as large as the dinner and my persecution doubled in proportion i desired at my usual hour to go to my repose and was conducted to my chamber by the gentleman his lady and the whole train of children they importuned me to drink something before i went to bed and upon my refusing at last left a bottle of stingo as they called it for fear i should wake and be thirsty in the night i was forced in the morning to rise and dress my self in the dark because they would not suffer my kinsmans servant to disturb me at the hour i had desired to be called i was now resolved to break through all measures to get away and after sitting down to a monstrous breakfast of cold beef mutton neats tongues venison pasty and stale beer took leave of the family but the gentleman would needs see me part of my way and carry me a short cut through his own grounds which he told me would save half a miles riding this last piece of civility had like to have cost me dear being once or twice in danger of my neck by leaping over his ditches and at last forced to alight in the dirt when my horse having slipped his bridle ran away and took us up more than an hour to recover him again  it is evident that none of the absurdities i met with in this visit proceeded from an ill intention but from a wrong judgment of complaisance and a misapplication of the rules of it i cannot so easily excuse the more refined critics upon behavior who having professed no other study are yet infinitely defective in the most material parts of it ne fashion has been bred all his life about court and understands to a tittle all the punctilios of a drawing room he visits most of the fine women near st jamess and upon all occasions says the civilest and softest things to them of any man breathing to mr isaac he owes an easy slide in his bow and a graceful manner of coming into a room but in some other cases he is very far from being a wellbred person he laughs at men of far superior understanding to his own for not being as well dressed as himself despises all his acquaintance that are not quality and in public places has on that account often avoided taking notice of some of the best speakers in the house of commons he rails strenuously at both universities before the members of either and never is heard to swear an oath or break in upon morality or religion but in the company of divines on the other hand a man of right sense has all the essentials of good breeding though he may be wanting in the forms of it horatio has spent most of his time at oxford he has a great deal of learning an agreeable wit and as much modesty as serves to adorn without concealing his other good qualities in that retired way of living he seems to have formed a notion of humane nature as he has found it described in the writings of the greatest men not as he is like to meet with it in the common course of life hence it is that he gives no offense that he converses with great deference candor and humanity his bow i must confess is somewhat awkward but then he has an extensive universal and unaffected knowledge which makes some amends for it he would make no extraordinary figure at a ball but i can assure the ladies in his behalf and for their own consolation that he has writ better verses on the sex than any man now living and is preparing such a poem for the press as will transmit their

the rank and quality of those who fall under my observation for this reason i can never suffer a coronet to pass me without enquiring whom it belongs to and whether it be worn in a manner suitable to so honorable a distinction i can say with a great deal of truth that i am commonly answered to my satisfaction when it happens otherwise i carry my enquiry yet further and inform my self with the greatest exactness imaginable whether the misfortune of complexion or that of education has chiefly contributed to eclipse the luster and defeat the advantages of a high and noble descent many failures i find chargeable on the former but they are not so numerous nor of so dangerous a nature as those which result from the latter being only such tendencies of the mind as by early care and proper application might have been cultivated and improved into useful and generous qualifications it is therefore of the last importance as well to the future happiness of our young nobility as to that of a nation in great measure depending on them that their genius should be nicely observed their capacity improved and a right turn given to their understanding to effect this i have sometimes had it in my head to write a treatise with directions to tutors or governors in the discharge of so weighty an employment but being credibly informed that they were a sort of people who had little opinion of any bodys wisdom but their own i was discouraged from that undertaking and obliged to pursue other measures i have within this twelvemonth made a coffeehouse acquaintance with as many of them as i could and now and then over a dish of tea enquired into the schemes and methods they have laid down for the management of their pupils the first i happened upon is a grave sober and discreet person turned of fifty his countenance somewhat formidable and his conversation extremely rigid and severe he has by some means or other seen the outsides of most of the courts in europe and got a smattering in the languages but having no taste of polite learning nor any insight into humane nature he is much better qualified to wait in an anteroom or keep the accounts of the family he belongs to than to conduct the hopes of it into the world he has often told me with great pride and satisfaction that he has his young lord in as much subjection as a footboy that he of course denies him every thing he has a mind to and that in the midst of his diversion he can make him tremble with a frown such is the love of tyranny in mean and narrow spirits even in the lowest circumstance of power another of them sets up for a fine gentleman and is a pedant in taking pains to be otherwise he has a notion that letters are but a poor accomplishment for a man of quality that a good air and being furiously of a party are sufficient distinctions for one that is born to many others and therefore indulges the youth under his care in an immoderate love of dogs horses plays gallantry and all manner of entertainments at leisure hours he flatters him with an opinion of his superiority to the common level of mankind and strictly cautions him against entertaining the least regard for the scum and dregs of the people what a patriot hero and counselor may we hope for from so extraordinary an education a third whom i suffer indeed to visit me now and then seems to have a better sense of his duty in this station than either of the others knowing that i am a great lover of children he one day brought his pupil who is very young to my lodgings he had long promised him i found that he would carry him to wait upon mr bickerstaff and i do not remember that i was ever so well pleased with being pointed at in public as i was with the particular survey this little boy took of me after this curiosity was pretty well over he seemed willing to enter into conversation in which he acquitted himself with the utmost good manners and a manly turn of wit very disproportioned to his years i could perceive he had a great mind to be talking of the tatlers and i on purpose led him into it he made some very surprising remarks upon several of them and with an agreeable freedom asked me the meaning of others that he did not understand i begged his little lordship to accept of the volumes i had by me and in return he desired my leave to be a subscriber for the next ever now and then i had my eye upon his tutor and could perceive in him an inexpressible pleasure for the good behavior of his charge  i could not help taking him aside soon after and telling him that i almost envied him the happiness of having so fine a genius in his hands go on sir says i to cultivate and improve it and by that means be an instrument of public good to your country you will never perhaps have it in your power to act in a more meritorious capacity think only what a pleasure it will be to you to see this young gentleman hereafter at the head of an army or managing a debate in the most illustrious assembly in the world believe me you will in a great measure partake his glory and act as it were by proxy in whatever station his merit shall advance him to if i can form any judgment of him at these years you will from his future gratitude and esteem receive the fruits of the utmost pains you can bestow upon him he will consider you almost in the highest relation and next to the persons that gave

the party staying somewhat beyond the time sam trusty would needs have me go with him into the kitchen and see how matters went there i would have excused my self fearing lest the heat of the place and the steam of the several dishes should have taken away my stomach but he assured me that mr brawn had an art beyond other cooks of making his customers more hungry by the sight of his kitchen i was indeed very much pleased and surprised with the extraordinary splendour and economy i observed there but above all with the great readiness and dexterity of the man himself his motions were quick but not preeipitate he in an instant applied himself from one stove to another without the least appearance of a hurry and in the midst of smoke and fire preserved an incredible serenity of countenance by thi time the doctor was come and made a thousand apologies for being so late he assure us by the great powers above that nothin should have kept him but the extreme dange of two or three of his patients we easil believed him knowing his uncommon tederness for those under his care and  the same time the multiplicity of his prctice without the least affectation to make  show of it

looking over his bills as he writ them which he did with wonderful quickness an seeming inadvertency entertaining us all the while with an incoherent but agreeable coversation notwithstanding the great numbe of distempers the infinite variety of their symptoms and the ignorance of those who represented them he entered into them all with an incredible penetration and without omitting one drug

very cautious for the future how i bestow any commendations on this or that particular player since i find by experience they have not judgment enough to support the weight of them one whom i owed to be an admirable buffoon having on that foot set up for a critic and anor from being encouraged by me to attempt e part of othello having ever since considered mself and very lately acted in the

that violent exercise natually ceases the poor man is mighty sensible of the condition he has been in and is so far from being proud of the spleen that he is resolved to leave no lawful means untried to get rid of it he looks very ill indeed and i fear t will be next to impossible to effect a perfect cure since by the account he gives me it has run in the family for some time his father had this misfortune so very young that he was a kit when he was a mere stripling and afterward became in his riper age a very grave and worthy humdrum or bassviol in which capacity or rather case he served his country being at the same time a justice of the peace for several years and at last died in it of seven virtuous ladies that were his aunts six lived and died virginals however as art finds means according to the observation of the most ingenious author of the plaster for corns i told the doctor if he would apply himself to the famous aesculapius  should be very glad of joining with him in order to reestablish his health accordingly he went yesterday to wait upon him but i was very much surprised when upon his coming to me again in the evening i found he had not received the satisfaction we both expected from the assistance of so celebrated a physician  mr bickerstaff said he to me with a dejected countenance i have been to see my old friend aesculapius i found with him a young man whom i took at first to have been a patient for he looked sadly at his going out i heard the doctor say either forbear to use those powders or see my face no more ah old friend said he upon sight of me this extravagant boy will certainly undo me have i walked up so many pair of stairs to get a little money together to have this young fellow spend it at twopence a day for powder for his hair come sit down let me know what it is brings you to town i told him my case in as few words as i could to which he answered with a melancholy look that he was not at all surprised at it since he was but too sensible of his having formerly been a football himself and to let me know what strange impressions the mind of man is capable of he assured me that a certain gentleman in this town me long ago took his face for a spitting pot i was no less startled at what he said than at what i afterward observed we were no sooner seated but looking on his watch he started up again and cried adso we must think of dinner then stepping into the next room he fetched from thence a string having fastened one end of it to a nail over his chimney he tied a leg of mutton to the other and giving it a twirl began a long complaint of the melancholy circumstances he found himself in he told me every body thought him vastly rich but they did not know what the expenses of life were then giving his mutton another twirl it is true says he i have fourscore thousand pounds in the funds but if a man did not take care to dress hit  dinner he might be poisoned for all that so desiring me to reach him the flowerbox doctor says he what do you think gilding a chariot might stand me in sir said i what need you trouble your self about that all the world knows  all the world may know what they please replied he but you will see me want before i die however says he i think it would do no harm if we had a drippingpan now pray give the box a shake doctor whilst i step and fetch it you must not take

dignity and distinction of men of wit is seldom enough considered either by themselves or others their own behavior and the usage they meet with being generally very much of a piece i have at this time in my hands an alphabetical list of the beaux esprits about this town four or five of whom have made the proper use of their genius by gaining the esteem of the best and greatest men and by turning it to their own advantage in some establishment of their fortunes however unequal to their merit others satisfying themselves with the honor of having access to great tables and of being subject to the call of every man of quality who upon occasion wants one to say witty things for the diversion of the company this treatment never moves my indignation so much as when it is practiced by a person who though he owes his own rise purely to the reputation of his part yet appears to be as much ashamed of it as  rich city knight to be denominated from t trade he was first apprenticed to and affec the air of a man born to his titles and consequently above the character of a wit or  scholar if those who possess great endowments of the mind would set a just value upon themselves they would think no mans acquaintance whatsoever a condescension no accept it from the greatest upon unworthy o ignominious terms i know a certain lord that has often invited a set of people and proposed for their diversion a buffoon player and an eminent poet to be of the party and which was yet worse thought them both sufficiently recompensed by the dinner and the honor of his company this kind of insolence is risen to such a height that i my self was the other day sent to by a man with a title whom i had never seen desiring the favor that i would dine with him and half a dozen of his select friends i found afterward the footman had told my maid below stairs that my lord having a mind to be merry had resolved right or wrong to send for honest isaac i was sufficiently provoked with the message however i gave the fellow no other answer than that i believed he had mistaken the person for i did not remember that his lord had ever been introduced to me i have reason to apprehend that this abuse has been owing rather to a meanness of spirit in men of parts than to the natural pride or ignorance of their patrons young students coming up to town from the places of their education are dazzled with the grandeur they every where meet and making too much haste to distinguish their parts instead of waiting to be desired and caressed are ready to pay their court at any rate to a great man whose name they have seen in a public paper or the frontispiece of a dedication it has not always been thus wit in polite ages has ever begot either esteem or fear the hopes of being celebrated or the dread of being stigmatized procured an universal respect and awe for the persons of such as were allowed to have the power of distributing fame or infamy where they pleased aretine had all the princes of europe his tributaries and when any of them had committed a folly that laid them open to his censure they were forced by some present extraordinary to compound for his silence of which there is a famous instance on record when charles the fifth had miscarried in his african expedition which was looked upon as the weakest undertaking of that great emperor he sent aretine a gold chain who made some difficulty of accepting it saying it was too small a present in all reason for so great a folly for my own part in this point i differ from him and never could be prevailed upon by any valuable consideration to conceal a fault or a folly since i first took the censorship upon me  having long considered with my self the ill application that some make of their talents i have this day

use at all of the said parts and understanding not to know the true value thereof who shall immediately be put out of possession and disqualified for ever the said kinsman giving sufficient security that he will employ them as the court shall direct i have set down under certain heads the several ways by which m prostitute and abuse their parts and from thence have framed a table of rules whereby the maintiff may be informed when he has a good title to eject the defendant i may in a following paper give the world some account of the proceedings of this court i have already got two able critics for my assessors upon the bench who though they have always exercised their pens in taking off from the wit of others have never pretended to challenge any themselves and consequently are in no danger of being engaged in making claims or of having any suits commence against them every writer shall be tried by his peers thoroughly versed in that point wherein he pretends to excel for which reason the jury can never consist of above half the ordinary number i shall in general be very tender how i put any person out of his wits but as the management of such possessions is of great consequence to

having lately in writing communicated the motives that induced him to erect so wise and necessary an institution no one sure can be so entirely a stranger to the world of literature as not to be sensible of the many abuses that have lately crept into it which unless a speedy and effectual remedy were applied would in process of time bring no small scandal on the most refined part of mankind

majestys footguards to deny many plain and undeniable consequences under pretense that the arguments were not brought in mood and figure and that he could not find in them either major minor or conclusion the plaintiff said he had brought the business into that court as having no other way of doing himself right on one that professed to be a mere scholar as for majors or minors why the gentleman should twit him with them he could not imagine that he had served and at that time had his commission for lieutenant colonel in his pocketthe court upon a fair hearing ordered mr wrangle to

his relations who had obtained a writ of captias against him they alleged that having a wife and large family which he might have maintained comfortably by his industry he being a very good clerk he had nevertheless given himself up wholly to the making of things with rhimes at the end of them which he called verses and that he was come to that pass at last that he frequently writ his orders and warrants in that way insomuch that the commissioners had threatened to turn him out which if it should happen would e to the utter ruin of himself and poor famiy therefore they prayed the assistance of the court he pretended to justify himself by saying that one genius by name had drawn him into it and quoted the examples of ovid and spencer that could not resist the instigation of poetry producing likewise some instances of rich poets still living mr snap took him up short and bad him not trifle with the bench telling him if they writ verses it was in their own coaches or when they had nothing else to do then sentence was passed upon him that he should be huskanawd and his penmanship put into the hands of his wife  she immediately took down the proceedings of the court in writing upon which he fell into a violent passion and such a torrent of words followed as plainly showed they had exchanged faculties with each other  then the court was adjourned till the first of april next which falling on easter day will be kept the monday following  from my own apartment in channelrow march    when this last sentence was brought to me for my confirmation i very readily approved of it and though i was aware that the term of huskanawing being a word unknown in any of the courts of westminster it might seem an hardship upon a people jealous of their rights and liberties to impose a new sort of punishment upon what has hitherto been scarce accounted a crime nevertheless out of the plenitude of my power and of my own mere motion and certain science i do ratify and confirm the said sentence but as i shall never extend the prerogative of censor of great britain to any unreasonable bounds nor use it at all but for the good of the people so for the quieting of their minds from any doubts which might arise concerning this new word i have thought it convenient to explain to them what it means  it is a custom amongst the westindians that border upon virginia for the priests of the country to elect a certain number of the hopefulest young men and of the best families to make the operation of huskanawing upon when they have gathered together thirty or forty of em they retire with them into the most inaccessible parts of the woods where they build a large stove in which they sweat the young men they keep em to a very strange diet and their drink is an odd composition of indian corn and juices of poisonous herbs which has such an effect upon them that they lose their hair their nails their skins and half of them their lives before the process be half over they that have strength enough to hold out till thirty days are brought home in great triumph and these are looked on as the top patriots of that country this seems to me to be a very wise institution and fit to be introduced in my own country for the sweatings diet drugs and drink which they have been used to quite renovate the men so that they come out without any remembrance of their parents country loves language or even of their own names these are their heroes these their counselors these their ambassadors these have the management of all their public

necessary a work walking the streets this morning i met a gentleman of my acquaintance who has the honor to serve his country in a very useful capacity oh mr bikerstaff says he you are luckily met i w your advice upon a very extraordinary occasion you may command me answered i to the best of my understanding but it is a rule with me neither to talk nor look wisely in the street please only to walk

was indeed surprised at my entrance to observe the eyes of the whole herd turned upon me a full stop put to their conversation and their dishes for some time suspended in midair at a little distance from their lips turning to the gentleman at the bar i asked in a soft tone for a dish of tea there is none made said he in a very surly manner  pray then will you help me to a dish of your coffee  you

then staring at me gave me to understand that i was looked upon as a spy or at least an intruder into select company one of them more bold than the rest seemed prepared to speak to me and collected himself in a resolute posture in order to it but his courage iling he sunk down into his chair again d suffered me to pass unmolested to a seat ext the chimney a surlylooking fellow who seemed to be one of those who do not care a farthing for any body sat opposite to me and fixing his eyes steadfastly upon me threw out three or four of his main principles in a breath expecting as i supposed either my dislike or approbation of them a young gentleman next him who i observed filled his pipe and reached the tobaccotongs for him assented with a smile to what he said and could not but wonder that any person should be so proposterous as to think otherwise or so insipid as to conceal his thoughts if he did  the calmness and invincible silence with which i received all this raillery had like to have brought me into some peril for in less than a quarter of an hour the whole fireside was up in a passion upon which i rose deliberately from my chair laid a couple of pence without noise upon the bar and stole out in the same state of neutrality that i came in i take it for granted if i had followed my friend to a coffeehouse of his choosing i should have met with the same treatment only softened a little perhaps by the lucky circumstance of being introduced by one of the same society  a humor so absurd needs not any animadversions follies of this stamp are too glaring in their own

my hand the title of the spectator which i had never before seen or heard of induced me to read it over in such a cursory manner as that kind of writing requires toward the end of the paper i found a letter subscribed c  l  after perusing it i could not without tears in my eyes consider the deplorable condition of this poor man the case of ned prattin salesman and that of this unfortunate perfumer bear some resemblance and i have but too much reason to fear will both terminate in the wretched circumstances of straw and a dark room whether it be owing to the great quantities of snuff he has taken or to pride of heart from the encouragement i formerly gave him it is certain that the latter has not for some time been right in his mind his unaccountable usage of me when i went last into the country was the first sally of his distemper which is now broke out into manifest phrenzy however unwilling i am to expose him in so public a manner i must hereby warn all persons whatsoever concerned about him not to trust a penknife in his hands nor any instrument wherewith he may do himself or others a mischief that his maid do every night take off his garters and remove them far out of his reach that he be not permitted to drink out of a glass lest he should eat it nor to feed on fish although it be lent lest he should industriously choke himself with the bones  i would by no means be

her person which being suited to the opinion we have of our own merit is commonly as beautiful and perfect as the most lavish imagination can furnish out strongly possessed with these notions i have read over sylvias billet and notwithstanding the reserve i have had upon this matter am resolved to go a much greater length than i yet ever did in making my self known to the world and in particular to my charming correspondent in order to it i must premise that the person produced as mine in the playhouse last winter did in no wise appertain to me it was such a one however as agreed well with the impression my writings had made and served the purpose i intended it for which was to continue the awe and reverence due to the character i was vested with and at the same time to let my enemies see how much i was the delight and favorite of this town this innocent imposture which i have all along taken care to carry on as it then was of some use has since been of singular service to me and by being mentioned in one of my papers effectually recovered my egoiety out of the hands of some gentlemen who endeavored to wrest it from me this is saying in short what i am not what i am and have been for many years is next to be explained here it will not be improper to remind sylvia that there was formerly such a losopher as pythagoras who amongst other ctrines taught the transmigration of souls ich if she sincerely believes she will not  much startled at the following relation  i will not trouble her nor my other rears with the particulars of all the lives i ve successively passed

veral ages i have been acquainted with that ave often rallied the world into good mans and kept the greatest princes in awe of y satyr there is one circumstance which i all not omit though it may seem to reflect on y character i mean that infinite love of hange which has ever appeared in the dispod of my existence since the days of the mperor trajan i have not been confined to the me person for twenty years together but ve passed from one abode to another much icker than the pythagorean system generally lows by this means i have seldom had a dy to my self but have lodged up and down herever

having mixed my self visibly with the literati of this kingdom i und it was unanimously agreed amongst em that no body was endowed with greater alents than hieres or consequently would be better pleased with my company i slip down his throat one night as he was fa asleep and the next morning as soon as  awaked he fell to writing a treatise that w received with great applause though he had t modesty not to set his name to that nor to an other of our productions some time aft he published a paper of predictions which were translated into several languages an alarmed some of the greatest princes in europ to these he prefixed the name of isaac bickerstaff esquire which i have been extremely fon of ever since and have taken care that mo of the writings i have been concerned  should be distinguished by it though i mu observe that there have been many countefeits imposed upon the public by this mean this extraordinary man being called out of t kingdom by affairs of his own i resolve however to continue somewhat longer in  country where my works had been so we received and accordingly bestowed my se with hilario his natural wit his lively tu of humor and great penetration into hmane nature easily determined me to the choice the effects of which were soon afte produced in this paper called the tatler  know not how it happened but in less tha two years time hilario grew weary of m company and gave me warning to be gon in the height of my resentment i cast m eyes on a young fellow of no extraordina qualifications whom for that very reason had the more pride in taking under my drection and enabling him by some means  other to carry on the work i was before egaged in lest he should grow too vain upon this encouragement i to this day keep hi under due mortification i seldom reside wi m when any of his friends are at leisure to ceive me by whose hands however he is du supplied as i have passed through many cenes of life and a long series of years i oose to be considered in the character of an d fellow and take care that those under my fluence should speak consonantly to it this ccount i presume will give no small consotion to sylvia who may rest assured that aac bickerstaff is to be seen in more forms an she dreamed of out of which variety she ay choose what is most agreeable to her fany on tuesdays he is sometimes a black proer young gentleman with a mole on his left cheek on thursdays a decent well looking man of a middle stature long flaxen hair and a florid complexion on saturdays he is somewhat of the shortest and may be known from others of

mention her last appearance in e boxes for which and being an atheist e expects the applause of the company this affectation of inhumanity is no less shocking when applied to other circumstances of life and yet i am well satisfied that some persons are at more pains to make themselves masters of it than others to arrive at the highest pitch of virtue generosity and good nature it were otherwise impossible that an easy fortune a happy constitution and in short all the advantages of life should strip men of those qualities which at the same time that they were highly beneficial to the rest of mankind would reflect the truest honor and the most exalted satisfaction on themselves amongst the many refinements upon pleasure which this polite age has produced it is a wonder to me that so few have hit upon that of relieving the poor this may sound very harsh in the ears of a fine gentleman but most certain it is that the least reflection would furnish him with the same observation were it possible for such a one to enter into all the disinai circumstances of want poverty and dress and to consider how far it may be in his power to remove them he would be content perhaps to part with some of his present enjoyments or rather to xchange them for those of a more exquisite nature  the immediate occasion of my speaking on this subject is a family that i happened upon in my walks about two days  pag through an alley in the city i  the ry of some little children which was so v y loud and importunate that i could not forb looking in at the house where it was  biggest of them immediately running to  door fell upon her knees and entreated  gods sake that i would give her something  keep her mother from starving upon whi i stepped in and found that this poor wom was the parent of seven children who  stood about her and as many of them as w capable of any impression seemed more solcitous for her relief than their own though evry one of them appeared faint with hung and ready to drop upon the spot the fath it seems was very lately dead and the expeces of his sickness and funeral had stripped the poor creatures of the few necessaries he h left behind him i have since recommend their case to a lady of quality whose extrordinary goodness makes her esteem an offi of that kind the greatest obligation that c be laid upon her distresses of the same so are more frequent than is generally believe in order to redress which i must first of a apply my self to the fair sex and beg the for that purpose to retrench many of their unecessary expenses which i shall otherwise  obliged to expose in a very public manner  so bright an example will not fail to inflence the rest of the world and when the great work is in any measure effected the thanks of many thousands shall be solemnl returned them by the hands of isaac bickestaff esquire  to isaac bickerstaff esquire sir the fame of your writings the gradeur of your office and the neverfaiing delight your incomparable essays give me have with much pleasure brought me to town it was so much my ambition to see the great bickerstaff that the diversions of the country and a cheerful fireside had not charms enough to keep me at home soon after my arrival the tailor sempstress and periwigmaker equipped me for my intended visit in channel row i enquired for the censor of great britain  the good people thought i banterd them and at best gave me but an uncertain account i then went to whites and wills where my information was no way satisfactory  but at length after i had spent several evenings at the grecian in the room on the left hand i verily thought i had found the censor there was a grave elderly gentleman who i observed was exact to his time of entering the room and who with great formality put off his cloak and hung it up with his sword and hat filled his pipe stirred the fire and called for the last mail these were the appearances that had seduced me into some hopes that this person was the gentleman i had been in search after but to my greater surprise i soon found him to be a perfect stranger to you lucubrations and your art and power of silence for his blood he could not hold his tongue  he continued his chat even in despite of your chair so i left him as i went by the ba i asked who this honest gentleman was and they told me sir thomas lalos  being now

unreasonable that a man because he has some wit should set up for having more than all the rest of the world besides the folly of such a presumption there is an inconvenience which naturally attends it when one man seems to grow into a great estate in fame from nothing other people are apt to enquire into his title the discerning part of mankind will be allowed upon such an occasion to take from him what is not his due without the imputation of detraction let hilario be pleasant and let some of his friends have wit but does it naturally follow from thence that he is a philosopher and that it is the effect of envy not to allow him all those excellencies he and they think he has  envy is a vice of such a detestable and pernicious nature that i would have it not only rooted out of our breasts in speculation b which would be much more for the real goo of society i could wish that our behaviou one toward another might be actually and entirely freed from those maks of it which a every day too visible for my self i can safely say i am contented with that condition providence has placed me in my own little fortune is sufficient for my necessities my friend are as many as supply all my conversations and that small portion of fame i have got will give me as much distinction in my lifetime and as much reputation with posterity as i desire for this reason i was never an enemy to any mans growing into the good opinion of the world i could with all the indifference of an idle spectator sit still and see my own old wit every day put to new uses by other people one dumb man retails my judicial astrology in drury lane and another of the same sort who owns he lives somewhere or other new vamps my cast lucubrations and cries my old morals about the street every day in the week this is what some people may think a pretty fai way of turning the penny let it be so i allow it them but when honest dumb forgets his name and his nature so far as to set up for a dictator when he assumes the magistrate and prescribes laws so manners in short wh n he arrogates to himself the authority of censor of great britain i think it time to assert my self and put a stop to encroachments of such a nature for this reason i think fit to admonish that pe son whoever he may be not to interfere with my jurisdiction unless he can prove himself to be me an enterprise of so vain and ridiculous a nature that i hope i need not go about to convince my readers of the folly it would be to attempt it from my first considerations upon envy i am naturally led to reflect upon some little ill offices which have been lately done me my maid who takes the privilege of an old servant to talk to me in an evening while she is warming my cap setting my slippers and turning down my bed as she was in her usual employment last night i believe sir said she i should make your worship laugh if i should tell you a comical thing that happened to me the other day as our neighbors maid and i were standing at the door together last sunday in the afternoon there comes by a young woman i thought to my self i should know her  so she comes up to me  laud says i mrs ann i profess i did not know you  and who should this be but the widow gentlewomans daughter that lived at the next door to where we lived before  how do you do mrs mary says she very well says i mrs ann how do you and how does your master do says she  very well says  laud says she we heard at our end of the town how an as if he should have given over his business  laud says i to her again who should tell you so nay says she twas one told me so whereupon thought i to my self says she if it be so and if mr bickerstaff should leave off his business and go into the country why perhaps mrs mary may be to seek for a place and so truly i was resolved to come and see whether twere so or no  thank you for your love said i mrs ann my master is a good master to me and i dont think of parting with him yet  well says she as brisk as could be up again to me if your master be a good master a better will do you no harm you would find another guess sort of a man if you were to live with our gentleman  pray says i and who is your gentleman laud says she how strange you make it as if you did not know our gentleman that lodges at my mothers  well but says i has your gentleman no name no matter for that says she that argues neither here nor there but if you have a mind to have your wages raised i can tell you something more of the matter  ay thought i to my self is that your business so sir i was resolved to take no notice  so says the to me but mrs mary what makes you like to live so with an old man i am sure if your place had been so good a place as you talk of mr lilly would have hardly come away from your master  mr lilly said i laud help your head as if my master could not do without mr lilly mr lilly is no rule for me my master was but too kind to him and if i had a mind to have served mr lilly a dirty trick  my master knows him well enough and if he had not gone away as he did my master had turned him away the thursday after  nay mrs mary says she if you are in a passion and indeed i was as red as the fire good night to you good night to you says i and clapped the door after me  though i was tired with the wenchs story i could not help being pleased with this uncommon mark of her fidelity and at the same time it was with some indignation that i reflected upon the little mean arts that were made use of to entice away my servant i could hardly have believed another instance of be same nature if i had not been assured by e whole neighborhood that they had obrved two famous known dogstealers watchg about my door for several days together from all these things put together i cannot but magine that the person who has a mind to ome into my place before i am willing to go ut of it thinks he cannot absolutely qualify himself for it unless he robs me of my domestics to endeavor at being witty and moral is a laudable design and the better part of the world will always approve and encourage it but if a man cannot be witty without mr lilly nor moral without stealing my dog i believe he had better

preparation to duties of the last importance this amounts to a tacit acknowledgment that they are in general calculated for our diversion without regard to our improvement that they amuse only and unbend the minds of an audience instead of filling them with great and noble ideas and serve rather to sink the dignity of humane nature than to raise in us any just sentiments about it were it otherwise the stage would have good reason to remonstrate against so peculiar a mark of infamy as that of being denied to the world at the approach of any religious solemnity and forced by that means to confess an irreconcilable enmity between the pleasures of the one and the obligations of the other notwithstanding all this i confess for my own part that i receive many advantages from going to the playhouse sometimes there is besides the play it self something in the circumstances of such an assembly that gives me a new turn of thinking and furnishes me with observations out of the common road i have a pleasure more than i ever observed in any one else on that occasion in seeing so great a variety of faces as well beautiful as others and in tracing their several tempers humors and opinions in their looks air and behavior to sit three hours in a crowd is in my opinion a severe trial of a mans understanding and from his deportment there i can generally form a judgment on his whole life and conversation amongst others i have ever avoided making an acquaintance with any person of either sex who talked loud or labored by any means to be distinguished from the rest of the audience my friend sam trusty exceeds me in penetration he and i commonly sit together and between the acts entertain our selves with reading over as many people as lie within our kens he enters not

of the company are entertaining themselves on the same subject after a very different manner we examine coolly and without danger the symmetry and proportion of a fine face and from the bloom of a complexion are led perhaps into reflections upon light and colors we were engaged in a conversation of this sort some evenings ago at the opera when sam trusty breaking abruptly well isaac said he i could find in my heart to weep as xerxes did over this multitude of mortals you and i remember when the house in dorsetgarden was thronged with women as beautiful as those we now behold here i

painted upon the doors of it a snake with the tail in its mouth which being the hieroglyphick of the year as well as the ensign of the divinity of physic i was at a loss what to make of it till observing it was corteged by broken printers and apothecaries i enquired who the person was i saw fitting in the chariot and what he could be writing i was answered that it was the genius of heroic poetry a r of the first magnitude in that science ich generally rose toward the winter solice i went up to him methoughts and said o thou antimonarchical praiser of princes and heroes shall their glories never be suffered to pass uncommended by thee when will thou learn how unequal to this task even the best are in the most abstracted retirement the jolts and rumblings of thy chariot must needs affect any verses and make them unfit to express the smoothness and steadiness of this heros conduct and successes  i recovered this delirium as the bellman went about with an annual sort of

this disposition in persons of a public capacity produces it self in an affectation of tyranny and arbitrary power in private conversation the effects of it are equally disagreeable though less

to saunter from one coffeehouse to another and as i was the other day thus rambling about a couple of odd fellows entered the room where i was one of them in his own short black hair with an uncommon smartness in his face the other a thin meagre person having much hunger and discontent in his countenance whilst the former of these engaged the man of the house in a brisk conversation the latter i observed slipped the tatler into his pocket and dropped two spectators in the place of it in order as i suppose to stifle the one and introduce the other they immediately afterward went out and upon following them in a careless manner to three or four other houses i found them putting the same stratagem in practice at last i laid hold of one of them and resolved to bring him before you when giving a sudden spring he broke loose from me and with his accomplice made the best of his way up the next alley i leave it to your wisdom to take some effectual measures for the defeat of these and all other your enemies who am for my own part  your most faithful humble servant f y   to isaac bickerstaff esquire  longa est injuria longae ambages sed summa sequar fastigia rerum virg april        sir the extent of your lucubrations being such as to take in whatever may be seriously instructive or innocently diverting i presume the following relation may come within the compass of them and therefore venture to lay it before you as it accidentally occurred  happening to visit last night an old acquaintance whose hours of retirement have been spent in uncommon contemplations and experiments he showed me under a large glass hermetically sealed up a spreading plant in its full verdure strong and lively to the eye which he assured me he had raised from its own ashes in a few moments this naturally led him to a rational discourse on the refurrection which though succinct was managed with that perspicuity as to answer to demonstration all the objections brought against it by its most formidable opponents those perfect masters of reasons and of natures laws though very imperfect christians moralists or men but to return to the plant it bore the figure of that indian weed if it be lawful to call it one that more than half the world hold in so great esteem and my friend growing less serious desired that while i smoaked my pipe he might take aesops liberty and let the admired vegetable give its own history in the following words  our extract is of ancienter date than that of mankind flourishing in the world before the days of adam our parents though widely distant from each other as heaven and earth yet always kindly concurred in our generation and production raising us higher in their favor than any of our sister plants as our birth was for many ages spontaneous so was our life uncontrouled and while we saw our neighbors devoured all by reptiles brutes or men our selves securely ranged the american woods unexposed to their voracious appetites for as we were objects of their love so neither were they of our fears how did the sun each morn smile on us with paternal rays and deck us with its clearest gems while the gignatick trees around as our lifeguards protected us from the fury of insulting winds and only suffered the fans of gentle zephyrs to refresh us thus for long tracts of time did each reviving spring cherish our infant days and summers heat mature us disclosing all their various beauties to us and ever illboding winter that mortal foe of annual plants frowned on us we in a good old age retired to endless rest within our mothers bosom  but alas those happy times are now no more for a malicious indian for what cause we know not committed some ages since a grave ancestor of ours to the devouring flames the odors of whose death procured us all the injuries we have since received for we no longer lived or died in peace but fell an easy and defenseless prey to numberless tortures invented by the barbarous nations round to ravish from us all our new discovered sweets and virtues  this was not long our case before the inhabitants of an unknown world came and inflicted on them as many deaths as they on us a just return for their inhumance treatment of us poor innocents but these too proved alas as merciless as those and have ever since forced us into life by their malicious art and cruel care to be untimely torn from our mothers breast then left to scorch with thirst and pine away and instead of a kind burial in our native soil transported us to far distant regions where our withered flesh stripped from our shriveld bones was cut in a thousand pieces by engines of a dire invention  nor are these last complaints unjust for though when plucked from earth our vegetation ceases yet do we still retain our spirits in full strength and so are never released from pain till totally consumed in flames  to enumerate the qualities i have been famed for the usage i have met with and the various and sometimes contrary effects ascribed to my powerful operations would be an endless task i shall instance therefore only in some few  at first i was the prisoner of the meanest sort confined in greazy pouches and visited with them my native fields and hedges but i soon got the esteem of those who kept me in a nearer though a stronger prison and so was introduced to shops and taverns then the learned faculty began their curious searches into my hidden virtues and could not long conceal their good opinion of me which quickly exalted me to the sublimest heads so that the statesman lawyer and divine admitted me to their closets and their studies and i have often since been the obstetrical assistant of many a teeming brain how often have i created a keen appetite to him that before had none and which is stranger as often filled a hungry belly many a time have i received the thanks of the scholar at his books the trader at his accounts and the soldier in the camp for the thoughts i have inspired the composedness i have occasioned and the refreshment i have administered the sick have praised my cures the healthy my preventions the solitary my amusements and thus have i gratified the greatest part of the male world but generally been the aversion of the fair  i was once indeed the private favorite of a maiden lady but unfortunately discovered by her admirer by being forgotten to be thrust behind the hangings and he not able to brook so disgustful a rival immediately dismissed his suit which produced a shyness between the whole sex and me in my ancient orm ever since  but since i have been refined by the new mode of crushing me to smallest atoms instead of being kept prisoner as before to expire in flames i have had all the riches of the east bestowed in fitting up apartments for me and am become the constant and beloved companion of the most celebrated wits and beauties i freely visit now the church the court the mansions of the great the teatable and the closet and every resort of highest quality  nay i am not refused the virgin bed but often dwell at midnight on the sweetest lips and wake the chastest fair with longings to embrace me by this new art i gain a free admission to the brain too and am as it were immortalized by being almost mixed with thought it self but what i value more than all is that i am the richest jewel in the british diadem  so concluded

infinite variety of scenes in humane life i cannot better employ the reflections i have made upon them than by instructing those in the paths they ought to pursue whose youth and unexperience would otherwise betray them into a thousand mistakes of all others i have a tender regard for such as apply themselves to those arts and sciences which gave me some reputation in the days of the emperor trajan i was esteemed the greatest wit of that age but by a misapplication of my parts and learning came to an ignoble end this is a reigning misfortune amongst the geniuss of the present age but has indeed prevailed much more in some foregoing reigns it is with the utmost indignation that i see many great capacities prostituted to the most unworthy purposes and the world in a manner corrupted and debauched by persons whose talents seem intended for the ornament and reformation of it next to the want of morality i bewail the narrowness of fortune which too often presses men of a liberal education and which perhaps is one step toward leading them into the former a young fellow who is uneasy in his circumstances is naturally betrayed into those follies which recommend him to company and give him hopes of making an acquaintance that may one time or other turn to his advantage with this view he gives into many fooleries that he secretly despises and at last is hardened into vices which he formerly abhorred the students of both universities are on this account in a peculiar manner the objects of my care and concern as often as i see a new face about town that promises much good understanding and a lively imagination i conclude it came up by the last coach from oxford or cambridge i am immediately upon the rack to consider the many difficulties such a one must encounter the attendance he must pay to insolent greatness the frequent shocks he will receive from the promotion of inferior merit from the dissimulation of some and the envy of others and at last from the mean reward he is likely to meet with for a long course of slavery and dependence  the following letter has partly suggested to me this way of thinking which seems to be written rather in confidence than with a design to have it published but that the postscript does more fully explain the intention of it  to isaac bickerstaff esquire sheerlane april   sir if the distresses of mankind do really fit so near you as we are given to understand by your paper of the   th of the last month i have but too just a right to your compassion and the most tender advice you can bestow upon me  it was not long since my good fortune to be a member of  college in oxford where i spent four years in a manner perfectly innocent and agreeable to my temper good part of my time was spent in reading the rest in such amusements as the place afforded i was generally well esteemed by the few i was known to and being not much turned to gallantry made a shift to be easy without the company of ladies which every body knows are scarce in those parts during this retirement i happened to write a copy of verses which alarmed two or three of the top booksellers in this town and gave them hopes of me for a future author of some more considerable work whether they employed my acquaintance to flatter me on that occasion i know not but to my utter ruin i received incredible applause for my performance soon after i took it in my head that the university was too narrow a sphere for me to act in i formed to my self great notions of my reputation at london and thought it would be taken amiss if i did not go and visit my friends and admirers there i made a journey accordingly and had the honor to be introduced to some persons of a considerable figure now thought i my fortune is made i have seen the greatest general and the best poet in europe my old friends in the mean time whom i had left behind me sent frequent letters of congratulation upon the prospect i had of coming into the ministry which i received and answered with the air and style of one that was already in employment i affected for instance a new way of writing my name of making up my paper and of subscribing my self according to the forms received in the offices about whitehall the great civility and good manners of many whom i was presented to had like to have led me into some mistake through my great ignorance and want of breeding i believed every word they said to me and when they assured me they would do me any service that lay in their power that they had a great opinion of my merit and only wanted an opportunity to show it i had no more complaisance than to take them at their words and look out for occasions of trying their friendship in the mean while my slender fortune run out apace the spleen succeeded and i am now in every essential as errant a wit as any about town words cannot express the shame scorn and regret i have for my past indiscretion which i can no otherwise atone for than by laying it open in this way for the good of others and applying at the same time for advice to mr bickerstaff with regard to my future conduct i am  sir with great respect your most obedient most humble servant w h p s i shall hope to see this in your next paper     this case shall be taken into consideration and the censors opinion delivered upon the same  the verses subscribed h g are received and many thanks returned for them as likewise for the letter from philanthropos  mr twining at toms coffeehouse in devereuxcourt a man eminent for his great probity and indefatigable industry is appointed undersecretary to mr

temperat astrum pers from tuesd april  0 to thursd april         from my own apartment april    in taking a survey of mankind one cannot but observe an universal pursuit of what they call pleasure and at the same time the grossest mistakes about the notion of it not to enter into more particulars let it suffice that in the catalogue of things conducing to this end friendship is generally omitted and either not at all considered or else exploded and laughed out of countenance the truth is our vanity seems to have got the better of our reason and choose rather to appear happy than be so hence it is that instead of cultivating an intimacy with a few we make a superficial acquaintance with all that offer and are more desirous of being seen by a multitude than rightly known and understood by any the want of virtue is at the bottom of all this having no true principles of honor generosity or good nature we naturally avoid being too strictly enquired into and therefore are cautious that those about us should not take any freedom beyond what a mixed kind of conversation will allow it is sufcient that a set of unthinking young fello can meet over a bottle and make a shift  pass the time with trifling and indifferent tpicks without ever entertaining the least mtual regard or examining into the merits  one another it will be difficult to perswad such men that they have not yet tasted one  the most exquisite enjoyments that the soul  capable of or that they have it in their power to open to themselves a more delightful wa of living than they have hitherto been acquainted with talking the other day with  very young gentleman on this subject i could not help asking him whether amongst the many affairs he had made with the ladies he had never yet happened to have one of an honorable nature upon his hands he frankly confessed he had and upon being further pressed that he found more satisfaction in the pursuit of that than from all the successes he ever met with in those of another kind believe me then said i there is no less difference between the idle amusement of a common acquaintance and the refined endearments of an intimate friendship i insisted the more on this point with a person who was as yet in a great measure a stranger to the world because it is very certain that the sooner this notion is received the more advantageous it proves and is a means of preventing many miscarriages in our behavior for my own part amongst a thousand other obligations which i owe to my parents i must particularly acknowledge that of instilling an early benevolence to mankind in general and a desire of fixing my self in the affections of one or more who should appear best qualified for so near an alliance sam trusty whom i have often mentioned in these papers was almost my first choice and has preserved me from many errors which youth and indiscretion would otherwise have led me into i am infinitely obliged to my cousin humphry wagstaff on the same account as well as for the great assistance he has given me in the prosecution of this work my conversation with each of these gentlemen is a kind of elegant retirement from the world as it furnishes me with the justest remarks upon the several occurrences in it our sentiments are communicated without reserve insomuch that our ordinary discourse is by the latter styled thinking aloud in this happy situation of life we stand less exposed than others commonly are either to the strokes of fortune the ill nature of our enemies or any calamity that can befall us in the mean time all our enjoyments by being shared amongst us are heightened and improved in proportion to the pleasure that every individual receives from them  in order to make mankind happy in the relish of so refined a commerce with each other i could wish our present writers of plays instead of filling their works of that sort with the business of love would sometimes diversify them with the distress of friends their heroic behavior under it with all the beautiful incidents that history can furnish or a warm and noble imagination suggest upon that model i am sensible how great a genius is required to this task but whenever the prudence of our superiors shall think fit to deliver the stage from the state of slavery and mismanagement it now labors under i shall not despair of seeing this and many other excellent designs happil put in execution  an humble retainer to the theater havin made the following application to me i t this occasion of making it public and of asuring the person concerned as well as others who may hereafter fall into the same misfortune that neither the corrupt dealing o charles lilly though a lunatic nor the insolence of those who support him in it sha pass unnoted or unpunished by the rightfu lawful and undoubted censor of the unite kingdom of great britain  sir i am the poor woman that has had the misfortune to be always in the way when don john in the play called the libertine sends his footman out for a whore by which means i believe i may venture to say i have modestly speaking been ravished upwards of five hundred times by this employment and that of lightner to the operas i have made a shift to get a comfortable livelihood but since there is a worthy gentleman who has taken upon him to regulate our stage and that if i should be turned out i am too old to turn my hands to any other business i must humbly implore your honors protection and that you would be pleased to do therein as to your great wisdom shall seem fit  and your petitioner shall ever pray e g sir all the women of our stage have made a party against me upon the account of this accident in the libertine and say that another such instance of chastity might ruin them for which reason and because i have no money to make an interest with mr lilly the other gentlemans agent i shall be undone unless your honor will pity my case    the tatler no    cuncti adsint merit aeque expectent

some of my readers an opinion has lately obtained that i allow no body to have any share of wit or humor but my self that i industriously suppress the attempts of others in that way and will not so much as suffer a young writer to thrive under my shade these and a thousand calumnies of the same nature have by some means or other though with the utmost injustice been spread amongst persons well affected  my interests who have thought themselv obliged by letters and other ways to gi me repeated notice of such unhandsome prceedings if i can promise any thing for self it is that i have no greater ambition tha to improve cultivate and encourage a promising genius wherever i meet with it and no only to refine the morals of mankind but t make even their studies and productions mo entertaining and agreeable to one another i must confess indeed that ever since my fir entering upon the censorship i have been very tender of suffering any encroachments to be made upon the dignity of that office i have now and then shown the error of those who offered to invade a province so peculiarly my own and by a seasonable rebuke put a stop to many growing inconveniences at a time when we are engaged in a just and necessary war abroad of what fatal consequence might it have proved to make a new division at home which must unavoidably have risen had i suffered any further competition for so great an employment a man must have little regard for the interest of europe who can be tempted by any consideration to embroil his country in quarrels and disputes at so critical a juncture what i have said therefore in any of my papers upon this occasion will by all persons of candor and discernment be considered rather as an instance of my care for the public than of any view to my own authority and advantage if others have been unhappily provoked by it to make rash and indiscreet reflections upon me i am heartily sorry for their misfortune and wish that their passion had not made them incapable of receiving advice from their truest friend upon that subject i shall only say at present t as it is evident they have embarked in a ong bottom they will do well to give off as on as possible for next to the honor of a ccessful engagement is that of a handsome treat  to vindicate my self yet further from t putation i before mentioned as i have late assigned the proper seasons of

professed patrons of polite learning without regard to party and because their umber is but small their subscriptions must ecessarily be the larger i do not despair of eing my self a contributor having deterined to assign a considerable part of the rofits arising from my own lucubrations toards so useful a project i must premise  general that no comedy will be admitd without a moral nor any

came hither about a week since being forced from london where i spent the winter by the commands of my mother who took it in her head that i grew too fond of that place and was in danger of throwing my self away upon some idle young fellow or other it is not to be expressed how melancholy i am here my heart aches at this instant as if it would break i look upon no one object with pleasure the fellows whom i liked well enough half a year ago appear silly and awkward and even the cathedral church of a sunday affords me no entertainment what shall i do dear mr bickerstaff to remove the heaviness that sits upon my heart how shall i divert my self in this wild and solitary retreat formerly indeed i could spend whole days and nights in turning over my romances i could with infinite pleasure rove about the wilderness in our garden and charm the rival nightingales with the music of my flute how often have i there unbound my silver locks and given them to be the sport of wanton

to the gratification of yours and that of many thousands more i will in all things act as becomes the substitute of so great a person and one who has a desire to approve her self  your most humble servant belinda   the case of belinda is in my opinion very deplorable and would if fully considered give occasion to many useful reflections at present i shall only observe upon it that the blemish she has received in her own character is by no means a step toward a power and jurisdiction over the conduct of others i am not unwilling to admit some of the fair sex into the employment she sollicits for having in general a great opinion of their capacities as well as of their earnest desire to reform the manners of those about them it may not however be amiss to give the electors in this point a short abstract of the qualifications requisite to a female censor lest any mistakes should happen upon so weighty an affair as first that she is indeed with an habitual silence secondly that she has a known hatred to scandal and detraction thirdly that she neither pays nor receives any impertinent visits fourthly that she is a constant reader of the tatler and fifthly and lastly that she has besides other books a huge  of receipts  the following billet is of no less consequence than the former  sir i have a great quarrel to mr jervoise and at your hands demand immediate justice upon him he has lately done a picture of me which is allowed to be extremely like and no less beautiful though at the same time my face is but very indifferent by this means he has raised the expectation of all who have seen the piece to my great disadvantage in the disposal of my person every body allows that he has shown himself an admirable painter and secretly wish that nature had been as kind as art has been indulgent to me for my own sake therefore and that of many others in the ame circumstances i humbly move the court for speedy sentence on so notorious an offender  and your petitioner shall ever pray  ordered that mr jervoise be fined a halflength of the censor done after the same manner as is mentioned in the abovewritten complains and that he be in readiness to receive him on wednesday next between the hours of nine and ten in the morning  to isaac bickerstaff esquire honored sir i have examined your lucubrations with the utmost care and diligence but can find nothing relating to my present case whether your thoughts have been employed on more useful subjects or whether circumstances so entirely alter the nature of things that it is impossible to define them but if so it happens that the importunity which a man should use in the recovery of his own has wholly escaped you i could read a dissertation of yours upon dunning with more pleasure than i ever looked at a newfashioned toy you only can direct us how far a gentleman may be decently pressed and whether personally or by billet is the more proper method  if you knew how much i was interested in this affair i persuade my self your concern for the sex would hasten your resolution i cannot look at poor charless face without bathing it with a flood of tears had he sold cast work for hammered or horn for tortoiseshell i could moderate my resentments but to be kicked disabled and caned like a stockfish for only demanding his due is an indignity not to be suffered in a free country  good mr bickerstaff take a distressed woman into your protection and give me such redress as you in your great wisdom shall judge suitable to the offense and believe my application to the censor of great britain to proceed only from the equity i have observed in all your determinations i am  your most devoted humble servant sarah bubbleboy   ordered that mr dighton and mr twining do enquire whether the kicks and blows given were by neats or calves leather jambees or dragons after which mr bickerstaff will proceed accordingly  the tatler no    torva leaena lupum sequitur lupus ipse capellam

is to reconcile men to their several stations in life and to remove that uneasiness which commonly arises from the supposed advantages of those about them unless this be in some measure effected it is in vain to expect any great success from precepts of another kind a person who is out of humor being as incapable of receiving advice as bestowing it on others the stake chiefly contended for is power and this if i mistake not is more equally divided than we commonly imagine the executive part of it seems indeed to be pretty much engrossed by men of great fortunes and large possessions they it is true carry about them all the distinctions of grandeur and superiority they are attended by maces adorned with ribands and crowded by a numerous train of dependants in the mean time it must be no small satisfaction for a man who is inclined to envy them such pompous appearances to make a strict enquiry into some other circumstances which are not altogether so much exposed to the public view he will by this means discover that these great machines are informed turned and directed by the most minute springs and movements that in many instances a menial servant has the management of their highest concerns and disposes of their actions as he in his great wisdom shall judge most convenient for them  as my cousin humphrey and my self were taking a walk in the park the other day a person of note passed by us with an air of insolence and contempt attended by a very magnificent equipage he with his usual freedom taking me aside desired me to observe that fine thing and to give my opinion of him observing me a little reserved upon the matter  isaac says he with some indignation you are the greatest coward in the world had i put the same question to you upon fifty others of five hundred times the worth of inferior rank you would have made no scruple of speaking your sentiments i will tell you then that gentleman you see there is one way or other in subjection to every one of those fellows that dangle after him i happen continued he to be well acquainted in his family in which there is a chain of interests carried on after the following manner the steward who is an old servant and has cheated his master time out of mind has the entire government of him the housekeeper has a hank as they call it over the steward and makes singular use of him in all impertinent affairs the page has no less interest in the housekeeper at the same time that he is himself in love with the chambermaid rose for that is her name professes a passion for t the footman who is deeply smitten with dirty moll the kitchen wench the latter of these has in conclusion a great sway in whatever cases she thinks fit to exert her interest which if she were made sensible of it would undoubtedly afford her no small comfort under the constant hurry and fatigue of her painful occupation  having but little knowledge of great families i was not before aware that this scheme of government was received amongst them but in the compass of my own acquaintance i have seldom seen it otherwise old major matchlock i remember was a very blustering fellow over a bottle and withal made a good terrible figure at the head of a company but within his own doors he behaved himself with great pusillanimity and paid the utmost subjection to an ancient maid whom in less than forty years he had raised from raking in a heap of cinders to the superintendancy over all his domestic affairs i am not in my own nature much addicted to fear yet i cannot but confess that i stand in awe of my old servant mary she happens to be of a mild disposition which makes her authority fit the more easy upon me but if it were otherwise i do not presume that i should have courage enough to make head against her as she has few other favorites or companions than my dog and tabby cat there is no danger of her leading me into any absurdities on their behalf  i am very much obliged to the person who sends me the following letter and shall comply with the instances made therein to the utmost of my power  from the west april    sir at this distance from other entertainments i am not a little beholden to that which your paper affords me insomuch that i drink your health in a bumper of manufacture every day of my life and next in order to those of very great consequence to the nation two or three of my children who are learning to read have their lessons set in your tatler though i had some difficulty to carry that point from their governante who stickled hard for the primmer i have had two or three quarrels with my wifes woman for putting thread in your paper and had like to have turned away my butler for setting up candles in it in a word sir i pay all imaginable respect to your works and would be glad to have opportunity of showing it to your person i flatter my self therefore that you will give me leave after these professions of my esteem and veneration for you to make a request in behalf of my self and many other your admirers in these parts we find our selves every postnight involved in such a multiplicity of newspapers that we know not which to consult first nor at last which of them to give any credit to the tatler was formerly wont to determine our choice in this matter by giving us a summary of the most material occurrences in a clear and intelligible style which except in the gazette is now not to be had for love nor money it is therefore our humble petition that you would renew this so laudable a practice which if you please to comply with i venture to assure you in the name of the whole neighborhood that we will at our next meeting hold a day of thanksgiving on that account and conclude the evening with a bonfire of dawkss dyers and postboys i am  sir with the truest respect your most obliged and most obedient humble servant j e   st jamess coffeehouse april    last night captain powel came express from the lord raby with an account that the

own apartment april  0 there is nothing more shocking to a generous mind than to see his labors rendered vain and fruitless i once flattered my self with the happy effects of my censorship and thought the influence of isaac bickerstaff had so generally obtained through the united kingdoms of great britain that there was nothing remaining but the fruits and glory of the conquest but such is the misfortune of a public character i have no sooner routed and disarmed the enemy in one quarter of my dominions exposed the vice and folly of mankind in one particular but i find my self engaged in a fresh dispute as if my authority was not so universally received as i imagined as if the people of this island thought me only de facto and not de jure censor by my age and experience i have hitherto put a stop to the growing evil but there is a race of creatures sprung up by their frame and complexion resembling men which are as far above my understanding as they are real objects of my concern it grieves me to see the bull the bear the lion stalking in a humane form i am in pain to find something so like my self sending forth nothing but brutal accents as if all joy and grief consisted in the quantity of sound and there was no way to express the dictates and sentiments of nature but by being tumultuous these men if i may be allowed to call them so seem weary of being at the fagend of the rational species and think they shall make tolerable good figures under another character i will refer the examination of this particular to another paper and insert the letter which gave occasion to the reflection  to isaac bickerstaff esquire sir among the many benefits which mankind has received from your lucubrations that of improving and polishing our conversation has been none of the least your distinguishing the different characters of men by the instruments of harmony has given most an inclination to be musical each preparing and hoping to appear in a better class this innocent ambition has had an effect even on the lowest kind and i have known some drums despairing of ever getting a finer note content to be silent a great negative blessing to those unhappy gentlemen who were sometimes condemned to be part of their audience but sir there is need of a farther reformation there are some people who have formed to themselves a sound that comes under no denomination you have yet imparted to the world indeed there are not many of this sect nor should i take any notice of them but that i have very lately observed they begin to get converts these noisy men have their fits come upon them very constantly and with very little intermission yet they can be sometimes articulate but then i dont observe those tokens of mirth which they show at the end of the paroxism i have seen one of them jump out of his chair and suddenly getting his legs from the ground five or six times make such a noise as nature gave us not ears to receive which has ended in about seven minutes in a strong loud laugh accompanied with the rest of the sect if there be any present for the fit often takes em among strangers who join in the chorus i have seen your great masters of noise foxhunters bombardiers gunners of all kinds sailers who are judges of storms amazed at their prodigious vociferation i should take them to be something enthusiastical but there is no show of religion among them the hottentotts a free people as the dutch travelers tell us come near them in sound but with less impetuosity from their agitation they may pass for french prophets but i think they deserve neither toleration nor indulgence there have been arguments used by men of wit and god knows of probity to support all the follies that have appeared in the world mr herbert an old solemn bard of our own a defender of joking to the last extent has observed that every thing is big with jest and has wit in it if you can find it out i neither doubt your power physically astrologically or mathematically yet if you can reduce these sounds into any compass if you can form any figure to express something inarticulate though the disquisition may not entertain the multitude do the fair thing and forgive a friend who begs of you even to make our monsters agreeable  dear isaac yours etc   advertisement dr proteus of wadhamcollege has with the greatest humanity owned the mistake he

aequabat opes animo hor from saturd april    to tuesd april         from my own apartment april    i am obliged to visit my old friend hortensius every april when his auriculas are in blossom he tells me he should be as much disappointed if his friends did not come and see him while his garden is in its pride as a fine lady would be on her day if no body came to admire how well she was lighted up  i went down on monday last to his house it was almost dark when i arrived and i found my friend watering his pots with his own hand and covering the choicest of them with glasses lest the inclemency of one frosty night in so uncertain a climate as ours is should shorten the duration of a pleasure which is but too transitory even in its longest continuance he bid me welcome to his hermitage and conducted me with aude hospes contemnere opes to an elegant little supper a good part of which was the product of his garden after the cloth was taken away mr bickerstaff said he i fancy you look with a good deal of contempt upon our country amusements is it not very odd to find me doing the same thing to night that i did forty years ago not at all replied i i dont think individuals either grow better or worse after one and twenty and i am no more surprised to find you diverted with an agreeable innocent employment forty years together than i should be forty years hence if it were possible i could live so long to find those who are now young fops to be grown old ones or those that are young knaves to be grown more experienced for since people dont grow weary of their faults i see no reason why they should grow weary of their pleasures at least of such pleasures as dont grow weary of them ah dear isaac said my friend there is the point to find out some entertainment that will not find out that we grow old and such a one i believe i have made choice of by that means i converse daily with the gwdiest part of the creation for since there is no body here to tell it again to the toasts i must own to you that i think nature has been no where so lavish of her beauties as amongst the birds and flowers harmonious voices sweet breaths fine complexions blooming youth and then for constancy one of my poor turtles is dying of a widowhood where will you match me these in the rest of the world you durst not talk at that rate replied i nor i hear you but at the age of seventy though it is natural for every one to give as much dignity as he can to whatever he is fond of dignity interrupted hortensius a little warmly we want no dignity or at least we need not strain a point for it pray friend isaac when man was made little lower than the angels what was he a prince a general or a great minister neither he was a gardener pray what is it that distinguishes man from beasts why all philosophers say reason philosophers are puppies if man were distinguished from the rest of the creation by reason would he not be distinguished by the noblest operation of reason the cultivating a virtuous mind but how is that ask any of these philosophers for examples of cruelty lust of avarice of disobedience to parents of rapine of ambition of treachery of cowardice of any vice they shall bring you instances of all these from kings queens generals popes and even philosophers themselves but talk to them of fidelity they quote you the dog of piety to parents the stork of industry the ant and the be of meekness the lamb of courage the lion and of constancy there my poor turtle comes in again oh reason is a dainty thing i love that noble distinction mightily it is almost as good as risibility hold dear hortensius said i pray let us be distinguished some way or other or let us go naked as they do and save tailors bills or rather let us get hair and feathers on our skins for i doubt i should not like to walk about pulled neither he smiled upon me and went on i design to distinguish for you too the true distinction between man and beast and which soli homini convenit is gardening homo est animal horticolum upon that condition you may differ from beasts as much as you please and be as distinct a species as you can but if you design to take the advantage of this proposal you must begin by going to bed early that we may be up to morrow to enjoy the sweets of the morning and therefore i will wait on you to your chamber the next morning was so like one in a romance that if it would not make this paper too long i could be content to describe it about seven a clock my friend came into my chamber and told me i was going to be very happy as soon as i had drank my chocolate for every thing conspired to make our walk so pleasant that what with the perfume of the flowers and the harmony of the birds he questioned whether i would regret either the smoke or the noises of london there were two parterres on either side of the house which were separated by a neat espalier from the rest of the garden these were destined for the reception of the flowers of quality such as auriculas tulips anemonies ranunculuss and carnations who lived here removed from the commerce of the people of flowers which inhabit the remainder of this vegetable kingdom my friend was pleased to see me surprised with the beauties of his benches of auriculas he made me take particular notice of number i which he told me was honored with the name of a great princess and the rest of the confederacy stood in their proper places after her the next series my friend enlarged more upon finding i begun to taste the entertainment and made me remark a flower which was a little overblown but he told me it had been wonderfully fine in its time and whispered me in the ear the ladys name it went by and what i value it for exceedingly said he is that i have raised those four seedlings which stand next her from this flower there was a fifth but i could not preserve it if we had not such losses we should be too happy in short he went on with above fifty fine ladies one after another and i believe would never have given off if i had not interrupted him by asking him how his flowers came to be all of a party and saying that i did not think to have seen that matter carried so far why said he i dont know how that comes about but we endeavor to fit our flowers to our faces and characters and this is done in a manner by election but no body need be without their flower for the daffodil and piony kind stand empty for any ladies that please to take them and as any new ones come out amongst our better flowers if they will stand candidates for them i shall be very impartial but we cannot do so well by the generals they must have a campaign in their bellies and cannot be provided for till next spring and then they will stand as fair as others we took our walk on through the rest of the garden at the lower end of which there was a little trout stream with benches by the side of it here we sat down and hortensius asked me if i was not tired with such a sauntering country life i assured him no and wished i had it in my power to invite him to such another place why really my friend said he i passed a good part of my time in what the world calls pursuit of pleasure and honor and have found at last that all those things are nothing more than what i have in this little brook noise and motion  the tatler no    tua res agitur paries cum proximus ardet from tuesd april    to thursd april         from my own apartment in channelrow april    i went two or three nights ago to browns coffeehouse to smoke a pipe and talk of the affairs of germany with my old friend mr solomon million as we were discoursing of funds and politics i observed a tall genteel man come in who made a very respectful bow to million and stood at a distance but looked as if he had something to say to him i made him take notice of it he tweerd at him a little and said friend would you speak with me fray what is your business he approached and whispered him and then million cried why ay and so i did but we could not carry it for you and so lookee you must be contented you lost it in good company that i must needs say but it is not always  here he coughed and i who had not recollected the gentleman till then perceived it was don diego he had a paper in his hand which he delivered million who looking upon it shook his head and said this is not in our way but my worthy friend muster bickerstaff  may be allowed to name him on this occasion may do you a kindness if so be he will recommend it to the world which i hope he will for my sake the paper was as follows  to all lovers and others within the cities of london and westminster and the liberties thereof whereas there have been great complaints at all times of the inconstancies indiscretions inabilities and exorbitances of the several lovers within the bills of mortality and whereas the same do still continue notwithstanding the several statutes in those cases had made and provided so that often those who have gone to bed in a substantial happy and reputable condition have perhaps the next morning by some sudden unforeseen accident found themselves stripped of all that was near and dear to them their pleasure and reputation for the preventing of which fatal misfortunes for the future it is humbly proposed that as office of insurance for lovers be erected after the manner of the amicable society where all persons subscribing the policies which will be ready by the first of may next at which time the books will likewise be opened at the sign of the united hearts in st martinslane may be entitled to the following advantages  i any lover may be insured ad valrem for any term of years or for life if required for a reasonable praemium to be settled by the majority of the subscribers at their first general court which is to be held as soon as one hundred thousand of either sex have entered themselves of this society which it is humbly presumed may be in less than twenty four hours after the books are opened  ii after such subscription and the name entered in the companys books the persons who take a policy will be insured by the sum of  that their lover shall neither deceive forsake nor betray them and in case of decay in affection which it is hoped will seldom happen such losses shall be made good by all the members of this society who upon due notice are to pay in their quota to any such claim within eight days at farthest  iii the society will stand to all repairs of the persons subscribing they having in pay the best artists of all kinds for that purpose some of whom have been bred up at the court of france and procured the most valuable cosmeticks there at a vast expense by which means they will be able at a minutes warning and in two hours time to scaffold up and new point any lady that apprehends falling to sudden decay and make her tenantable without loss of time or hindrance of business  iv young men of quality and officers of the army must be insured at pretty high rates they being liable to bragging and inconstancy but citizens seamen and country gentlemen will come at little or nothing  v the pleasures and profits of this society to be equally divided betwixt the adventurers  vi any married woman shall in this office be deemed and taken as a femme sole and may subscribe and enjoy to her own use and behoof such policy or policies notwithstanding her coverture and in case of any trouble from her husband or if any divorce should be attempted the whole society are obliged to use their interest against it either in the commons or otherwise  vii any adventurers in this society may by mutual agreement with the consent of the governor and governess and the majority of the four and twenty directors transfer their right and title in any policy to any other member of this society  viii all persons at their admission to take an oath to stand by and mutually assist each other against all malicious and censorious tongues who are always raising ill reports and misconstruing the most innocent looks to the great disquiet of civil families  ix there are to be swornappraisers of both sexes who are to take a survey and certify upon oath the true values of the persons subscribing  though i am far from taking this for a perfect scheme yet i think it does not deserve to be rejected at the first reading for perhaps something may be added in a committee to make it of great use  i do therefore refer it to a committee of the whole town who are to examine the allegations and report their opinion for i cannot but think that if something of this kind could be done it would be of universal advantage and might go a great way toward extinguishing those heats and animosities which are amongst us and put an affectual stop to those wicked emissaries that are continually busied in stirring up jealousies and evil reports among her majestys loving subjects  the tatler no     prisca redit venus hor from thursd april    to saturd april         from my own apartment in channelrow april    one great inducement to me in removing to this end of the town was for the benefit of the air in st jamess park where i usually take one turn in the morning and  it be any thing like weather another as soon as my pipe is done after dinner in my walk the other day i met with so odd an adventure that i cannot help being particular in the relation of it especially since in regard to posterity it may serve to clear up one of the most important passages of my life just by the cockpit at the privygarden door there stepped up gently to me an ancientish woman in a little black hood a whisk band and a crape gown and in a soft low voice calls to me  sir i could never think it charity to relieve your streetbeggars what little i do in that kind is chiefly to charityschools and decayed housekeepers so on i walked and she after me but sir says she again with a respectful whisper i am a gentlewoman gentle or simple said i that is nothing to me prithee woman be gone about thy business this is not a place for you when she had got me to answer her she proceeds sir you look like a gentleman and my case is really such that if you knew but half  i dont desire to know a quarter said i but the woman was so very civil and withal so very importunate that i could not help turning about to her and with that she pulls two or three dirty torn papers out of her stays and offers them me to read pray mistress said i what is it you would have of me this is not a place to read papers in but my name is so i live in such a place and if you think it worth your while to come to me when i have more leisure i will hear what you have to say i observed she changed color upon hearing my name and coming up closer to me told me nothing but the greatest necessity could have brought her to this her education it was well known had been above any such thing till the frowns of fortune had reduced her to this condition why it is a strange thing said i mistress that you will not take an answer i tell you again that i have not for you and let that suffice ah dear sir said she there was a time when one of your name would have given me a kinder answer this brought a thousand confused imaginations into my head and i felt something awakening within me that i could not account for i stole a look over my shoulder and saw her wiping a pair of eyes that i thought i should not be a stranger to with a greasy glove and the lappet of her hood i have no small money about me said i but i am just at home and made what haste i could to my house as i was going into my parlour i heard my maid disputing the door with her  mary said i let the gentlewoman come in as soon as we were alone  fixed my eye upon her and asked her pray what may your name be ah mr bickerstaff she replied is it possible you should have forgot me but indeed the troubles i have gone through since you and i danced together at the mayors feast at litchfield would have altered a better face than i could ever pretend to whatever changes time and trouble may have made in you said i i am sure it has not made so much in me but that i am mightily concerned to know what has happened to you since i am now assured you can be no other than mrs olivia darkin for whom once i passed so many uneasy minutes well mr bickerstaff i must own  but pray sit down said i  and mary do you hear bring me a pint of that sack in the corner and bake a toast well pray go on why truly sir as i was saying i did perceive you had a kindness for me but alas what could you expect of a giddyheaded young thing as i was in those days for you must know sir that mr maccarrot that you saw at our house had engaged my affections before i came from the boardingschool but i am sure i have lived to repent it every vein of my heart that ever i crossed the seas with him in short sir we were no sooner married but he carried me over with him to the county of kerry where he had relations who were well enough to pass and what with their assistance and that little we had of our own we made a pretty good shift for some years till the war breaking out in ireland my husband was too zealous for the popish interest and entered into the service of the late k  j  s i told him over and over what would come of it he gave me no answer but that it was his opinion and he would stand and fall by it and child said he you are a fool if you dont turn catholic never talk on it said i i will die a thousand deaths before i will change my religion and so he never pressed me any more about it but as i had foretold so it happened he was killed at the siege of limerick and our house plundered i may safely say they did not leave me the value of this rag to wind about my finger and en she burst out a crying ha said i this is a melancholy story indeed come here is to you i will promise you it is a glass of good sack but pray did his relations do nothing for you relations ah lord said she they were his relations not mine and when he went all went with him you must think sir i went to em but they looked as coldly upon me as if i came to take the bread out of their mouths at last they agreed among em to take one of my girls off my hands and gave me five pounds to carry me over to england but when i came there i was never the near for i had angered all my friends in marrying and i dare say some of em were glad to see me in such necessity at last an aunt of mine sent me word i should be welcome to her in staffordshire where being a widow and old and infirm i was serviceable to her in the nature of her housekeeper it pleased god she died in about two years after and left me in money and goods to the value of four hundred pounds upon this i plucked up a good heart again and had several offers made me from substantial farmers of good repute in the neighborhood but it was a sort of life i did not care for and having no thoughts of altering my condition nothing would serve me but i must come up to town here and having a stock of linen and other good things that my aunt left me i hired a handsome house and took lodgers well why this put you in a good way again said i interrupting her yes indeed sir said she i had several parliament men and other very good gentlemen in my house and lived as creditably as any body in my employ so that in a few years i thought i should be able to do very well for my children pray what children might you have said i besides the girl you were mentioning in ireland i had a son and daughter said she and as hopeful they were though i say it as any woman would wish to be mother of but there was a gentleman in my house who belonged to the army a civil man to my thinking as ever came under any bodys roof i never heard an oath come out of his mouth he paid me punctually every monday morning and was so easy and contented that i thought i could never do enough for him it seems as i found afterward he took a liking to m betty and i believe there was no love lo for i observed the girl would go mopin about the house and i would often s to her what is come to you child methin you take no pleasure in any thing you do she would make me no answer but on day as we were alone i put it home  her and then she up and told me the whole story that she had been overpesuaded by the captain and was so far gon that it was in vain to conceal it any long soon after she was delivered of a fine bo and as soon as she was up well mother says she i will not live here to be a disgrace to you i will try my fortune in the indies so i agreed with a west india captain of my acquaintance since the girl had such a mind to travel into foreign parts but the first news i had by the return of the ships was that she died of the distemper of the country still i was in hopes my son joseph would do well but he was got in with an idle gang who would send for him at all hours in the night i was fond of him and sed him with money till i was almost reduced again in hopes to reclaim him by fair means at other times i would talk to him seriously and tell him he had had another sort of an education but nothing would do i found i was but a woman he would give me the hearing and then away to his comrades but one day above the rest there was a great noise of a robbery and murder that had been committed upon bagshotheath and my son among others was taken up and carried to newgate upon his trial he confessed he was among them and was found guilty but he declared with his last breath he was not concerned in the murder i was with him every day after his condemnation he told me all along he was willing to die but i did what i could with money and friends till i had nothing left to get his pardon and a gentleman who belonged to the court and had formerly been my lodger gave me hopes to the last and bid me fear nothing o that my son should not suffer to keep him in heart i told him we should get a reprieve but

channelrow april  0 ever since i have taken upon me the office of censor of great britain it has been my principal care to guard my self against all manner of just reproaches which might depretiate those wholesome maxims which i every day distribute to the public and to fence against all those vices which render old age contemptible and it is wholly owing to this that i have never fallen into that common weakness of finding fault with the present only for an excuse to cry up the last age i must own i have had a great itch to do it but as i weigh every thing before i attempt doing it i find upon mature deliberation that generally speaking the age is virtuously inclined and that what faults it has proceed chiefly from excellent principles and might be made virtues with a very little trouble for in the first place i observe that part of mankind where one would least expect it to be wonderfully inclined to economy i mean the young and the fair of quality no frost snow no east wind can hinder a large set of people from going to the park in february no dust nor heat in june and this is come to such an intrepid regularity that those agreeable creatures that would shriek at an hind wheel in a deep gutter are not afraid in their proper sphere of the disorder and danger of seven rings but as the city does generally value it self upon outdoing the other end of the town in these matters so i have long observed with infinite satisfaction a certain coach which i esteem particularly it belongs to a worthy trader in or near wellclose and no disparagement to charless wain it keeps its course as regularly as any fixed star of em all the family to which this wondrous automaton belongs goes to dinner as soon as morning service is over they set out in the cool of the noon about half an hour after twelve and according to the rule of discreet travelers make the coachman drive slowly at first by which they have two advantages one that they see all the company go to church in the city and the other that their horses have time to empty themselves at charing cross they stop and give the cattle a mouthful of hay have a cool tankard or the like and any of the gentlewomen that have occasion step out of the coach by the end of suffolkstreet they mend their pace and get into a tolerable trot which brings them so happily to the farthest part of their journey and in such good time that they are there as soon as the best of em i remember last year i was over against northumberland house when this caravan reposed there they were five of the fair sex three pretty fat ones one very fat and a lean one they were all sure of the thousand pounds a year in the lottery and almost fell out about their several ways of disposing of it the fattest of them said if it should please god to take away her master she would not change her condition though she should get the thousand pounds a year but would lay it up to make her children love her but if they should prove undutiful she could not tell how far she might be prevailed upon but ant please god she would never marry a seaman again she would have no more frights and twitters at every puff of wind the next in size to her ladyship said laud mother why to be sure forsooth you will not have it you will have enough without it child said her mother will you never leave off that ugly trick cannot you call a body madam i would to god i had sent you to chelsey instead of stepney but twas such a great way off prithee sister dont fright your self says another i shall have it mun for i was adreamed and so methought there came a fine gentleman to me in a cinnamoncolourd coat and gold buttons and a long wig and a gold chain about his neck and so he axd me to go with him to his country house at grinitch and methought he had my lord mayors bage and tisdale and the city music and he said as how twas because i had a great forti the third said she was sure she should have it because she had a mind to it and if she got it she would come away immediately to that very coffeehouse yonder and send for one of those young officers out and marry him immediately and then madam i will come and wait upon you in my glass chariot and pass my time like a little queen ah mal said the old one thou art a mad girl thou would think on it twice  ay so i shall forty times said she till the lottery is drawn i shall do nothing but think on it but sister rachel says nothing why says the lean one i am satisfied none of you will have it for it is come into my head just now that i shall have it my self and i will take a house in devonshiresquare and get a set to play all day long at lue and never marry but despise mankind though now i think on it if any of you have a girl to my mind perhaps i may breed her up and when i die leave her all i have and then she may be married to a lord lookee there now it grieved me mightily to see the coach drive away at this period and i could not but make this reflection how five people could be sanguine enough to expect the great lot which was one hundred and fifty thousand to one whether either of them had it and of the many thousand owners of coaches in and about this great city not one of them was afraid of having their necks broke at the park where the odds are not above two hundred at most nay folks are glad to borrow a chance for being crippled i concluded with my self that those who come from the wary part of the town had perhaps had the precaution to insure in exchangealley without which i thought it impossible ladies should venture to travel so far to run such dangers for we may perceive by the number of offices now in town that it is no longer in fashion to ride post to sieges but the mystery was soon explained as to these wellclose pilgrims for that very evening my honest friend faber would needs take me from st jamess park with him to eat a cold chicken and sallad and drink a flask of flurrence as he calls it and as we were looking out at window in the pall mall and seeing the coaches going to the park i saw my lady and her daughters return i had an inclination to smile at first but upon reflection i could not but admire the sagacity of those people who having a great way to go come out of the park when others are going in for by that means they see all the company and avoid all the danger  the tatler no    potanda ferens infantibus ubera

wit as it is very unbecoming in the presence of a man of my years so is it likewise very ominous to the persons who are possessed with it for they are generally shortlived and give occasion to their mothers to say the poor child had too much sense to live long it is therefore my opinion that this great vice takes its beginning entirely from taking children too soon f om the breast and admitting them so early to the use of a luxurious variety in their food which forces an understanding before its due time i have therefore from a long observation amongst young fellows as i find them in their conversation and according to the subjects which they handle been able to tell the very day when the nurse applied the bitter drug to the nipple to give them an aversion to sucking there was a law among that wise people the romans that no man should kill above thirty asses at a time for a banquet and the reason was that they being a creature then esteemed a great dainty and a vast consumption of them there was found at length a great defect of their milk for the education of the offspring of the commonwealth to the unspeakable pain and labor of the good women who were otherwise obliged to suckle their children till they should be fit to carry arms in defense of their country i have therefore out of a due respect to such an excellent example and to prevent the inconveniences of these too early essays in things of sublime science ordered the ingenious mr charles bubbleboy to get made for the use of the public from time to time a sufficient number of suckingbottles which all young fellows under the age of twenty are to hang with a chain about their necks and i likewise ordain that when any person under the age above written shall presume to launch out of his depth in theoretical learning it shall be in the power of any bystander to apply the bottle to his mouth and make him suck  i hope by this simplicity of diet in some reasonable time so far to reform the manners of youth in conversation that no one under the age aforementioned shall presume to exceed the limits of grammatical learning in discourse and likewise to augment the strength and stature of my countrymen a well as their understandings  it has ever been the custom of our family to bring up their children without endeavoring to improve their minds till their bodies were grown to a full maturity and we were suffered as it were to lie fallow without any cultivation till the soil was rich enough to give a full vigor and extension to the seed that should be sown in it for this reason i was looked upon as a mere idiot all the time of my childhood and lived in a state of admiration to an age wherein others are wont to exert egregious signs of wisdom i remember very well that i sucked my mother till i was able to carry my cradle on my back and could not speak a word till i was ten years old being a perfect pythagorean by nature and always more inclinable to hear than talk till i

epigrammatical flowers in which you behold poetry in her spring very various in her array of colors but not daring yet to shoot high from the earth which were then offered up as fi fruits to the great harlaeus as they show their own inability of soaring high enough yet they do in some measure point at that immense height of praise which should be equal to the subject commended and which ought to be the particular province of an epick poet  when i first entered the school i was struck with a becoming awe and veneration to so sacred a place and the dignity of the person presiding in it not without a due regard to the fasces which are the symbol of his authority i could not then forbear taking the person and office of a schoolmaster into a nearer consideration and to propose him to my mind in

complains of having too little  whilst i was amusing my self with these thoughts which to some may seem too ludicrous on so grave a subject though i profess t is far from my intention to lessen the

here  mr bickerstaff we are all here very much pleased that you are upon so useful a work as establishing a club of ugly faces at london being well assured that you cannot want company enough but are much surprised to find a person going by the name of the spectator so audacious as to style himself a member of our society here and printing letters as from us to prove his admittance and thereby

up meets with continual opposition and seldom very seldom comes to that perfection as to dare to look vice in the face but then it easily looks such false courage out of countenance it was most amazing to me when i was yesterday at st jamess coffeehouse to see a forward youth well dressed and powdered whom i knew not only to be of very mean extract but of more despicable parts lay his extraordinary chin over a dukes shoulder and as familiarly ask him impertinent questions as if his equality or intimacy entitled him to disturb that noble peer who when he was delivered from the weight of his chin enquired who he was how easy had it been for me to have told the company that that place was indeed very fit for him but in another capacity however i only privately informed the master who in respect to his brother coffeeman desired the count to know himself an not be so familiar with those that he did no know from that place i came to toms at devereuxcourt i have a singular respect for that courteous man and find that if he permits doctor salvo  to lay aside the man in that violent man and with an indignation greater than can be admitted to any orator retire into the third sphere and talk things indeed not fit to be heard i assure my undersecretary that as curiosity at present doubles his customers at the doctors eloquence in a short time as no body else now can be heard there will be no body to hear  ordered therefore that unless the said doctor will condescend to be on the level with common sense his tea be always two degrees under proof that he be allowed no tobacco nor the use of his own s v o both too conducive to agitation but after having paid his penny you show him the situation of your door  what made me in some measure excuse the doctors vociferation was that i did not see as usual the newspapers of which none could give account till in about half an hours time i saw a man come out of the yard with a handful yet enquiring most thirstily for the postboy till he had that he would not deliver the rest upon enquiry i found him to be my old friend the upholsterer revived in a northbritish barber who is so great a patriot so good

to reclaim this obstinate age f om its vices and follies i have often had it in my thoughts to quit my office my friends all importune me to it and one of them whom in january last i had desired to continue this paper during a necessary avocation of mine actually tried to lay it down handsomely for me nothing has hindered me from complying with their requests but a strong benevolence i have always had toward mankind and an ardent desire of doing some good in my generation these alone have supported me under my disappointment and now prompt me to put in execution a new scheme which is to abate something from the grandeur of my enterprise and since i cannot attain a greater good to attempt a less no longer endeavoring to ease men of their follies but in their follies nor striving to make men supportable to each other but each one to himself this thought arose in me the other night at the play upon observing several difficulties that many of our nobility and gentry labored under a pretty young gentleman tore his breeches and broke his sword by getting over the box into the pit that he might have that opportunity of exposing to sight his pearlcoloured stockings and redtopd shoes another who had a very fine wig and a feather in his hat was forced to sit covered all the time and spoil the wig to show the feather a third lest his fringed gloves should not be seen underwent the pain of leaning forwards for a whole play together upon the fore part of the box setting his arms upright upon his elbows a fourth who was in low circumstances of stature every now and then with great labor heaved into sight a rich swordknot and many others were variously hampered and perplexed in displaying their several fineries to remedy which inconveniences i at first thought it might be proper to advise the owners of the playhouse to appropriate each division of the sideboxes to a several dress and to distinguish them by inscriptions over them in large letters in these and the like words redtopd shoes swordknots feathers fringed gloves gold snuffboxes dressed at all points   by which means the whole audience would at one glance be apprizd of the particular ornament of every person in that division  but reflecting since that this invention would be of too narrow an use it being likely to extend only to the playhouse and perhaps a cathedral or two i have applied my self to find out something that may be of general ease to the beau monde proceeding in this manner i considered what might be the rise or cause of all that vast variety of fashions which we yearly see this i found to be solely the oftentation of riches for upon this accoun it is that people have no sooner one sui brought home from the taylors but to show that their purse is not exhausted they bespeak another which that it may appear to the most careless eye to be a late purchase must differ from the former not only in matter but in form this in the present course of things will be an eternal occasion of the mutability of fashions and as a man has but one way of being in the right and ten thousand of being in the wrong so there can be but one dress commodious and as soon as we deviate from that we shall find all the rest troublesome i therefore thought that if a medium could be invented by me whereby both the fair and the foul sex might at once be rid of the encumbrances of the mode and be continued in the reputation of profuseness i should do an acceptable piece of service to my country and procure to my self peace of mind in a consciousness that i had not lived in vain this i hope i have at last happily effected by the following project  an office shall be ed by the name of the equivalent office in this office any person shall be admitted to pay down such sum or sums of money as he or she shall be desirous to expend in any particular ornament or ornaments upon the payment of such sum or sums and intimation given what piece of finery it is designed for there shall be made out a neat ticket or credential in the language of the office to be worn in the most conspicuous part of the body certifying to all men that the wearer thereof has actually laid out so much money as would have purchased such an ornament therein described and requiring them to deem esteem and repute the said wearer as ipso facto wearing the said ornament any thing in outward appearance to the contrary notwithstanding the advantages that will arise from this office are innumerable i shall only hint at a few which will put the reader into a way of discovering many more  by virtue of proper credentials gentlemen may wear wigs of such size and color as shall best suit with their features and complexions and yet have the credit of light fullbottoms thick legs may be diminished by black stockings and spindleshanks enlarged by white yet both be reputed as scarlet silk corns may be avoided by keeping the feet in easy old shoes and yet the owner maintain the reputation of having a new pair every day ladies by these credentials may yet farther enlarge their petticoats which in their present method is impossible to be done they may make their headdresses proportionable to their petticoats and they may patch their faces with diamonds without disparagement to their eyes  i am not insensible how highly beneficial this scheme might be in raising money for the public but a former project of mine having been rejected with scorn when i offered it and two years after made use of with good success but without any acknowledgment of or to the inventor i am disgusted from making any more proposals of that nature i had once a mind to apply the profits to charitable uses but then i thought again that doing good with the money would be so prodigious an alteration in the application of it that it would create an insuperable objection against the whole undertaking in those who were likely to be my contributors so that i have at last resolved to apply it wholly to my own benefit

sort  wit from the divine calliope as i would a cquet from a fine woman one is all air an affectation the other refines upon good sense yet converses in proper words and sentiments a turn is the creature of fancy that after it is born is put under the tuition of the judgment which is to assign it a proper station and to stint its extravagancies when it depends upon the words or style great care is to be used that it may not dwindle into p and jingle and when it consists chiefly in the thought the same diligence is required that it may not sink into any of those flowers of the school or commonplaces of youth by which they gradually ascend to this attainment both the real and verbal turn owe their beauty to novelty for there is no greater perfection in these witticisms than what arises from that sudden surprise they make upon the imagination they seem to take their name from their nature for they consist mostly in advancing a thought or expression and then making what follows play upon it in an agreeable way either by retracting what went before or wittily perverting it or comparing it with something that hits the same fact or idea to any degree of exactness or giving some surprising reason for it when it seemed a paradox indeed the variety of turns is so great and their beauty so entirely owing to this variety that it is almost impossible to fix them to any stated rules a turn being the product of fancy it is unnatural to use it but in those gayer and more airy parts of poetry where the fancy is at liberty to wanton and gambol in the epick in tragedy or in that sort of elegy which has distress for its subject it would be ridiculous and trifling for here the chief business belongs to the judgment and the fancy is only concerned in ranging for images and ideas equal to the grandeur of the subject a hero in a passion might as well express the high sentiments of his soul by laughing at one of the plumes out of his helmet as by playing with a turn or a double entendre a lover lamenting the rigor of his mistress or a poet the loss of his friend in this sportive way would make as awkward a figure as the resigned ardelia when she laughs at the mischiefs committed by her monkey though the loss of her china wrings her very soul or an irishman in his country way singing at a funeral the ancients had abundance of this sort of wit and used it more discreetly than the moderns the greeks indeed appear perfect strangers to it they had other ways to improve that mirth which was so natural to them anacreon and aristophanes write in a way where turns are a beauty and yet it is very difficult to find so much as one expression of that sort in their works homer hesiod theocritus and musaeus have nothing like it in their poems it seems to have begun at rome when epigrams became the common entertainment of their best people after supper or over a bottle in a cool retreat it was their custom to divert one another with reciting or composing three or four distichs that were usually pointed with one of these turns in which they were smart upon some of the reigning coxcombs coquets or humors of that age modern lampoons were introduced as a third course at the tables of great men in imitation of this custom a good part of martials epigrams seem  have been made at some of those conversations whence we may account for the great inequality in his works which himself acknowledges  sunt bona sunt quaedam mediocria sunt mal plura for we may imagine that the grave pieces were made just upon the whet the bright after the first bottle and the smutty after a full dose the applause that followed upon these smart things tempted the fraternity to mingle them with their most serious and pathetick works ovid whose great fault was redundante ran early into a palpable extravagance this way in his exile amidst cold hunger solitude and distress he indulges this awkward bdinery very feelingly imagine a generous fellow touched with the loss of a fine woman and could he find leisure for so egregious a turn as  tu non inventa reperta es   narcissus is turned into a flower and well deserved it for playing with his own misery and making flowers of his misfortunes when he bursts forth in the most wanton merriment with  inopem me copia fecit vellem quod amamus abesset roger anne rogem quid deinde rogabo   you would think he were varying at wertminster and not preparing himself for a real transformation  virgil the most judicious and correct writer in the world has studiously avoided every temptation to this error his  ignoscenda quidem scirent si agnoscere manes is the only thing that looks like a turn how carefully does he avoid it in that fine complaint of gallus  tu procul a patria nee sit mihi credere tantum alpinas ah dura nives   there is all the beauty of the analagy in two words which ovid would have wiredrawn into two lines at least for a professor of turns can never forbear exerting himself when he happens to bring a scornful mistress into the company of cold and frost till he has made the lady a perfect winterpiece and it is all one if fire had made a third person in the conversation i remember a very celebrated epigram which begins thus  me nive candenti petiit modo julia  where the author submits to be pelted with snowballs by his mistress for eight lines together on purpose to take the benefit of this melting allegory it would set up an ordinary critic to take the moderns to task upon this single article the misapplication of turns the time may perhaps come when i may in person summon our great alexander theodosius brutus anthony caesar t appius and osmyn to answer their extravagancies this way and out of their own mouths shall condemn them i do not mean for little harmless turns made in their reseries their cool soliloquies or in snipsnap dialogue with a priest or a gentleman usher but for turus i fits of love and of madness for turus spoken in the very face of death and of the gods themselves nay in the very face of their mistresses and i am not mistaken if they have not sometimes raised the inordinate appetite of wit to the horrid outrage of a downright quibble  the tatler no    from thursday may    to saturd may         a lovers meditation on his mistress madam the hours to me are ages of misery they must be insupportable to a wretch who can never know what joy is but in her presence love may well be defined a restless impatience to be with those we adore what a miserable constraint then must i live under who make it my business to avoid the mistress of my soul where my heart my wishes my thoughts are eternally there i must never be did she but know what i suffer and how much a discretion as exact as mine makes one miserable but alas they must love like me that are to guess at my torments i hardly know i live but by what i endure for her o nothing can touch my soul there is no harmony in words unless she speaksthem there is no bliss but in her smile no terror but in her frown nothing worth living for but her esteem there is this comfort in an affliction like mine no other thing can give me a moments uneasiness she prevents all other grief she prevents all other pleasure if the whole world should change its place and she not concerned i should hardly perceive it whether peace or war what party prevails whose ruin is near all these things are now indifferent they employ not my thoughts my only impatience is to increase her good opinion my only care not to forfeit her esteem this thought brings me into one of those terrible fits of fear which often seize them that adore her i know i am not in positive disobedience and a little equivocation if so much practiced in religion may be indulged in love i neither write nor send to her i dare not disobey sure if there be any thing like a fault in this i am safe who is it is to accuse who is guilty and i hope i may say what is the crime this letter is sent to you meant to her and it came from him but who are these in this dress it is to every body it is to no body how will you draw up my indictment however let me not be condemned unaccusd unheard save me from being criminal if you can think me so burn this and there can be but a single evidence against me your self and there never shall be another this is the plotting way of your servant who with less fear would engage in treason than in what might offend her too scrupulous niceness i confess i tremble though i can say if this be one it is a new kind of sin against which there is no law  her eyes were not more fatal to me the first time that i saw them than my own have been false to my heart ever since if they have  told her a thousand times that i die for  alas how many tears will that happin cost them they have gazed upon her the have confessed a passion and should not  hand declare my tongue endeavor to describe it that she might know my love  as it ought to be the adoration that i  her is such and no other but what we shou all pay the gods were their charming attributes so visible i was prepared for their tal influence before i saw her eyes i was bewitched by her siren tongue before i heard it i loved the spring from whence she came and my soul follows the enticing stream with pleasure i knew there must be wit and fire before i heard so and i found more than was spoken of thus i was struck by prepossession and the poison first instilled into my heart before i saw or knew her can never be removed from thence by all that i shall ever see or know i would not profane a confession as sincere as ever was a dying mans with the least augmentation of truth i will not pretend that i have not endeavored to remove by any other object a stroke of fate as i may call it that has given and will give me such uneasiness were i to make a wish for a friend he should have many halfpassions but none such as i have felt for her  o this would content me alone that she might know how long i have struggled against her charms in vain  as the beginning of my fate was extraordinary i think all the steps of it have been and will be out of the common road the foundation of a common passion is a desire to please ones self but the aim of mine is only to please her i adore  could it be more satisfaction to her to have e wretched than happy i should choose the rst and find some satisfaction in misery but what i cannot endure is to be indifferent to er to be eternally thinking of her and never hought of by her heavens preserve me from his and i willingly in every thing else subit to fate  o how i fear her wit her judgment that distinction that lets no folly escape i fear her ut upon this score for sure i am all her peetration can never discover the least contraiction the least deceit in any word the least want of respect in any action sure i am no time can ever discover the least diminution in y zeal and must i nevertheless fear this most dored lady should employ that overstock of wit she has to ridicule the sufferings of a reaking heart so faithful so submissive so incere o how shall i express my self what shall i say or is it possible to be silent there  a distracted language she does not undertand the dialect is particular to them that love and the cruel lady will find no sense in  because she is insensible she must not then play the critic too severely if she should chance to hear my complaints she must excuse my accusing her of ignorance what is it she does not understand but love vows curses melancholy madness hopes despair shunning pursuing passion discretion impatience resignation all these in one letter she would call a romantic heap of contradictions shuffled together yet they do all agree in me and work at once in my distracted mind if the greatest wit had put them together with the utmost art and passion they would express less than i feel the thoughts would be below my love and not above the truth  who can teach me to write to this terri lady that ignorant of the fatality of  charms might suspect the effects of the and when they are but faintly painted wo think the colors fierce what can i have  course to but plainness and sincerity s then without offense i may tell this tr what can the admiration of her wit the dence of her generosity and truth added  these that charming agreeableness in eve word in every look in every action w can all these produce but love with the ut passion o there the criminal word is  and yet she cannot be displeased though  without virtue without wit with little putation might pretend to be angry  were it too much for a man she has broug to the brink of despair for a man that wo die a thousand deaths to serve her to who life is a burden unless she make it easier  him o were it too much to beg leave wh he scarce ever sees her when he dare ne speak that he might sometimes ease his so in a respectful line has not every body etenal opportunities of speaking to her and  i that suffer more than ever man did not da almost to come near her i cannot doubt b you will judge impartially upon this occasion is it possible after having gazed upon tho searching eyes to escape their power is i possible to hear her words and cease adorin her is it possible to love to the distractio that they do who know her and not langui eternally after the sight of her is it possible when there is no hopes of seeing her to support the cruel absence without writing to her i know what you would say for you self think then what is the miserable condition of him who struggles with all these seeming impossibilities but to live near her and be as far from her as the antipodes and if i never see her only for some hasty moments in an age and in these separations not permitted to give the least ease to my distracted soul o were not dying preferable to this restless life for i fright my self if i write what i never intend to send and i awake in terrors if i but dream of her my hard fae condemns me to adore her in all the opposite and most tormentng circumstances of love with a distraction eading to madness yet with a reservedness that would shame philosophy and with a respect might suffice a deity with an impatience that gives an eternal rack to my soul yet could i wait hours days and weeks for one moments sight of her o the false fires with which the persecuting fops afflict your sex every way false they are not such as warm my breast though i could leap through flames to come to her and not feel more heat though i could swim through seas and not quench the flame yet i love with that coolness and temper with that command over my passion that rather than bring her to the least inconveniency i would renounce the utmost happiness if it were in my reach one would think this were enough to be allowed the most passionate the most miserable of men misery beyond this is hardly to be conceived this seems torment enough in love to drag an afflicted heart through so many distracted fears for such an eternity but to have lived accused of having deserved her anger to think i was accounted criminal that knew the tender faithful passion of my soul to live thus for ages for many months without obtaining one happy to be justified without doing any thing rash or indiscreet to show my innocence this you will sure allow to have been torment and discretion beyond any example  but i eternally find fault with the faint dscriptions i make of what i suffer and shou have an eternal task indeed were i to begi again till i could satisfy my self in what i say  her i love this and this alone justifies  forbidding the attempt since she only forbi what impossibility prevents for were my pasion to be described it would not be unfit  her to hear not to complain and endure  much is impossible but to hope for c without being able to describe the disea seems madness therefore alas i ask i see i hope for none let her but give me opi to allay my grief and only help me langui out life in less painful love what word what language can express my passionate rspect or give the least idea of the distracti of my soul she methinks and she alone the is capable of creating it might conceive i o were it but conceived i should not wholl be left unpitied in the wretched impossibility  one moments happiness or quiet she wou think with some conscience that from the fir moment i saw i heard her speak i have laguished out my life in neverceasing uneasness racks are forbidden for our bodies b our laws and is it lawful for her to torme and crueify my soul against the happy mment that i see her next may some genero friend advise her to consult that heart of her which would show more compassion where i were less necessary let her consider whethe there is nothing due to that faithful slave wh at all times in all places
