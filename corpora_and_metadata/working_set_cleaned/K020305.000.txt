internal violence invasions from abroad or dissentions at home the rage of foreign war or domestic faction  after a dangerous and exhausting war victory has at length restored peace to our bleeding country but in vain the sword of war is sheathed if in time of peace the poignard of licentiousness and faction is drawn and madly levelled by many of our countrymen at the breasts of their fellow subjects  to prevent the fatal consequences of this deluded or deluding spirit is the purpose of this essay in which the writer will endeavor to trace the present state of things to its general foundations by pointing out the real basis and genuine characteristics of true liberty by unmasquing the pretenses and laying open the secret sources and distinctive marks of licentiousness and faction  as the political principles here laid down and enforced will be found strictly connected with religion and morals no apology will be made for endeavoring to establish the public happiness of mankind on the solid basis of virtue which is the end of religion itself  in this point the writer confirms himself on the authority of an excellent and learned prelate whose political researches were of like tendency as the sum of human happiness is supposed to consist in the goods of mind body and fortune i would fain make my studies of some use to mankind with regard to each of these three particulars and hope it will not be thought faulty or indecent in any man of what profession soever to offer his mite toward improving the manners i will add the religion health and prosperity of his fellow creatures dr berkleys misc p       sect ii of the nature of civil liberty to some it will doubtless appear a superfluous labor to fix the true idea of civil liberty in a country which boasts itself free  yet the writer esteems it a necessary though obvious task not only that he may appeal to his idea of it thus established but also because in the conduct at least if not in the writings of his countrymen it seems to have been sometimes mistaken  the natural liberty of man considered merely as a solitary and savage individual would generally lead him to a full and unbounded prosecution of all his appetites some savages there are though few who live nearly if not altogether in this brutal state of nature  these last expressions it must be confessed are inadequate to their subject for such a state of man is worse than that of brutes and in the strict sense is also contrary to nature for brutes are endowed with unerring instincts which man possesses not therefore such a solitary and wretched state is strictly unnatural because it prevents the exertion of those powers which his nature is capable of attaining but those powers society alone can call forth into action  man is therefore formed for society that is man is formed for intercourse with man hence through the natural developement of the human powers a variety of new wants a necessity for mutual aids and distinct properties must arise from these a new accession as well as a frequent disagreement and clashing of desires must inevitably ensue hence the necessity of curbing and fixing the desires of man in the social state by such equal laws as may compel the appetites of each individual to yield to the common good of all  from this salutary restraint civil liberty is derived every natural desire which might in any respect be inconsistent with the general weal is given up as a voluntary tax paid for the higher more lasting and more important benefits which we reap from social life  sect iii of licentiousness and faction from the nature of civil liberty thus delineated the nature of licentiousness will easily be fixed being indeed no other than every desire carried into action which in any respect violates those equal laws established for the common benefit of the whole  thus an unlimited indulgence of appetite which in the savage state is called natural liberty in the social state is styled licentiousness  and licentiousness when its immediate object is that of thwarting the ends of civil liberty is distinguished by the name of faction  sect iv unassisted laws no permanent foundation of civil liberty these remarks are obvious and clear to every man possessed of the common degrees of understanding let us now consider what are the permanent foundations of civil libertythat is in other words what are the effectual means by which every member of society may be uniformly swayed impelled or induced to sacrifice his private desires or appetites to the welfare of the public  this is a subject which deserves a particular elucidation because in our own country and our own times it seems to have been much and dangerously mistaken  it has been affirmed as a first principle by certain writers and has been artfully or weakly suggested by others that the coercive power of human laws is sufficient to sustain itself that the legislator or magistrate has properly no concern with the private opinions sentiments or operations of the mind and that actions alone fall under the legal cognizance of those in power  the author of the fable of the bees has boldly laid down this which as a ruling principle pervades his whole work he professes himself the friend of liberty he derides private virtue as the offspring of flattery begotten upon pride he discards religion as a political fable he treats the principle of honor as an empty chimera he recommends private vices as public benefits fable of the bees passim and having thus levelled the whole fabric of manners and principles what do you think is the grand arcanum of his policy for the prevention of such crimes as would endanger the grandeur and stability of the state why  severe laws rugged officers pillories whippingposts jails and gibbets essay on charity schools   this principle of the sufficiency of human laws to sustain their own efficacy and power without regard to the opinions or principles of men has been at least indirectly held forth by other writers  an author who although a sincere was certainly an imprudent friend of liberty speaks in the following ambiguous style which if not designed to impress the principle here called in question is at least very liable to be interpreted into it it is foolish to say that government is concerned to meddle with the private thoughts and actions of men while they injure neither the society nor any of its members every man is in nature and reason the judge and disposer of his own domestic affairs and according to the rules of religion and equity every man must carry his own conscience so that neither has the magistrate a right to direct the private behavior of men nor has the magistrate or any body else any manner of power to model peoples speculations no more than their dreams government being intended to protect men from the injuries of one another and not to direct them in their own affairs in which no one is interested but themselves it is plain that their thoughts and domestic concerns are exempted entirely from its jurisdiction in truth mens thoughts are not subject to their own jurisdiction   let people alone and they will take care of themselves and do it best and if they do not a sufficient punishment will follow their neglect without the magistrates interposition and penalties it is plain that such busy care and officious intrusion into the personal affairs or private actions thoughts and imaginations of men has in it more craft than kindness  to quarrel with any man for his opinions humors or the fashion of his clothes is an offense taken without being given  true and impartial liberty is therefore the right of every man to pursue the natural reasonable and religious dictates of his own mind to think what he will and act as he thinks provided he acts not to the prejudice of another catos letters no      these expressions are crude inaccurate and ambiguous leaving the thoughtful reader at a loss for the authors precise and determined meaning for first they may possibly imply that the magistrate has no right to violate the laws of what is commonly called religious toleration or christian liberty but that every man has an unalienable right to worship god in that manner which accords to the dictates of his own conscience  in this sense they are rational and true and to this truth the writer has more than once born public testimony see vol of sermons sermon          but secondly they may imply that thoughts speculations opinions principles however received and imbibed by the mind of man have no connection with his actions at most no connection so necessary and strong as to give the magistrate a right to regulate them by any means whatever that no direction is to be given either to the grown or the infant mind that as every member of society has a right to hold what opinions and principles he pleases so he has the same privilege to communicate them to his family and children that they are to think what they will because thoughts and opinions are a private and personal affair that the magistrate is only concerned to regulate their actions  this is not only a possible interpretation but in all appearance the more natural of the two for it is not here once suggested by this author that opinions have any influence on actions but rather that they concern nobody but him who holds them it is true he speaks of them as being reasonable and religious but if they be the mere result of private and fortuitous thought unaided by the regulations of civil policy i see not why they may not more probably be unreasonable and irreligious because they are more likely to be modeled by ruling appetites than rational deduction  at the same time it is but justice to this author to say that he certainly meant not like the author of the fable of the bees to discard all moral principles as groundless and chimerical whatever his intentions were with regard to religion but his expressions are ambiguous and have been laid hold of by men of the most libertine opinions therefore in whatever sense they were written it is necessary to oppose them in that sense in which they have been received  and farther this is certain that the principle implied in this second interpretation has passed into a general maxim in this kingdom among those who pique themselves on unlimited freedom of thought these men have long and openly derided every regulation of opinion and principle have discarded all moral and religious instruction under the despised idea of prejudice of education have laid it down as their fundamental maxim that you are to think what you will only to act honestly not attending to that essential connection which subsists between thoughts opinions principles and actions  doubtless any society of men aiming at the establishment of civil liberty have a right to unite themselves on what conditions they please but it is the purpose of this essay to prove by reasonings confirmed by facts that a free community built on the maxims above delivered cannot be of long duration that the mere coercive power of human laws is not sufficient to sustain itself that there is a strong and unalterable connection between opinions and actions that a certain regulation of principles is necessary to check the selfish passions of man and prevent liberty from degenerating into licentiousness and that a certain system of manners and principles mutually supporting each other and pervading the whole community are the only permanent foundation on which true civil liberty can arise  the natural appetites passions and desires of man are the universal fountain of his actions without the impulse which he receives from those he would be at once unfeeling and inactive consequently according to the state and character of his desires his actions will naturally be good or evil innocent useful or destructive  were these desires universally coincident with the welfare and happiness of others no coercive power would be wanting as the means of producing and securing perfect liberty  but the acknowledged necessity of penal laws affords an incontestable proof that the unbridled desires of man are utterly inconsistent with the welfare and happiness of his fellow creatures  whatever means therefore are most effectual in curbing and subduing the selfish desires of man are the most effectual means of regulating his actions and establishing civil liberty on its most permanent foundations  the mere coercive power of human laws without an assistant regulation of the passions and desires is utterly inadequate to the great ends either of private happiness or public liberty  it cannot produce private happiness to the individual because while it leaves his mind open to be infested by every unruly passion that may arise it forbids him the gratification thus it sets the distracted soul at variance with itself the best consequence that can be hoped for is a continued conflict of fear and appetite of a dread of human laws warring with inordinate and selsish passions  it cannot be a permanent foundation of public liberty because while the passions are thus left without an inward control they will often be too strong for fear even where a legal punishment is the certain consequence for as they are suffered to subsist in their full vigor and when kindled in the soul are blind and headlong they will often carry away the whole man will bear him down in their gratification even to unavoidable destruction  still farther and chiefly human power cannot penetrate the secret recesses of the soul nor reach the dark intentions of the heart of man nor always be of weight to combat the strength of individuals hence cunning will often evade and force will often defy the coercive power of the bestformed laws thus public wisdom must give way to private gratification the innocent must become a prey to the guilty that is in other words liberty must be destroyed and licentiousness must triumph  sect v virtuous manners and principles the only permanent foundation of civil liberty what then are the permanent foundations on which perfect liberty can arise  i answer it can only arise on the power of such a system of manners and principles effectually impressed on the human mind as may be an inward curb to every inordinate desire or rather such as may so frame and model the human heart that its ruling desires may correspond coincide or coalesce with all the great and essential appointments of public law  the nature of man admits of this improvement though not in a perfect yet in a considerable degree he is born with appetites suited to his own preservation and the continuance of his species beyond this he is by nature at once selfish and social compassionate and resentful docile either to good or evil and hence capable of acquiring new habits new passions new desires either to the welfare or destruction of his fellow creatures  virtuous manners i call such acquired habits of thought and correspondent action as lead to a steady prosecution of the general welfare  virtuous principles i call such as tend to confirm these habits by superinducing the idea of duty  virtuous manners are a permanent foundation for civil liberty because they lead the passions and desires themselves to coincide with the appointments of public law the infant mind is pregnant with a variety of passions but it is in the power of those who are entrusted with the education of youth in a considerable degree to determine the bent of the nascent passions to fix them on salutary objects or let them loose to such as are pernicious or destructive  here then lie the first foundations of civil liberty in forming the habits of the youthful heart to a coincidence with the general welfare in checking every rising appetite that is contrary to this and in forwarding every passion that may promote the happiness of the community in implanting and improving benevolence selfcontroul humility integrity and truth in preventing or suppressing the contrary habits of selfishness intemperance pride dishonesty and falsehood in teaching the young mind to delight as far as is possible in every virtue for its own sake in a word in so forming the pleasures and displeasures of the opening heart that they may coalesce and harmonize with the laws of public freedom  above all this will give stability to civil liberty if the social passions of individuals can be so far extended as to include the welfare of the whole community as their chief and primary object this affection is distinguished by the name of public spirit or the love of our country the highest passion that can sway the human heart considered as a permanent foundation of true liberty  but in some minds the selfish passions are strong and the social ones weak or wanting and in the best formed heart incidental temptations may arise and overturn its preestablished habits therefore it is a necessary measure for the security of private virtue and public freedom that virtuous principles be likewise implanted in the heart such principles i mean as may strengthen the good habits of thought and action already contracted by superinducing the idea of duty  of these there are but three which can sway the manners of men and confirm the foundation of civil liberty these are religion honor and natural conscience the first has the deity for its object the second the applause of men the third the approbation of our own heart the frame and situation of man admits of no other principle from whence the idea of duty can arise  the principle of religion tends to this end of confirming civil liberty as it induces the idea of duty and urges the performance of it on the belief of a just omnipotent and allseeing god who approves and condemns will reward or punish according as our thoughts and actions are good or evil  but as the means of rendering religion a firm ally and support of liberty it is necessary that their dictates should be coincident that is that the thoughts and actions which religion prescribes as duties and forbids as sins should coincide with the dictates and appointments of public law in free countries this is the natural state of religion which commonly either bends to the established laws of the community or moulds them into its own genius and complexion  the principle of honor affords a concomitant support of civil liberty when properly directed it works by a powerful and universal passion our fondness for the applause of men but in free countries this principle is much more liable to abuse than that of religion because it is apt be be warped by the fashionable and ruling manners of the times for whatever is fashionable is apt to draw respect and applause whatever is unfashionable is for the present entitled only to contempt hence the principle of honor becomes fluctuating and uncertain in its nature and therefore in its effects a regulation of this principle therefore is of the most important consequence because if left to its own fantastic dictates it will often endanger instead of strengthening the foundations of public freedom  the third principle that of natural conscience which tends to confirm the establishment of liberty is founded in the approbation of our own heart this principle is in one respect independent on the other two but in another respect seems to stand intimately related to them it is independent of them as it neither looks out for the approbation of god nor the applause of men it seems intimately related to them because on a strict examination of the human frame as well as the history of mankind it appears generally to be the result of the one or other or both we transplant the acknowledged approbation of heaven and the applause of men into our own heart and from this through the fertile power of association springs a new principle of selfapprobation and selfreproof as an additional regulator of our thoughts and actions  it is true many writers have resolved the particular dictates of natural conscience into an unchangeable principle of right and wrong arising universally in the human heart there is no doubt but the general principle of selfapprobation or selfrebuke arises in an universal manner in some degree or other but as it appears from the history of human nature that the particular dictates of this conscience vary with the other received principles of the mind it is not necessary to debate or dwell on this speculative point we may take it as a truth confirmed by facts that the particular dictates of natural conscience will generally be founded on those of religion and honor  hence then it appears that this principle of conscience stands in need of a guide in the same degree as those principles on which it is founded if it be founded on the religion of a free state it will generally coincide with the principles of freedom if its foundations are laid in the mere principle of honor its dictates will be fantastic as those of its parent and will therefore require a parallel regulation  each of these principles singly taken is of power in some degree or other to strengthen the basis of civil liberty on their united influence added to the force of preestablished habits of thought and manners public freedom might seem to arise on immovable and everlasting foundations  but as the nature of man even in his most virtuous state is imperfect and inconsistent so in spite of the most salutary institutions some defects will intrude hence from an unavoidable alloy of vice civil liberty must ever be imperfect a certain degree of licentiousness that is of private will opposing the public will always mix itself and in some degree contaminate the purity of every commonwealth  yet while virtuous manners and principles clearly predominate in their effects a state may still be justly called free  but in proportion as these manners and principles decay and their contraries rise into power and action public freedom must necessarily decline for in that case the passions and powers of the human mind are all set in conspiracy against the dictates of public law hence unbridled passions will have their course every mans heart and hand will be set against his brethren and the general cement of society which bound all together being thus dissolved even without any external violence offered the commonwealth through its internal corruption must fall in pieces  sect vi an objection considered doubtless it will be objected nay it has been objected by the patrons of unlimited freedom of thought that this is indeed a system of slavery that it is building civil liberty on the servitude of the mind and shackling the infant soul with early prejudice  in answer to this plausible objection the writer replies what he has elsewhere advanced sermons on education etc p    etc that a prejudice does not imply as is generally supposed the falsehood of the opinion instilled but only that it is taken up and held without its proper evidence thus the infant mind may be prejudiced in favor of truth as well as falsehood and neither can the one or the other thus instilled be properly called more than an opinion  farther the infant mind cannot remain in a state of indifference and inaction either with regard to habits of conduct or principles and opinions habits impressions beliefs principles of one kind or other the growing mind will inevitably contract from its communication with mankind if therefore rational habits and principles be not infused in order to preclude absurdities it is odds but absurdities will get the start and preclude all rational habits and opinions the passions and the reason of a child will put themselves in action however wretched and inconsistent in the same manner as his limbs will make an effort toward walking however awkward and absurd the same objection therefore that lies against instilling salutary habits and principles will arise against teaching him to walk erect this being indeed a violation of the natural freedom of the body as the other is of the natural liberty of the passions and the mind the consequences too are of the same nature for sure a child left to the direction of his own appetites and reason would stand the same chance to grovel in absurdities as to crawl on hands and knees and wallow in the mire  neither is there any difference with respect to the real and internal freedom of the mind between opinions instilled and opinions caught by accident for in truth the mind cannot be compelled to receive any habit of thought principle or opinion these may indeed be offered to the infant mind but the reception of them is its own voluntary act and is equally so whether they be presented by fortuitous incidents or designed instruction all the difference is that in the first case such a system of habits and opinions will certainly arise as tend to the destruction of society in the second such a system of habits and opinions may be infused into the free mind as will lay a sure and lasting foundation of public liberty and happiness  nay if any difference could arise with respect to the true freedom of the mind surely that mind ought in the eye of reason to be adjudged most free which adopts a system of thought and action founded on the wisdom of the agreeing society rather than that which is suffered to be incurably tainted with the vague and random conceptions of untutored infancy  this at lest is consonant with the old stoic principle that the wise man alone is free solus sapiens liber   much has been said in our times indeed concerning the force of unassisted human reason the writer would not willingly either flatter or degrade its powers but to him it appears that they are superficially informed of the frame and tenor of the human mind who think that mere reason as it exists in man is more than a power of discerning and choosing the properest means for obtaining his desired ends whether these ends be good or evil the passions preestablished habits and infused principles of the soul are the universal motives to human action where these point not to an end desired reason may indolently exercise its eye but can never find nor create an object of force sufficient to put the powers of the soul and body in motion hence human reason must always receive its particular cast and color from the preestablished passions habits and principles will ever form its ruling ideas of good and evil right and wrong just and unjust from these great fountains of human action  the history of human nature confirms this truth hence it is that this boasted human reason is indeed so poor and unprofitable a possession being warped and molded into that particular form which the varying accidents of climate soil established manners religion policy bodily frame or prevailing passions and principles chance to give it  hence then it appears that the private freedom of the infant mind is not violated but only directed to its best end by early and salutary instruction hence it appears to be the proper destination of man that he shall not be left to the follies of his own weak understanding and nascent passions that he shall not be left fortuitously to imbibe the maxims of corrupt times and manners maxims which setting aside all regard to their speculative truth or falsehood do lead to the dissolution of law and freedom but that he shall be conducted voluntarily to adopt those habits and principles which have been consecrated by the approbation of the best and wisest men in every age and nation such in particular as are suitable to the laws the customs the genius of his own free country such in a word as are a secure foundation of public liberty  sect vii a confirmation of these principles drawn from the history of free states  st of sparta these reasonings founded on the nature and constitution of man will receive a strong and unanswerable confirmation from the history of free states hence we shall obtain the clearest evidences of fact that while virtuous manners and principles retained their efficacy and power civil liberty remained unshaken that as these decayed liberty declined that as soon as these were lost liberty was no more licentiousness crept in faction triumphed and overwhelmed these degenerate states in one common ruin  to this purpose i shall briefly analyze the genius of the three most eminent republics that are recorded in story those of sparta athens and rome the events are sufficiently known to those who are conversant in ancient history but the fundamental and leading causes of these events deserve a particular investigation they will form a concurrent proof of the principles here given  the republic of sparta claims the first place both on account of its antiquity and perfection by its perfection is meant not the moral perfection of its particular institutions but of the means and principles by which these institutions were secured  the leading institutions which lycurgus fixed as the essence of his commonwealth were these which follow    he established a senate of twentyeight as an intermediate power between that of prince and people   he made an equal partition of lands and goods among the free members of the community   he introduced the use of iron money instead of gold and silver   he banished or prevented all the arts of commerce elegance and luxury   he ordained that all the members of the society should eat together and partake alike of the same coarse fare   he established an occasional community of wives so that a wife was not so much the property of her husband as of the republic to the end of population   with a parallel view he ordained a kind of community of children by this no father had the care of his own child which on its birth was immediately delivered over to the officers of the state and was either preserved or destroyed according to their decree   a continued attention to the preservation of the state and an unremitted preparation and readiness for defensive war formed the chief employment of the spartan state   he committed the cultivation of their lands to a large body of slaves who dwelt in the surrounding country were deprived of all the natural rights of men and were often laid in wait for and butchered in cold blood by the young men of sparta this enormity practiced with impunity by the young men of sparta has been held unaccountable but seems to have been allowed on the same warlike principle with that other allowance of stealing victuals both were probably established as the means of preparing them for the exercise of stratagem in war   these were the public and essential institutions of the spartan republic many of them strange in their nature yet formed for long duration through the means and principles on which they were established which we shall find to be consistent with and corroborative of the principles of civil liberty above laid down  the first and best security of civil liberty has been shown to consist in impressing the infant mind with such habits of thought and action as may correspond with and promote the appointments of public law  this security was laid by lycurgus in the deepest and most effectual manner by the mode of education which he prescribed to the spartan youth  no father had a right to educate his children according to the caprice of his own fancy they were delivered to public officers who initiated them early in the manners the maxims the exercises the toils in a word in all the mental and bodily acquirements and habits which corresponded with the genius of the state family connexions had no place the first and leading object of their affection was the general welfare this tuition was carefully continued till they were enrolled in the list of men to secure the manners thus acquired they were prohibited from traveling into other countries lest they should catch infection from ill example on the same foundation all visits from strangers were forbidden plutarch in lycurgo thus were they strongly and unalterably possessed with the love of their country  these severe manners were confirmed by all the principles that could strengthen them in the mind of man  the principle of religion laid at the very foundation of the state for lycurgus expressly modeled his commonwealth on the pretense of a divine authority he declared to the people that its essential institutions were given him by the oracle of delphi which he went on purpose to consult plutarch in lycurgo again after he had modeled his republic he repaired once more to the sacred tripod and enquired whether the god approved of the laws he had established the answer was in the affirmative and this reply lycurgus sent to sparta ib   this principle was so intimately blended with that of the state that their kings were at the same time the high priests of the community ib  the religion and power of an oath was so strongly impressed on their minds that lycurgus trusted the future execution of his laws to that oath which the people took on his last departure from the city plutarch in lycurgo  an oath which proves that the religion of the country was not at variance with the appointments of the state because it obliged them never to depart from the institutions of lycurgus  the principle of honor was not at variance but cooperated with and sustained that of religion plutarch is very particular on their early and continued encouragement of this principle their songs which made a part of their education tended to inflame their minds with honest ambition their subject was generally the praise of such men as had died in defense of their country or in derision of those who had shrunk from the public service the old men talked high of what they had done the younger part echoed back their song declaring their resolution not to disgrace the valor of their forefathers plutarch in lycurgo   the principle of natural conscience was so intimately interwoven with those of their religion and honor that it affords a striking proof how far natural conscience depends on these other principles if natural conscience were in itself a wellregulated and sufficient guide could any thing have been more odious to its dictates than prostitution adultery thieving and assassination yet all these did the severe spartans practice not only without remorse but with selfapprobation the infant mind being beforehand modeled to this preposterous system of imagined duty for on the very ruling principles of the state their daughters were debauched their wives were common their victuals were stolen their slaves were murdered ib   thus was the famed republic of sparta strongly fortified by the united and concurrent power of manners and principles all pointing to the same end the strength and duration of the state of manners and principles which in their particular application seemed to sacrifice the happiness of individuals to the preservation of the whole and while they were most abhorrent from the maxims of improved human nature secured the institutions of a savage policy  from this view of the spartan commonwealth these farther remarks may naturally arise    it has been matter of surprise to those who have written on this famed republic by what means lycurgus should be able to persuade the spartans not only to change the form of their government but to quit their private possessions their manner of life the use of money the advantages of commerce the property of their wives the care of their children and adopt a contrary system so abhorrent from the desires of civilized man and indeed supposing the fact it should seem a paradox utterly unaccountable  the true solution seems of a quite different nature  plutarch leads me to it  there is so much uncertainty says he in the accounts which historians have left us of lycurgus that scarce any thing is asserted by one which is not contradicted by others their sentiments are quite different as to the family he came of the voyages he undertook the place and manner of his death but most of all when they speak of the laws he made and the commonwealth he founded  they cannot be brought to agree as to the very age when he lived  timaeus conjectures that there were two of his name and in different times but that the one being more famous than the other men gave to him the glory of both their exploits plutarch in lycurgo   hence it appears that the true history of this lawgiver was lost in the darkness of fabulous and obscure ages and that as to the beginnings of this commonwealth we have nothing to depend on but the traditionary rumors of a barbarous and lying period now this seems to be fairly weighed down by the internal evidence arising from the nature of the establishment itself for it was indeed the establishment of barbarous manners carried into permanency by political institutions that mankind should be carried back to this from a state of humanity and civilization  that they should quit private property money commerce decency domestic comforts wives and children and give them up to the possession of the public is a contradiction to all the known powers and passions of the human mind to effect a change of government only is a work sufficient for the abilities of the greatest legislator but to overturn all the preestablished habits of the head and heart to destroy or reverse all the fixed associations maxims manners and principles of a whole civilized community were a labor which might well be ranked among the most extravagant legends of fabulous greece  on the other hand to bring forward a tribe of untaught savages one degree toward civilization and there to fix them  to assign equal portions of land to those among whom lands laid in common  to introduce iron money where no money had been in use  to prohibit commerce where commerce was almost unknown  to make the girls dance naked in public where they had never known the decent use of clothes  to allow of theft and homicide under certain limitations where both had been practiced without limitation  to make wives at times a public property where promiscuous concubinage had prevailed to give children a public education where no education had taken place  these might all seem the natural and practicable efforts of a pagan legislator  thus the formation of the spartan republic seems clearly accounted for a tribe of untaught savages were brought forward by lycurgus one degree toward civilization and humanity and there fixed by severe institutions  the fate of agis their patriot king confirms this solution he with a degree of public virtue seldom seen in any station attempted to bring back the corrupt state to its first rigorous institutions but that which lycurgus could establish among untaught savages agis found impracticable among a corrupted people he was seized imprisoned and murdered by a faction in his attempt to restore freedom to a degenerate republic    if the argument here alleged be just concerning the first institution of this republic it follows what indeed seems probable in its own nature that the strongest political institutions may be formed on the savage state of man in this period the legislator has few or no prior institutions to contend with and therefore can form a system of legislation consistent with itself in all its parts while the lawgiver who reforms a state already modeled and corrupted must content himself with such partial regulations as the force of prior establishments and public habits will admit    the long united state of this republic afford a proof against a political maxim commonly received that divisions are necessary to a free state and that inward tranquillity is a certain symptom of its approaching ruin for from the history of sparta it appears that during the space of at least five hundred years intestine divisions were unknown this common and mistaken maxim adopted by almost all political writers among others by machiavel and montesquieu  has been founded on a supposition that where opinion is free it must ever be divided the spartan commonwealth presents a clear proof of the reverse that opinion may be free yet still united but this free union can only be the happy effect of an early and rigorous education by which the growing minds of the community are voluntarily led by public institutions into one common channel of habit principle and action plutarch tells us that the effect of this entire union was so conspicuous in sparta that the commonwealth resembled one great and powerful person actuated by one soul rather than a state composed of many individuals in lycurgo     it appears that the institutions of the spartan republic were admirably calculated for each others support while their perfect union was maintained and further that when an inroad was made into any one of them the ruin of the whole was inevitable  its institutions were admirably calculated for each others support while their perfect union was maintained because they tended strongly to prevent the first inroads of temptation to the mind the very first impulses of selfish passion the equal partition of lands and goods took away all hope of superiority in wealth the introduction of iron money rendered wealth cumbersome and untractable the prohibition of commerce prevented the materials of luxury the banishment of elegant arts prevented the first conception of them their public meals eaten in common cut off the hope nay prevented the desire of all private indulgence of the palate the disorders of intemperance to secure these rigid institutions the public education of their children was ordained lest private passion should mix its alloy with the rigorous appointments of the state thus the republic was so round and compact in all its parts that it might seem to defy the attacks of the most powerful enemy  but supposing an inroad made into any one of its capital institutions the ruin of the whole was inevitable for its several parts receiving their strength from each other were therefore mutually dependent and the whole being an austere contradiction to the natural appetites of man the least inroad of indulgence naturally led on to more forcible temptations thus inequality of possessions brought in wealth and poverty wealth brought in luxury poverty gave birth to envy and avarice licentiousness and faction thus crept in and the fall of sparta was inevitable  yet even amidst the decays of this republic the force of a rigorous education essentially mixed with the principles of the state was still conspicuous the power of manners and maxims thus imbibed was so untractable even in the declining periods of the spartan commonwealth that philopaemen after many fruitless attempts to annihilate its influence declared that the only effectual method of destroying sparta must be in dissolving the education of their youth plutarch in philopaem   this analysis is clearly confirmed by plutarch in the following passages since we may blame the legislators of common rank who through want of power or wisdom commit mistakes in the formation of fundamental laws how much more may we censure the conduct of numa who for the reputation of his wisdom only being called by the general voice of an unsettled people to be their king did not in first place constitute laws for the education of children and discipline of youth for want of which men become seditious and turbulent and live not peaceable in their families and tribes but when they are inured from their cradle to good principles and imbibe from their infancy the rules of morality they receive such impressions of virtue as convinces them of that advantage which mutual concord brings to a commonwealth this with many others was one of the policies of lycurgus and was of singular force in the confirmation and establishment of his laws  hence the spartans having sucked in these principles with their milk were possessed with a most reverend esteem of all his institutions so that the fundamentals of his laws continued in force for above five hundred years without any violation comparison of numa and lycurgus   such then was the force of concurrent manners and principles all centering on one point impressed on the infant mind and continued by a variety of rigorous institutions  thus the strength of the spartan republic like the firmcompacted weight of the macedonian phalanx bore down every opposing power  sect viii of the republic of athens we have seen the force of manners principles in the strong formation the unanimity and continuance of the spartan state we shall now see the effects of the want of manners and principles in the weak establishment the unceasing factions and early dissolution of the commonwealth of athens  it appears above that lycurgus probably forming his people in the first and earliest period of civilization was thus enabled to establish a perfect republic solon on the contrary having a corrupted people to reform could only institute such a kind of government as their preestablished habits vices and forms of polity could admit  here we discover the foundation of that striking remark of solon himself that he gave not the athenians the best laws that could be given but the best they were capable of receiving plut solon   the first and ruling defect in the institution of this republic seems to have been the total want of an established education suited to the genius of the state there appears not to have been any public regular or prescribed appointment of this kind beyond what custom had accidentally introduced it is true that the parents often had masters to instruct their children in the gymnastic arts and in music which last in the ancient acceptance of the word included poem as well as melody it is farther true that the poems thus taught their children included often the great actions but withal the vices of gods and ancient heroes see a dissertation on music and poetry sect v yet in this first and ruling circumstance in the institution of a free state the parents were much at liberty to do as seemed good to them hence a dissimilar and discordant system of manners and principles took place while some youthful minds were imbibed with proper and virtuous principles some with no principles and some with vicious principles with such as must therefore on the whole tend to shake the foundations of true freedom  the second ruling defect in the constitution of this republic was the establishment of an unmixed and absolute democracy this naturally arose from the licentious state of manners and prinples which solon found already prevalent among the people a virtuous people would have been content to have shared the legislative power with the higher ranks of the commonwealth but a licentious people naturally grasped the whole as the likliest means in their deluded eye of gratifying their own unbridled passions from this partial distribution of power the state was blindly ruled by the dregs of the community for all who were of ability to maintain a horse were admitted to the rank of magistracy plut in solon and all who were admitted to the rank of magistracy were excluded from any share in the legislative power ib hence it followed that all they who possessed the legislative power were such as were not of ability to maintain a horse  do not you despise said socrates to his pupil alcibiades who was afraid to speak in presence of the athenian people do not you despise that cobbler i do replied the youth do not you rejoyned the philospher equally contemn that crier and yon tentmaker alcibiades confessing that he did then said socrates is not the body of the athenian people composed of men like these and therefore when you despise the individuals why should you fear the whole aeliani var hist l ii c     a hopeful tribe of legislators and such as might naturally be supposed to give rise to that licentiousness discord and ruin in which they were soon swallowed up  from this weak and imperfect establishment founded on the caprices of an ignorant unprincipled and licentious populace all the subsequent factions which ended in the ruin of this republic are clearly derived  even solon the original legislator outlived the commonwealth he had formed on his departure from athens factions immediately arose pisistratus the first ruling demagogue led the people obtained a guard seized the castle and established a tyranny plut in solon   we need go no farther into the history of this republic for a discovery of the causes of its final ruin it is true that an imperfect semblance of liberty often appeared amidst the factions of succeeding times it is true that wealth and luxury contributed to hasten the fall of athens it is true that pericles and alcibiades in their turn while they seemed to polish the manners inflamed the vices of the populace and led them on to the certain destruction of the state but for the ruin of this commonwealth we need not have recourse to the inroads of wealth or luxury as the causes of its dissolution it resembled a beautiful edifice founded in sand and rubbish where an uneducated an unprincipled a licentious populace ruled the state that state was destined to the convulsive struggles of faction while it lived and then to a speedy death  sect ix of the commonwealth of rome let us now pass to a review of the commonwealth of rome in the history and fate of which we shall find most abundant proof of the truths here laid down concerning the power of manners and principles in the preservation or the dissolution of public freedom  montesquieu remarks finely in his discourse on this republic that more states have perished through a violation of manners than through a violation of laws grandeur etc  the reason though he does not assign it appears evident on the principles here given he who violates established manners strikes at the general foundation he who violates law strikes only at a particular part of the superstructure of the state  in the republic of sparta we have seen the original state of manners and principles conspiring strongly to the preservation of the republic in that of athens we have seen the original state of manners and principles tending no less clearly to its dissolution  in analyzing the original state of manners and principles in the roman commonwealth we shall find a different and intermediate state of things mixing the strength of the spartan with the weakness of the athenian institutions tending first to enlarge and aggrandize the republic and in the end to corrupt and destroy it  the manners and principles of early rome which tended to enlarge and aggrandize the republic were   a love of their country instilled into their rising youth formed chiefly on the power of custom and more particularly on the warlike genius of the state their annals abound with so many instances of this grand passion that present times stand amazed and with difficulty credit their story    this passion founded on an early though not a prescribed education was so strengthened by their religious system that till the fatal entrance of the doctrine of epicurus no roman was ever known to have violated his oath see montesq grand des romans c x polyb l       their principle of honor coincided with that of their religion it was so strong at the time of the first formation of the republic that the punishment of disgrace was judged sufficient to deter the people from a violation of the laws when a delinquent was cited before the people says livy the valerian law ordained only that he should be branded as infamous live hist l  0     from the truths laid down above it appears that the principle of natural conscience must of course cooperate with these for the confirmation of civil freedom the force of this principle is no less conspicuous in the early periods of roman liberty it arose even into a ferocious pride of virtue independent of all outward testimony which has distinguished the great names of ancient rome from those of every other people upon earth    to these we must add the equality of property the mediocrity of possession the simplicity of life which prevailed in early rome all these were the outworks that guarded the internal strength of manners and principles and seemed like the institutions of sparta to promise an eternity of freedom  but in spite of all these foundations of civil liberty there were three fatal circumstances admitted into the very essence of the republic which contained the seeds of certain ruin while the tree seemed to flourish in its full growth and vigor these like cankerworms lay eating at the root  the first of these was the neglect of instituting public laws by which the education of their children might have been ascertained this is justly charged by plutarch as a capital defect in numas legislation see above sect vii this defect when once admitted into the essence of the state could not easily be rectified in succeeding times the principle could only have been effectually infused at the general formation of the whole mass in consequence of this error in the first concoction the supporting principles of freedom were vague and fluctuating for want of this preventing power the incidental vices of a parent were naturally transmitted to his children and thence to future ages the rigorous education of sparta was a strong check to the proneness of human nature toward degeneracy and corruption through this every incidental vice died with its first possessor while the more lax institution of the roman republic suffered every original taint in manners and principles to be transfused into and to contaminate succeeding times  the second of these was their principle of unlimited conquest their early passion for war arose from their necessities on their first establishment they had neither territory nor commerce they lived by plunder hence the ruling genius of the state was warlike their warlike genius was unchecked by any other principle hence unremitted exercises unceasing improvements in discipline increasing valor and ferocity arose thus they attempted to subdue and thus they subdued the world  but such an empire is utterly untenable valor may acquire but cannot maintain it the body of such a state is too enormous to be effectually animated by the soul this is a cause of ruin so clear that it has met every writers observation and therefore needs no farther proof  the third principle of inevitable destruction which seems to have been inwrought into the very essence of the roman republic was the fatal principle of change this is a cause not so obvious and therefore may require a farther investigation  montesquieu has justly observed that one cause of the roman greatness was their adopting any institution or custom of other nations whom they conquered provided it was better than their own grandeur etc c i ii  it seems to have escaped the observation of this great writer that the same principle of adoption carried through every period of the republic led the way to its final ruin  for although in the early periods when manners were simple and concurrent principles were strong this spirit of adoption was confined to customs that were better than their own yet in the succeeding periods when manners grew more relaxed and principles were weakened the same spirit of adoption opened a door for the admission of customs that were pernicious  thus the admission of change which in the virtuous ages led to the greatness in succeeding times brought on the destruction of the republic  the sagacious romans soon found the consequences of this defect they saw that through a want of original preventive and salutary institutions bad manners were creeping insensibly on the state hence the creation of the censors had its rise an office which immediately took cognizance of the manners of the citizens  but this high office was ineffectual in its end because it had not power universally to prevent but only in part to remedy the evil hence while particular and detected offenses only could be punished by the censor the hearts and manners of the people were laid open to a general corruption from the fatal principle of novelty and adoption  the danger arising from this principle manifestly increased with the increasing empire that identity and integrity of manners and principles which is the soul and security of every free state gave way to manners and principles wholly dissimilar new maxims of life new principles of religion and irreligion of honor and dishonor of right and wrong picked up indiscriminately among the nations which they conquered by degrees infused themselves into the heads and hearts of the roman citizens  here then we see the original foundation of all the misery and ruin which ensued on the conquest of the luxurious immoral and unprincipled tribes of greece the romans having no preventive remedy in the essence of their state of course adopted the luxury the immoralities the irreligion of the conquered people  it seems to me says the excellent montesquieu that the epicurean sect which made its way into rome toward the close of the republic contributed much to corrupt the hearts of the romans the greeks had been infatuated with it before them accordingly they were sooner corrupt polybius tells us that in his time no greek could be trusted on the security of his oath whereas a roman was inevitably bound by it grandeur etc c x   he adds cyneas having discoursed on the epicurean system at the table of pyrrhus fabricius wished that all the enemies of rome might hold the principles of such a sect ib   thus as in the early periods of the commonwealth they had adopted the virtues in the later times they assumed the vices of the conquered nations thus by unperceived gradations the same principle the admission of change first led to the greatness and then to the ruin of the republic  all the particular consequences that followed were occasional and inevitable the rapacity the factions the civil wars the enormous profligacy of individuals the horrible calamities of the state  all these are finely pursued by montesquieu and were no more than the natural and incidental effects of this general cause the loss of manners and principles  hence the progress and retreat of the roman power resembled the flow and the ebb of a vast ocean which rowzed from its bed by central concussions overwhelmed and forsook the earth  sect x how far these facts can properly be applied to the political state of great britain though the study of history be often instructive and useful yet in one respect it becomes the source of frequent error even when it is written with impartiality and truth this arises from a mistaken application of historical facts errors of this kind are apt to creep into all reasonings on every subject where men and manners are concerned but they are liable to infect political reasonings above all others  as the political interests of men form the principal subject of history the reasoner on this subject has recourse to facts as the best support of his argument yet the politician seems of all others most liable to be mistaken in the application of history to his own purpose because the political connexions and interests of men are above all others complicated and various  hence as no two political constitutions were ever the same in all their circumstances though similar in many so all arguments drawn from a partial resemblance must be inadequate and inconclusive unless when it appears that no other circumstances took place by which that partial resemblance might be counteracted and its effects destroyed  yet it has been a practice too common among political reasoners from a partial resemblance between two states to infer a total one and because they have been like in some respects to draw conclusions as if they had been like in all  much caution therefore is necessary in the application of historical facts without this we shall run into perpetual error let us then remark some of the most essential circumstances in which the constitution of the british state differs from those of sparta athens and rome and then draw such conclusions as may be consistent with these distinctions    we may lay it down as a fundamental truth generally acknowledged that the political constitution of great britain in its main outline is better modeled than those of sparta athens or rome the legislative and executive powers are more equally balanced and more clearly distinguished now if laws could support themselves it would follow that this political state must therefore be of longer duration but as it has been made appear that the duration of free states depends not so much on their mere form as on the manners and principles which support them so nothing can be decided concerning the duration of the british state from its mere external model    the christian religion established in britain is in its own nature far superior to that of these ancient commonwealths the absolute perfection and glorious attributes of the deity the great principle of universal charity the particular duties of man to man thence resulting the sanctions of future reward and punishment all these tend to purify and exalt the soul far beyond the rites of ancient paganism for this even in its best forms was ever built on the history and examples of deifyd men whose lives had often been blotted with the most flagrant crimes and therefore could never exalt the heart of man beyond this weak principle of elevation  but as the power of a religion depends not only on its excellent genius but on its being effectually impressed on the mind so no consequence can be justly drawn from the mere unapplyd excellence of its nature    that selfconsistence and perfect unity of parts which distinguished the republic of sparta cannot be expected nor found in that of britain for the first was the entire work of a single legislator struck out at one heat all its institutions conspiring to one end and centering like the radii of a circle in one single point to this the outward form of government the internal state of education of religion manners and principles were uniformly subordinate but at the time of the revolution which was the first era of britains freedom many prior institutions and establishments both in religion and policy manners and principles had taken place these had been formed on the fortuitous events of time and had resulted from a variety of contending parties of power fluctuating at different periods between the kings the nobles the priesthood and the people all these it was impossible for human art to remove and newmodel without shaking the state to its foundations hence though the form of the british constitution civil and religious be of unrivaled excellence yet in its very birth it came attended with unalterable weakness  it wanted that general selfconsistence that entire unity of parts as well as of established habits manners and principles suited to the genius of the state which was the very spirit and support of the spartan commonwealth in this circumstance it appears likewise inferior to the roman commonwealth yet perhaps superior to that of athens    the british system of polity and religion perfect in its leading parts but imperfectly united and supported is not upheld in its native power like that of sparta by correspondent and effectual rules of education the fundamental laws of our country the principles and duties of christianity are indeed occasionally explained and taught in a certain manner and degree but it is in the power of every private man to educate his child not only without a reverence for these but in an absolute contempt of them it is much in every parents option whether he will impress his childrens hearts with such habits and principles as accord to the genius of the state or with impunity suffer them to contract such manners and opinions as tend to its dissolution a circumstance pregnant with danger to this free state for hence manners and principles its chief support are liable to be incurably perverted in the heart at that time of life in which alone they can be effectually impressed    in the important circumstance of the admission of change or the principle of adoption the british constitution is contrary to that of sparta and nearly on a level with those of athens and rome  foreign commerce foreign travel new manners new principles new modes of dress of amusement of luxury are here adopted with a degree of avidity almost unbounded  happy would the writer esteem his labors if this principle which in some respects has tended so much to the improvement of his country could in any degree be checked by his weak admonitions from degenerating into a cause of its destruction    the last circumstance of note here to be remarked is the difference of character among the several ranks of the community in these ancient free states and that of britain  in point of knowledge and ability the difference was great between the nobles and the people in these ancient states in britain the nobles and the people in their legislative capacity are fairly on a level when alcibiades addressed the legislative body of the athenian people he addressed cobblers brasiers tanners tentmakers when the people of rome retired in discontent to the sacred mountain they were appeased by the fable of the belly head and hands a lord of parliament would make but a sorry figure who should come armed with such an apologue for the conviction of a british house of commons  again in each of these ancient republics the collective body of the people were much of one uniform character being inhabitants of the same city and nearly on a level with respect to employment and property in athens they were all artisans or tradesmen in sparta and rome they were all soldiers a low degree of knowledge was their general lot for much knowledge can only be acquired by much leisure which their occupations did not allow the people of sparta were intentionally virtuous those of athens were corrupt those of rome were of a mixed character as these free states voted not by representatives the presence of the people was necessary in all decisions of a public nature hence such a people from their ignorance wants collective presence and pride of power must ever and suddenly be swayed by the eloquence of public demagogues  but the collective body of the people of britain are of a nature and character less uniform and essentially different they may properly be divided into two classes the people of the kingdom and the populace of its cities  the populace of its cities resemble those of athens in most things except only that they are not possessed of the legislative power for the people of athens were a body of laborers and mechanics who earned their bread with the sweat of their brows too generally ignorant and illeducated too generally prosligate in manners and void of principle  but the people of this kingdom in their collective body are upon the whole of a quite different character for under this title are properly comprehended all those who send representatives for the counties to parliament this catalogue will include the landed gentry the beneficed country clergy many of the more considerable merchants and men in trade the substantial and industrious freeholders or yeomen a collective body of men with all their incidental failings as different in character from the populace of any great city as the air of richmond hill from that of billingsgate or wapping  sect xi of the general state of manners and principles about the time of the revolution at this famed period it is evident that the manners and principles of the nation did upon the whole tend to the establishment of liberty otherwise liberty had not been established this revolution was perhaps the noblest public reform that ever was made in any state and such a reform nothing but the prevalence of upright manners and principles could have effected  the religious principle of protestant christianity seems to have taken the lead even of the love of civil freedom the dread of popery was at least equal to that of arbitrary power the national honor and conscience on the whole coincided with and confirmed the christian principle these three united powers raised liberty to the brightest throne she ever sat on a throne which nothing but their contraries can shake  yet notwithstanding the unrivaled excellence of this civil and religious establishment there could be little hope of its immediate and perfect efficacy declaimers may express their wonder that a system so perfect should not at once attain its end but they who take a nearer view of the manners and principles of those times will rather say that the tumults and dissentions which instantly arose were in their own nature inevitable  the manners of the times though in the main favorable to liberty were mixed with a gross alloy of private licentiousness and hence factious measures of course arose from the prospect of power or gain see estimate v i part   the preceding age had caught a strong tincture of vice from the prevalent example of a debauched court the education of children was still left in an imperfect state this great revolution having confined itself to the reform of public institutions without ascending to the first great fountain of political security the private and effectual formation of the infant mind  the religious principle though chiefly consonant with the new constitution and indeed its leading support was in part at variance with it  a numerous body of papists held a whole system of principles diametrically opposite to its most essential dictates  another body of protestant jacobites were at war with the principles of the state for they held an hereditary and unalienable right of kings founded on certain mistaken passages of the sacred scriptures  a third body of men though they allowed the necessity and justice of the revolution on the principle of an abdication yet still retained an opinion at variance with the state they asserted an independent hierarchy vindicated a religious intolerance and on some misconstrued passages of scripture affirmed the duty of a passive obedience without limitation  a fourth body was that of some bigoted dissenters who not content with a religious toleration which had been justly granted them aimed on a mistaken principle of religion to erect their own system upon the ruins of the established church  all these parties held religious principles at variance with the laws of freedom  the principle of honor though in many and great instances cooperating with that of religion yet when not founded on it was often at variance with it this principle as it has appeared in modern times was in its origin chiefly military hence it has generally taken cognizance of actions not as they are just or unjust but merely as they are splendid or mean brave or cowardly thus it overlooks all laws both human and divine hence unbounded contempt of enemies furious partyrage unlimited resentment and revenge were and still are its favorite dictates thus it has come to pass that honor often forbids what religion approves and approves what religion forbids this uncontrouled and dangerous principle mixed itself with the licentious manners of the times hence attachments resentments and partyrage arose and were persisted in essentially contradictory to the principles of freedom  consonant with what has been above delivered the principle of conscience did not correct but followed one or other of these various principles according to their predominance and power and these being incurably discordant among themselves the national ideas of right and wrong just and unjust which were formed on these could not but prove themselves of the like motley and disagreeing complexion  here then we behold the natural and unavoidable source of all the dissentions that disgraced the reigns of king william and queen anne and while some affect to wonder how so generous a system of religion and polity so noble a constitution in church and state could fail to produce private virtue and public happiness we now obtain an additional proof of the irresistible power of preestablished manners and principles when at variance with the laws of freedom we may see even to demonstration that the animosities of those times were not incidental but inevitable  sect xii of the changes in manners and principles through the succeeding times the accession of george the first seemed the era of perfect freedom and if an excellent king at the head of an unrivaled constitution could have secured liberty it had now been fixed on immovable foundations  the alloy of licentious manners and contradictory principles which had tarnished the preceding reign still maintained their influence but the declared and zealous advocates for liberty now assumed the reins of power and began more effectually to combat those false principles which were at enmity with the state  would to god these intentional friends of public liberty had been as much the friends of private virtue and religion they would not then have undermined the foundations while they were building the superstructure of civil freedom  the seeds of irreligion had for some time been privately fermenting but they did not break forth into open growth till about this period  it is remarkable that burnet conclusion of his history enumerating the dangers by which the state was threatened in the year   0  makes no mention of irreligion as an evil worth being obviated but soon after this pestilence came on with a terrible swiftness and malignity  the slavish principle of absolute nonresistance and an independent hierarchy were still prevalent in part especially among the clergy to combat these and expose them to the public contempt certain writers were encouraged by those in power a vigorous and effectual attack was made on the advocates for despotism but in their zeal against tyranny these writers supplanted freedom  they assailed superstition with such weapons as destroyed religion they opposed intolerance by arguments and ridicule which tended to sweep away all public establishments while they only aimed perhaps to contend for freedom of thought they unwarily sapped the foundation of all salutary principles see the div leg of moses dedication vol ii p   etc   catos letters and the independent whig among many other tracts of less note seem palpable instances of this truth the one was written in defense of civil the other of religious liberty yet both tended in their general tour to relax those principles by which alone freedom either civil or religious can be sustained by their intemperate insults on religious institutions by their public and avowed contempt of all opinions principles or if you please prejudices instilled into the infant mind as the necessary regulators of human conduct by exalting unaided human reason far beyond the rank she holds in nature by debasing all those assistances which the wisdom of ages had prescribed and consecrated as the necessary means of correcting her vague and wandering dictates  while these authors made this illjudged and perhaps undesigned attack on the foundations of civil liberty others made a still bolder and more fatal inroad and opened a wider door for licentiousness by an attack on christianity itself  in this list of enemies to their country it must be a mortification to every friend of virtue and liberty to find the noble author of the characteristics his morals were unblemished his love of virtue and freedom indisputable but by confounding two things which he saw accidently united though in their nature essentially distinguished he polluted his arguments against intolerance with the grossest buffoonries on christianity  there is no doubt but that the current reasonings of the times had brought him to a habit of belief that all this was harmless pastime to this purpose he seems to speak himself it is certain that in matters of learning and philosophy the practice of pulling down is pleasanter and affords more entertainment than that of building and setting up  in the literate warring world the springing of mines the blowing up of towers bastions and ramparts of philosophy with systems hypotheses opinions and doctrines into the air is a spectacle of all other the most naturally rejoicing miscell iii chap     these intemperate sallies of gaiety may serve as a comment on the passage already cited from catos letters they are a clear and concurrent indication of the ruling principle of the times when opinions and doctrines began to be derided as things indifferent the noble writer was naturally led to embrace this growing error of the times by a too flattering opinion which he had imbibed concerning unassisted human nature as being sufficient of itself to establish the unerring practice of virtue unless beforehand sophisticated by servile institutions  the noble writer indeed attempts a vindication of this licentious conduct by an appeal to the practice of ancient greece and rome there he tells us philosophy had a free course and was permitted as a balance against superstition and while some sects such as the pythagorean and latter platonic joined in with the superstition and enthusiasm of the times the epicurean the academic and others were allowed to use all the force of wit and raillery against it letter on enthusiasm   this has a plausible appearance yet i am persuaded the noble author would have looked grave had he been put in mind of the remark which fabricius made on the epicurean sect that he wished such principles to all the enemies of rome see above p     or had he recollected that when the irreligious system of epicurus prevailed in greece and rome these unprincipled and profligate states were on the eve of their destruction  soon after the author of the characteristics another more dissolute writer appeared on the public stage i mean the author of the fable of the bees this gentleman as has been observed above leveled his artillery on the whole fabric of morals and religion his system was diametrically opposite to that of lord shaftesbury the one was founded on the unaided excellence the other on the incurable depravity of human nature but now the vagrant spirit of irreligion was abroad and the most inconsistent productions were greedily swallowed provided only they disgraced christianity  the avidity with which these compositions were received soon emboldened a succeeding writer to make a formal attack on the religion of his country christianity as old as the creation now appeared in which the gospel was grossly misrepresented insulted and disgraced and in compliance with the ruling malady of the times that poor and sickly creature unassisted human reason was vainly exalted to the throne of eternal truth  other inferior workmen in this patriot amusement of blowing up the religion of their country such as woolston and morgan i pass unnoticed  in a succeeding period and down to the present time the evil has increased and been completed for now not only revealed but natural religion has been publicly attacked in the writings of lord bolingbroke an author who stands convicted of designed profligacy even on his own confession some men there are the pests of society i think them who pretend a great regard to religion in general but who take every opportunity of declaiming publicly against that system of religion or at least that church establishment which is received in britain dissert on parties let xii   you see this patriot writer proclaims his abhorrence even of those who assault the outworks of religion and then with modesty unparalled proceeds to blow up the citadel  the last of these patriot worthies by which the present age stands distinguished is the author of essays philosophical and moral who disdaining the vulgar practice of a particular attack undermines all the foundations of religion revealed and natural and with a pen truly epicurean dissolves at once all the fears of the guilty the comforts of the afflicted and the hopes of the virtuous  such then has been the progress of this public evil which has proceeded almost without cognizance from the magistrate instead of that it is well known that some of these public enemies of their country and mankind were formerly pensioned and others privately encouraged by those in power how this came to pass and aggravated the growing evil it is now necessary to point out  we have seen above that a foundation was laid for this in an illconducted opposition to the enemies of freedom they who were employed to sweep away false principles imprudently struck at all principles  but beyond this a famous minister assumed and long held the reins of power there seems not the least foundation for the charge laid against him by his enemies that his design was to inslave his country neither had he any natural inclination to corrupt practices yet he rather chose to rule by these than to resign his power nay perhaps he thought this corrupt system the only one which under the circumstances of those times could support that illustrious family which was brought in as the happy support of liberty farther perhaps he judged this the only possible expedient for prolonging a peace which he thought necessary till time should wear out the false principles on which the expelled family still held their influence in the minds of the people  from some or all of these motives he not only gave way to corruption but encouraged it to this end religion was discountenanced and christian principle which would have been the firmest friend of liberty was discarded as the enemy of corruption  in the mean time trade wealth and luxury increased these in their extreme having an unalterable tendency to a dissolution of manners and principles went hand in hand with the progress of corruption which in its most improved state this mistaken minister left as a lasting legacy to his country see an estimate etc vol ii p  0  etc   the effects of this established system of corruption did not immediately appear but about the year fiftyseven they came to their crisis advancing with the appearances even of public ruin  that powerful correctress necessity gave a temporary union to all parties and a temporary restoration to the state see ib vol i p the last but from the deduction of causes here given it was natural to expect that as soon as danger ceased faction would arise  it follows also that it must arise on foundations widely different from those in the reigns of william and anne for the dissentions of these past times were chiefly founded in false principles those of the present age on a want of principle  for the false principles which disgraced the protestants of the last age are vanished the mistaken interpretations of scripture on which the jacobite the tory the bigoted dissenter founded their various pretensions and attempts are now held in general derision a preacher of whatever religious congregation who should now advance these obsolete stateheterodoxies would be the contempt of his wiser audience  nay what is more these false principles tending to despotism are generally banished even from the breasts of the clergy except only a very few of the most aged for the bishops being appointed by the patrons of liberty have been such as held principles consistent with the freedom of the state and much caution having been required of them and used by them in the appointments of their clergy the general complexion of this body has changed from that of being the enemies to that of being the friends of freedom  much it were to be wished that along with the tares the wheat had not also perished but the general system of manners being relaxed though refined see the estimate part i and education still left more and more imperfect the principle of religion being unhappily destroyed among certain ranks and weakened among others ib  that of honor being thus left to its own false and fantastic dictates ib  and conscience naturally following the whims of its untutored parent  licentiousness and faction founded on a want of principle cannot but arise and stand among the leading characters of the present times  sect xiii among what ranks licentiousness and faction may most probably be expected though this want of principle must naturally infect every rank of men in a certain degree yet some ranks stand more exposed to it than others  and that we may give as little offense as possible while we speak the truth let it be observed that all orders of men being born with an equal tendency to virtue or vice their adopting the one or falling into the other depends chiefly on the temptations to which their rank exposes them  let us consider the temptations to licentiousness and faction to which the leading ranks stand exposed  wealth and power give opportunities of indulgence indulgence naturally inflames appetite  flattery awakens contempt and contempt weakens the fear of offense or shame  laws which bind little men are often too weak for great ones  leisure when not dignified by suitable accomplishments ends in idleness and idleness is the parent and the nurse of licentious folly to such temptations do the great stand exposed in the important article of manners  with respect to the principle of religion their present situation is no less unfavourable dissolute opinions flatter their disordered passions nor will they ever want sycophants to present this alluring bait to their desires  the maxims of irreligion are now so generally established among those with whom the young men of fashion converse that they must be peculiarly fortunate if they escape the infection wherever this taint is given the principles of honor and conscience become vague and ineffectual if considered as the supports of liberty certain delicacies of personal conduct they may produce but can never rise to an unbiassed and steady prosecution of the public welfare  another circumstance unfavourable to the public virtue of the higher ranks presents itself their situation leads them to expect and to claim the great and lucrative offices of the state i need not here point out how strongly this tends to betray them into the extremes of selfish views ambition partyrage licentiousness and faction see the estimate etc vol i part     add to all these considerations their frequent and longcontinued meetings in the capital a circumstance which from the powerful effects of free communication cannot but inflame all these causes of political dissension  if we next examine the state of the populace of the great cities we shall find that their situation naturally exposes them to such temptations as lead to factious conduct when not early fortified by a virtuous education they are often urged by want of which discontent and envy are the inevitable effects they are let loose to every impulse of appetite by frequent opportunity and secrecy of action they are tempted by wicked examples inflamed by evil communication and intoxicating liquors and though the industrious mechanic may sometimes escape the infection yet the life of the uninstructed poor in great cities is too commonly a horrid compound of riot and distress rapacity and thieving prostitution and robbery wickedness and despair  now if this body of men be indeed what candor itself cannot deny too generally ignorant and illeducated too generally profligate in manners and void of principle it follows that like the athenian populace of old they must be liable to the seduction of artful men the ready tools of every unprincipled leader who may choose to misguide them to the ends of licentiousness and faction  but the people of great britain as above distinguished see p       are of a character essentially different from both these the landed gentry the country clergy the more considerable merchants and men in trade the substantial and industrious freeholders and yeomen possess a middle state of life which guards them from many of those temptations that surround the higher and the lower ranks their imaginary wants are fewer than those of the great their real wants are fewer than those of the poor hence their appetites are less inflamed to evil  their education generally seconds this happy situation in a certain degree though imperfect it is commonly more consistent with the main outlines of public law than that of the superior or inferior ranks  their principles of religion confirm this education they stand not generally exposed to the infection of dissolute opinions their sentiments of honor and conscience are most commonly built on the doctrines of christianity  their numbers and their station conspire to exclude them from a general claim to the lucrative offices of the state their collective knowledge is of sufficient reach to prevent their general seduction to the purposes of licentiousness their dispersion and rural life prevent those continued and unrestrained communications which are alike fatal to private and public virtue  let not the writer be misunderstood there are examples of integrity and dishonor of virtue and vice among all degrees of men he only points out the circumstances which naturally tend upon the whole to form the several ranks into these distinct characters  from this view of the several ranks it follows that although the people of this kingdom must inevitably partake of the various manners and principles of the great and the populace with which they at times communicate though they be subject to the common failings of men and to the incidental inroads of licentiousness from higher and lower life  yet upon the whole and considered as one collective body they stand comparatively clear of many temptations to vice and therefore must naturally be least exposed to the influence of licentiousness and faction  one consequence arising from their dispersion must not pass unnoticed it not only prevents the general depravation of their manners and principles but likewise prevents their uniting in large bodies upon all slight occasions hence though they are apt to doubt nay to be alarmed on the factious clamours of the capital yet they are not rowzed into action but on singular and important emergencies  to conclude they are a great but quiescent power on whose collective knowledge and integrity the freedom and fate of this nation must finally depend in the last age through the influence of false principles preestablished or infused they had wellnigh shaken the foundations of liberty see above p    in the present these mistaken principles being no more they are now the firmest bulwark of britains freedom  sect xiv of the most effectual means of detecting licentiousness and faction where faction is founded on false principles it is easily detected because it is generally avowed it implies no moral depravity but only an error of the mind and he who holds this error is not naturally ashamed of it because he holds it as a truth  but where faction is founded on licentiousness and want of principle it cannot be so easily detected for as it implies a moral depravity it will naturally attempt to veil itself and to this end will assume the garb and appearance of freedom  the favorite subject of its clamours will be the misconduct of those who govern and in a country where liberty is justly ranked among the greatest national blessings the most plausible pretense of faction will be to load the executive power with the charge of despotism  in every free state there will frequently occur certain subjects and measures of doubtful expediency these in the wide field of political contention may justly be styled the debateable grounds on these doubtful points even the friends of liberty may sometimes differ therefore the patrons of faction will naturally lay hold on these as the most successful and effectual means of state distraction because thus they may hope to mingle with and to pass for the friends of freedom  when therefore such doubtful measures become the subject of political contention it may be difficult to determine from the mere circumstance of opinion who are the friends of liberty and who the abettors of faction because in these points there may be an incidental difference of opinion even among the friends of liberty themselves  a much surer determination may be formed on the manner and conduct of the dissenting party for the friend of liberty having no selfish views will be rational honest equitable in the prosecution of his wishes he who is actuated by the spirit of licentiousness and faction will be irrational dishonest iniquitous  let us then endeavor to particularize these distinctive marks or characters thus shall we best be able to determine who are the friends of liberty and who the abettors of licentiousness and faction  sect xv of the characteristic marks of liberty these which follow are perhaps some of the clearest characteristics of the spirit of liberty by which the friends of public freedom though dissentient from any measure of government will be evidently distinguished  each of these marks may seem decisive even when separately viewed but to do justice to this argument it will be necessary to consider and weigh them in union because as they in part depend on each other they will illustrate each other and at once receive and give additional confirmation    the friend of liberty will endeavor to preserve that just balance of divided power established by law for the security of freedom  because the public welfare is the leading object of his wishes and can only be effectually obtained by the preservation of such a balance  this will be the general aim and end of the true friend of liberty this end will be prosecuted by suitable means and its reality will be confirmed and illustrated by these which follow    he will be attached to measures without respecting men  because the passions and interests of individuals ought to yield to the public weal    he will be generally selfconsistent both in speech and action  because the public welfare being the uniform object of his pursuits this can only be steadily and effectually promoted on clear and uniform principles    he will not attempt to inflame an ignorant populace against their legal governors  because an ignorant populace are in all cases unqualifyd to decide on the measures of government    his debates either in the senate or from the press will be void of undistinguishing and injurious imputations on any whole bodies of men who may differ from him in opinion because truth and the public welfare being his desired end he will clearly see that others have the same right of approving as himself has of disapproving the measures of government    he will not industriously and indiscriminately defame the private characters of the individuals who differ from him in opinion  because calumny thrown on individuals is a still more aggravated crime than that which is promiscuously aimed at bodies of men  sect xvi of the first characteristic mark of licentiousness and faction though we have seen that the patrons of faction will attempt to mix and confound themselves with the friends of liberty yet in spite of their pretenses they will be detected by the following characteristic marks which will stand in clear opposition to those of freedom  these like the former may seem sufficiently decisive even when separately viewed but to do justice to this argument it will in the same manner be necessary to consider and weigh them in union because as they in part depend on each other they will illustrate each other and at once receive and give additional confirmation    the leaders of faction being naturally of the higher ranks see above sect xiii  would aim to establish an aristocratic power and inslave both prince and people to their own avarice and ambition  thus if any set of men had in former times been in power and while in power had oppressed embarrassed majesty had threatened the prince with a general resignation had thus intimidated him to their own purposes had by these means usurped the legal prerogatives of the crown and applied them rather to the support of their own influence than to the public welfare   if the legal privileges of the people had fared no better in their hands  if these too had been swallowed up in the great gulf of aristocratic power  if the members of the lower house while they seemed to be the free representatives of the people had been in truth a great part of them no more than the commissioned deputies of their respective chiefs whose sentiments they declared and whose interests they pursued   if such a set of men as soon as they had lost their influence should now rail at the privileges of the crown as the engines of despotism though they had been formerly allowed by the wisdom of the state as the occasional securities of freedom   if they should now absurdly magnify and exalt the privileges of the lower house beyond the limits prescribed by a free constitution  if their pretense should be the vindication of the peoples rights while their real motive was the restoration of their own exorbitant power founded on an expected majority of their own dependents  if this conduct was pursued by any set of men they would stand convicted of a clear mark of licentiousness and faction  such would be their main end or purpose and this end would be pursued by suitable means these means considered in union would still farther confirm and illustrate the end they aimed at and these means would be such as follow  sect xvii a second mark of licentiousness and faction the patrons of faction would be attached to men to the neglect of measures  if the same men when formerly in power should have obstinately adhered to each other in every public debate and opinion should have execrated every man as the enemy of his country who dissented even in the slightest article of political belief   if on any sudden change in the fountain of power a more generous system of government should have taken place  if the sovereign had aimed to unite all honest men of all parties and had invited them to cooperate for the welfare of their country   if these men determined still to engross all public power should threaten the sovereign as they had effectually threatened his royal predecessor with a general resignation   if their leaders should be taken at their word and unexpectedly stripped of all power and influence   if on this the clamours of their attendant populace should arise see sect xix and for the sake of the public tranquillity overtures should be made by the prince to the discontented  if the same principle should still predominate and demands in favor of men should be the leading object of accommodation   if these demands should be not only irrational in their kind but exorbitant and oppressive in their degree requiring a general restoration of all the discontented and a general dismission of all who were in power though of known fidelity to their king and country   if such should be the conduct of any set of men they would stand evidently convicted of licentiousness and faction  sect xviii a third mark of licentiousness and faction the patrons of faction would be selfcontradictory and inconsistent not only on different but on parallel occasions  thus if the exercise of a privilege should be quietly allowed to one officer of state and by the same persons should be clamoured against in his successor the persons thus acquiescing and clamouring by turns would stand convicted of a selfcontradictory and inconsistent conduct and without deciding on the propriety or impropriety of the privilege in question would carry upon them a clear mark of licentiousness and faction  again if a certain mode of political influence on dependents was generally exercised among all the ranks of a free country  if the same persons already characterized should now condemn this as a despotic measure in the servants of the crown which they themselves formerly exercised when in power and still continue to exercise toward their private dependents  these gentlemen would betray a very notable inconsistence in their conduct and therefore without any decision on the rectitude of such a general practice would stand convicted of an undeniable mark of licentiousness and faction  sect xix a fourth mark of licentiousness and faction the patrons of faction would endeavor to delude and inflame an ignorant and licentious populace against their legal governors  a blind and unprincipled populace have ever been the most effectual engines of sedition and above all those of the capital being near to the grand scene of political contention must ever be a ready and dangerous engine in the hands of licentiousness and faction  but in a nation like this to make the populace of the capital a more successful instrument of sedition a degree of art would be necessary for it appears above that the people of this kingdom and the populace of its cities are of a character essentially opposite to each other that the one is collectively knowing and upright the other collectively ignorant and immoral see above sect xiii  the first step therefore that faction would take as the surest method for success would be to confound the one with the other and dignify the clamor of the populaceby stiling it the voice of the people  the fury of such a populace thus awakened by vanity vice and ignorance would arise in a variety of shapes  if an order of the senate should be given for the burning of a paper legally declared seditious such a populace would be incited to rescue it from the fire and they who had thus incited them would boast that it was rescued by the hands of the people  every talking demagogue who should oppose the measures of government would be artfully and indiscriminately obtruded on such an ignorant populace as a patriot or a hero and they who had thus obtruded him would boast that he was the favorite of the people  every distinguished friend to the measures of government would be artfully obtruded on such a populace as the enemy of his country and they who had thus obtruded him would boast that he was the detestation of the people  every act of the legislature which contradicted the passions or partial interests of such a populace or their leaders would be branded by them as arbitrary and oppressive and they would boast that it was branded by the voice of the people  if daily or periodical papers of intelligence were circulated from the capital through the nation and these were open to the admission of every thing which private pique passion or interest might suggest they would of course become the general repositories of popular slander and as malice is always more eager to accuse than injured innocence to defend these slanders would often seem to preponderate in the public ear and hence would be boasted by those who raised them as the prevailing voice of the people  thus hatched by licentiousness faction would attain to its enormous growth the unprincipled among the great would form the head the unprincipled among the populace would form the body of this rapacious monster  sect xx a fifth mark of licentiousness and faction the abettors of faction would throw injurious and undistinguishing imputations on every body of men who differed from them in opinion  having thus gained an ignorant and licentious populace as the trumpets of sedition the patrons of faction would leave no means untried to load their adversaries with the most envenomed calumny  thus if any mistaken principle had formerly been maintained but was now generally forsaken and derided a faction could not be detected by any clearer mark than by its attempt to conjure up the ghost of this departed principle in order to alarm and terrify not only the populace but the people  if on this pretense any men should attempt to revive animosities which time had buried  should attempt to divide and distract the subjects of an united kingdom whose common welfare depended on their union  should revile all men without distinction who were born in a certain district and indiscriminately endeavor to exclude them from a participation of those public trusts honors and emoluments to which with the rest of their fellow subjects they might stand entitled by their capacity or virtue  who would not discover in this unequal conduct a clear and distinctive mark of licentiousness and faction  again if ever there had been a time when all who presumed to dissent in any degree from those in power were indiscriminately and unjustly branded with the name of jacobite or tory  and if these very men who had bestowed such appellations should now deal them as freely round on all who assent to those in power  this were surely a clear indication that the spirit of faction were abroad  but if in the course of political revolutions some of these mens former adherents should now be their adversaries and some former adversaries should now be their adherents another characteristic circumstance would arise for those whom they had once reviled they would now applaud as being the friends of liberty and those whom they had formerly applauded they would now revile as having become jacobites or tories  such a conduct and such names thus arbitrarily imposed however speciously colored over by the pretense and cry of liberty might seem to stand with all impartial judges as a clear mark of licentiousness and faction  the views of such men would be still more apparent should they insinuate that the prince received those very men as his ministers and favorites whose principles tended to the subversion of his throne and family this insinuation indeed would not so much merit detestation as contempt and ridicule  sect xxi a sixth mark of licentiousness and faction the abettors and instruments of faction would promiscuously calumniate the private characters of the principal individuals of the opposing party  it was the just observation of an ancient writer that the wicked is an abomination to the righteous and the righteous an abomination to the wicked  yet the measures which these two parties take in their treatment of each other are essentially different  the good man never maliciously stabs the reputation of his neighbor the wicked man on the contrary delights in this most practicable but most atrocious of all mischiefs  invenomed hints ambiguous imputations private crimes darkly alleged but void of all foundation  these are the deadly weapons of the abandoned but cunning defamer  here then is a secure and ample field for every profligate minister of faction here he tosseth about arrows firebrands and death and cries am i not in sport  if a prince whose words and actions might justly be given as an example of integrity to all his subjects should be ambiguously accused of such things as his honor would abhor   if such a prince should be indirectly charged with ignorance for not distinguishing in a point of law which even some of the ablest lawyers in his kingdom had not attended to   if neither the virtues nor the condescension of a queen could protect her from the insults of those whom she had never injured   if any other branch of a royal family should be basely traduced by the grossest and most audacious calumnies studiously contrived to inflame an ignorant and unbridled populace   if the servants of the crown and members of the legislature who had legally exerted themselves in defense of their injured sovereign should in their private character be impudently vilifyd misrepresented and abused and even their unoffending families traduced with studied and unexampled virulence   if neither age nor virtue should be a security against the arrows of public calumny  if a man of the most distinguished worth in private life a known and zealous friend of public liberty one of the ornaments of his age and country should be overwhelmed by a load of the most unprovoked and malicious slander merely because he had dared to assert his own right of private judgment in opposition to the opinion of another   if these outrages should be publicly committed by some and winked at or countenanced or patronized by others  surely all honest men ought to join in declaring their abhorrence of such atrocious acts of licentiousness and faction perpetrated in defiance of all laws both human and divine  sect xxii some objectious obviated should it be objected to the writer that while he blames the practice in others he indiscriminately characterizeth whole bodies of men who dissent from public measures he would reply that the accusation is groundless for he has expressly distinguished those who dissent on principles of liberty from such as dissent on motives of licentiousness and faction  should it be objected that he has attacked even private characters in the way of indirect description this accusation would be equally illfounded for all personal peculiarities are avoided save only the single facts alluded to as the proofs of his allegations these were essentially necessary for the support of the argument and relate not to private life but to public and political conduct  should it be objected that he has indirectly censured those whose conduct he had formerly applauded he replies that he never was attached to men but measures  should it be objected that some of these characteristic marks may seem to involve men of good morals in private life he would reply that the affections of good men in private life may not always extend to the public  should it be objected that some of these characteristic marks may seem to involve men who have been eminently serviceable to their country in public stations he would reply that he ever has been and ever will be proud to do justice to merit when exercised in any public station  should it be objected that he questions the conduct of those only who are now out of power he would reply that he formerly questioned their conduct with the same freedom when in the fullness of their power and that his reasons in both instances were the same because in both instances he judged their general conduct to be essentially illfounded narrow selfish reprehensible  sect xxiii of the most effectual means of checking the growth of licentiousness and faction thus the writer has endeavored to lay open the foundations and characters of licentiousness and faction he now proceeds to consider the most effectual means of checking them in their progress of restoring internal uhanimity and securing public freedom  in every national malady of this nature there are two kinds of remedies essentially distinct the one is palliative and temporary the other is radical and lasting  the palliative remedies ought to be first applied because it will appear that they are the only means by which we can come at those which are radical  it is evident then that the first advance toward a cure of this national evil must arise from the steady conduct of the prince for faction unopposed and led on by the higher ranks will never cease in its demands till it terminates in the possession of an unbounded aristocratic power this is a power which nothing but the courage and steadiness of the prince can possibly contend with because the final object of such a faction will always be those high and lucrative offices of state which are in his sole disposal  if a sovereign once gives way to the storms in which such a faction will involve him his peace and freedom together with those of his people are inevitably destroyed on the contrary if amidst all the tumults of sedition he discovers an unalterable firmness and fortitude founded in upright intentions and real virtue the rage of hopeless faction will by degrees subside and a prospect of better times will open upon him and his people this general truth might be commented on but at present the writer can with satisfaction leave it to the impartial public to find a more instructive and living comment  sect xxiv of a second remedy the next remedy which can effectually aid the firmness of the prince must be the steadiness of the minister in discouraging as far as in him lies the inroads of venality and corruption  this is a large topic and fitter for a book than a section however what is most essential to the present subject may be briefly touched on  a plausible objection then is here to be obviated for a late writer has very calmly and systematically attempted to prove the universal and unconditional necessity of political corruption in all free governments see a free inquiry into the nature and origin of evil let v   what follows is the foundation of his argument all human government is the offspring of violence and corruption and must inherit the imperfection of both its parents origin of evil p      all governments must be administered by the same violence and corruption to which they are indebted for their origin ib p      corruption therefore must always increase in due proportion to the decrease of arbitrary power since where there is less power to command obedience there must be more bribery to purchase it or there can be no government carried on at all ib p       such is the sum of this gentlemans argument to which the following observations are offered as a reply  there have been two different pictures given of man by different writers diametrically opposite to each other by some the human species has been represented as a natural society of angels by others as a crew of devils both these representations have arisen from a partial view of mandkind one party regarding his social qualities only the other overlooking these and fixing on the appetites which are commonly called the felfish  were mankind of the first of these characters they would need no law were they of the latter no law could unite or bind them the truth is they are a mixture of both as they have the several modes of selflove for the preservation of the individual so by proper culture they gain habits of benevolence religion social prudence the love of honest reputation and sometimes even a regard for the general welfare of the society to which they belong as these social passions and regards are strong or weak frequent or uncommon the character of a nation is good or bad honest or corrupt upright or profligate a variety of proofs has been given of these different degrees of moral character in the preceding parts of this essay see above sect vii etc   but that we may not seem to build on a principle which this author admits not we hear him virtually declaring all this himself in another part of his book here he man has an opportunity given him of improving or debasing his nature in such a manner as to render himself fit for a rank of higher perfection and happiness or to degrade himself to a state of greater imperfection and misery origin of evil p     again he speaks of a reformation of manners as a thing practicable and recommends it as the only remedy for political evil ib       but while he treats of the absolute necessity of political corruption all the better part of man is hid his imperfections and vices alone are set in view during the progress of this argument if it deserves that name we hear of nothing but such imperfect and vicious creatures as men tyrannizing over others as imperfect and vicious as themselves origin of evil p      we have nothing presented to us but pride avarice and cruelty on one side envy ignorance and obstinacy on the other injustice and selfinterest on both ib  in a word mankind are represented as an abandoned and incurable race utterly void of all good qualities and such as must be always bribed or beat into obedience ib p   0   here then this maxim of the absolute and unconditional necessity of political corruption appears in all its nakedness and deformity for it is founded on the supposed incurable wickedness of man an error too glaring to need a confutation and which there is still the less occasion to confute because this author himself admits the contrary  it follows then that his leading proposition is as false in itself as it is pernicious to society that corruption must always increase in due proportion to the decrease of arbitrary power because virtue and religion upright manners and principles properly instilled may much better supply corruptions place were it necessary to pursue this gentleman through all the windings of his political labyrinth and trace him to the end of his course where he suddenly starts up in the form of a severe moralist there could not perhaps be exhibited a more striking instance of selfcontradiction in the whole compass of literary debate  at present i shall only remark that this essay was published in the year      at a time when the system of political corruption much needed some kind of apology because its fatal effects began to glae too strongly upon the nation to be longer doubted hence though we should not inquire who the author iswe may give a shrewd guess what political school he was bred in   on this foundation therefore it appears that every upright minister ought as far as possible to check the progress of corruption and though at times he may be embarassed and under a political necessity of yielding it is clearly both his duty and his interest to oppose this dangerous and encroaching spirit in the leading outlines of his public conduct  it is his duty both because corruption can only flourish on the ruins of virtue and religion good morals and principles without which public liberty is essentially destroyed and because corruption tends inevitably and invariably to weaken the public administration of government by filling every high department with the venal the ignorant the selfish the dishonest see estimate part ii   it is both his duty and interest because licentiousness and its attendants venality and faction are of an insatiable appetite the more the venal are fed they grow more importunate if you gorge one of these to the full and thus lay him to sleep ten will rise in his place every one more clamourous than the first  the minister therefore both in consideration of his own peace and the public welfare ought as far as possible to obviate this evil in its beginnings fortify himself as well as the state with the honest the firm and the capable resist to the utmost the exorbitant demands of venality thus faction will either bark itself asleep or die despairing  sect xxv of some concomitant remedies let us now consider what might be in the power of the legislature and the magistrate immediately to effect    it is generally acknowledged that power naturally follows property therefore exorbitant property in individuals must always be unfavourable to civil liberty must always tend to produce licentiousness and faction because it throws exorbitant power into the hands of individuals and the greater the inequality between the poor and rich the more the one will ever be under the influence of the other  it should seem then to be the particular interest even of the most wealthy if they be the real friends of liberty  it is certainly the general interest of a free community that some legal limitation of property should take place i speak not of the probability but the expediency of such a measure    it follows that some regulation in respect to boroughs would be of great importance for in boroughs contrary to all sound policy power is lodged without annexed propertythe natural consequence is that this illplaced power will be seized by those who are possessed of exorbitant property thus power settles on its natural foundation but a foundation in this instance most dangerous to freedom as it leads to the establishment of an aristocracy in this instance too i speak not of the probability but the expediency of the measure    the limitation of extended conquest and empire might seem an object worthy the attention of the highest powers  rome perished by its avidity of unbounded empire colonies when peopled beyond a certain degree become a burden to the mother country they exhaust her numbers they distract her attention they divide her compacted strength such extent of colonies as may be necessary to maintain the empire of the seas will always be a just object of british regard more than this sound policy perhaps could hardly dictate    this limitation is of more importance as it would naturally set bounds to another excess i mean that of trade and wealth this the writer knows is of all other topics the most unpopular notwithstanding which he presumes to persist in what appears to him a demonstrative truth that exorbitant trade and wealth are most dangerous to private virtue and therefore to public freedom the topic is too large to be here insisted on he therefore refers to what he has already written on this subject see estimate part iii passim which has been much clamoured against indeed but never confuted for the conviction of those who choose rather to attend to present than future consequences the following circumstance may deserve notice much has been said on the cause of the present exorbitant price of provisions and general distress of the poorevery cause has been assigned except the true one which seems to be the sinking value of money arising necessarily from the exorbitant increase of trade and wealth if this be so it follows that the evil is incurable excepting only by a general augmentation of the wages of the poor  now this which is the necessary effect of the exorbitancy of commerce naturally tends by the increased price of manufactures to the destruction of commerce if the exorbitancy of trade should still run higher this evil will be aggravated in proportion the consequences which must follow are such as the writer chooses not to enlarge on because he knows the spirit of the times would not bear it     the immediate care of upright manners and principles might seem an object worthy the strictest attention both of the legislature and magistrate  to this end if the growing spirit of novelty and adoption could by any means be checked it would be a work attended with the most salutary consequences the writer would not willingly be thought chimerically to adopt all the rigours of the spartan state but could wish to see a law enacted parallel to that of lacedaemon by which their raw and unexperienced youth were prohibited from bringing home the new follies and vices of foreign countries picked up in a premature and too early travel see estimate vol ii part i sect  0   he would by no means discourage the freedom of the press yet sure its licentiousness might seem an object of the magistrates regard the search of truth is good but to search for this in the hoards of irreligion is like searching for hope in pandoras box where the sole reward of industry can only be pestilence despair and death national virtue never was maintained but by national religion he therefore who shakes the essential principles of religion undermines the virtue of his fellow subjects and therefore deserves to feel the rigor of the law as a determined enemy of his country  this may seem a practicable remedy but how to destroy those irreligious writings which already lie exposed on stalls and counters or deposited in private libraries like so many heaps of poison for the gratification of vice and the destruction of virtue  or how to pluck from the minds of men those poisoned arrows which these authors have already planted there  that were a task indeed  the shaft is already flown and cannot be recalled and this nation through succeeding times will have cause to say  haeret lateri lethalis arundo  immoral writings should seem no less the object of the magistrates attention though these may not shake the principles yet they inevitably corrupt the manners of a nation  personal defamation or calumny thrown on private characters is another evil which seems rising at present with unheard of aggravations two slagrant instances of this enormity the writer will pass unnoticed lest he should seem to insult over the exiled or the dead in these two kinds of modern profligacy immoral writings and personal calumny there is one professed author now said to be living in this kingdom with impunity who in a better policed state would ere this have felt the full weight of that public punishment and infamy which is due to an enemy of mankind this man supposed to be one c  first writ a volume of execrable memoirs for the corruption of youth and innocence since that a reverie or dream which hunger and malice probably conspired to suggest replete with the most impudent falsehoods and injurious calumnies on individuals for the entertainment of base and envious minds   sect xxvi of the chief and essential remedy all these may be regarded as temporary and concomitant supports of freedom but the chief and essential remedy to licentiousness and faction the fundamental means of the lasting and secure establishment of civil liberty can only lie in a general and prescribed improvement of the laws of education  we have seen above that upright manners and principles are the only basis of true liberty that the infant mind if left to its own untutored dictates inevitably wanders into such follies and vices as tend to the destruction of itself and others we have seen that the early and continued culture of the heart can alone produce such upright manners and principles as are necessary to check and subdue the selfish passions of the soul and that liberty can only arise from a general subordination of these to the public welfare we have seen these truths confirmed by an appeal to the state of three famed republics which by turns arose and fell on the very principles here delivered we have seen the defects as well as excellencies of our own public constitution both civil and religious that its form is excellent and unrivaled but that the practical application of this unrivaled excellence is attended with defects incurable that it has all along been inevitably counterworked by manners and principles discordant with its genius and discordant with each other that for want of a prescribed code of education to which all the members of the community should legally submit the manners and principles on which alone the state can rest are ineffectually instilled are vague fluctuating and selfcontradictory  nothing then is more evident than that some reform in this great point is necessary for the security of public freedom till this be effected in spite of all temporary remedies licentiousness and faction though checked for a time will ever be gathering new strength and returning to the charge with redoubled fury  this reform to some may appear easy to effect by others it will be derided as wholly impracticable perhaps the truth may lie between these two opinions to throw the manners and principles of a nation into any new channel is certainly a work of no small difficulty  on the other hand we seem to have many materials lying round us ready to be converted into the means of this great work a pure and rational religion a generous system of policy founded on that religion manners though apparently degenerating yet by no means generally profligate much true religion integrity and honor among the middle ranks many instances of domestic worth among the higher and in spite of the temptations that surround the great true piety and the moral virtues adorning the most exalted station  therefore without dreaming of the perfect republic of plato  and fairly acknowledging the incurable defect of our political state in not having a correspondent and adequate code of education inwrought into its first essence  we may yet hope that in a secondary and inferior degree something of this kind may be still inlaid it cannot have that perfect efficacy as if it had been originally of the piece yet if well conducted it may strengthen the weak parts and alleviate defects though not completely remove them  among what ranks in the writers opinion these defects in education chiefly lie may be sufficiently collected from some of the preceding sections but as to the most effectual methods of relieving these defects he pretends not at present to attempt so great a subject  this however he is well persuaded of that till something of the kind be attempted and performed all the labored harangues that can be given from the bench the pulpit or the press will be of little avail they may tend occasionally to obviate some of the evils of licentiousness but never can radically cure them  sect xxvii the conclusion these remedies however just in their nature can only be effectual through a proper application and this can only lie in a zealous and unfeigned union of the honest among all ranks and parties for the accomplishment of these ends against the patrons and instruments of licentiousness and faction  this union at first view seems of such a nature as could hardly need to be enforced yet it is frequently retarded by several circumstances  among the great this rational union is often counteracted by the ties of false honor a dangerous principle which we have already noted as being productive of partyrage and faction see above p    this principle even in honest minds will sometimes prevail over the dictates of religion and private virtue on this false foundation political connexions are often maintained in defiance of a just sense of public utility while the unhappy man who acts on this mistaken motive is inwardly rent by two contrary and contending powers severe moralists may perhaps discard such a character from the list of the honest but it should seem that he is rather an object of clemency than indignation remove but the unhappy prejudice from his breast and such a character would press forward among the first toward the goal of public virtue  again this rational and salutary union may be retarded by connexions of friendship gratitude or blood this cause tends to confirm and extend the influence of the former fathers powerful friends and patrons connect themselves with parties and cleave to them on a mistaken principle sons obliged friends and dependents are naturally inlisted in their party and are rivetted in it not only by false honor but education gratitude affection how peculiarly unfortunate is this circumstance that the generous passions should ever become the adversaries of public virtue  the same false attachment to friends patrons and relations naturally prevails in a certain proportion among the middle ranks of the kingdom their interests passions and prejudices are not so immediately concerned as those of the higher ranks and therefore it is natural to suppose that their mutual attachments of mistaken honor or private affection will upon the whole be more moderate and less culpable yet still while these false attachments are prevalent among the great the people must in some degree catch the infection from the various relations which they bear to their superiors hence untractable prejudices arise and are maintained while measures are less regarded than the party which adopts them  but besides this another circumstance arises which inevitably tends to disunite and distract the honest among the people even when their personal attachments are conquered by their integrity their dispersion in the country has already been remarked as a circumstance worthy of attention here it meets us again as a cause of their frequent disunion we have seen how naturally under the present state of things every factious clamor that rises in the capital is transmitted with aggravated circumstances through the whole kingdom see above sect xix p   0 and the people of the villages being easy of belief because not suspecting the abandoned profligacy of these towndefamers are apt to receive every insinuated personal slander as a truth these calumnies being seldom contradicted by the injured party take root in the minds of the less knowing hence doubts arise surmises and dislikes are spread facts though void of all foundation are alleged and persisted in the more credulous part are misled thus an honest people are divided and not only a province or a village but even an house often set at variance within itself  these contentions sometimes arise to a degree which is ridiculous and have formerly been so described without exception by the tools of faction notwithstanding this every friend of liberty ought to grieve if a free an honest and a sensible people should ever desist were it possible to debate on affairs of government though they may be occasionally alarmed and misled on slight occasions yet their mature and collective judgment on important subjects will seldom be erroneous on this foundation montesquieus remark is solid tell me not that such a people will sometimes reason ill it is sufficient that they reason lesprit des loix   the guilt and ill consequences then arise from the malevolent clamours of the capital transmitted thence to the provinces these clamours though not of power to seduce an honest people into actual sedition are yet often sufficient to alarm and divide them see above sect xiii p       much caution therefore ought to be used by the inhabitants of the country how they give credit to the political rumors of the town which are seldom spread without design and are in general spread most industriously by the malevolent they who act on good principles are apt to trust to the native force of truth the patrons of falsehood are conscious of a defect here and therefore endeavor to supply it by a misapplied diligence and cunning  one mark of licentiousness and faction is peculiarly applicable to these clamours from the metropolis if they are fraught with personal calumny and attack private characters they assuredly come from the enemies of virtue and freedom  all these therefore a sensible and honest people will learn to suspect and deride this foundation once laid they will not be far from a general union against the hidden designs of licentiousness and faction  in conclusion therefore let the honest among every rank and party recollect that their first and highest obligations are to god their king and country that every subordinate connection ought to yield to these that true honor can never be at variance with the laws of religion and virtue that if any desertion be shameful it is the desertion from truth and the welfare of their country if any attachment be honorable it is an impartial attachment to the public weal unbiassed by private affections and regards if any acknowledgment be the certain mark of a great and ingenuous mind it is the acknowledgment of its own errors or those of a patron friend or ancestor  these remarks the writer submits to the impartiality and candor of his countrymen desiring that they may be regarded as his mite thrown in toward the accomplishment of the sovereigns wish on his accession to the throne that of founding the liberty and happiness of this kingdom on the solid basis of religion and virtue and uniting all honest men in the steady prosecution of this great purpose  the end by the same author with all convenient speed will be published principles of christian legislation
