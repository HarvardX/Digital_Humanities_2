remember  you have given me cause the gods who deal in vengeance  reward you for it i could dash my brains  for that way only can i scape remembrance  o nature what a luckless piece of work was man exit scene the prospect of a rude wild country to a considerable extent with the ruins of a temple to faunus timon is discovered at the extremity of the stage led in by flavius at the same time evanthe enters at the front surveys him some time and while he slowly advances speaks evan  o spectacle of sorrow mighty gods  is that my father  is that mournful ruin  that bare and blasted trunk the spreading vine  beneath whose shade late a whole nation sat  and feasted from its branches hold my heart  sink not my knees beneath your weight of woe  but bear me to his feet  my lord my father she kneels tim  rise rise my daughter  do i once again  enfold thee in my arms alas my child  i am old and weak and smitten sore with grief  gods how ingratitude lays waste your works  unkindness like another deadly plague  strikes all below the moon creation groans  nature with more than mothers pangs brings forth  her thankless offspring man  evan  all shall be well  tim  all all is well for thou art in my sight  mute as these scenes and calm as summer seas  here will we sit and meditate a while  then die and be at peace  evan oh talk not thus  tim  give me your pardon i have suffered much  and much i fear sorrow has shook my wits  but in the bitterest moments of affliction  i have remembered still to bless my child  evan  o bless me not in part complete my joy  return to me to athens to thyself  and these base emblems of thy discontent  like the nessean garment cast away  and be at peace with a repentant world  tim  can i who from the depth of hell have called  malignant spirits to ensnare mankind  i who each night upon the lonely strand  by the sea brink or in this silent waste  have stood and bandied curses to the moon  till the gray dawn looked out can i now teach  that voice which execration has made hoarse  the smooth soft notes of peace will nature pardon  that common mother in whose patient bosom  i have stuck iron goads  it will not be  flav  move him no more dear lady it is in vain  tim  yet i had cause  speak flavius thou art honest  and wilt not flatter had i not full cause  flav  may the just gods who know thy wrongs revenge em  tim  hush hush no more of that  we must be calm  shattered with storms at length i see my port  and stretch for deaths calm shore  rejoice my child  thy fathers sufferings hasten to an end  and life and care shall terminate together  eva alas my father talk not in this strain  bright years of glory rise to crown thy hopes  great alcibiades defends thy cause  the suppliant senate come to kiss thy feet  loaded with treasure while repentant athens  from all her gates pours forth unnumberd crowds  to hail thy glad return  tim   why let them come  should alcibiades to please old timon  burn athens to a heap crush the proud senate  and swallow that vile swarm of summer friends  that left him bare to shame shall timon say  i thank thee sir for this great courtesy  shall man say this to man who in pure love  and singleness of heart never stirs his hand  to aid his suffering fellow  evan  nay that is hard  tim  rather let timon say i have a daughter  beauteous and young and fair as unsund lilies  your eye has drank her charms and strong desire  knocks at your heart therefore let athens burn  spare not a man that ever spoke timons name  but in the way of worship  oh it is great  it is glorious friendship in his daughters arms  evan  that daughter is no idle wanton sir  to dote on every form that courts the eye  though nature fashioned him with every grace  which the joint bounty of the gods could give him  yet alcibiades had passed unnoticed  with lucius and lucullus and the herd  of common flatterers were he that base thing  which your description paints him  tim  soft you now  he is a man and flavius is no more  yet he is honest and you will say another  may be so too  two honest men ye gods   can there be two i know you can do much  ye great divinities therefore i say  it may be so but mark me well my child  i vouch it not that were indeed too much  evan  does heaven cloth falsehood in celestial robes  see where he comes who can survey that form  and doubt if honor dwells in such a shrine  yes in each glance each gesture it appears  lives in his tongue and lightens in his eye  pervades inspires and occupies his soul  alcibiades enters alcib  health to thee noble timon health and fame  peace and fair fortune the athenian senate  stung with remorse and shame present themselves  entreating your return with them to athens  tim  say to the senate you have seen me die  timon is now no more here lies their prey he sinks down on the steps of the temple being supported in his fall by evanthe and flavius  the stout old heart they have coursd so long in view  dead dead you see and fairly hunted down  alcid  much injured timon they have seen their faults  their former thriftiness they have cast from them  and now their coffers like their hearts stand open  to your free use  tim  alas kind hearted men  oh they are cunning murderers fine the wound  and hard to trace where sharp unkindness strikes  therefore they say i am not struck at all  but heaven rejects their plea and in my heart  sees the dire arrow rankle  alcib  live oh live  shake off despair and live most worthy timon  see on all sides my soldiers fence thee round  athens i have humbled to thy meanest use  and driven to shameful flight that loathsome crew  whose black ingratitude corrodes thy heart  tim  and what in recompense can timon give  to alcibiades  alcib  more than the gods did  when they gave life thou can bestow evanthe  evan  o alcibiades forbear to urge  at this sad hour thy inauspicious suit  hence must we date our nuptials this a time  to ask a blessing in this awful moment  for mourning for misfortune only fit  can this be happy when a father dies  tim  no more give me your hands come on each side  the overshadowing heavens shower down upon you  infinite blessings make you one in heart  in mind faith truth contentment shun mankind  live to yourselves and to the gods alone  evan  break break my heart  tim  weep not for me my child death is my cure  life my disease son daughter friend farewell  bring not my corpse within the walls of athens  but lay me on the very hem of the sea  where the vast neptune may for ever weep  on my low grave  remember  oh it is past dies evan  there fled his spirit waft it immortal gods  up to our heavenly mansions yes my father  we will entomb thee by the oceans edge  on the salt beech and when the thronging waves  which every morn shall bow their curled heads  to kiss thy tomb shall like the flattering friends  of this base world fall off and leave thee bare  then will i come down to the vacant strand  washing thy grave with never ceasing tears  till the sea flows again  alcib  ah turn evanthe  turn from that mournful sight and look upon me  damp not the blessing which his dying breath  pronounced upon us and lament not him  who freed from this bad world rests from his cares  now let us bear him to the neighboring beach  and with such rites as soldiers use inter him  under the vaulted cliff such was his will  strong in extremes from love to hatred tossed in the fierce conflict he was whelmed and lost  finis
