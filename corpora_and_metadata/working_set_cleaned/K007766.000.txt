remarks on the final cessation of the menses  and on a remedy and method of treatment  adapted to prevent or remove the evil consequences attending that period  together with some strictures on secret and advertised medicines in general  london printed for the author and sold by john donaldson bookseller at the corner of arundel street in the strand  mdcclxxv  remarks etc the very name of a nostrum or patent medicine generally conveys the idea of imposture nor is it matter of surprise almost every shop is furnished with secret medicines and handbills and newspapers in swarms incessantly cry up their infallible virtues and boldly promise a certain cure for every disease whether within or beyond the reach of art this sort of medicine never abounded more than in the present age seldom a month elapses but something new is intruded as a specific and yet it may be said with truth every species of disease is as frequent as ever and some kinds particularly the putrid the scorbutic and those called nervous are known to gain ground but it would be well for the credulous if the use of most of the advertised medicines only thinned their pockets or disappointed their expectation of undoubted recovery it is every where well known that many valetudinarians have suffered and daily do suffer by the use of those medicines their complaints being sometimes increased or vitiated humors translated to a more noble and therefore more dangerous part at other times new disorders are formed and not unfrequently the most alarming symptoms come on and death at length closes the scene  it may seem from the futility or mischievous effects of many nostrums that any medicine whatever be its real excellence if offered to the public under the veil of secresy lies under a great disadvantage and must meet more or less with censure and contempt many undoubtedly who are fond of invective and wish to make a show of superior judgment will indiscriminately condemn every medicine of the sort and pretend to behold nothing but interested artifice on the part of the proprietor and mischief or at least insignificancy on the part of the medicine but this dogmatical method of condemning is evidently erroneous and must expose them that adopt it to ridicule and deserved censure it being in fact as absurd as on the other hand it would be to believe implicity all the virtues ascribed to every nostrum or to every simple etc either in an ancient or a modern materia medica as no rank of persons so no class of things universally deserves either panegyric or invective the merits or demerits of each must be singly considered and when weighed in the balance of impartial criticism receive praise or censure according to its respective degree of worth or vileness as common sense forbids to inveigh against all sovereigns because some are tyrants to censure all the professors of the law because many of them are obnoxious to it to condemn all physicians because some are illiterate or with the medical quixot to declaim against the use of bread because it is often ill made so likewise it will restrain the impartial and discerning from crying down every secret medicine notwithstanding many of them are the brats of mere quackery and imposture should a physician discover for instance a more efficacious preparation of the peruvian bark than is yet known keep the preparation secret and advertise and disperse it after the usual manner of nostrums the bark would not for this reason be less useful nor deserve the censure of the public because veiled from its eye even the great hoffman and other first rate physicians as well as quacks and medicasters have had their nostrums it is not therefore the mere secresy of a medicine or the manner in which it is exhibited to the world it is its being trifling or dangerous that must draw upon it the contempt and abhorrence which are due to the major part of advertised medicines  from the premises it appears notwithstanding the usual and commonly just outcry against nostrums that a medicine may with propriety be recommended and with service introduced to general use although its composition be not declared there may be honor and skill on the part of the inventor or proprietor and efficacy in the medicine  on this foundation a remedy is now offered the want of which has hitherto been and still is fatal to a great part of them who by their sex are liable to a greater number of diseases than men and by their characteristic qualifications claim the strictest attention etc i need not say that i mean the fair sex there is a period of their lives when the menses or monthly evacuations begin to be irregular and then finally cease this period admits of great latitude and many exceptions but generally happens between the age of forty and fifty and is the most critical time of womens lives the final irregularity and cessation of the menses being the origin of most perhaps of all the diseases which attack them either at that or any other succeeding time many who till this period had enjoyed the invaluable blessing of health are then seized with one or other of the various complaints that afflict the human frame some are speedily snatched away by an acute disease others fall a prey to a chronic distemper and become invalids for life many indeed by a peculiar happiness of constitution pass over this period without any remarkable inconvenience yet their number is much the larger who are then troubled with ailments and in these cases it is the common practice to prescribe a few doses of physic but as these seldom remove or even touch the cause so they rarely effect a cure the event of which is that the ailments increase and a disorder is at length formed either of the acute or chronic kind which still gaining ground from the presence or continuation of the primary cause baffles the usual methods of cure and the medioines which otherwise might have answered every intention here at most only palliate the symptoms  but it may be queried how can any medicine be supposed to possess such extensive efficacy as to subdue the variety of diseases to which females are exposed at the aforesaid period this query shall be fairly considered its elucidation will clearly point out what judgment is to be formed both of the medicine here recommended and in general of others that are advertised  in variety of instances it is demonstrable that the same disease may proceed from very different canses and it is equally certain that according to the diversity of the cause the method of cure must also be varied it is again a certainty that the same disease must often be treated in a different manner by reason of the difference of constitution age sex and of the different appearance degree inveteracy of the disease itself and moreover by reason of its combination with some other distemper it is thus in the headache toothach quinsies coughs in consumptions or decays in the apoplexy palsy deafness in colics in convulsive disorders the epilepsy tremours in the hypochondriac or nervous disease the same may be said of the rheumatism the scurvy cachexies the vertigo pleurisies melancholy madness etc etc and was the whole catalogue of diseases to be ran through and the principles of rational or judicious practice considered it would be found that the above variety of causes constitution age etc require to be so accurately distinguished and attended to that otherwise the best general method would frequently prove fruitless or noxious and consequently that more or less difference in prescribing medicines or a method of treatment will often be requisite for the recovery of sive patients out of six laboring under the same disorder with what shadow of probability then can the same drug or composition be fondly imagined a neverfailing cure for all afflicted with the scurvy or for all epileptics all that are consumptive or in short for all patients troubled with the same disease notwithstanding the insuperable impediments arising from the diversity of causes creating the disease from its changes its complication with others from the difference of age sex temperament seasons etc can the same medicine brace the fibers of youth and delicacy and relax those of age or warm the chills of the lymphatic constitution and cool the heats of the sanguine or break down the viscidity of the blood and conquer its putrefactive diathesis or act as a restorative in diseases from inanition and perform the office of evacuants in the same when brought on by a plethora or remove those cholics etc in which warm medicines are essential and the cool destructive and those too vice versa where the warm destroy and the cooling save nevertheless some of these or other such opposite indications are commonly met with in the same disease and proceed either from the varying symptoms which attend its different stages and progress or as was said before from the diversity of its cause of the patients constitution etc but as rationally might we believe the promised feats of a bottleconjurer or expect adventurers to inhabit the bottom of the sea and revisit its surface at pleasure as fancy that any medicine can possess qualities diametrically opposite and correspond with the widely differing intentions and methods of cure which are so often requisite in order to treat the same disease with success hence is evinced not only the small dependence that can be had on the generality of advertised medicines but also the danger that must attend their use and in fact where they chance to suit the constitution of one invalid accord with every symptom and indication of his disease and thus luckily perform a cure perhaps ten others afflicted with the same disease find no relief and as many more reap nothing from their trial but the aggravation of their complaints  if any medicines in the world can establish a well grounded confidence of their safety and efficacy it must be those which are usually termed specifics but how small is their number and how very frequently do they fail of success how often is their trial attended even with disadvantage with an increase of the disease they were intended to cure or with the introduction of some other and whence all this but because they are often administered without discernment the remperament of the patient the cause of the disease or some concomitant symptoms are not taken into consideration again they may be exhibited at an improper time too soon or too late or without a cautious preparation or are given in an incongruous form or quantity or are not qualified with the addition of other suitable ingredients which by restraining or increasing some of their properties should promote their efficacy such is too often the fate of the peruvian bark in intermittents of opium in spasms of tin for worms of steel for the chlorosis of cerated glass of antimony for the dysentery and sanguineous fluxes such likewise the fate attending the injudicious use of dr james celebrated powder which though a medicine of sovereign efficacy when given under his inspection or precisely according to his directions has nevertheless been productive of many bad consequences and has sometimes proved almost suddenly fatal and why because given without necessary precautions or in cases in which that ingenious physician as best knowing its composition and strength would have judged it improper perhaps perilous  the difficulties and danger which accompany the use of most nostrums or the unskilful exhibition of other medicines and which arise in part from their not being suited to the causes and complication of diseases to the difference of age sex etc have no place in the present subject of enquiry viz a method of treatment to prevent or remove the complaints which attend or follow the cessation of the menses here one sex only is concerned age is nearly the same the diseases or complications of disease which frequently seize the fair at or after the said period are indeed various yet the cause is but one such the difference between this and other medicines proposed as general cures for any malady almost every disease may have various and sometimes opposite causes the remedies therefore must be subject to the same variations and to more still when constitution age sex etc are taken into the account but respecting the remedy now offered to the fair every thing wears the pleasing aspect of certainty and safety it is adapted to them to the critical period of their lives to the radical cause which at that time involves so many of them in almost all the evils of pain and disease the varieties that may occur in their use of this remedy arise chiefly from the kind of morbid quality that may chance to affect the fluids and from the difference of constitution whether sanguine lymphatic etc or from their being of a robust and healthy or a delicate and infirm habit these variations are duly considered and directions adapted to each together with cautions and methods to be observed in the cases that usually happen at this period are laid down clearly and explicity and will be presented with the medicine  but to proceed as it may be acceptable to many to be informed of the complaints diseases danger which frequently accompany or follow the final cessation of the menses and to know what grounds there are to expect requisite assistance at that period from the use of the remedy and method of treatment here recommended i shall enter more minutely into these particulars  one grand point in the medical art is to discover and distinguish the real causes of disease another to choose that method of cure which all things considered is specifically proper safe and essectual  most diseases owe their formation either to some fault in the quantity or to the morbid qualities of the blood and other fluids  the principal cause of the diseases which afflict females at the period in question is manifest viz a general or partial plethora brought on by the cessation of the menses  when a long accustomed evacuation ceases a redundancy of blood etc must ensue and this excess now confined in the body receiving fresh additions and its wonted drain being checked must either disorder the whole frame by bringing on a general disease or collect in particular parts and generate the disorders to which those parts are respectively subject this is evident in the cessation of the haemorrhoids of the haemorrhage of the nose or of other usual sanguine evacuations the consequence being many and sometimes fatal diseases but daily observation demonstrates that those which follow the final cessation of the menses are more in number and attended with greater peril  secondly any morbid quality of the blood etc whether acrimonious viscid dissolvent etc that existed in the habit before the cessation after it becomes more predominant and these morbid qualities of the blood also give birth to a variety of disorders  from one or other of these causes singly or from their complication proceed the various diseases with which females are affected at the turn of life viz headachs spasmodic pains the vertigo large haemorrhages of the nose in the throat a quinsy sometimes succeeds the parts contained within the breast have their share of vexatious symptoms a palpitation of the heart an uneasiness in the praecordia with difficult breathing violent and lasting coughs the convulsive or dry asthma pleuritic pains not rarely a spitting of blood which returns at the usual time of the menses  variety of pains and ailments attack the stomach flatulencies distentions the cardialgia the heartburning loss of appetite etc  colics often torment the bowels nauseas and reachings to vomit are not unfrequent even a vomiting of blood now and then alarms the patient  the loins have their uneasy sensations and an inflammation of the kidneys has often followed it is easy to conceive that the womb particularly when the menses cease to flow becomes a seat of disease a sensation of weight and distention are here common and pains are sometimes felt which nearly equal those of labor of profuse frequent and sometimes fatal haemorrhages of dropsies inflammations ulcers scirrhous tumors cancers of this part instances are frequent sometimes a tumor or hard substance is there formed of considerable size its weight the frequent and violent returns of pain the attendant fever and other symptoms are similar to those which accompany a mole at other times the whole abdomen or belly grows big and turgid and in size and appearance resembles that of a pregnant woman this turgescency when mistaken for pregancy or neglected has continued in some one or two in others ten years and has sometimes lasted with life  to these evils which seize particular parts may be added those that distemper the whole habit a cacochymy or depravation of the humors and hence generally a cachexy or relaxed state of the solids  weight and weariness of the limbs particularly after exercise a corpulent or rather bloated habit oedematous swellings of the feet etc dropsies gouty and rheumatic pains wandering or fixed slow or nervous hectic inflammatory fevers a distemperature of the nerves and their subtle fluid which manifests itself by the frequent assault of hypochondriac hysteric convulsive or paralytic symptoms some of which are most troublesome at the changes of the moon and at the periods when the menses usually came on even madness has been a consequence of the cessation and was happily removed when the humors abound with scorbutic salts or other foulnesses the itch both of the dry and moist kind variety of other eruptions blotches etc disfigure and torment the patient obstinate ulcers and spreading sores especially on the legs are very frequent and the more so as age advances  besides these complaints one or more of which in a greater or less degree too often succeed and are occasioned by the cessation of the menses many other disorders either acute or chronical some of which are sometimes obscure and complicated and perhaps not easily reducible to any class of disease also arise from the same cause  and here it may be observed that although at the cessation no present inconvenience be perceived nevertheless it often happens that in the course of some months or years after it some disorder or other begins to appear and becomes exceedingly stubborn but might have been prevented had proper care been taken when the final irregularities and cessation of the menses first came on  having now indicated in part the various complaints to which the cessation of the menses subjects the fair it remains to show that the the medicine and method of cure recommended to their use are adapted to the cause of the said complaints and possessed of the properties requisite to remove them  it was observed above that the causes of the inconveniences and diseases which frequently accompany or succeed the final cessation of the menses are chiefly a redundancy and sometimes a vitiated state of the blood and other fluids the intentions of cure are therefore to lessen their quantity correct their vitiated qualities and remove the morbid symptoms viz obstructions relaxation etc which they may have generated in the solids  in order to answer these intentions the medicine under consideration is calculated to act on the blood lymph etc it enters even the smallest vessels causes a free circulation of their contained fluids and promotes every secretion and excretion it likewise cleanses the primae viae and keeps the body open by these means obstructions are removed from the uterine and other vessels from the viscera etc redundancies are carried off and the variety of complaints which the cessation of the menses might produce in the stomach and bowels are obviated or subdued it moreover contains a balsamic quality most friendly to the blood which preserves or restores the natural balsam of that fluid and being at the same time mildly attenuating prevents a glutinous or viscid state which is alone productive of many disorders the salutary effects of this medicine on the solids that is on the vessels and organs of the body merit also to be noticed it imparts to them a just degree of elasticity and strength to protrude their contained fluids and perform their several functions regularly and with ease thus by the peculiar qualities of this medicine assisted when necessary by other means which will be specified in the directions and which relate to the different state of the humors to constitution etc the following indications are fully answered viz redundancies are evacuated and thrown off by the different emunctories the faults of the fluids are obviated or corrected the solids are strengthened and the whole habit invigorated  here it may be remarked that this medicine is of equal service to females on many other occasions it frequently happens that the first eruption of the menses is slow difficult etc or that afterward they are irregular or deficient or otherwise deviate from their usual and healthy appearance or that they are checked for many months successively or in fine perhaps entirely cease long before the usual time of their cessation i have known several instances of their ceasing entirely and finally at the ages of thirty twentyseven twentysix once at twentyfive when the above complaints occur the strong emmenagogues or forcing medicines such as steel hellebore savin etc are too often advised but for the greater part are highly improper and very frequently are attended with pernicious consequences particularly if the patient be of a cachectic or relaxed habit or if the vessels or the viscera be obstructed in consequence of checked perspiration or a cold or of glutinous sluggish humors or if the irregularity or defect was brought on by the excessive use of astringents or in fine if any other species of evacuation has spontaneously or otherwise succeeded the said irregularity defect or suppression in these cases the above medicine as will be more particularly declared in the directions will without danger answer every desirable intention  this sketch of the virtues of the remedy and method of treatment here recommended to the sex is not merely theoretical or merely descriptive of the good effects which are to be wished for when the menses are irregular deficient or finally cease but is in fact a concise and candid relation of the efficacy and success with which their use has been accompanied in almost an infinite number of instances the above assertions being therefore established on experience which is above all authorities  any other panegyric would be useless  the cases attending or following the irregularities and cessation of the menses which have been brought to an happy issue by the method here recommended are so very numerous and various that a descriptive collection of them would swell to a moderate volume and probably would prove both satisfactory and serviceable almost every female patient might discover therein a case similar to her own and with pleasure observe it had been treated with safety and success perhaps too the professors of the healing art might not deem it an useless attempt particularly if the writer of these lines should in the said collection of cases fully communicate his observations on the cessation of the menses which though a fertile and fatal source of disease has hitherto been little noticed and generally improperly treated but other avocations permit me not to sit down to any thing of the kind moreover the fair sex only being here concerned the subject might to some appear rather too delicate to admit an historical detail and explication of cases  it should therefore seem sufficient that every female may know and have it in her power to obtain a remedy and directions which will answer her most sanguine wishes when arrived at the critical period of life or when before that period the free and healthy emanation of the menses is any way disturbed and this is the motive why the said remedy is thus offered to the sex as it will by this publication and by advertisements be far more speedily and universally known than by any other means but it may be said is not the authors own emolument also a motive i answer be that as it may the efficacy of the remedy is not for that reason the less again why should not the author reap some advantage from his endeavors to relieve and save multitudes but in truth the advantage will be in favor of the public first the medicine will be made with the best ingredients and nicest accuracy these are conditions without which medicines the most judiciously prescribed would often prove not fruitless only but noxious and was the composition of this medine declared who would answer that as many as made it up would strictly observe the above conditions hurry negligence bad drugs any presumptuous alteration or the substituting one ingredient for another faults which are too common and inexcusable would frustrate every hope every wished for effect these uncertainties and the dangerous consequences of neglect etc are cut off by entrusting the composition of this medicine to a person whose integrity and indefatigable attention are not to be called in question secondly the price of the medicine will be reduced to the lowest to the end that the inferior ranks as well as the opulent may purchase it with case and for a triflle receive that benefit which an expensive variety of drugs and repeated fees seldom procure at the period etc in question  let it be finally observed that hitherto this remedy has been made up in almost every form according to the inclination of different patients some preferring liquid others solid forms but now that it is intended for more general use it will be made into pills this form is less liable to accidents than any other may be carried from place to place without difficulty or injury and be taken by patients without trouble when on a journey visit etc  finis n b this remedy is sold under the name of balsamic pills by mrs hall perfumer at the corner of beaufort buildings no  0  in the strand and by mrs grigg milliner at dockhead southwark  this pamphlet is likewise sold by the said persons
