is strange the miser should his cares employ to gain those riches he can never enjoy is it less strange the prodigal should waste his wealth to purchase what he never can taste not for himself he sees or hears or eats artists must choose his pictures music meats he buys for topham drawings and designs for fountain statues and for curio coins rare monkish manuscripts for hearne alone and books for mead and rarities for sloan think we all these are for himself no more than his fine wife my lord or finer whore for what has virro painted built and planted only to show how many tastes he wanted

gardens of the lord viscount cobham in buckinghamshire stow without it proud versailles thy glory falls and neros terrasses desert their walls the vast parterres a thousand hands shall make lo bridgman comes and floats them with a lake or cut wide views through mountains to the plain you will wish your hill and sheltered seat again behold villarios tenyears toil complete his quincunx darkens his espaliers meet the wood supports the plain the parts unite and strength of shade contends with strength of light his bloomy beds a waving glow display blushing in bright diversities of day with silverquivring rills maeanderd over   enjoy them you villario can no more tired of the scene parterres and fountains yield he finds at last he better likes a field through his young woods how pleased sabinus strayed or sat delighted in the thickning shade with annual joy the redning shoots to greet and see the stretching branches long to meet his sons fine taste an opner vista loves foe to the dryads of his fathers groves one boundless green or flourished carpet views with all the mournful family of yews the thriving plants ignoble broomsticks made now sweep those allies they were born to shade yet hence the poor are clothed the hungry fed health to himself and to his infants bread the labrer bears what thy hard heart denies thy charitable vanity supplies another age shall see the golden ear imbrown thy slope and nod on thy parterre deep harvests bury all thy pride has planned and laughing ceres reassume the land at timons villa let us pass a day where all cry out what sums are thrown away so proud so grand of that stupendous air soft and agreeable come never there greatness with timon dwells in such a draught as brings all brobdignag before your thought to compass this his building is a town his pond an ocean his parterre a down who but must laugh the master when he sees a puny insect shivering at a breeze lo what huge heaps of littleness around the whole a labored quarry above ground two cupids squirt before a lake behind improves the keenness of the northern wind his gardens next your admiration call on every side you look behold the wall no pleasing intricacies intervene no artful wildeness to perplex the scene grove nods at grove each ally has a brother and half the platform just reflects the other the suffering eye inverted nature sees trees cut to statues statues thick as trees with here a fountain never to be played and there a summer house that knows no shade here amphitrite sails through myrtle bowers then the two famous statues of the gladiator pugnans and gladiator moriens gladiators fight or die in flowers unwaterd see the drooping seahorse mourn and swallows roost in nilus dusty urn behold my lord advances over the green smit with the mighty pleasure to be seen but soft  by regular approach  not yet  first through the length of yon hot terras sweat and when up ten steep slopes you have dragged your thighs just at his studydoor he will bless your eyes his study with what authors is it stored in books not authors curious is my lord to all their dated backs he turns you round these aldus printed those du sueil has bound lo some are vellom and the rest as good for all his lordship knows but they are wood for lock or milton it is in vain to look these shelves admit not any modern book and now the chappels silver bell you hear that summons you to all the pride of prayer light quirks of music broken and uneven make the soul dance upon a jig to heaven on painted cielings you devoutly stare where sprawl the saints of verrio or laguerre on gilded clouds in fair expansion lie and bring all paradise before your eye to rest the cushion and soft dean invite who never mentions hell to ears polite but hark the chiming clocks to dinner call a hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall the rich buffet wellcolourd serpents grace and gaping tritons spew to wash your face is this a dinner this a genial room no it is a temple and a hecatomb a solemn sacrifice performed in state you drink by measure and to minutes eat so quick retires each flying course you would swear sanchos dread doctor and his wand were there between each act the trembling salvers ring from soup to sweetwine and god bless the king in plenty starving tantalizd in state and complaisantly helped to all i hate treated caressed and tired i take my leave sick of his civil pride from morn to eve i curse such lavish cost and little skill and swear no day was ever past so ill in you my lord taste sanctifies expense for splendour borrows all her rays from sense you show us rome was glorious not profuse and pompous buildings once were things of use just as they are yet shall your noble rules fill half the land with imitating fools who random drawings from your sheets shall take and of one beauty many blunders make load some vain church with old theatric state turn arcs of triumph to a gardengate reverse your ornaments and hang them all on some patched doghole ekd with ends of wall then clap four slices of pilaster on it and laced with bits of rustic it is a front shall call the winds through long arcades to roar proud to catch
