women he knows is the last that would be entertained at the expense of another  of the characters of women an epistle to a lady nothing so true as what you once let fall most women have no characters at all matter too soft a lasting mark to bear and best distinguished by black brown or fair how many pictures of one nymph we view all how unlike each other all how true arcadias countess here in ermind pride there pastorella by a fountain side here fannia leering on her own good man and there a naked leda with a swan let then the fairone beautifully cry in magdalens loose hair and lifted eye or dressed in smiles of sweet cecilia shine with simpring angels palms and harps divine whether the charmer sinner it or saint it when folly grows romantic we must paint it come then the colors and the ground prepare dip in the rainbow trick her off in air choose a firm cloud before it falls and in it catch ere she change the cynthia of this minute rufa whose eye quickglancing over the park attracts each light gay meteor of a spark agrees as ill with rufa studying lock as flavias diamonds with her dirty smock or flavias self in glue her rising task and issuing flagrant to an evening mask so morning insects that in muck begun shine buzz and flyblow in the settingsun how soft is silia fearful to offend the frail ones advocate and weak ones friend to her calista proved her conduct nice and good simplicius asks of her advice sudden she storms she raves you tip the wink but spare your censure silia does not drink all eyes may see from what the change arose all eyes may see  a pimple on her nose papillia wedded to her amorous spark sighs for the shades  how charming is a park a park is purchased but the fair he sees all bathed in tears  oh odious odious trees ladies like variegated tulips show it is to their changes half their charms we owe such happy spots the nice admirer take fine by defect and delicately weak twas thus calypso once our hearts alarmed awed without virtue without beauty charmed her tongue bewitched as odly as her eyes less wit than mimic more a wit than wise strange graces still and stranger flights she had was just not ugly and was just not mad yet never so sure our passion to create as when she touched the brink of all we hate narcissas nature tolerably mild to make a wash would hardly stew a child has even been proved to grant a lovers prayer and paid a tradesman once to make him stare gave alms at easter in a christian trim and made a widow happy for a whim why then declare goodnature is her scorn when it is by that alone she can be born why pique all mortals yet affect a name a fool to pleasure yet a slave to fame now deep in tailor and the book of martyrs now drinking citron with his grace and ch now conscience chills her and now passion burns and atheism and religion take their turns a very heathen in the carnal part yet still a sad good christian at her heart flavias a wit has too much sense to pray to toast our wants and wishes is her way nor asks of god but of her stars to give the mighty blessing while we live to live then all for death that opiate of the soul lucretias dagger rosamondas bowl say what can cause such impotence of mind a spark too fickle or a spouse too kind wise wretch of pleasures too refined to please with too much spirit to be ever at ease with too much quickness ever to be taught with too much thinking to have common thought you purchase pain with all that joy can give and die of nothing but a rage to live turn then from wits and look on simos mate no ass so meek no ass so obstinate or her that owns her faults but never mends because she is honest and the best of friends or her whose life the church and scandal share for ever in a passion or a prayer or who in sweet vicissitude appears of mirth and opium ratafie and tears the daily anodyne and nightly draught to kill those foes to fair ones time and thought woman and fool are two hard things to hit for true nomeaning puzzles more than wit pictures like these dear madam to design asks no firm hand and no unerring line some wandering touches some reflected light some flying stroke alone can hit them right for how should equal colors do the knack camelions who can paint in white and black in public stations men sometimes are shown a womans seen in private life alone our bolder talents in full view displayed your virtues open fairest in the shade bred to disguise in public it is you hide where none distinguish twixt your shame and pride weakness or delicacy all so nice each is a sort of virtue and of vice in several men we several passions find in women two almost divide the kind those only fixed they first or last obey the love of pleasures and the love of sway that nature gives and where the lesson taught is but to please can pleasure seem a fault experience this by mans oppression cursed they seek the second not to lose the first men some to business some to pleasure take but every woman is at heart a rake men some to quiet some to public strife but every lady would be queen for life yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens power all their end but beauty all the means in youth they conquer with so wild a rage as leaves them scarce a subject in their age for foreign glory foreign joy they roam no thought of peace or happiness at home but wisdoms triumph is welltimd retreat as hard a science to the fair as great beauties like tyrants old and friendless grown yet hate repose and dread to be alone worn out in public weary every eye nor leave one sigh behind them when they di pleasures the sex as children birds pursue still out of reach yet never out of view sure if they catch to spoil the toy at most to covet flying and regret when lost at last to follies youth could scarce defend it grows their ages prudence to pretend ashamed to own they gave delight before reduced to feign it when they give no more as hags hold sabbaths less for joy than spite so these their merry miserable night still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide and haunt the places where their honor died see how the world its veterans rewards a youth of frolicks an old age of cards fair to no purpose artful to no end young without lovers old without a friend a fop their passion but their prize a sot alive ridiculous and dead forgot ah friend to dazzle let the vain design to raise the thought and touch the heart be thine that charm shall grow while what fatigues the ring flaunts and goes down an unregarded thing so when the suns broad beam has tired the sight all mild ascends the moons more sober light serene in virgin modesty she shines and unobserved the glaring orb declines oh blessed with temper whose unclouded ray can make to morrow cheerful as to day that pleased can see a younger charm or hear sighs for a sister with unwounded ear that never shall answer till a husband cool or if you rule him never show you rule please by receiving by submitting sway yet have your humor most when you obey let fops or fortune fly which way they will despise all loss of tickets or codille spleen vapors or smallpox above them all and mistress of youtself though china fall and yet believe me good as well as ill womans at best a contradiction still heaven when it strives to polish all it can its last best work but forms a softer man picks from each sex to make the favorite blessed your love of pleasure our desire of rest blends in exception to all general rules your taste of follies with our scorn of fools reserve with frankness art with truth allied courage with softness modesty with pride fixed principles with fancy ever new shakes all together and produces  you even such is womans fame with this unblest toasts live a scorn and queens may die a jest this phoebus promised i forget the year when those blue eyes first opened on the sphere ascendant phoebus watched that hour with care averted half your parents simple prayer and gave you beauty but denied the pelf that buys your sex a tyrant over itself that generous god who wit and gold refines and ripens spirits as he ripens mines kept dross for duchesses the world shall know it to you gave sense
