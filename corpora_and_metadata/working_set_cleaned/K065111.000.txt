some account of the medicinal water near tewkesbury with thoughts on the use and diseases of the lymphatic glands  in a letter to edward johnstone m d  a physician to the general hospital birmingham etc  by james johnstone m d  one of the physicians to the general infirmary worcester fellow of the royal medical society edinburgh of the philosophical society manchester and corresponding member of the medical society london   sacros ausus recludere fontes second edition with additions  tewkesbury printed and sold by did and son  mdccxc  the preface though walton water is here held out as possessing the same properties and medicinal powers as cheltenham water it is not done with the most distant view to lessen the reputation of that water and the resort to cheltenham on the contrary it is presumed it will be a satisfaction to invalids to be assured of having within a small distance a water of the same kind to which recourse may be had when the numbers are so great at cheltenham as to be insufficiently supplied from the well there  in this point of view the water near tewkesbury must be useful to cheltenham in full seasons and cannot injure it in any one at its priority in use and the habit of resort for amusement as well as health will give cheltenham the preference  tewkesbury however has equally a right to the benefit of its natural riches and to the advantages which may accrue to it from the vicinity of walton waters in particular this borough is situated on a fertile plain at the conflux of the river avon with the severn the town is well built and now well paved and provisions of every kind particularly the finest salmon are in great plenty it communicates by a very good road to fine rides toward worcester upton and malvern and is only nine miles from cheltenham  in these rides the various views of a most picturesque country charm the eye and make the salutary exercise of riding delightful malvern rising in bnign majesty diffuses all around a pure and temperate air a water exceeding all others in elementary purity which every year manifests its salubrity in curing diseases which have bassied the power of medicine in other situations  tewkesbury and its environs besides the striking beauties of the country present to the observation of the curious a field of battle where victory fixed the crown on the head of edward iv a church one of the finest gothic structures in england in which lie the remains of edward prince of wales son of henry vi cruelly murdered in cold blood with the duke of somerset and many other noblemen and gentlemen who shared his fate after that decisive battle   sacros ausus recludere fontes my motto is proper in more senses than one for taking advantage of the epistolary form i have attempted to illustrate the use of the lymphatic glands acknowledged to be hitherto undiscovered as well as to make known the properties of a new medicinal water  sir at length i send you an account of the experiments made on the medicinal water near tewkesbury of which so much has been said at cheltenham in the course of this season and the last  i first heard of this water in passing through tewkesbury in      it had been for some time resorted to by persons in the neighborhood and was reported to have effected cures in the diseases for which cheltenham water is sound to be so efficacious and on account of which persons of every rank resort to that place in such numbers as to exhaust sometimes the spring on which they rest their hopes of recovery  this well is situated near walton a village about a mile from tewkesbury upon an estate belonging to nicholas smithsend esquire the ground about the well is a deep clay soil under which at the depth of about seven or eight yards runs a stratum of blue slaty stone on piercing this bed of stone plentiful springs of water arise which are always more or less impregnated with salt  the well of which i write is about twenty feet deep  the water from the pump or soon after hasa soft almost oleaginous taste numerous air bubbles rise and sparkle in the glass after it has been drank it leaves the chalybeate and saline tastes on the tongue and when shook in the bottle the hepatic smell is very perceptible  its resemblance in taste and other appearances to the cheltenham water strikes every one who makes the comparison  its operation on the body also is exactly the same a pint or more acts as a gentle laxative and diuretic and it occasions a slight giddiness in some persons in others a sort of heavy pain in the head  these tests though of themselves sufficiently convincing will be confirmed by the experiments which i made on the walton water in the summer of      and this summer in which i had the assistance of the worthy surgeons and apothecaries at tewkesbury   when the walton water is mixed with clear siltered lime water it becomes immediately cloudy and a copious white scaly precipitation ensues  the same cloudy appearance arises in lime water when the air separated by heat from the walton water is conveyed by a pipe and bladder connected with the two bottles into the bottle containing the lime water and shaken with it  if the walton water has been taken from the well twelve or more hours the precipitation by lime water does not take place immediately in the manner it does in a glass of water from the pump  white arsenic dissolves more readily in the walton water than in common water and renders the hepatic smell thereof stronger and more perceptible    when walton water fresh from the pump is mixed with an infusion of green tea the mixture assumes a purple color and by standing the color becomes deeper    solution of saccharum saturni mixed with fresh drawn water becomes brown and is followed by a blackish precipitation this is a test of the presence of hepatic air which also discovers itself in this water by its characteristic sulphurous smell this often is produced by putrefying vegetables bishop watson observes that sulphurous waters are produced in morasses and bogs from rotten wood that shale a stone so called of which there is a stratum extended all over the country about harrowgate and from which the sulphur springs there arise contains both vitriolic acid and phlogiston the constituent parts of sulphur and some pieces of shale when calcined properly have been found to communicate the sulphurous impregnation to water ph trans      it is sufficient to observe that walton water emerges from a bed of stone and of a blue sulphurous soft pyrites probably similar to this and that the soil abounds with the remains of rotten vegetables resolved into it and that from one or both these sources it derives the hepatic gas perceived in it  the blue sulphurous pyrites found in digging the ground in the field belonging to the wellhouse near walton has exactly the same appearance and properties as that dug to make a new well near fauconberghouse by order of his majesty    after walton water has been drawn from the pump ten or twelve hours it no longer becomes purple or blackish by the addition of astringents no ii and a precipitation with lime water does not immediately ensue no i    its color neither becomes green nor red with syrup of violets    it does not effervesce with the vitriolic or nitrous acids    it becomes milky by mixture with the fixed alkali and more so with the volatile alkali prepared with lime    solution of silver makes it milky and a flaky precipitation subsides    two ingenious friends and accurate observers found the whole fixed contents of the water left by evaporation amounted to one ounce in a gallon   0 after various evaporations i found it yielded exactly that quantity  when a gallon of the water is reduced by evaporation to two ounces and under a considerable quantity of an earthy powder remains in the vessel in which it was boiled and when the liquid is set to cry stallise crystals in shape and size resembling the vitriolated magnesia are formed they are hexagonal and when dried in the sun are calcined into a white powder the taste cool and bitter  some cubical crystals of marine salt and a deliquescent bitter lixivium remain  the powder dropped by boiling in the vessel consists of magnesia and an absorbent earth which entirely dissolve in vinegar with considerable esservescence  the quantity of large crystals amounted to six drachms or more from a gallon of water evaporated in      but by after experiments i find this impregnation is not constantly in the same quantity and proportion     lastly the crystals of the walton water and the white powder into which these dried crystals sall when dissolved the solution is again perfect and clear in an exceedingly small quantity of water  salt of tartar added to this solution becomes milky and a copious white sediment subsides sound to be magnesia  lime water added to the solution occasions a milky whiteness and a soft alkaline precipitation but it does not happen near so soon as that made by falt of tarter  some farther experiments on walton water made in november      by john johnstone b a of merton college oxford the water on which the following experiments were tried had been drawn from the spring several weeks before it was used and though it was conveyed from walton to birmingham in bottle well corked and covered with wax yet the appearances which result from the presence of the volatile ingredients are not to be expected in these experiments    this water did not immediately become purple with tincture of galls but by standing it contracted a dusky greenish color with a variegate pellicle at the top    phlogisticated alkali did not occasion any change of the color in the water  the fixed air having escaped the iron was precipitated and of course could not exhibit those appearances which it did in the experiments made by my father at the spring    syrup of violets made it of a light green color tincture of turnsole became brown when mixed with it tincture of brazil wood gave it a blue cast  the appearances produced by these three precipitants were occasioned either by magnesia or alkali disengaged by the escape of the fixed air    acid of sugar discovered lime by precipitating it in the form of a white powder    salited terra ponderosa by attracting the vitriolic acid occasioned a white turbidness in this water    nitrated silver showed the presence of marine acid its attraction for it producing a white cloud which on standing became of a black color    an alkali very copiously precipitated a white powder which appeared to be magnesia  by several experiments a quart of the walton water yielded on evaporation   0 grains  i the residue of a quart of this water was first mixed with alcohol which took up   grains of it this by its deliquescing in the air was found to consist of magnesia  ii distilled water dissolved  0  grains of it as i could not crystallise the whole i cannot tell the proportion of each salt but i had reason both from what did crystallise and from experiment to suppose that vitriolated magnesia is the most abundant in this water a quantity of alcohol sufficient to precipitate the bases of those salts in which there was vitriolic acid was mixed with a pint of walton water a copious precipitation ensued which on examination proved to be magnesia alone for on adding syrup of violets to the magnesia in distilled water no evidence of alkali appeared more than what magnesia would alone have given  to a quart of walton water was added a quantity of vegetable alkali sufficient to precipitate all the magnesia when the precipitation was over the whole was siltered and the water set to crystallise the crystals in general were those of vitriolated tartar and a few resembling those of glaubers salts appeared a very small quantity remained uncrystallised which perhaps was common salt  iii distilled vinegar was mixed with what the water left and took up   grains of it on examination this proved to be lime it had a remarkable pungent taste did not deliquesce in the air and formed on the addition of vitriolic acid a kind of gypsum  iv an alkali diminished the remainder   grain i could not exactly tell what the alkali took up here but it seemed to be a kind of argillaccous earth  v the alkali left nearly   grain of a black looking earth this was mixed with diluted marine acid which dissolved nearly the whole of it phlogisticated alkali dropped into the solution immediately produced a very bright blue color i therefore concluded that the grain and very small quantity more which the marine acid had dissolved was iron the small quantity of earth which did not dissolve in the acid as it resisted all the above mixtures i concluded to be siliceous earth  there appears then to be in a quart of walton water  grains i of aerated magnesia   ii of different salts but chiefly epsom  0  iii of aerated lime   iv of earth perhaps argillaceous   v of aerated iron with a little siliceous earth    cheltenham water of which i had a few bottles exhibited the same appearances with precipitants only in some instances they were more striking  a quart of cheltenham water yielded on evaporation     grains i tried the experiments with alcohol and vegetable alkali on cheltenham with the same appearances as with walton water only a large crystal of glaubers salt appeared in the vessel with the alcohol  experiment   shows walton water abounds with fixed air lime becomes quick calcined or caustic by the expulsion of this air by fire and being attracted again from this water the calcareous matter before held in solution becomes mild and precipitates in form of a clear and white powder the immediate precipitation which takes place by the mixture of walton water with lime water and still more clearly the air forced from walton water agitated with lime water is therefore a certain test of the presence of fixed air in walton water    by this experiment iron in a small quantity appears to be one of the sugitive ingredients in the walton water this as well as some absorbent earth is kept in a dissolved state by the fixed air and the sulphurous gas contained in it when the fixed air flies off which it does much sooner than the hepatic gas the iron precipitates and the water is no longer capable of becoming purple by astringents the action of heat carries off the hepatic gas which appears to hold the absorbent earths in solution which are left by evaporation and to which the soft almost oleaginous taste with which this water strikes the tongue is probably owing    the addition of saccharum saturni discovers the presence of the hepatic air another fugitive principle contained in this water as well as that of cheltenham but it is much less fugitive than fixed air being often perceived both in the cheltenham and walton waters after they have been bottled a considerable time this sulphurous or hepatic air found in this and in other waters has been the occasion of much controversy among the gentlemen who have analyzed waters mr kirwan has probably finally settled the dispute by showing that hepatic air is no other than actual sulphur kept in solution in an acrial state by union with the matter of heat ph tr    it is evident from this article that the fixed air only dissolves and keeps iron suspended in the water its disappearance so soon shows its very volatile nature and the necessity of resorting to these springs to have the benefit of a principle and ingredient which gives penetrability and action to the saline contents of the waters      show the salts contained in these waters are neutral and that neither the acid nor the alkali of which they are compounded prevail      demonstrate that vitriolated magnesia is the principal salt contained in the walton water the attraction of an alkaline salt and especially that of the caustic alkali with the vitriolic acid is greater than that of the magnesia which is precipitated in these experiments    the existence of sea salt is manifested by this experiment and by the cubic crystals formed in the residuum     0 from all our experiments fixed air dissolving a small quantity of iron hepatic air united with an absorbent earth appear to be the fugitive ingredients of the walton water the fixed ingredients discovered by evaporation and crystallisation appear to be a vitriolated magnesia united with a little vitriolated mineral alkali in the quantity of six or seven drachms in one gallon of water magnesia lime and absorbent earth and a deliquescent bitter lixivium consisting of salited magnesia and lime with a few grains of entire sea salt altogether about a dram or two to a gallon  that these also are the component medicinal ingredients in the cheltenham water appears by the analysis of the learned dr fothergill of bath  this gentleman in his very valuable experimental enquiry into the nature and qualities of cheltenham water p    concludes from the preceding experiments a gallon of the water wine measure appears to contain the subsequent principles nearly in the following proportions native glauber salt with a portion of epsom salt one ounce sea salt five grains iron combined with fixed air five grains magnesia combined with fixed air twenty five grains calcareous earth or selenite forty grains fixed air combined with phlogisticated air twentyfour ounce measures to these may perhaps be added a small proportion of hepatic gas or hepar sulphuris converted into vapor by the separation of its phlogiston this useful work has been much improved and enlarged in the second edition   by this ingenious work it appears and is sufficiently known to all who frequent cheltenham that the iron is very soon precipitated from the water after it is drawn from the pump and in a short time it cannot be made to assume a purple color by the addition of astringents  the salts of the walton and cheltenham waters are both soluble in a very small quantity of water equal to their weight nearly and their impression on the human senses and their action in the bowels is the same  in so many points the cheltenham and walton mineral waters are entirely like each other a pint or less of each opens the body some find a small addition of the walton necessary to produce the same effect in the same degree others find no difference the purgative salt is somewhat less about a dram in a gallon in my experiments but the quantity of fixed air and steel are at least equal the hepatic air seems to prevail in the walton water over the cheltenham which gives it a most pleasing almost oleaginous softness and makes it highly grateful in taste and gentle in operation and far more suitable in diseases of the kidneys and urinary passages than the cheltenham water itself  without therefore entering into a farther detail of chemical research i apprehend the similarity of the walton to the cheltenham water to be sufficiently ascertained to warrant its use and application in the diseases for which cheltenham waters have been used with advantage  the analysis of mineral waters undoubtedly is highly useful but notwithstanding the perfection to which it is carried by discoveries in modern chemistry i apprehend it gives a very imperfect idea of the real composition of waters in short such an idea as diffection gives of an animated body a view of its parts disjointed and separate very different from that union on which symmetry and life depend  it is on this account that the exhibition of the ingredients found to compose mineral waters and the imitations of many of them administered as medicines fall short of the waters prepared by nature especially when drank at the sources  it is the same in other parts of the materia medica an analysis in some measure assists in accounting for the operation of a medicine but seldom enables us to prepare and compound to perfection the natural productions we pretend to imitate these sentiments have been distinguished by the approbation of m marcard his majestys physician at hanover in his learned account of the waters at pyrmout   the use and advantage of waters is established by experience alone as well as that of every article in the materia medica the advantages found from the use of the walton well in various eruptive diseases and in old sordid ulcers as well as in many other diseases has already been so considerable as to confirm the expectation grounded on their being similar to the cheltenham water  it will undoubtedly be found as much like cheltenham water as that water is like itself at different seasons seasons occasion accidental differences of saturation in all mineral waters the cause of which is sometimes known and sometimes unknown rainy seasons while they make springs more abundant render the mineral impregnation at the same time weaker to this alteration the walton water must be sometimes liable as it lies on a plain part of which is frequently overflowed with water but if by experience this shall be sound to have any considerable influence means will be used to remove the inconvenience an inconvenience which is very seldom likely to happen in dry and warm seasons in which waters of this class are for the most part resorted to  after all i am persuaded that the dilution of mineral waters is very seldom any injury to the patient the virtues and powers of mineral water depending principally on the quantity of water the medium in which the medicinal ingredients are suspended the vehicle which conveys them into the smallest vessels and makes them capable of removing obstructions fixed in them and in various glands hence the same medicinal ingredients given in the usual forms have but little efficacy in removing such diseases  the healing powers of the walton well and those of its sister of cheltenham are owing to the mixture of a neutral compound of vitriolated magnesia commonly called epsom or cathartic salt to vitriolated mineral alkali or glauber salt with a small portion of salited mineral alkali magnesia and lime nearly to the quantity of a dram in a pint of water also to a considerable quantity of fixed air and hepatic gas by the former of which iron and by the latter magnesia and absorbent earth are held in solution  the whole is a composition friendly to appetite and digestion as well as soft and pleasing to the taste it is also a penetrating deobstruent and attenuating medicine and in sensible operation a quick and gentle laxative and diuretic and when applied with discretion it may be continued a long time without any dimunition of strength  it is obvious this water contains saline ingredients and others possessing different attractive powers and assinities which though balanced in the water yet when mixed with animal fluids and salts in the course of digestion chylisication and in circulation with the blood must be so changed and varied as to form new attractions and combinations in their course through the vessels whence compounds possessing properties different from what existed before will be produced and the system itself will be changed it is well known that cold is generated by dissolving salts and that while saline bodies of different affinities and attractive powers are forming new compounds such salts in the process of mutual attraction and incorporation produce heat in this manner and from such causes new stimuli with other alterations take place in the glands and remoter vessels of our system from the salts combined with other ingredients in mineral waters and it is by these means as well as evacuation they become beneficial and are really valuable alterative medicines  the walton waters being a compound sui geveris similar to cheltenham they both operate primarily and principally on the intestines as a gentle purgative their mode of operation says dr smith p       upon the intestines producing an easy sudden discharge is explainable upon the principle of the tenuity and uniform diffusion of the ingredients in the water for the water after having performed its strengthening and exhilarating office upon the stomach passes quickly into the intestines as sluids do carrying along with it more or less of all its ingredients but particularly its great dilution and consequent dispersion all over the internal surface of the canal vellicates the innumerable little exhalent vessels with which that cavity is crowded into a plentiful secretion and notwithstanding the stimulus may be but slight on any particular part on account of the minuteness of the particles of the salt yet as they are universally diffused and act upon the whole system of exhalents at once a more eopious and expeditious evacuation is produced than what is often attainable from a much larger quantity of any of the other more stimulating purgatives less attenuated attended at the same time with these important advantages that as the stimulus is gentle no griping pain is likely to be excited and as it is superficial the particles must soon be washed off in the general current without leaving behind them any of those disagreeable feelings that usually hang in the rear of other cathartics see observations on the use and abuse of cheltenham waters by j smith m d savilian professor of geometry oxford   corollary mineral waters in general derive their healing powers much less from the metals earths and salts often inconsiderable in quantity which remain after evaporation than from the volatile principles united with them but diluted in a very great proportion of water and they universally owe the activity the whole possesses to the incorporation of the volatile and sugitive principles both with the water and with the grosser ingredients combined together most intimately  the taste of the walton water fresh from the spring as has been already observed is at first soft and afterward agreeably saline the sulphur and iron are also plainly tasted in it in the quantity of a pint and often less it occasions two or three lax stools and operates without the least sickness griping or any kind of inconvenience  the quantity of urine is also increased it sits easy on the stomach and appetite is promoted  the volatile principles fly off soon after the water is removed from the well and as these are so essential to its efficacy and render it agreeable to the taste and stomach and carry the saline invigorating and deobstruent contents of the water into the vessels and glands it is necessary to drink it from the pump or very soon afterward  these waters not only remove costiveness but increase appetite and the powers of digestion the chylification of digested aliment is more perfectly elaborated and the errors of the first digestion prevented and remedied in an effectual manner whatever is injurious to health in the stomach and and intestines acidity and ilious putrid matter are carried out of the body worms and their nidus are expelled in this manner the seeds of disease will be prevented in the chyliferous vessels and the chyle itself being highly elaborated and withal diluted with the water enters the lacteals possessing such qualities and powers as bid fair to obviate and remove obstructions which have taken place in the channels of the chyle and lymph  hence obstructions in the mesentery and glands will gradually be resolved as this water will be likely to dilute and dissolve any tenacious matter incapable of moving in the chyliferous vessels on account of its glutinous cheeselike and steatomatous consistence and will stimulate the vessels and mesenteric glands by its saline contents so as to enable them to push on any obstructing matter  some portion of the waters being absorbed will act as a powerful deobstruent in obstructions of the liver  by thinning the hepatic bile and carrying that fluid regularly into the intestines by preventing the stagnation of bile in the gallbladder by gently stimulating the biliary vessels and increasing their action in a word by the united insluence of these powers recent obstructions or older scirrhosities which have taken place either at home or by residence in warm climates will be remodied  calculous concretions in the biliary ducts and in the gallbladder when of a size capable of being carried into the intestines will be disposed to be moved thither by that stimulus which acting originally on the duodenum will extend its influence along the ductus choledochus in like manner new concretions of the biliary kind will be effectually prevented  so that this water will be found a very effectual remedy for jaundice arising from gallstones as well as from other causes obstructing the discharge of the bile into the intestines it will also be found useful in removing obstructions in the substance of the liver and in preventing hemmorrhoidal and other discharges of blood which most frequently originate from obstructions in the liver  hemmorrhoidal swellings and discharges of blood from other causes obstructing or retarding its motion and return through the branches of the vena portarum will be eased or relieved by a seasonable use of this water  the softness which is peculiar to this water renders it proper in diseases of the urinary passages as it acts powerfully on the kidneys and occasions an increased secretion there as well as in the intestinal tube gravelly concretions will be prevented or washed away as the secretion of urine is in experience sound essential for carrying out of the body the salts and oils which are prejudicial to health purity of blood will be very greatly promoted by the increase of this secretion so that by the free discharge from this emunctory along with that from the alimentary canal the skin will be cleansed from hot red eruptions and from scaly and scabby incrustations which notoriously arise from a blood and habit overloaded with acrid and impure matter when by excess in diet or by improper food by imperfect digestion or inadequate secretion and excretion such acrid corrupt matter is formed and retained in our bodies gentle evacuation by the use of such waters is generally a certain relief under these circumstances this has been experienced by various persons but very remarkably by one tanner from kidderminster who has had a leprous eruption removed from his face and other parts by drinking the walton water and applying it externally which relief for six years past he had not obtained by any means whatever  the preserving the bile in a fluid state and the regular conveyance of it into the duodenum will powerfully operate in completing the digestion and chylification of the food and will give the blood those properties which support the health and vigor of the body  with that all cutaneous soulness will disappear and the bloom of beauty reassume its charms along with the ease and cheerfulness inseparable from wholesome sluids and from good health  by removing the somes which causes scurvies scrophulous herpetic eruptions leprosies and every kind of cutaneous soulness whether of the red and pimply or the scaly and ulcerous kinds i say by gradually draining off this fomes and soliciting its exit from the emunctories such foulnesses of the skin accompanied with itchings sores and even scirrhous and cancerous taints will often be prevented removed or palliated  chronic weakness and dejection of spirits arising frequently from the same latent sources will receive relief from the salutary though slow operation of these waters  obstructions in the uterine system suppressions of the menstrual discharge and other irregularities and excesses peculiar to it the fluor albus scirrhous tumors and other diseases of the womb will in many circumstances and constitutions find a useful remedy in the walton water  obstructions left by the long continuance and the frequent return of intermittent fevers will probably yield to a prudent use of these waters and they will prepare the patient and put him in a fit state to receive further benefit from the bark  obstructions in the lungs from a scorbutic cause and acrid humors in the blood and inveterate ophthalmias have been relieved and are likely to be successfully treated by the walton water  i shall not give many directions concerning the use of this water professedly similar to that of cheltenham the method of drinking of which has been long ascertained by established usage and the public is possessed of the directions of eminent and able practitioners explanatory of their experience in this point  the summer months are the season to drink the walton waters as they will in these months and in dry weather be in their most perfect state of impregnation  like cheltenham the walton waters are their own preparative three quarters of a pint drank at the pump may be taken in the morning and afternoon this quantity may be increased to three halfpints afterward if the former quantity does not sufficiently open the body  but i would observe that the middle doses such as merely preserve the body in a lax state not exceeding three stools daily are preferable to larger doses and to greater evacuation the business and intention being to carry off the illdigested remains of meals perhaps of excess and of luxury and of all kinds of corrupt recrementitious matter lodged in the alimentary canal without impairing strength and digestion  early hours are necessary to an advantageous use of the waters at the well where only they are drank without the loss of the active volatile ingredients which give power to those that are more fixed to penetrate into the glands and smallest vessels  exercise sub dio is also equally proper to second the operation of the water and to strengthen the body  an easy digested nutrient diet consisting when it agrees with the stomach of milk in the morning and at night of light meats and vegetables at dinner with general temperance and moderation in the use of vinous liquors rather than total abstinence from them is highly expedient  in a situation where excellent fish is so plentiful it is proper to observe that moderation in this article will be prudent as a very frequent use of fish is found often prejudicial in discases of the skin and sometimes produces the more obstinate diseases of that class diseases for which these waters are peculiarly proper  it is almost superfluous to add that however useful it may be to entertain the mind with pleasing society and an agreeable succession of amusements it is always necessary to retire to rest at an early hour and before eleven oclock at farthest to be in bed that the constitution may have the advantage of natures sweet restorer balmy sleep  in the cutaneous diseases and many of the affections of the glands for which the internal use of these waters is proper baths of different degrees of heat from that of common cold water to that of one hundred degrees of fahrenheits scale will be highly expedient this will appear in a stronger light from what i shall offer concerning the sunctions and diseases of the lymphatic glands i apprehend the diseases of these glands are chiefly to be reached by the means of remedies which are applied so as to be absorbed by the lymphatic vessels which pass to the glands i am confident that the most obstinate cutaneous and glandular diseases would yield to a due perseverance in the external and internal use of waters and other proper remedies but what these remedies are and also the use whether external or internal of mineral waters and of medicines of all kinds which are to produce any important and salutary consequence can only be determined in particular cases and constitutions by the judgment of an able and experienced physician  thoughts on the functions and diseases of the lymphatic glands the use of mineral waters in diseases of the glands leads me to offer some thoughts which i believe are either new or have not been enough attended to concerning the use and diseases of the lymphatic glands  the lymphatic system which makes an important article in the anatomical discoveries of the last century has received much improvement in this it is not my business to assign to each improver or discoverer his due proportion of merit i acknowledge my obligations to them all to haller meckel monro mr hewson dr william hunter and mr john hunter mr sheldon and mr cruikshank who have all contributed and some of them very splendidly to perfect the knowledge of this important part of the animal system and let them not deem it amiss that profiting by their labors i endeavor to make them subservient to the knowledge of the animal economy and to the healing art  that the lymphatic vessels arise from every viscus and from every cavity in the body as well as from the skin and the cellular membrane investing the body in prodigious and till lately in undiscovered numbers is an anatomical truth of the greatest importance now clearly demonstrated and universally acknowledged  the lymphatic vessels and lacteals are of the same kind and constitute a system of vessels no where connected with the veins containing red blood but which universally terminate in the lacteal sac and duct and convey chyle and lymph collected in every part into the subclaviam vein where it mixes with the blood and no where else  the sole and exclusive function of this system of vessels is absorption  some indeed have held that the red veins are supplementary absorbents especially on some occasions and the illustrious walther and others with some probability have assigned this office to the vena portarum especially in diseases in which the conglobate glands of the mesentery are scirrhous or obliterated by age as some have supposed or the lacteal sac and duct itself is obstructed the proofs of this are equivocal and accounted for on different principles by the school of hunter particularly by that accurate anatomist mr john hunter who first discovered that absorption is carried on by the lymphatic vessels alone  the lacteal and lymphatic vessels universally pass through conglobate glands before the fluid they convey reaches the lacteal duct those arising from the intestines enter the different orders of mesenteric glands and the chyle and lymph deposited in these glands is again absorbed from them by the vasa lymphatica efferentia in order to be conveyed to the thoracic duct cruikshank passim p      this law is universal and the lymphatic veins wherever they arise in no instance enter into the lacteal duct without previously and repeatedly throwing the lymph into the conglobate glands which are an essential part of this system a part of the greatest importance for the advantage of which the lymph is absorbed in order to be conveyed to them and from them the lymph is taken up in a more purified and assimilated state and is conveyed by the lymphatica efferentia into the lacteal sac and duct  the structure of these glands is both vascular and cellular into these cells the lymph is thrown and the absorbing lymphatics the lymphatica efferentia are the only excretories to all the conglobate glands the uses of which are acknowledged to be unknown and undiscovered by gentlemen to whom anatomists are so much indebted messrs sheldon and cruikshank the latest improvers of the lymphatic system the ingenious discoverers who have lately so much improved the knowledge of the lymphatic system all acknowledge their ignorance of the use of these glands mr cruikshank the latest publisher on this subject says though we know something more of the nature structure and diseases of the lymphatic glands we know no more of their real use than the ancients as they inform us however of the passage of infections matter into the blood and as from their state we are enabled to judge of the presence or absence of other diseases the knowledge of them is of great importance in the practice of medicine anatomy of the absorbing vessels of the human body p       why the lymphatics and lacteals terminate first in the glands i do not know p     it will appear strange that i have said nothing of the use of the absorbent glands i avow absolute ignorance of this matter there are none in turtle and in fish and only two in the necks of some birds why there are so many in men and quadrupeds i do not know nor why they exist at all p     etc  once for all i beg leave to express my opinion of the work now quoted as one of the most valuable and important acquisitions both to anatomy and medicine this age has produced     yet it is a matter not only interesting in the science of physiology to ascertain their use but is likewise necessary to enable us to understand more perfectly the diseases of the glands and to treat them with success we will therefore pursue the enquiry  a fluid is constantly exhaled into the cavities containing the viscera this fluid is liable to be altered either by remora or mixture the absorption of this fluid is the function of the internal lymphatics and when it is prevented either by obstruction of the conglobate glands or by any other cause dropsies in the brain thorax pericardium abdomen and the widely diffused cellular membrane arise  the lymph along with the chyle and nutritious liquors prepared from the food in the intestinal canal is absorbed by the lacteal and lymphatic vessels for they are the same these fluids are immediately thrown into the mesenteric glands and they are more numerous there than in other parts because their office is peculiarly important that of perfecting the chyle or nutritious fluid extracted by digestion from food that fluid is perfected by intercepting what is noxious in the cells of the conglobate glands where it undergoes a digestion before it is absorbed by the second and third orders of the lacteal vessels  numerous lymphatic vessels arise also from the stomach intestines and from the glandular viscera from the pelvis the bladder and parts of generation both in males and females they observe the same law and pass through the iliac conglobate glands or others before they enter the lacteal sac and their use is the same to intercept crude noxious unassimilated matter which has been rendered unfit by disease or other means to mix immediately and unaltered with the blood  the food we take in and the air we breathe while they convey the necessary supports of life contain also the feeds of disease and death  the lymphatic vessels which arise in the mouth and from the trachea and lungs where their number is immense convey the fluids they absorb with whatever extraneous matter has been taken up to the numerous conglobate glands of the neck to the thyroid gland thymus and the glands of the lungs where it is digested before it reaches the thoracic duct  in young animals who take in their food by suction in which action much is absorbed by the lymphatics the glands are very large numerous and conspicuous the more perfectly to digest and animalise the crude fluids received by suction with the milk  when that period of life is passed over the thyroid glands and thymus are not quite so necessary and abate in size but are never totally obliterated  in pointing out the business of purifying and animalising lymph as the function of the conglobate glands in general i believe i have discovered the use of the thymus in infants and of the thyroid glands hitherto one of the hidden mysteries in anatomy cruikshank speaking of the thymus says i know not the use of this gland and of the thyroid gland as i have not the least conception of its use i do not understand what functions in particular its absorbents perform p       the external surface of the body is no less absorptive fluids are imbibed thirst abated urine and weight increased from thence garlic externally applied is soon smelled in the breath turpentine gives the urine a violet smell variolous matter and the venereal poison introduced by the smallest puncture produce similar diseases and previous to universal infection and diffusion the inguinal and axillary glands are swelled and inflamed by the passage of the poison into them mercury the antidote to this poison also enters freely by the skin blisters applied to the arms and shoulders inflame the axillary glands those of the neck in children particularly are made hard and sore by ulcers behind the ears and in the head and by blisters to those parts  ulcers and punctures in the legs and other parts often occasion swellings along the lymphatics up to the axillae or inguinal glands purulent bubos arise frequently from such ulcers and from matter formed in the joints the axillary glands are swelled by stagnating milk by cancerous swellings and inflammations in the breast cancers in the lips and on the face cause similar swellings under the lower jaw and in the neck the same glands are swelled by gum boils and by venereal sores in the lips acrid matter absorbed inflames the lymphatic vessel and the gland universally between the seat of the matter and sore and the thoracic duct and its entrance into the body may be prevented by caustic or by the excision of the part powders scattered over the surface of the body are absorbed thus calomel is known to enter and i remember a degree of salivation and sore mouth produced by a small quantity of corrosive sublimate rubbed with crude sal ammoniac and camphire scattered on bed linen in order to prevent a morbus pediculosus  when we consider these various facts that all lymphatic vessels perpetually enter the conglobate glands and in the cells of which these glands universally consist deposite the lymph which being absorbed once and again by larger lymphatics is at length conveyed by the great channel the lacteal duct into the vena cava descendens under the left calavicle when we recollect that the venereal virus cancerous and variolous poisons enter the body by these channels and and are primarily deposited in these glands occasioning there tumors sometimes indolent sometimes painful inflamed and suppurating it seems clear these glands are intended by nature to purify the lymph before it enters the blood vessels from matter which may be noxious there by arresting it in the glands universally connected with absorbents  in these glands it is either altered by a concocting and digesting power inherent in them or when it is too noxious to be subdued into a salutary nature it remains in the form of a tumor or escapes by suppuration when it cannot be subdued nor removed by suppuration and those salutary efforts of nature fail it is then absorbed and diffuses disease in the constitution at large  thus the glands in the neck and the thyroid are interposed to intercept crude matter or noxious virus taken up from the nostrils mouth trachea and lungs and other parts about the neck and breast more especially in very young animals  the mesenteric glands purify and digest whatever is absorbed with the lymph and chyle from the intestines  the axillary and inguinal glands alter and intercept whatever extraneous matter may happen to be absorbed from the surface of the body or the cellular membrane  the glands have the power of assimilating into a sound fluid such noxious matter in very many instances but when it is highly virulent as in the lues in scrophulous and in cancerous diseases that digesting and assimilating function is overpowered the gland remains scirrhous or is destroyed by suppuration and the matter enters and contaminates the habit  in fine the use of these glands is to intercept as sponges and to alter as digestive organs whatever is unfit to enter into the mass of blood in ordinary cases this is effected without obstruction or inflammation and then no apparent consequences detrimental to health appear and the deposited matter is absorbed again and goes along with the sound lymph in extraordinary cases the poison remains in the gland and destroys its powers first and its substance and organization afterward  the fatal consequences which have followed injections of undigested alimentary fluids directly into the red veins of living animals are proofs that the lymphatic glands have the use and function here alleged and show that without the lymphatic digestion liquors apparently harmless are unfit to mix with the blood and produce fatal effects there haller elem phys tom   p       how the glands alter digest and assimilate the matter absorbed and deposited in them i know not and shall not attempt to explain i think that power implanted in them as well as in the stomach and intestines and we see an important apparatus set apart for the purpose by him whose ability is too great in every instance to be fully comprehended and interpreted by us his creatures  from the uses here ascribed to the lymphatic glands we see why they are most numerous where absorption is greatest and particularly in those parts where crude matter is absorbed we see why the glands are nearly as numerous in the neck as in the mesentery p   0  for beside the matter absorbed from the inside of the mouth nostrils and trachea the absorbents from the brain join the glands of the neck though these have not been traced by anatomists as a copious exhalation and absorption constantly take place in the ventricles of that organ as we have reason to believe the water in the internal hydrocephalus is sometimes absorbed from the general law we may presume that lymphatics exist in the brain though not certainly traced there p     cruikshank  this is confirmed by the internal cephalus often happening in scrophulous and ricketty children in whom the glands of the neck are scirrhous  it is well known that swellings of the glands often follow cruptive diseases they arise after scarlet fever measles and small pox dropsy is sometimes the consequence of them all and i have known the hydrocephalus internus as well as other dropsies succeed the scarlet fever another presumptive proof that absorption in the brain is carried on by lymphatic vessels as well as in other parts  we also see why the glands are more numerous in the mesentery through which all the chyle passes and are smaller and less numerous in the mesocolon through which hardly any chyle passes whence mr cruikshank is led to say this looks as if the glands were intended to produce some remarkable change in the chyle p      of cruikshank   the mesenteric glands as well as the conglobate glands in other parts being cellular as well as vascular contain a white milky fluid most conspicuous and abundant in young animals album perpetuo reperi says haller elem phys t    these glands though greatly less in adults than in young animals are yet not totally obliterated the illustrious haller has seen the thymus in the mediastinum and the glands in the mesentery and in the intestinum rectum in adults in children they are very large and succulent elem phys t   p      the lymphatic vessels being destitute of the moving impulse of the heart and having no other principle of motion to carry on the liquors absorbed but that of the irritability of the lymphatic system the motion of the lymph is necessarily liable to be obstructed hence obstructions happen more frequently in the conglobate and lymphatic glands than in the conglomerate glands the liver may be excepted because the blood conveyed into it by the vena portarum undergoes a similar retardation in that very singular vein  the conglobate glands are hence universally liable to scirrhosity and obstruction the mesenteric glands are notoriously liable to great enlargement and hardness and thereby often cause a slow consuming sever and atrophy in infants similar swellings in the mesenteric glands are sometimes observed from ulcerated intestines after dysentery the neck is seldom strumous without accompanying obstructions in the mesenteric glands  the thyroid axillary and mammary glands as well as the iliac lumbar and inguinal glands are all frequently sound obstructed and scirrhous in a word these glands are not only obstructed in venereal and cancerous habits but the scrophula and rachitis likewise originate in them and are principally seated in the glands  in all cases of obstructed glands the chyle and lymph being imperfectly assimilated the blood becomes gradually vitiated and unfit for nourishment hence that acrimony often called scorbutic an ulcerous and even cancerous disposition of fluids originate from the same source the bones become brittle break in some and are rendered soft and flexible in others  all these facts conspire to show the importance of the digestive and assimilating power of the glands and lymphatic system in perfecting the animal fluids  in diseased glands the chyle is not sufficiently assimilated and that defect gradually induces acrimony and impurity in the lymph which soon taints the blood and habit universally  it is more from this defect than from the entrance of the chyle into the blood being prevented by obstruction that marasmus and consumption follow scirrhosities in the mesentric glands  it is possible says the ingenious cruikshank that children and even grown persons may have died of the tabes mesenterica from obstructions in the glands rendering them impervious to the chyle but he never saw any such stagnation of chyle as these are supposed to cause on any occasion whatever p  0  cruikshank   the lymph and chyle enter the blood but in a corrupted crude unanimalised state  i am confirmed in this opinion by the experiments of another excellent anatomist mr sheldon which i shall quote from his splendid history of the human lacteal vessels  in subjects in which the lymphatic glands of the mesentery were found entirely obstructed sometimes by a curdlike substance sometimes by calcareous earth mr sheldon could push injections of quicksilver from the vessels below the obstructed glands to those above them though not a single particle of quicksilver could be made to enter the glands in this obstructed state in this case the collateral branches of the lacteal vessels which communicated with those above were enlarged and had conveyed the chyle into the lacteal duct  the ingenious dr cheston found the cavity of the lacteal duct totally obstructed for a considerable length by an earthy matter in a man who had a spina ventosa of the os ilium  it is probable the chyle in this case was conveyed from below into the lacteal duct above the obstruction by one or more collateral anastomosing branches which are every where numerous in the lymphatic vessels and frequent in the lacteal duct itself this being a provision of nature for securing more certainly a regular conveyance of the chyle into the blood vessels  i remember a melancholy case which shows the thoracic duct sometimes is obstructed in a fatal degree a young lady high in rank beautiful in person and amiable in disposition had a swelling in the neck which extended itself under the left clavicle and there obstructed the entrance of the thoracic duct into the subclavian vein so completely as to render her incurably dropsical in every part of her body  what i have now offered concerning the use of the glands belonging to the lymphatic system will i apprehend derive support from the late discoveries and will be found useful in the treatment of diseases of the glands  medicines taken into the stomach and mixed with the chyle are indeed in the direct channel to reach the diseased glands of the mesentery  but this is not the case respecting the conglobate glands in other parts medicines mixing with the blood never directly reach these glands and but very remotely and indirectly affect them and this is one of the reasons why diseases in these glands have always appeared so stubborn and have so rarely yielded to the common treatment and internal use of medicine  the confiding alone to medicines conveyed by the lacteals into the channel of circulation the inattention to the only entrance into the external diseased glands that by absorption are i am persuaded causes why those diseases have proved so obstinate and rebellious to medical treatment  it is the cause why scrophula and scirhous glands have become cancerous and finally incurable and fatal  it is evident then that the remedies proper for removing obstructions should be applied to such parts from whence the lymphatics arise which may absorb and conduct them to the glands the obstructions of which are to be removed  applications intended to remove glandular swellings in the neck the thyroid gland the bronchocele etc must be made to the head neck cheeks and mouth internally as well as externally  vapors inhaled by inspiration are proper in the diseased glands of the lungs  remedies intended to pass into the axillary glands must be applied to the arms and breast  in diseases of the inguinal glands the remedies intended to pass into them and through them must be applied to the genitals and to the legs and thighs  the advantages found from the local application of mercury in venereal swellings of the inguinal and axillary glands and in ulcers of the throat exemplify this doctrine in that disease  the holding medicines intended to remove the the bronchocele and swelled neck in the mouth and under the tongue is essential to give efficacy to these medicines as has been long experienced in the coventry medicine the saline ingredients whether alcaline or neutral of which such medicines usually consist are absorbed by the lymphatic vessels arising in the inside of the mouth and are conveyed directly to the diseased glands with constant good effect  internal obstructions in the mesentery in particular are to be relieved by internal medicines and in every kind of glandular obstruction mineral waters have been found highly necessary and useful  the chalybeate the sulphurous the saline the hot and the cold waters have all been tried with advantage  of laxative medicines the purgative mineral waters always operate with the least diminution of strength and with the least disturbance the appetite is for the most part mended under their use and important alterations in the whole system arise from continuing to apply to them their operation principally affects the first passages in clearing away what is recrimentitious and hurtful in that seat and source of corruption  they next directly operate on the lacteal vessels and glands they dilute the chyle and stimulate the lacteals themselves which are sufficiently irritable and remove thereby both the source of obstruction and the obstructions which may have taken place in the conglobate glands of the mesentery  in this manner they contribute to the purity and perfection of the chyle and lymph and remove all obstacles to its perfect digestion in the intestinal canal and in the lacteal vessels and glands  hence this source of tainted fluids being taken away from the chyle and blood and no new acrimonious deposition falling on the remoter parts of the body the lymphatic vessels and glands there reassume their functions and absorb and digest what was before lodged on the skin and on the adjacent parts of the surface of the body  thus under the use of such waters continued for a sufficient length of time depositions eruptions and defedations of the skin with ulcers and glandular swellings disappear it is thus the harrowgate cheltenham and walton waters prove beneficial  the sea water acts not only as a powerful internal remedy in the same diseases but has its efficacy greatly promoted by bathing washing thereby away much cutaneous foulness and removing more by being directly absorbed into the lymphatics and conveyed to the diseased glands at the same time that a useful spring and vigor is given to the whole constitution  i might illustrate the practical importance of these principles by cases but this letter being already too long i now commit it to your consideration to you who joining reading to experience and talents make the healing art your study and delight  from you my humble but zealous endeavors to excite the attention of the younger and liberal gentlemen of the profession to improved methods of curing diseases are sure of a candid reception  as to others whose sole pursuit and study is gain  quaerenda pecunia primum est virtus
