fortune who intended to marry her v her being gentleman to a certain peer vi her commencing strolling  player with various and surprising vicissitudes of fortune during nine years peregrination vii

prologue to the what do you call it london printed for w reeve in fleet street a dodd in the strand and e cook at the royal exchange m dcc lv  the author to herself madam though flattery is universally known to be the spring from which dedications frequently flow i hope i shall escape that odium so justly thrown on poetical petitioners notwithstanding my attempt to illustrate those wonderful qualifications by which you have so eminently distinguished yourself and gives you a just claim to the title of a nonpareil of the age  that thoughtless ease so peculiar to yourself with which you have run through many strange and unaccountable vicissitudes of fortune is an undeniable proof of the native indolent sweetness of your temper with what fortitude of mind have you vanquished sorrow with the fond imagination and promissary hopes only from yourself of a succession of happiness neither within your power or view  your exquisite taste in building must not be omitted the magnificent airy castles for which you daily drew out plans without foundation must could they have been distinguishable to sight long ere this have darkened all the lower world nor can you be matched in oddity of fame by any but that celebrated knight errant of the moon g  e a  r st  s whose memoirs and yours conjoined would make great figures in history and might justly claim a right to be transmitted to posterity as you are without exception two of the greatest curiosities that ever were the incentives to the most profound astonishment  my choice of you madam to patronize my works is an evidential proof that i am not disinterested in that point as the world will easily be convinced from your natural partiality to all i have hitherto produced that you will tenderly overlook their errors and to the utmost of your power endeavor to magnify their merits if by your approbation the world may be persuaded into a tolerable opinion of my labors i shall for the noveltysake venture for once to call you friend a name i own i never as yet have known you by  i hope dear madam as manly says in the provoked husband that last reproach has struck you and that you and i may ripen our acquaintance into a perfect knowledge of each other that may establish a lasting and social friendship between us  your two friends prudence and reflection i am informed have lately ventured to pay you a visit for which i heartily congratulate you as nothing can possibly be more joyous to the heart than the return of absent friends after a long and painful peregrination  permit me madam to subscribe myself for the future what i ought to have been some years ago  your real friend and humble servant charlotte charke  a narrative of the life of mrs charlotte charke as the following history is the product of a female pen i tremble for the terrible hazard it must run in venturing into the world as it may very possibly suffer in many opinions without perusing it i therefore humbly move for its having the common chance of a criminal at least to be properly examined before it is condemned and should it be found guilty of nonsense and inconsistencies i must consequently resign it to its deserved punishment instead of being honored with the last row of a library undergo the indignancy of preserving the syrup of many a choice tart which when purchased even the hasty child will soon give an instance of its contempt of my muse by committing to the flames or perhaps cast it to the ground to be trampled to death by some threadbare poet whose works might possibly have undergone the same malevolence of fate  however i must beg leave to inform those ladies and gentlemen whose tenderness and compassion may excite em to make this little brat of my brain the companion of an idle hour that i have paid all due regard to decency wherever i have introduced the passion of love and have only suffered it to take its course in its proper and necessary time without fulsomely inflaming the minds of my young readers or shamefully offending those of riper years a fault i have often condemned when i was myself but a girl in some female poets i shall not descant on their imprudence only wish that their works had been less confined to that theme which too often led em into errors reason and modesty equally forbid  in regard to the various subjects of my story i have i think taken care to make em so interesting that every person who reads my volume may bear a part in some circumstance or other in the perusal as there is nothing inserted but what may daily happen to every mortal breathing  not that i would have the public conceive though i am endeavoring to recommend it to their protection that my vanity can so far overcome my small share of reason as to impute the success it should meet with to any other motive than a kind condescension in my readers to pity and encourage one who has used her utmost endeavors to entertain em  as i have promised to give some account of my unaccountable life i shall no longer detain my readers in respect to my book but satisfy a curiosity which has long subsisted in the minds of many and i believe they will own when they know my history if oddity can plead any right to surprise and astonishment i may positively claim a title to be shown among the wonders of ages past and those to come nor will i to escape a laugh even at my own expense deprive my readers of that pleasing satisfaction or conceal any error which i now rather sigh to reflect on but formerly through too much vacancy of thought might be idle enough rather to justify than condemn  i shall now begin my detail of the several stages i have passed through since my birth which made me the lastborn of mr colley cibber at a time my mother began to think without this additional blessing meaning my sweet self she had fully answered the end of her creation being just fortyfive years of age when she produced her last though not least in love nor was i exempted from an equal share in my fathers heart yet partly through my own indiscretion and i am too well convinced from the cruel censure of false and evil tongues since my maturity i lost that blessing which if strongest compunction and uninterrupted hours of anguish blended with selfconviction and filial love can move his heart to pity and forgiveness i shall with pride and unutterable transport throw myself at his feet to implore the only benefit i desire or expect his blessing and his pardon  but of that more hereafter  and i hope ere this small treatise is finished to have it in my power to inform my readers my painful separation from my once tender father will be more than amply repaid by a happy interview as i am certain neither my present or future conduct shall ever give him cause to blush at what i should esteem a justifiable and necessary reconciliation as it is the absolute ordination of the supreme that we should forgive when the offender becomes a sincere and hearty penitent and i positively declare were i to expire this instant i have no selfinterested views in regard to worldly matters but confess myself a miser in my wishes so far as having the transcendant joy of knowing that i am restored to a happiness which not only will clear my reputation to the world in regard to a former want of duty but at the same time give a convincing proof that there are yet some sparks of tenderness remaining in my fathers bosom for his repentant child  i confess i believe i came not only an unexpected but an unwelcome guest into the amily exclusive of my parents as my mother had borne no children for some few years before so that i was rather regarded as an impertinent intruder than one who had a natural right to make up the circular number of my fathers fireside yet be it as it may the jealousy of me from her other children laid no restraint on her fondness for me which my father and she both testified in their tender care of my education his paternal love omitted nothing that could improve any natural talents heaven had been pleased to endow me with the mention of which i hope will not be imputed to me as a vain selfconceit of knowing more or thinking better than any other of my sister females no far be it from me for as all advantages from nature are the favorable gifts of the power divine consequently no praise can be arrogated to ourselves for that which is not in ourselves possible to bestow  i should not have made this remark but as it is likely my works may fall into the hands of people of disproportioned understandings i was willing to prevent an error a weak judgment might have run into by inconsiderately throwing an odium upon me i could not possibly deserve  for alas all cannot judge alike  as i have instanced that my education was not only a genteel but in fact a liberal one and such indeed as might have been sufficient for a son instead of a daughter i must beg leave to add that i was never made much acquainted with that necessary utensil which forms the houswifely part of a young ladys education called a needle which i handle with the same clumsey awkwardness a monkey does a kitten and am equally capable of using the one as pug is of nursing the other  this is not much to be wondered at as my education consisted chiefly in studies of various kinds and gave me a different turn of mind than what i might have had if my time had been employed in ornamenting a piece of canvas with beasts birds and the alphabet the latter of which i understood in french rather before i was able to speak english  as i have promised to conceal nothing that might raise a laugh i shall begin with a small specimen of my former madness when i was but four years of age having even then a passionate fondness for a perriwig i crawled out of bed one summers morning at twickenham where my father had part of a house and gardens for the season and taking it into my small pate that by dint of a wig and a waistcoat i should be the perfect representative of my sire i crept softly into the servantshall where i had the night before espied all things in order to perpetrate the happy design i had framed for the next mornings expedition accordingly i paddled down stairs taking with me my shoes stockings and little dimity coat which i artfully contrived to pin up as well as i could to supply the want of a pair of breeches by the help of a long broom i took down a waistcoat of my brothers and an enormous bushy tiewig of my fathers which entirely enclosed my head and body with the knots of the ties thumping my little heels as i marched along with slow and solemn pace the covert of hair in which i was concealed with the weight of a monstrous belt and large silverhilted sword that i could scarce drag along was a vast impediment in my procession and what still added to the other inconveniences i labored under was whelming myself under one of my fathers large beaverhats laden with lace as thick and broad as a brickbat  being thus accoutred i began to consider that twould be impossible for me to pass for mr cibber in girls shoes therefore took an opportunity to slip out of doors after the gardener who went to his work and rolled myself into a dry ditch which was as deep as i was high and in this grotesque pigmystate walked up and down the ditch bowing to all who came by me but behold the oddity of my appearance soon assembled a crowd about me which yielded me no small joy as i conceived their risibility on this occasion to be marks of approbation and walked myself into a fever in the happy thought of being taken for the squire  when the family arose till which time i had employed myself in this regular march in my ditch i was the first thing inquired after and missed till mrs heron the mother of the late celebrated actress of that name happily espied me and directly called forth the whole family to be witness of my state and dignity  the drollery of my figure rendered it impossible assisted by the fondness of both father and mother to be angry with me but alas i was borne off on the footmans shoulders to my shame and disgrace and forced into my proper habiliments  the summer following our family resided at hamptontown near the court my mother being indisposed at her first coming there drank every morning and night asses milk i observed one of those little healthrestoring animals was attended by its fool which was about the height of a sizeable greyhound  i immediately formed a resolution of following the fashion of taking the air early next morning and fixed upon this young ass for a padnag and in order to bring this matter to bear i communicated my design to a small troop of young gentlemen and ladies whose low births and adverse states rendered it entirely convenient for them to come into any scheme miss charlotte cibber could possibly propose accordingly my mothers bridle and saddle were secretly procured but the riper judgments of some of my followers soon convinced me of the unnecessary trouble of carrying the saddle as the little destined beast was too small and indeed too weak to bear the burden upon which twas concluded to take the bridle only and away went miss and her attendants who soon arrived at the happy field where the poor harmless creature was sucking we soon seized and endeavored to bridle it but i remember twas impossible to bring that point to bear the head of the fool being so very small the trappings fell off as fast as they strove to put them on one of the small crew who was wiser than the rest proposed their garters being converted to that use which was soon effected and i rode triumphantly into town astride with a numerous retinue whose huzzas were drowned by the dreadful braying of the tender dam who pursued with agonizing sounds of sorrow for her oppressed young one  upon making this grandentry into the town i remember my father from the violent acclamations of joy on so glorious an occasion was excited to enquire into the meaning of what he perhaps imagined to be an insurrection when to his amazement he beheld his daughter mounted as before described preceded by a lad who scraped upon a twelvepenny fiddle of my own to add to the dignity and grandeur of this extraordinary enterprise  i perfectly remember young as i was then the strong mixture of surprise pleasure pain and shame in his countenance on his viewing me seated on my infantical rosinante which though i had not then sense enough to distinguish my memory has since afforded me the power to describe and also to repeat his very words at his looking out of window gad demme an ass upon an ass  but alas how momentary are sometimes the transports of the most happy my mother was not quite so passive in this adventure as in that before related but rather was as i thought too active for i was no sooner dismounted then i underwent the discipline of birch was most shamefully taken prisoner in the sight of my attendants and with a small packthread my leg was made the sad companion with that of a large table  o fall of honor it is not to be conceived the violent indignation and contempt my disgraise raised in my infantbreast nor did i forgive my mother in my heart for six months after though i was obliged to ask pardon in a few moments of her who at that time i conceived to be most in fault  were i to insert one quarter part of the strange mad pranks i played even in infancy i might venture to affirm i could swell my account of em to a folio and perhaps my whimsical head may compile such a work but i own i should be loath upon reflection to publish it lest the contagion should spread itself and make other young folks as ridiculous and mischievous as myself though i cannot charge my memory with suffering other people to feel the ill effects of my unaccountable vagaries except once i remember a cross old woman at richmond having beat me i revenged myself by getting some of my playfellows to take as many as they could of her caps and other small linen that hung in the garden to dry and who fent em sailing down a brook that forced its current to the thames whilst i walked into the parlour secretly pleased with the thoughts of my revenge  this is the only piece of malice that occurs to my remembrance but i have too much reason to know that the madness of my follies have generally very severely recoiled upon myself but in nothing so much as in the shocking and heartwounding grief for my fathers displeasure which i shall not impudently dare deny having justly incurred but i dare confidently affirm much pains has been taken to aggravate my faults and strengthen his anger and in that case i am certain my enemies have not always too strictly adhered to truth but meanly had recourse to falsehood to perpetrate the ruin of a hapless wretch whose real errors were sufficient without the addition of malicious slanders the persons i mean who did me these unfriendly offices are still in being but qui capit ille facit  i formerly wrote to my father as i thought it an incumbent duty to enquire after his health and at the same time implore his pardon but could never have the happiness of even a distant hope of obtaining it for the forementioned reasons i flatter myself as reflection and contrition have brought me to a just sense of all past failings humanity will plead her right in his relenting heart and once again restore me to a joy which none can conceive who never felt the pain arising from the disgrace of being deemed an alien from the family in which they originally drew breath  my obligations to him in my bringing up are of so extensive a nature i can never sufficiently acknowledge em for notwithstanding it is every parents duty to breed their children with every advantage their fortunes will admit of yet in this case i must confess myself most transcendantly indebted having received even a superfluity of tender regard of that kind and at the same time beg pardon for not having put it to a more grateful and generous use both for his honor and my own credit  however i shall lay it down as a maxim for the remaining part of life to make the utmost amends by prudent conduct for the miscarriages of the former so that should i fail in my hopes i may not draw any further imputation on myself by not endeavoring to deserve what i think so particularly my duty if possible to archieve  i shall now proceed in my account at eight years of age i was placed at a famous school in parkstreet westminster governed by one mrs draper a woman of great sense and abilities who employed a gentleman called monsieur flahaut an excellent master of languages to instruct her boarders among the number of his pupils i had the happiness of being one and as he discovered in me a tolerable genius and an earnest desire of improvement he advised my mother in a visit to me at school to let him teach me latin and italian which she proud of hearing me capable of receiving readily consented to  nor was my tutor satisfied with those branches of learning alone for he got leave of my parents to instruct me in geography which by the bye though i know it to be a most useful and pleasing science i cannot think it was altogether necessary for a female but i was delighted at being thought a learned person therefore readily acquiesced with my preceptors proposal  accordingly i was furnished with proper books and two globes caelestial and terrestrial borrowed of my mothers own brother the late john shore esquire serjeanttrumpet of england and pored over em till i had like to have been as mad as my uncle who has given a most demonstrative proof of his being so for many years which i shall hereafter mention  the vast application to my study almost distracted me from a violent desire i had to make myself perfect mistress of it mr flahaut perceiving that i was too close in the pursuit of knowledge not absolutely needful shortened the various tasks i had daily set me thinking that one mad mortal in a family was rather too much without farther addition  after i had received in two years schooling a considerable share of my education in which music and singing bore their parts i was through my indulgent parents fondness allowed masters at home to finish my studies  mr flahaut my master of languages was continued mr young late organist of st clements danes instructed me in music though i was originally taught by the famous dr king who was so old when i learnt of him he was scarce able to give the most trifling instructions the celebrated mr grosconet was my dancing master and to do justice to his memory i have never met with any that exceeded him in the easy sublime taste in dancing which is the most reasonable entertainment can be afforded to the spectators who wish only to be delighted with the genteel movement of a singular or plurality of figures with becoming gracefulress in which no performer ever so eminently distinguished themselves as mrs booth widow of the late incomparable and deservedlyesteemed barton booth esquire one of the patentees of drury lane theater conjunctive with my father and mr wilks  the present taste in dancing is so opposite to the former that i conceive the highflown caprioles which distinguish the first performers to be the result of violent strength and unaccountable flights of spirits that rather convey an idea of so many horses a la merage than any design formed to please an audience with the more modest and graceful deportment with which mrs booth attracted and charmed the hearts of every gazer  when twas judged that i had made a necessary progression in my learning and other accomplishments i went to hillingdon within one mile of uxbridge where my mother who was afficted with the asthma chose to retire for the preservation of her health  this was an agreeable retreat my father had taken a lease of for some years but a winter residence in the country was not altogether so pleasing to me as that of the summer i therefore began to srame different schemes for rendering my solitude as agreeable to myself as possible the first project i had was in the frosty mornings to set out upon the common and divert myself with shooting and grew so great a proficient in that notable exercise that i was like the person described in the recruiting officer capable of destroying all the venison and wild fowl about the country  in this manner i employed several days from morn to eve and seldom failed of coming home laden with feathered spoil which raised my conceit to such a pitch i really imagined myself equal to the best fowler or marksman in the universe  at length unfortunately for me one of my mothers straitlacd oldfashioned neighbors paying her a visit persuaded her to put a stop to this proceeding as she really thought it inconsistent with the character of a young gentlewoman to follow such diversions which my youth had i been a male she thought would scarce render me excusable for being but fourteen upon this sober ladys hint i was deprived of my gun and with a halfbroken heart on the occasion resolved to revenge myself by getting a muscatoon that hung over the kitchen mantlepiece and use my utmost fndeavours toward shooting down her chimnies after having wasted a considerable quantity of powder and shot to no purpose i was obliged to desist and give up what i had though wishfully vainly attempted  i remember upon my having a fit of illess my mother who was apprehensive of my death and consequently through excessive fondness used all means to prevent it that lay within her power sent me to thorly in hertfordshire the seat of dr hales an eminent physician and relation with a design not only to restore and establish my health but with the hopes of my being made a good houswife in which needful accomplishment i have before hinted my mind was entirely uncultivated but alas she ended where poor dear soul she ought to have began for by that time from her desire of making me too wife i had imbibed such mistaken pedantick notions of a superiority of schollarship and sense that my utmost wisdom centered in proclaiming myself a fool by a stupid contempt of such qualifications as would have rendered me less troublesome in a family and more useful to myself and those about me  learning is undoubtedly a glorious and happy acquisition when it is encountered by a genius capable of receiving and retaining the powerful efficacy of its worth yet notwithstanding this assertion i am certain that its greatest advantages are to be infinitely improved by launching into the world and becoming acquainted with the different places and objects we go through and meet in traveling  the observations to be made by that means refine the understanding and improve the judgment as something is to be gathered from the various dispositions of people in the highest and lowest stations of life which persons of reflection may render greatly conducive in clearing and purging themselves of those dregs of learning which too often for want of this method of purifying the mind reduces many a fine genius to four pedantry and ill humor that makes them uneasy to themselves and obnoxious to all who converse with em  even in my slender capacity i have sound this remark to be just for notwithstanding my vanity might have excited me to a fond belief of my being wonderful wise in nine years peregrination i began to find out till i had seen something of the world i was but rough in the mine observation had a little polished me and i was soon convinced the additional helps i received from travel almost rendered my former knowledge nothing so that i cannot but join in polydores opinion  i would be busy in the world and learn not like a coarse and usless dunghill weed fixed to one spot and rot just as i grew though i must acknowledge it is an equal error for youth to set out too soon to see the world before they are capable of digesting what they hear or see and too frequently come back with the same light load of understanding with which they set out i therefore think it proper instead of saying such a one is lately returned from his travels who is so unadvisedly sent forth rather to have it said he is lately returned from his delightful jaunts and parties of pleasure  in the second chapter of mr dumonts history i have expatiated on this error and refer my readers thereto who i believe will not think my argument offensive or unreasonable  while i staid at thorly though i had the nicest examples of houswifely perfections daily before me i had no notion of entertaining the least thought of those necessary offices by which the young ladies of the family so eminently distinguished themselves in ornamenting a welldisposd elegant table decently graced with the toil of their mornings industry nor could i bear to pass a train of melancholy hours in poring over a piece of embroidery or a wellwrought chair in which the young females of the family exclusive of my madcap self were equally and industriously employed and have often with inward contempt of em pitied their misfortunes who were i was well assured incapable of currying a horse or riding a race with me  many and vain attempts were used to bring me into their workingcommunity but i had so great a veneration for cattle and husbandry twas impossible for em either by threats or tender advice to bring me into their sober scheme  if any thing was amiss in the stable i was sure to be the first and head of the mob but if all the fineworks in the family had been in the fire i should not have forsook the currycomb to have endeavored to save em from the utmost destruction  during my residence in the family i grew passionately fond of the study of physic and was never so truly happy as when the doctor employed me in some little offices in which he durst entrust me without prejudice to his patients  as i was indulged in having a little horse of my own i was frequently desired to call upon one or other of the neighboring invalids to enquire how they did which gave me a most pleasing opportunity of fancying myself a physician and affected the solemnity and gravity which i had often observed in the good doctor nor am i absolutely assured from the significant air which i assumed whether some of the weaker sort of people might not have been persuaded into as high an opinion of my skill as my cousins whose talents chiefly were adapted to the study of physic to do him justice he was a very able proficient and i dare say the loss of him in hertfordshire and some part of essex is not a little regretted as he was necessary to the rich and tenderly beneficent to the poor  at the expiration of two years his lady died and i was remanded home and once again sent to our country house at hillingdon where i was no sooner arrived than i persuaded my fond mother to let me have a little closet built in an apartment seldom used by way of dispensatory this i easily obtained and summoned all the old women in the parish to repair to me whenever they found themselves indisposed i was indeed of the opinion of leander in the mock doctor that a few physical hard words would be necessary to establish my reputation and accordingly had recourse to a latin dictionary and soon gathered up as many fragments as served to confound their senses and bring em into a high opinion of my skill in the medicinal science  as my advice and remedies for all disorders were designed as acts of charity it is not to be imagined what a concourse of both sexes were my constant attendants though i own i have been often obliged to refer myself to salmon culpepper and other books i had for that purpose before i was able to make a proper application or indeed arrive at any knowledge of their maladies but this defect was not discovered by my patients as i put on a significancy of countenance that rather served to convince them of my incomparable skill and abilities  fond as i was of this learned office i did not choose to give up that of being lady of the horse which delicate employment took up some part of my time every day and i generally served myself in that capacity when i thought proper to pay my attendance on the believing mortals who entrusted their lives in my hands but providence was extremely kind in that point for though perhaps i did no actual good i never had the least misfortune happen to any of the unthinking credulous souls who relied on me for the restoration of their healths which was ten to one i had endangered as long as they lived  when i had signified my intention of becoming a young lady bountiful i thought it highly necessary to furnish myself with drugs etc to carry on this notable design accordingly i went to uxbridge where was then living an apothecarys widow whose shop was an emblem of that described in romeo and juliet she good woman knowing my family entrusted me with a cargo o combustibles which were sufficient to have set up a mountebank for a twelvemonth bu my stock was soon exhausted for the silly devils began to fancy themselves ill because they knew they could have physic for nothing such as it was but oh woeful day the widow sent in her bill to my father who was entirely ignorant of the curious expense i had put him to which he directly paid with a strict order never to let doctor charlotte have any farther credit on pain of losing the money so by me contracted  was not this sufficient to murder the fame of the ablest physician in the universe however i was resolved not to give up my profession and as i was deprived of the use of drugs i took it into my head to conceal my disgrace to have recourse to herbs but one day a poor old woman coming to me with a violent complaint of rheumatick pains and a terrible disorder in her stomach i was at a dreadful loss what remedies to apply and dismissed her with an assurance of sending her something to ease her by an inward and outward application before she went to bed  it happened that day proved very rainy which put it into my strange pate to gather up all the snails in the garden of which from the heavy shower that had fallen there was a superabundant quantity i immediately fell to work and of some part of em with coarse brown sugar made a syrup to be taken a spoonful once in two hours boiling the rest to a consistence with some green herbs and mutton fat i made an ointment and clapping conceited labels upon the phial and gallipot sent my preparation with a joyous bottle of hartshorn and sal volatile i purloined from my mother to add a grace to my prescriptions  in about three days time the good woman came hopping along to return me thanks for the extreme benefit she had received entreating my goodness to repeat the medicines as she had found such wonderful effects from their virtues  but fortune was not quite kind enough to afford me the means of granting her request at that time for the friendly rain which had enabled me to work this wonderful cure was succeeded by an extreme drought and i thought it highly necessary to suspend any further attempts to establish my great reputation till another watery opportunity offered to furnish me with those ingredients whose sanative qualities had been so useful to her limbs and my fame i therefore dismissed her with a word of advice not to tamper too much that as she was so well recovered to wait till a return of her pains otherwise a too frequent use of the remedy might possibly lose its effect by being applied without any absolute necessity with as significant an air as i could assume i bid her besure to keep herself warm and drink no malt liquor and that if she found any alteration to send to me  glad was i when the poor creature was gone as her harmless credulity had raised such an invincible fit of laughter in me i must have died on the spot by the suppression had she staid a few minutes longer  this relation is an instance of what i have often conceived to be the happy motive for that success which travellingphysicians frequently meet with as it is rather founded on the faith of the patient than any real merit in the doctor or his prescriptions but the happiness i enjoyed and still continue to do in the pleasing reflection of not having through inexperience done any harm by my applications i thank the great creator for who notwithstanding my extreme desire of being distinguished as an able proficient knew my design was equally founded on a charitable inclination which i conceive was a strong guard against any evils that might have accrued from merely a wild notion of pleasing myself  my being unfortunately deprived of the assistance of the widows shop to carry on this grand affair made me soon tire in the pursuit and put me upon some other expedient for my amusement i therefore framed the tenderest excuses i could possibly invent to drop my practice that those who had before thought themselves indispensibly obliged to me might not conceive i had lost that charitable disposition which they had so often blessed me for and which indeed i heartily regretted the not having power still to preserve and maintain  my next flight was gardening a very pleasing and healthful exercise in which i past the most part of my time every day i thought it always proper to imitate the actions of those persons whose characters i chose to represent and indeed was as changeable as proteus  when i had blended the groom and gardener i conceived after having worked two or three hours in the morning a broiled rasher of bacon upon a luncheon of bread in one hand and a pruningknife in the other walking instead of sitting to this elegant meal making seeds and plants the general subject of my discourse was the true characteristick of the gardener as at other times a halter and horsecloth brought into the house and aukwardly thrown down on a chair were emblems of my stableprofession with now and then a shrug of the shoulders and a scratch of the head with a hasty demand for smallbeer and a  god bless you make haste i have not a single horse dressed or watered and here it is almost eight oclock the poor cattle will think i have forgot em and tomorrow they go a journey i am sure i would need take care of em perhaps this great journey was an afternoons jaunt to windsor within seven miles of our house however it served me to give myself as many airs as if it had been a progress of five hundred miles  it luckily happened for me that my father was gone to france and the servant who was in the capacity of groom and gardener having the misfortune one afternoon to be violently inebriated took it in his head to abuse the rest of his fellow servants which my mother hearing interfered and shared equally the insolence of his opprobrious tongue upon which at a minutes warning he was dismissed to the inexpressible transport my gentle reader of your humble servant having then the full possession of the garden and stables  but what imagination can paint the extravagance of joy i felt on this happy acquisition i was so bewildered with the pleasing ideas i had framed in being actually a proper successor to the deposed fellow i was entirely lost in a forgetfulness of my real self and went each day with that orderly care to my separate employments that is generally the recommendatory virtue for the first month only of a newhired servant  the rumor of the mans dismission was soon spread and reached to my great uneasiness to uxbridge and every little adjacent village upon which i soon found it necessary to change my post of gardener and became for very near a week porter at the gate lest some lucky mortal might have been introduced and deprived me of the happy situation i enjoyed  i began to be tired with giving denials and in order to put an end to their fruitless expectations gave out that we had received letters from france to assure us that my papa had positively hired a man at peris to serve in that office and therefore all future attempts would be needless on that account  i kept so strict a watch at the gate during the apprehensions i had of being turned out of my places the maids wondered what made me so constantly traversing the courtyard for near eight days successively but  alas they knew but little of calista twas really to fecure my seat of empire which at that time i would not have exchanged for a monarchy and i conceived so high an opinion of myself i thought the family greatly indebted to me for my skill and industry  one day upon my mothers paying me a visit in the garden and approving something i had done there i rested on my spade and with a significant wink and a nod asked whether she imagined any of the rest of her children would have done as much at my age adding very shrewdly come come madam let me tell you a pound saved is a pound got then proceeded in my office of digging in which i was at that time most happily employed and with double labor pursued to make the strongest impression i could on my admiring mothers mind and convince her of the utility of so industrious a child  i must not forget to inform the reader that my mother had no extraordinary opinion of the fellows honesty whom she had turned away and what confirmed it was tracing his footsteps under the chamberwindows the night after his dismission and the neighbors had observed him to have been hovering round the house several hours that very evening  as we had a considerable quantity of plate my mother was a good deal alarmed with an apprehension of the mans attempting to break in at midnight which might render us not only liable to be robbed but murdered she communicated her fears to me who most heroically promised to protect her life at the utmost hazard of my own accordingly i desired all the plate might be gathered up and had it placed in a large flasket by my bedside this was no small addition to my happiness as it gave me an opportunity of raising my reputation as a courageous person which i was extreme fond of being deemed and in order to establish that character i stripped the hall and kitchen of their firearms which consisted of my own little carbine i had through the old maids persuasion been barbarously divested of not long before a heavy blunderbuss a muscatoon and two brace of pistols all which i loaded with a couple of bullets each before i went to bed not with any design on my word to yield to my repose but absolutely kept awake three long and tedious hours which was from twelve to three the time i thought most likely for an invasion  but no such thing happened for not a mortal approached on which i thought myself undone till a friendly dog who barked at the moon gave a happy signal and i bouncd from my repository with infinite obligations to the cur and fired out of the window piece after piece recharging as fast as possible till i had consumed about a pound of powder and a proportionable quantity of shot and balls  it is not to be supposed but the family was on my first onset in this singular battle having nothing to combat but the air soon alarmed the frequent reports and violent explosions encouraged my kind prompter to this farce to change his lucky bark into an absolute howl which strongly corroborated with all that had been thought or said in regard to an attempt upon the house my trembling mother who lay half expiring with dreadful imaginations rang her bell which summons i instantly obeyed firmly assuring her that all danger was over for that i heard the villain decamp on the first firing which decampment was neither more nor less than the rustling of the trees occasioned by a windy night for the fellow was absolutely gone to london the very morning i declared war against him as was afterward proved  notwithstanding i was fully convinced i had nothing to conquer but my unconquerable fondness and resolution to acquire the character of a courageous person i settled that point with the whole family in begging em not to be under the least apprehension of danger urging that my constant firing would be the means of preventing any and bid em consider that the loss of sleep was not to be put in competition with the hazard of their lives  this reflection made them perfectly easy and me entirely happy as i had an unlimitted power without interruption once in ten minutes to waste my ammunition to no purpose and retiring to my rest as soon as my stock was exhausted enjoyed in dreams a second idea of my glorious exploits  it is certain nothing but my mothers excessive fondness could have blinded her reason to give in to my unprefidented ridiculous follies as she was in all other points a woman of real good sense but where the heart is partially engaged we have frequent instances of its clouding the understanding and making dupes o the wisest  i shall add one unfortunate circumstance more and then proceed to give an account of my marriage with mr richard charke whose memory will by all lovers of music who have heard his incomparable performance on the violin be held in great estimation but to my story  i had received information that there was a very fine young horse to be disposed of at uxbridge qualified to draw a chaise and having heard my father say before he went to france he would purchase another when he came home i flew with distracted joy to the mans house where this horse was to be seen and accordingly had him harnessed and put to this excursion was entirely unknown to my mother who at that time lay extremely ill of the asthma  the owner of the horse knowing my family and seeing me often drive my fathers horses made no doubt but that i was sent in fact to make trial of his and being willing to make his market as quick as possible got the horse and chaise ready in a few minutes and out i set at the extreme hazard of my neck when i got upon uxbridge common for the creature was very young and ungovernable and dragged me and the chaise over hills and dales with such vehemence i despaired of ever seeing hillingdon again however the subtle devil knowing his way home set up a barbarous full gallop and made to his masters house with dreadful expedition beyond my power to restrain and in the cartrut ran over a child of three years of age that lay sprawling there for its unfortunate amusement  the violent rapidity of his course luckily prevented the death of the child but was very near effecting mine for grief and surprise took such hold of my spirits i became speechless the child was soon brought after me by the parents attended by a numerous mob and as soon as i regained my speech i ordered the infant to be examined by a surgeon but no harm being done more than a small graze on the neck the affair was made up with a shilling and a shoulder of mutton  notwithstanding this happy acquittance from so terrible a disaster as ignorant people are naturally fond of striking terror some doublyindustrious courier who had more expedition than brains ran with the news to my mother of my having killed a child which threw her into such agonizing frights as greatly hazarded her life and for some time was an aggravation to the illness she labored under for though i came home as soon as possible and convinced her of the error of the stupefied wretch that had so cruelly alarmed her the surprise and shock so strongly possessed her twas with difficulty she retained her senses  this misfortune threw me into a kind of melancholy that subsisted as long as could be expected from one of my youth and volatile spirits and to the extreme surprise of the neighborhood miss charlotte became for a little while i believe rather stupidly dull than justly reflecting for i dont remember any impression left on my mind by this accident after my mothers recovery and the assurance i had of the boys being living and well however it put a period to the fertility of my mischievous genius and upon being soon after acquainted with mr charke who was pleased to say soft things and flatter me into a belief of his being an humble admirer i as foolish young girls are apt to be too credulous believed his passion the result of real love which indeed was only interest his affairs being in a very desperate condition he thought it no bad scheme to endeavor at being mr cibbers soninlaw who was at that time a patentee in drury lane theater and i in the happy possession of my fathers heart which had i known the real value of i should never have bestowed a moments thought in the obtaining mr charkes but preserving my fathers  alas i thought it a fine thing to be married and indulged myself in a passionate fondness for my lover which my father perceiving out of pure pity tenderly consented to a conjugal union and the reader may suppose that i thought at that time twas the greatest favor he ever conferred on me as indeed i really did but i have some modest reasons to believe had he indulged me under the guardianship of some sensible trusty person to have taken a small tour into the country without letting me know twas done with a design to break off my attachment to my then intended husband it would have prevented the match and both parties in the main might have been better pleased for i am certain that absence and an easy life would soon have got the better of the violence of my fondness being then of too indolent a disposition to let any thing long disturb my mind  i dont advance this as a reproach for my fathers indulgence but to give the reader a perfect idea of the oddity of my youthful disposition for as sir charles easy says to his lady he is often rude and civil without design the same inadvertency had an equal dominion over me and i have avoided or committed errors without any premeditation either to offend or oblige  but to my tale  after six months acquaintance i was by consent espoused at st martins church to mr charke and thought at that time the measure of my happiness was full and of an everduring nature but alas i soon found myself deceived in that fond conceit for we were both so young and indiscreet we ought rather to have been sent to school than to church in regard to any qualifications on either side toward rendering the marriagestate comfortable to one another to be sure i thought it gave me an air of more consequence to be called mrs charke than miss charlotte and my spouse on his part i believe thought it a fine feather in his cap to be mr cibbers soninlaw which indeed it would have proved had he been skilful enough to have managed his cards rightly as my father was greatly inclined to be his friend and endeavored to promote his interest extremely amongst people of quality and fashion his merit as a proficient in music i believe is incontestible and being tolerably agreeable in his person both concurred to render him the general admiration of those sort of ladies who regardless of their reputations make em the unhappy sacrifices to every pleasing object which enter nous was a most horrible bar in my eschutcheon of content insomuch that married miss was the first twelvemonth of her connubial state industriously employed in the pursuit of fresh sorrow by tracing her spouse from morn to eve through the hundreds of drury  i had indeed too often very shocking confirmations of my suspicions which made me at last grow quite indifferent nor can i avoid confessing that indifference was strongly attended with contempt i was in hopes that my being blessed with a child would in some degree have surmounted that unconquerable fondness for variety but twas all one and i firmly believe nothing but the age of methuselah could have made the least alteration in his disposition  this loose and unkind behavior consequently made me extravagant and wild in my imagination and finding that we were in the same circumstances in regard to each other that mr sullen and his wife were we agreed to part accordingly i made our infant my care nor did the fathers neglect render me careless of my child for i really was so fond of it i thought myself more than amply made amends for his follies in the possession of her  when mr charke thought proper he paid us a visit and i received him with the same good nature and civility i might an old decayed acquaintance that i was certain came to ask me a favor which was often the case for i seldom had the honor of his company but when cash run low and i as constantly supplied his wants and have got from my father many an auxiliary guinea i am certain to purchase myself a new pair of horns  when i married twas in the month of february the beginning of benefittime at both theaters mrs thurmonds coming on soon who understood that i was designed for the stage the season following requested that i might make my first appearance on her night in the character of mademoiselle in the provoked wife and i particularly remember the first time of my playing was the last in which that matchless performer mrs oldfield ever charmed the town with her inimitable exhibition she sickend soon after and lingered till october following when she expired to the inexpressible loss of her acquaintance in general and all connoisseurs in acting though i am apt to think had she survived that illness the stage would not have been less liable to have sustained her loss as she had acquired a considerable fortune and was in the decline of life but in her business still in the utmost height of perfection  this excellent actress from her encouragement gave me lively hopes of success and being possessed with a youthful transport was rendered quite insensible of those fears which naturally attend people on their first essay on the theater  my father and mrs oldfields approbation was no trifling addition to my selfconceit it is true i was happy in a genius for the stage but i have since my riper years found that the success i met with was rather owing to indulgent audiences that goodnaturedly encouraged a young creature who they thought might one day come to something than any real judgment i had in my profession and that i was more indebted to chance than i was aware on for the applause i received when i accidently stumbled on the right  i must beg leave to give the reader an idea of that extacy of heart i felt on seeing the character i was to appear in the bills though my joy was somewhat dashed when i came to see it inserted by a young gentlewoman who had never appeared on any stage before this melancholy disappointment drew me into an unavoidable expense in coachhire to inform all my acquaintance that i was the person so set down in mrs thurmonds benefitbills though my fathers prudent concern intended it to be a secret till he had proof of my abilities  to my inexpressible joy i succeeded in the part and the play was in about six weeks after rechosen for the benefit of mr charke and miss raftor now mrs clive who was then a young but promising actress of which she has given demonstrative proofs in various lights therefore shall not expatiate on that subject lest the weakness of my pen should fall short of her merit  my name was in capitals on this second attempt and i dare aver that the perusal of it from one end of the town to the other for the first week was my most immediate and constant business nor do i believe it cost me less in shoes and coaches then two or three guineas to gratify the extravagant delight i had not only in reading the bills but sometimes hearing myself spoken of which luckily was to my advantage nor can i answer for the strange effect a contrary report might have wrought on a mind so giddily loaded with conceited transport  i am not quite certain whether my folly and indignation might not have caused a drawnbattle on such an occasion  it happened that mrs horton who played lady fanciful the time before was indisposed and my sisterinlaw the late mrs jane cibber was appointed to do the part who notwithstanding her having been a few years on the stage and indeed a meritorious actress had not overcome the shock of appearing the first night in any character i who was astonished at her timidity like a strange gawky as i was told her i was surprised at her being frighted who had so often appeared when i who had never played but once had no concern at all that is the very reason said she when you have stood as many shocks as others have done and are more acquainted with your business you will possibly be more susceptible of fear the apprehensions she labored under gave her a grave aspect which my insensible head at that time took as an affront and i remember i turned short on my heel as we were waiting for our cue of entrance and broke off our conversation nor could i bring myself but on the stage to speak to her the whole evening  this ridiculous circumstance we have both laughed at since and i found her words very true for i will maintain it the best players are the most capable of fear as they are naturally most exact in the nicety of their performance not that i would insinuate by this observation that i think myself better than in the common run of those theatrical gentry who are lucky enough to be endured through the course of a play without being wished to be no more seen after the first act  such melancholy instances i have been witness of both in town and country whilst the poor player has bawled and bellowed out his minute on the stage and the groaning audience hissingly entreated he might be heard no more  the second character i appeared in was alicia and found the audience not less indulgent than before mrs porters misfortune of being overturned in her chaise at highwoodhill was the means by which i was possessed of that part the third was the distressd mother in the summer when the young company were under my brother theophilus cibbers direction  now i leave to any reasonable person what i went through in undertaking two such characters after two of the greatest actresses in the theater viz mrs oldfield and mrs porter by this time i began to feel i feared and the want of it was sufficiently paid home to me in the tremor of spirits i suffered in such daring attempts however fortune was my friend and i escaped with life for i solemnly declare that i expected to make an odd figure in the bills of mortality  died one of capital characters  soon after this george barnwell made his appearance on the stage in which i was the original lucy and beginning to make acting my business as well as my pleasure the success i had in that part raised me from twenty to thirty shillings per week after which having the good fortune to be selected from the rest of the company as stockreader to the theater in case of disasters i acquitted myself tolerably to the satisfaction of the masters and audience  my first attempt of that kind was cleopatra for the benefit of mr worsdale who was honored with the presence of his royal highness the late prince of wales mrs heron having that afternoon the misfortune to bruise her kneepan she was immovable and i was at the second music sent for to read the part  had i been under sentence of death and st sepulchers dreadful bell tolling for my last hour i dont conceive i could have suffered much greater agony and thought of my sisters words to some tune for i absolutely had not a joint or nerve i could command for the whole night and as an addition to the terror i labored under mr quin that worthy veteran of the stage played ventidius the apprehension i labored under in respect to the audience which was a numerous one to the amount of three hundred and odd pounds was nothing in comparison to the fright his aspect threw me into  but even this shock i got through and was soon after inducted to a second of the same nature mrs butler was taken ill and the queen in essex was to be filled up accordingly i was sent for to supply the deficiency which in justice to the memory of the deceased gentlewoman i must inform the reader she rewarded me for by sending me in a very polite manner a couple of guineas next morning i must needs say i did not think it worth so handsome an acknowledgement but she sent in such a manner that had i refused it i must have been guilty of a very great absurdity as her station and mine at that time were upon very different footings i being but a babby in the business and she an established person of a very good salary  i continued for that season at the beforementioned revenue but upon mr highmores making a purchase in the theater there immediately happened a revolt of the greatest number of the company to the new theater in the haymarket my brother being principally concerned i also made a decampment and was by agreement raised from thirty shillings to three pounds had a very good share of parts and continued with them till the whole body returned to mr fletewood who for some time carried on the business with great industry attended with proportionable success though poor gentleman i fear that superextraordinary success was the foundation of his ruin  it happened he and i had a dispute about parts and our controversy arose to such a height i without the least patience or consideration took a french leave of him and was idle enough to conceive i had done a very meritorious thing i cannot say in the affair he used me entirely well because he broke his word with me but i used myself much worse in the main by leaving him as i have since experienced as there are too many busy medlars in the world who are ever ready to clinch the nail of sedition when once it is struck so some particular people thought it worth while by villainous falsehoods to blow the spark of fire between mr fletewood and myself into a barbarous blaze insomuch that i was provoked to write a farce on the occasion entitled the art of management wherein the reader may be assured i took no small pains to set him in a most ridiculous light and spared not to utter some truths which i am sensible ought rather to have been concealed and i cannot but own i have since felt some secret compunction on that score as he notwithstanding my impertinent and stupid revenge at my fathers request restored me to my former station  what further aggravates my folly and ingratitude i made even then but a short stay with him and joined the late henry fielding esquire who at that time was manager at the haymarket theater and running his play called pasquin the eleventh night of which i played the part of lord place which till then had been performed by mr richard yates but as he had other parts in that piece mr fielding begged the favor of him to spare that to make room for me and i was accordingly engaged at four guineas per week with an indulgence in point of charges at my benefit by which i cleared sixty guineas and walked with my purse in my hand till my stock was exhausted lest i should forget the necessity i then labored under of squandering what might have made many a decayed family truly happy  as i stand selfconvicted for all the follies i have been guilty of i hope my behavior to mr fletewood will six no imputation that may not be removed and the less so as i might say to him from the origin of our quarrel with peachum  brother brother we were both in the wrong my motive for leaving him the second time proceeded from a cause he had no share in which i confess is a farther aggravation to my ingratitude i can only acknowledge my error and beg pardon for the folly and at the same time apologize for my concealment of the reason of my second elopement as twas partly a familyconcern though perhaps i might be condemned were i to reveal it but notwithstanding i have done a thousand unaccountable things i cannot absolutely think myself blameable for that last project farther than in using a gentleman ill who had behaved to me agreeable to that character when he might have taken any advantages against me without being thought guilty of inhumanity or injustice  soon after pasquin began to droop mr lillo the author of george barnwell brought mr fielding a tragedy of three acts called the fatal curiosity taken from a true tragic tale of a family at penryn in cornwall who lived in the reign of king james the first in this play are two welldrawn characters under the denominations of old wilmot and his wife agnes an aged pair who had from too much hospitality on the husbands part and unbounded pride on the wifes outrun a vast estate and were reduced to extremest poverty  the late mr john roberts a very judicious speaker discovered a mastership in the character of the husband and i appeared in that of the wife we were kindly received by the audience the play had a fresh run the season following and if i can obtain a grant for one night only i intend to make my appearance once more as mrs agnes for my own benefit at the haymarket theater on which occasion i humbly hope the favor and interest of my worthy friends  at the time i was engaged with mr fielding i lodged in oxendonstreet and boarded with my sister brett who was but an inmate as well as myself but i and my little daughter swelled up the number of her family i being a sort of creature that was regarded as a favorite cat or mischievous monkey about house was easily put off with what reasonable people might have deemed not only an inconvenience but an affront i accordingly was put into the worst apartment and was entirely insensible of it is oddity till a blustering night roused me into an observation of it is extraordinary delicacy when i had thoroughly surveyed it i sat down and wrote the following description of the room and exact inventory of my chattels  good people for awhile give ear till i have described my furniture with my stately room i shall begin which a part of noahs ark has been my windows reach from pole to pole strangely airy  that in winter of my soul with the dear delight of  here and there a hole there is a chest of drawers too i think which seems a trough where pigeons drink a handkerchief and caps as much as they will contai o but i keep no gowns  so need not to complain then for my fire i have an inch of stove which i often grieve i cannot move when i travel from the chimney to the door which are miles full three if not fourscore by that time i shivering arrive i doubtful grow if i am alive two foreign screens i have in lieu of tongs and poker  nay faith shovel too sometimes they serve to fan the fire for it is seldom that to bellows i aspire i will challenge englands king and the pretender to say that ever i rust my fender that fashions old i have got a newer and prudently make use of iron skewer now for my lovely bed of verdant hue which ere adam lived might possibly be new so charming thin the darns so neat with great convenience expel the heat but these things will not ever last each day a curtain i in breathing waste then for chairs i indeed have one but since ruin draws so swiftly on will let my room ere chair screens and curtains all are gone these curious lines were for nineteen years preserved by my foolish fond sister who in her turn has been a universal friend to her brethren or rather her sisterhood i wish fortune had been less rigourous and gratitude more predominant that the former might have prevented or the latter have been the tender motive to assuage those sorrows and inconveniences of life she at present labors under from which as far as she has a claim in me and my poor capacity extends i will make it the business of my life to extricate her as i have when fortune was in her power been a participater of her bounty  i dont make this design public with any regard to myself but with the pleasing hope of being the happy example to others from whom she may have an equal claim both from nature and gratitude poor thing she is now in the five and fiftieth year of her age and as she has had no faults the family can allege against her it is pity but she should be tenderly considered by em all that the remaining part of life may pass away without those corroding cares that are too often the impediment to our casting our thoughts beyond the present state which alas is the sad and dreadful consequence of a forgetfulness and disregard of the future  i dont apprehend that to be my unhappy sisters case for i am certain her reason and good sense can never be reduced to such a stupefaction yet the strongest intellects and most resolute minds may possibly be vanquished in some degree by an oppressive load of anguish and uninterrupted hours of care  now i am speaking of her i must not omit the mention of mr joseph marples her second husband the faithful partner of her sorrows who is worthy the consideration of every human heart as he tenderly endeavors to soften all her distresses which doubly preys on his mind from want of power totally to dissipate and wears to her a pleasing aspect with a bleeding heart but i hope providence has still an unforeseen happiness in store for em and that i shall see their clouds of grief brightened with smiles of joy from the possession of a happier fortune  i must now leave them in the industrious and pleasing search of what i hope they will shortly obtain and pursue my story by informing my reader when i removed from my airy mansion beforedescribed i took it into my head to dive into trade to that end i took a shop in longacre and turned oilwoman and grocer  this new whim proved very successful for every soul of my acquaintance of which i have a numerous share came in turn to see my mercantile face which carried in it as conceited an air of trade as it had before in physic and i talked of myself and other dealers as i was pleased to term it the rise and fall of sugars was my constant topic and trading abroad and at home was as frequent in my mouth as my meals to complete the ridiculous scene i constantly took in the papers to see how matters went at bearkey what ships were come in or lost who in our trade was broke or who advertised teas at the lowest prices ending with a comment upon those dealers who were endeavoring to undersell us shrewdly prognosticating their never being quiet till they had rendered the article of tea a mere drug and that i and many more of the business should be obliged entirely to give it up an injury to traffic in general that must be allowed  i must beg leave gentle reader to tell you that my stock perhaps did not exceed ten or a dozen pounds at a time of each sort but that furnished me with as much discourse as if i had the whole lading of a ship in my shop then as to oils to be sure the famous nobbs and fifty more were not to be put in competition with mine for their excellence and though i seldom kept above a gallon of a sort in the house i carried on the farce so far as to write to country chapmen to deal with me  then i considered till i had established a universal trade i would save for the first year the expense of an outrider as i was a very good horsewoman and go the journies myself concluding with a significant nod that money was as well in my own pocket as anothers  but providentially for me i could gain no country customers for as the case stood i must positively have let em had the goods considerably to my own loss and as a proof will relate a circumstance that occurred to me in the selling a quarter of a hundred of lumpsugar to a goodnatured friend who came to buy it for no other reason but that i sold it  it is customary in buying of sugars by the hundred to be allowed a tret of six pounds extra i was so insufferably proud of hearing so large a quantity demanded by my friend that i really forgot the character of grocer and fancying myself the sugarbaker allowed in the twentyfive pounds the half of what i got in the hundred alleging that twas our way when people dealt for large quantities to make an allowance over and above the common weight  my friend who knew no better than myself promised me all the custom she could bring which if she had been as good as her word might in due course of time have paved the way for me either to newgate the fleet or marshalsea  after my friend was gone with her bargain i began as i thought trade increasing to think it proper to purchase a large pair of scales to weigh by hundreds and a large beam to hang em on and set out next morning to that purpose traversing through drury lane holborn fleetditch etc but meeting with nothing to my mind returned home with a resolution to have a pair made  the good woman who kept the house upon hearing i had been endeavoring to make this needless purchase made bold to enquire into the necessity of it upon which i told her what had happened the day before and mentioned as a proof of my knowledge of trade the advantage i allowed to my friend she for some time left me amazed at her meaning while she was almost strangled with laughing at my folly  when she came to herself i gravely asked where the joke lay and what mighty wonder there was in my having an increasing trade who had such a universal acquaintance as soon as she was able to convince me of the error i had committed in giving one half of the overweight in a quarter of a hundred which was allowed in a whole hundred only i began to drop my jaw and looked as foolish as any reasonable person may suppose on so ridiculous an occasion  links and flambeaux are a commodity belonging to the oiltrade at least generally sold in shops of that kind and constant and large demands i had for both but i remember in particular one of those nocturnal illuminators who are the necessary conductors for those who dont choose chairs or coaches came every night just before candletime which is the dusky part of the evening the most convenient light for perpetrating a wicked intent as will be proved in the sequel of my story  to be sure i thought myself infinitely obliged to the sootycolourd youth for using my shop and was mighty proud of his handsel every evening and sometimes as i dealt in spiritous liquors treated him with a dram and many thanks for his own and other gentlemens custom of his profession the arch villain smiled and expressed great satisfaction that even in his poor way he had the power of serving his good mistress he bowed and i curtseyd till walking backwards out of my shop he had complemented me out of every brass weight i had in it  he had not been gone five minutes ere i had occasion to make use of some of em when to my great amazement and confusion not one was to be found unluckily for me they were piled up one within the other and injudiciously placed in the corner of the window next the door quite pat to his purpose and he was really so perfect a master of his art in filching that notwithstanding the great ceremony that passed between us from the upperend of the shop to the lower he went off entirely undiscovered in his villainy  i need not tell the reader twas the last interview we ever had till i to his great misfortune saw him making a small tour in a twowheeld coach from newgate to tyburn a college where many an industrious squire like himself have frequently and deservedly taken their degrees  this second fracas so closely pursuing the former i had some secret thoughts of shutting up my shop for ever to conceal my misfortunes and disgrace though i altered my mind for that time but i think in about three months after i positively threw it up at a hundred pounds stock all paid for to keep a grand puppetshow over the tenniscourt in jamesstreet which is licenced and which is the only one in this kingdom that has had the good fortune to obtain so advantageous a grant  when i first went into my shop i was horribly puzzled for the means of securing my effects from the power of my husband who though he did not live with me i knew had a right to make bold with any thing that was mine as there was no formal article of separation between us and i could not easily brook his taking any thing from me to be profusely expended on his mistress who lived no farther from me than the house next to the coachmakers in great queensstreet and was sister to the famous mrs sally k  g one of the ladies of the highest irreputable reputation at that time in or about covent garden however to prevent any danger i gave and took all receipts till mr charke went to jamaica where he died in about twenty months after his leaving england in the name of a widow gentlewoman who boarded with me and i sat quiet and snug with the pleasing reflection of my security though he suspected i had a hand in the plot  but he did not stay long enough to trouble me on that score for his lady was one day unfortunately arrested for a hundred pounds as they sat tete a tete at dinner and he to show his gallantry went directly into the city and immediately purchased her redemption by taken up that sum of the merchants who were agents for the gentleman he went over with and whom till then he left in uncertainty whether he would go or not  it was concerted between this happy pair that madam should follow and i suppose pass in the indies for his wife which she had my leave to do though she were a lady  as i have among many other censures labored under that of being a giddy indiscreet wife i must take this opportunity of referring myself to the superior judgment of those who read my story whether a young creature who actually married for love at least i thought so nay was foolish enough to think myself equally beloved must not naturally be incensed when in less than a month after marriage i received the most demonstrative proofs of disregard where i ought to have found the greatest tenderness to be even to my face apparently convinced of his insatiate fondness for a plurality of common wretches that were to be had for half a crown this consequently raised in me both aversion and contempt and not having years enough to afford me much reflection nor patience sufficient to sit down like lady easy contented with my wrongs till experience might by chance have made him wiser  had he entertained a reciprocal affection for me he had when i married him so absolute a possession of my heart twas in his power to have molded my temper as he thought fit but the ungrateful returns my fondness met with could not fail of the unhappy effects of a growing disregard on my side  i was in hope the birth of my little girl might have made some impression on his mind but twas the same thing after as before it nor did he make the least provision for either of us when he went abroad it is true i was then in lincolnsinnfields playhouse and from thence engaged at a good salary with the late mr fielding but then i was as liable to death or infirmities as any other part of the creation which might have disempowerd me from getting my own or my childs bread  pray what was to become of us then i labored under the melancholy circumstance of being newly under my fathers displeasure and consequently no redress to be hoped or expected from that quarter which he very well knew and as i have been since informed was one of the principal sowers of sedition betwixt us though at the same time he would explode my father behind his back and condemn him to me for the very things he had partly urged him to  however though he did not choose to be a husband or a father he proved himself a son by making an assignment of twenty pounds a year during his life to his mother who constantly made it her practice to be one of the party with him and his lady and very confidently come from them to my apartment and give me a history of the chat of the day that had passed between them  but peace to his manes and i hope heaven has forgiven him as i do from my soul and wish for both our sakes he had been master of more discretion i had then possibly been possessed of more prudence  about a year before he went to the indies i had the misfortune to lose my dear mother otherwise i should not have undergone that perturbation of mind i suffered from his not leaving any thing in case of accidents for mine and the childs support as my mothers tenderness would have made us equally her care in any exigence that might have occurred to me but alas she was gone to my sorrow even to the present minute in which i mention her and shall ever revere her memory as is quite incumbent on me for her inexpressible fondness and tender regard for me to the latest moment of her life  this dear woman was possessed of every personal charm that could render her attractive and aimable her conquest over my father was by a visit he made to her late brother whom i have before mentioned and as he passed by the chamber where she was accompanying her own voice on the harpsichord his ear was immediately charmed on which he begged to be introduced and at first sight was captivated nor as i hear was she less delighted with the sprightliness of his wit than he was with the fund of perfection with which art and nature had equally endowed her in short a private courtship began and ended in a marriage against her fathers consent as mr colley cibber was then rather too young for a husband in the old gentlemans opinion he not coming to age till after as i have been told the birth of his second child but notwithstanding my grandfather in the end gave her a fortune and intended a larger but this marriage made him convert the intended additional sum to another use and in revenge built a folly on the thames called shoresfolly which was demolished some years before i was born  her fathers family exclusive of her children is now entirely extinct by the death of my uncle who poor man had the misfortune to be ever touched in his brain and as a convincing proof married his maid at an age when he and she both had more occasion for a nurse than a parson  we have proof positive of his being incapable of making a will that can stand good for which reason i am determined as being one of the heirs at law to have a trial of skill with the ancient lady and see whether a proper appeal to the court of chancery will not be the happy means of setting aside a mad mans will and make way for those who have a more legal and justifiable claim to his effects than an old woman whose utmost merit consisted in being his servant i am only astonished they have let her alone so long but i promise her she shall not find me quite so passive  and that right soon  and heaven give our arms success  as our cause has justice in it for some time i resided at the tenniscourt with my puppetshow which was allowed to be the most elegant that was ever exhibited i was so very curious that i bought mezzotintos of several eminent persons and had the faces carved from them then in regard to my clothes i spared for no cost to make them splendidly magnificent and the scenes were agreeable to the rest  this affair stood me in some hundreds and would have paid all costs and charges if i had not through excessive fatigue in accomplishing it acquired a violent fever which had like to have carried me off and consequently gave a damp to the run i should otherwise have had as i was one of the principal exhibiters for those gentry whose mouths were like many others we have seen move without any reality of utterance or at least so unintelligible in the attempt they might as well have closed their lips without raising an expectation they were unlucky enough to disappoint whether orators or players is not material but as i have myself been lately admitted into the number of the former and from my youth helped to fill up the catalogue of the latter i hope no exceptions will be taken as the cap may as reasonably fit myself as any other of either profession though i must beg leave to hint however deficient i or some of my cotemporaries may be every tragic player at least should be an orator  it is no complement to mr garrick to say he is both consequently encomiums are needless to prove what the nicest judges have for some few years past been so pleasingly convinced of  it is i own natural and necessary to apologize for disgressing from a subject but i hope when the reader considers the merit of the person who occasioned it i may in the eye of reason and judgment stand excused perhaps as mr garrick is a person who many may undoubtedly wish to pay their court to this remark may be deemed adulation but i must beg their pardons and assure them they would in that point be guilty of a very great error for i am the last creature in the world to be picked out for that piece of folly nay i think so meanly of it as to set it down as servility which i heartily contemn and have been often blamed for a too openness of temper that has sometimes hazarded the loss of a friend  in regard to the abovementioned gentleman there is not any mortal breathing that enjoys the benefit of hearing and of sight but must receive infinite delight from his performance though they should be ever so indifferent to him when off the stage but that is not my case i have received some acts of friendship from him therefore of course must revere him as a benefactor and am proud of this opportunity to make him a public acknowledgement  it is certain there never was known a more unfortunate devil than i have been but i have in the height of all my sorrows happily found a numerous quantity of friends whose commiseration shall be taken notice of with the utmost gratitude before i close this narrative now on to the affairs of state  when i quitted the tenniscourt i took a house in marshamstreet westminster and lived very privately for a little while till i began to consider that my wooden troop might as well be put in action and determined to march to tunbridgewells at the head of them when i arrived there was a general who had taken the field before me one lacon a famous person who had for many successive years and indeed very successfully entertained the company with those inanimate heroes and heroines i therefore was obliged to sound a retreat and content myself with confining my forces and fighting against lacon in propria persona at ashleys great room  i had living numbers sufficient to play two or three of our thinest comedies and our only tragedy we had to our backs was george barnwell which i played for my own benefit the last night and set out next morning for london  when i arrived there i began to consider which way i should turn myself being then out of the houses and in no likelihood of future restoration i resolved to make the best use i could of my figures without fatiguing myself any farther and let my comedians out for hire to a man who was principally concerned in the formation of them but business not answering his ends and my expectations i sold for twenty guineas what cost me near five hundred pounds another proof of my discretion and indeed of the honesty of the purchaser that knew the original expense of them and the reality of their worth but as i have condemned him for taking the advantage of my necessity shall conceal his name and hope he will have modesty enough if this paragraph should be read to him by some who knew the affair to add one sin more in denying that he was the person  i even gave him the privilege as i had a license to make use of that and my name which now when ever i think proper as i shall never exhibit any thing that can possibly give offense shall always employ mr yeates who is a skillful person and one who has made it his business from his youth upwards  as it is very possible i may entertain the town with some unaccountable oddity of that kind very shortly those that like to laugh i know will encourage me and i am certain there is none in the world more fit than myself to be laughed at i confess myself an odd mortal and believe i need no force of argument beyond what has been already said to bring the whole globe terrestrial into that opinion  it has been hinted and indeed luckily came to my ear that i should never have patience to go through the process of my life i dont suppose those who could advance such a piece of folly in me could possibly be my friends and am sorry for their want of humanity as this work is at present the staff of my life and such an insinuation must naturally deter many from taking it in if they suppose me capable of such an inconsistency so far from it that were i by miracle capable of riding in my own coach i would still pursue my scheme till i had brought it to a conclusion for a happy change of circumstances makes  misfortunes past prove stories of delight and what now is my support would then be my amusement  it is strange but true let people use the most honest endeavors to support themselves there is generally some ridiculous mortal that without rhyme or reason and for the sake of saying something without any real views of good or ill are often detrimental to the industrious or oppressed be it as it may it is an error i fear invincible and hurtful to both and sure unprovoked to offer an injury is unpardonable if the contrary were the case it is nobler far to overlook than resent but as i have no reason to believe that i have offended i hope for the future no person will be indiscreet enough to assert that for a truth which time will prove to be a real falsehood  not long after i had parted from what might really by good management have brought me in a very comfortable subsistence and in a genteel light i was addressed by a worthy gentleman being then a widow and closely pursued till i consented to an honorable though very secret alliance and in compliance to the person bound myself by all the vows sincerest friendship could inspire never to confess who he was gratitude was my motive to consent to this conjunction and extreme fondness was his inducement to request it to be short he soon died and unhappily for me not only from sustaining the loss of a valuable and sincere friend but by the unexpected stroke of death i was deprived of every hope and means of a support  as i have overcome all the inconveniences of life this terrible shock of fate rendered me liable to i am contented and think myself happy but not even the most inexplicable sorrows i was immersed in ever did nor shall any motive whatever make me break that vow i made to the person by a discovery of his name  this was a means indeed by which i hoped to have secured myself far above those distresses i have known but alas proved the fatal cause of all i was left involved with debts i had no means of paying and through the villainous instigation of a wicked drunken woman was arrested for seven pounds when as heaven shall judge me i did not know where to raise as many pence  the officer who had me in custody on hearing my story really compassionated me and was exceeding angry at the woman who without cause worked up the creditor to believe i had a fortune of five hundred per annum left me which was not in the power of the deceased to leave nor as the affair was a secret and death sudden any probability of such a happiness  this misfortune was occasioned first by the stupidity and cruelty of the woman and effected by dint of a very handsome laced hat i had on being then for some substantial reasons en cavalier which was so well described the bailiff had no great trouble in finding me  undoubtedly i was extreme happy when he told me his business having nothing in view but the marshalsea the gates of which i thought though at that time in the middle of covent garden stood wide open for my reception but as the man had humanity he eased me of those fears and by dint of a trifling favor conferred by poor mrs elizabeth careless whose name will i believe be for some years in remembrance i was set at large till matters could be accommodated  it is not to be expressed the transport i felt on his leaving me behind him with mrs careless and her goodnatured friend who being an attorney was incapable of becoming my bail but compassionated my distress and sent me directly to mr mytton who kept the crosskeys requesting him to do that friendly office for me and sent by me a note of indemnification which mr mytton could on no means make any exceptions to as the gentleman was a person of worth and honor and besides a particular good customer to the other  the next thing was to procure another bail to join with the former i soon obtained one whose good nature was easily excited to do a kind action but when i went to the officer and told who it was objections were made against him as he was obliged himself to keep close for fear of an equal disaster and to convince me of his danger produced a writ which had been two or three times renewed to no purpose  what to do in this terrible exigence i could not tell as i had but a day and a half longer to be at large if i could not produce a second bail i tried all means but in vain and on the friday following was obliged to surrender and lay that night in jacksonsasley at the officers house  i had not been there half an hour before i was surrounded with all the ladies who kept coffeehouses in and about the garden each offering money for my ransom but nothing then could be done without the debt and costs which though there was i believe about a dozen or fourteen ladies present they were not able to raise as far as their finances extended they made an offer of em and would have given notes jointly or separately for the relief of poor sir charles as they were pleased to style me it is true the officer would willingly have come into their kind propositions as he was truly sensible of my indigence but being closely watched by the creditor who would on no terms be brought to any composition all their efforts were ineffectual  after two or three hours wasted in fruitless entreaties it growing late they left me to bewail the terrible scene of horror that presented to my tortured view and with a heart overcharged with anguish and hopeless of redress i retired to my dormitory and passed the night in bitterest reflections on my melancholy situation  my poor child who was then but eight years of age and whose sole support was on her hapless friendless mother knew not what was become of me or where to seek me and with watchful care wore away the tedious night in painful apprehensions of what really had befallen me  about seven next morning i dispatched a messenger to my poor little suffering infant who soon came to me with her eyes overflowed with tears and a heart full of undissembled anguish she immediately threw her head upon my bosom and remained in speechless grief with which i equally encountered her for some time the child was so entirely sensible of our misfortunes and of the want of means of being extricated from them twas with difficulty i soothed her into a calm alas what has the poor and friendless to hope for surrounded with sorrows of such a nature that even people in tolerable circumstances find some perplexity when so assailed to overcome  i sat down and wrote eight and thirty letters before i stirred out of my chair some of which went where i thought nature might have put in her claim but i could obtain no answer and where i least expected i found redress  my poor little wench was the melancholy messenger and neither eat or drank till she had faithfully discharged the trust i reposed in her to be short the very ladies who had visited me the night before brought with them the late mrs elizabeth hughes who by dint of her laying down a couple of guineas and a collection from the rest with a guinea from mrs douglass in the piazza i was set at liberty and the officer advised me to change hats with him that being the very mark by which i was unfortunately distinguished and made known to him  my hat was ornamented with a beautiful silver lace little the worse for wear and of the size which is now the present taste the officers a large one cocked up in the coachmans style and weightened with a horrible quantity of crape to secure him from the winters cold  as to my figure it is so well known it needs no description but my friend the bailiff was a very short thick redfaced man of such a corpulency he might have appeared in the character of falstaff without the artful assistance of stuffing and his head proportionable to his body consequently we each of us made very droll figures he with his little laced hat which appeared on his head of the size of those made for the spanish ladies and my unfortunate face smothered under his that i was almost as much incommoded as when i marched in the ditch under the insupportable weight of my fathers  however this smoaky convenience for it stunk insufferably of tobacco was a security and absolute prevention from other threatening dangers and i prudently retired into a most dismal and solitary mansion in great queensstreet where i was hourly apprehensive of having the house fall upon my head though if it had according to the old proverb it would not have been the first misfortune of the kind that had befallen me twas the old building which has since been formed into several new and handsome houses  when my kind redeemers took me away they treated me with an elegant supper and sent me home to my child with a guinea in my pocket which they very politely desired me to accept on as a present to her  i passed the night in grateful thoughts both to heaven and those appointed by that great power to save me from the gulf of absolute destruction i never having been in a distress of that kind before laid my sorrow deeper to heart and the inexpressible delight of being restored to my child and liberty was almost too much for my fluttered spirits at that time to bear so unexpected a relief may be deemed a prodigy but what is there so difficult or unlikely in the imagination of thoughtless mortals that the allgracious ruler of the world cannot bring to bear  this very circumstance convinces me that no misfortune of ever so dreadful a nature should excite us to despair what had i to conceive but the miserable enforcement to linger out a wretched life in prison a child who might possibly have been despised only for being mine and perhaps reduced to beggary  these were the entertaining ideas i had the night of my confinement but when i found providence had been so tenderly and industriously employed in my behalf i began to arraign myself for supposing that my relations in such extremity though they were regardless of me would have abandoned an innocent and hapless child to that rigourous fate my fears suggested  during my solitary residence in queensstreet i never made my appearance for a considerable time but on a sunday and was obliged to have recourse to as many friends as i could muster up to help me to a support for myself and my little fellowsufferer she poor child was so deeply affected with the malevolence of my fortune it threw her into a very dangerous illness but even in that distress heaven raised a friend my brother theophilus cibber kindly sent an apothecary at his own expense for which i shall ever acknowledge myself extremely his debtor and am sorry i have not the power of making a more suitable return  i left the poor girl one sunday to prog for her and myself by pledging with an acquaintance a beautiful pair of sleevebuttons which i effected in about two hours and on my return asking the landlady how the child did having left her very much indisposed she told me miss went up about an hour and half ago to put on some clean linen but by her staying she concluded she was lain down having complained of being very sleepy before she went up but oh heaven how vast was my grief and surprise when i entered the room and found the poor little soul stretched on the floor in strong convulsion fits in which she had lain a considerable time and no mortal near to give her the least assistance  i took her up and overcome with strong grief immediately dropped her on the floor which i wonder did not absolutely end her by the force of the fall as she was in fact a dead weight my screaming and her falling raised the house and in the hurry of my distraction i run into the street with my shirtsleeves dangling loose about my hands my wig standing on end  like quills upon the fretful porcupine and proclaiming the sudden death of my muchbeloved child a crowd soon gathered round me and in the violence of my distraction instead of administering any necessary help wildly stood among the mob to recount the dreadful disaster  the peoples compassion was moved it is true but as i happened not to be known to them it drew them into astonishment to see the figure of a young gentleman so extravagantly grieved for the loss of a child as i appeared very young they looked on it as an unprecedented affection in a youth and began to deem me a lunatic rather then that there was any reality in what i said  one of the people who had been employed in the care as i then thought of my expiring infant missing me sought me out and brought me home where i found the child still in violent convulsions which held her from sunday eleven oclock in the forenoon without intermission till between the hours of eight and nine next morning  in the midst of this scene of sorrow mr adam hallam who lived next door to my lodging hearing of my misfortune in a very genteel and tender manner proved himself a real friend unasked the first instance i had of his humanity was a letter of condolence in which was enclosed that necessary and neverfailing remedy for every evil incidental to mankind in general and what was more extraordinary was his constantly sending to enquire after the childs health with the same respectful regard as might have been expected had i been possessed of that affluence i but some few months before enjoyed  at his own request his table was my own and i am certain his good nature laid an embargo on his person as he often dined at home in compliment to me rather than leave me to undergo the shock of mingling with his servants or be distinguished by them as his pensioner by leaving me to eat by myself  it happened very a propos for me that mr hallam had a backdoor into his house which prevented the hazards i might otherwise have been liable to by going into the street and indeed as sharp says to gayless the backdoor i always thought the safest by which means i had a frequent opportunity of conversing with a sincere friend whose humanity assuaged the anguish of my mind and whose bounty was compassionately employed for a considerable time to protect me and mine from the insupportable and distracting fears of want  after what i have said in regard to the favors i received i am certain no person who ever knew what it was to be obliged and had honesty enough to dare to be grateful will condemn me for making this public acknowledgement who have no other means of doing justice to one that had no motive or right to give such an instance of benevolence but excited alone from a natural propensity to do a good action  favors when received are too often forgot and i have observed gratitude to be a principle that bears the smallest share in the hearts of those where it ought to be most strongly president so that i begin to imagine one half of the world dont understand the real etymology of the word  but that i may give farther assurances of my detestation of that sin of unkindness and insolence i shall proceed to give a farther account of obligations i received from strangers and shall begin with those conferred on me by the late mr delane comedian who though almost a stranger to my person grew intimate with my affliction and testified his concern by raising a timely contribution to alleviate my distress and redoubled the favorable remedy in the politeness of the application  mrs woffington stands equally in the rank of those whose merits must be sounded in the song of grateful praise and many more of the generous natives of ireland who are in nature a set of worthy people when they meet with objects of pity and i have made bold to expatiate in a particular manner on that subject in my history of mr dumont which will be immediately published after the conclusion of this narrative  i must now mention the friendly assistance of mr rich mr garrick mr lacey the several governors of the two theaters mr beard and many more of the gentlemen of the stage to whose bounty i shall ever think myself indebted  i am now going to take notice of a person who at friendly distance has many times afforded a happy relief to my bitterest wants namely the present mrs cibber whose pity was once the means of saving my life by preventing my going to a jail and more than once or twice fed both myself and child by timely presents only from hearing of the sad circumstances we labored under whatever the world may think in regard to my taking this public notice of her humanity i must beg to be excused if i insist on my being justifiable by the laws of gratitude and as i was glad to be obliged should think it the height of insolence to be ashamed to make the acknowledgement  as soon as my poor girl began a little to recover i sometimes used by owllight to creep out in search of adventures and as there was frequently plays acted at the tenniscourt with trembling limbs and aching heart adventured to see as i was universally studied whether there was any character wanting a custom very frequent among the gentry who exhibited at that celebrated slaughterhouse of dramatick poetry  one night i remember the recruiting officer was to be performed as they were pleased to call it for the benefit of a young creature who had never played before to my unbounded joy captain plume was so very unfortunate that he came at five oclock to inform the young gentlewoman he did not know a line of his part i who though shut up in the mock greenroom did not dare to tell them i could do it for fear of being heard to speak and that the sound of my voice which is particular and as well known as my face should betray me to those assailants of liberty who constantly attended every playnight there to the inexpressible terror of many a potentate who has quiveringly tremored out the hero lest the sad catastrophe should rather end in a spunghouse than a bowl of poison or a timely dagger  the want of which latter instrument of death i once saw supplied with a ladys busk who had just presence of mind sufficient to draw it from her stays and end at once her wretched life and more wretched acting  some of these kind of meritorious exhibiters were to massacre poor farquhar that night but not one among them capable of playing or rather going on for plume which they would have done perhaps like a chair set up to fill up the number in a countrydance at last the question was put to me i immediately replied seeing the coast clear i could do such a thing but like mosca was resolved to stand on terms and make a merit of necessity to be sure maam says i i would do any any thing to eblige you but i am quite unprepared  i have nothing here proper  i want a pair of white stockings and clean shirt  though between friends in case of a lucky hit i had all those things ready in my coatpocket as i was certain let what part would befall me cleanliness was a necessary ingredient  then i urged that twould be scarce worth her while to pay me my price upon which she was immediately jogged by the elbow and took aside to advise her to offer me a crown i being pretty well used to the little arts of those worthy wights received the proposal soon after and without making any answer to it jogged the lady s other elbow and withdrew assuring her that under a guinea i positively would not undertake it that to prevent any demur with the rest of the people she should give me the sixteen shillings privately and publicly pay me five  her house was as full as it could hold and the audience clattering for a beginning at length she was obliged to comply with my demands and i got ready with utmost expedition when the play which was in fact a farce to me was ended i thought it mighty proper to stay till the coast was clear that i might carry off myself and guinea securely but in order to effect it i changed clothes with a person of low degree whose happy rags and the kind covert of night secured me from the dangers i might have otherwise encountered my friend took one road i another but met at my lodgings where i rewarded him poor as i was with a shilling which at that time i thought a competent fortune for a younger child  it happened not long after that i was applied to by a strange unaccountable mortal called jockey adams famous for dancing the jockey dance to the tune of horse to new market as i was gaping for a crust i readily snapd at the first that offered and went with this person to a town within four miles of london where a very extraordinary occurrence happened and which had i been really what i represented might have rid in my own coach in the rear of six horses  notwithstanding my distresses the want of clothes was not amongst the number i appeared as mr brown a name most hateful to me now for reasons the town shall have shortly leave to guess at in a very genteel manner and not making the least discovery of my sex by my behavior ever endeavoring to keep up to the wellbred gentlemen i became as i may most properly term it the unhappy object of love in a young lady whose fortune was beyond all earthly power to deprive her of had it been possible for me to have been what she designed me nothing less than her husband she was an orphan heiress and under age but so near it that at the expiration of eight months her guardian resigned his trust and i might have been at once possessed of the lady and forty thousand pounds in the bank of england besides effects in the indies that were worth about twenty thousand more  this was a most horrible disappointment on both sides the lady of the husband and i of the money which would have been thought an excellent remedy for ills by those less surrounded with misery than i was i who was the principal in this tragedy was the last acquainted with it but it got wind from the servants to some of the players who as hamlet says cannot keep a secret and they immediately communicated it to me  contrary to their expectation i received the information with infinite concern not more in regard to myself than from the poor ladys misfortune in placing her affection on an improper object and whom by letters i afterward received confirmed me she was too fond of her mistaken bargain  the means by which i came by her letters was through the persuasion of her maid who like most persons of her function are too often ready to carry on intrigues twas no difficult matter to persuade an amorous heart to follow its own inclination and accordingly a letter came to invite me to drink tea at a place a little distant from the house where she lived  the reason given for this interview was the desire some young ladies of her acquaintance had to hear me sing and as they never went to plays in the country twould be a great obligation to her if i would oblige her friends by complying with her request  the maid who brought this epistle informed of the real occasion of its being wrote and told me if i pleased i might be happiest man in the kingdom before i was eight and forty hours older this frank declaration from the servant gave me but an odd opinion of the mistress and i sometimes conceived being conscious how unfit i was to embrace so favorable an opportunity that it was all a joke  however be it as it might i resolved to go and know the reality the maid too insisted that i should and protested her lady had suffered much on my account from the first hour she saw me and but for her the secret had never been disclosed she farther added i was the first person who had ever made that impression on her mind i own i felt a tender concern and resolved within myself to wait on her and by honestly confessing who i was kill or cure her hopes of me for ever  in obedience to the ladys command i waited on her and found her with two more much of her own age who were her confidents and entrusted to contrive a method to bring this business to an end by a private marriage when i went into the room i made a general bow to all and was for seating myself nearest the door but was soon luggd out of my chair by a young madcap of fashion and to both the ladys confusion and mine aukwardly seated by her  we were exactly in the condition of lord hardy and lady charlotte in the funeral and i sat with as much fear in my countenance as if i had stole her watch from her side she on her part often attempted to speak but had such a tremor on her voice she ended only in broken sentences it is true i have undergone the dreadful apprehensions of a bombbailiff but i should have thought one at that time a seasonable relief and without repining have gone with him  the beforementioned madcap after putting us more out of countenance by bursting into a violent fit of laughing took the other by the sleeve and withdrew as she thought to give me a favorable opportunity of paying my addresses but she was deceived for when we were alone i was ten thousand times in worse plight than before and what added to my confusion was seeing the poor soul dissolve into tears which she endeavored to conceal  this gave me freedom of speech by a gentle enquiry into the cause and by tenderly trying to sooth her into a calm i unhappily increased rather than assuaged the dreadful conflict of love and shame which labored in her bosom  with much difficulty i mustered up courage sufficient to open a discourse by which i began to make a discovery of my name and family which struck the poor creature into astonishment but how much greater was her surprise when i positively assured her that i was actually the youngest daughter of mr cibber and not the person she conceived me she was absolutely struck speechless for some little time but when she regained the power of utterance entreated me not to urge a falsehood of that nature which she looked upon only as an evasion occasioned she supposed through a dislike of her person adding that her maid had plainly told her i was no stranger to her miserable fate as she was pleased to term it and indeed as i really thought it  i still insisted on the truth of my assertion and desired her to consider whether twas likely an indigent young fellow must not have thought it an unbounded happiness to possess at once so agreeable a lady and immense a fortune both which many a nobleman in this kingdom would have thought it worth while to take pains to atchieve  notwithstanding all my arguments she was hard to be brought into a belief of what i told her and conceived that i had taken a dislike to her from her too readily consenting to her servants making that declaration of her passion for me and for that reason she supposed i had but a light opinion of her i assured her of the contrary and that i was sorry for us both that providence had not ordained me to be the happy person she designed me that i was much obliged for the honor she conferred on me and sincerely grieved it was not in my power to make a suitable return  with many sighs and tears on her side we took a melancholy leave and in a few days the lady retired into the country where i have never heard from or of her since but hope she is made happy in some worthy husband that might deserve her  she was not the most beautiful i have beheld but quite the agreeable sung finely and played the harpsichord as well understood languages and was a woman of real good sense but she was poor thing an instance in regard to me that the wisest may sometimes err  on my return home the itineranttroop all assembled round me to hear what had passed between the lady and me  when we were to celebrate the nuptials  besides many other impertinent stupid questions some offering agreeable to their villainous dispositions as the marriage they supposed would be a secret to supply my place in the dark to conceal the fraud upon which i looked at them very sternly and with the contempt they deserved demanded to know what action of my life had been so very monstrous to excite them to think me capable of one so cruel and infamous  for the ladys sake whose name i would not for the universe have had banded about by the mouths of low scurrility i not only told them i had revealed to her who i was but made it no longer a secret in the town that in case it was spoke of it might be regarded as an impossibility or at worst a trumpdup tale by some ridiculous blockhead who was fond of hearing himself prate as there are indeed too many such of which in regard to my own character i have been often a melancholy proof and as it just now occurs to my memory will inform the reader  as misfortunes are ever the mortifying parents of each other so mine were teeming and each new day produced fresh sorrow but as if the very fiends of destruction were employed to perpetrate mine and that my real miseries were not sufficient to crush me with their weight a poor beggarly fellow who had been sometimes supernumerary in drury lane theater and partwriter forged a most villainous lie by saying i hired a very sine bay gelding and borrowed a pair of pistols to encounter my father upon eppingforest where i solemnly protest i dont know i ever saw my father in my life that i stopped the chariot presented a pistol to his breast and used such terms as i am ashamed to insert threatened to blow his brains out that moment if he did not deliver  upbraiding him for his cruelty in abandoning me to those distresses he knew i underwent when he had it so amply in his power to relieve me that since he would not use that power i would force him to a compliance and was directly going to discharge upon him but his tears prevented me and asking my pardon for his ill usage of me gave me his purse with threescore guineas and a promise to restore me to his family and love on which i thanked him and rode off  a likely story that my father and his servants were all so intimidated had it been true as not to have been able to withstand a single stout highwayman much more a female and his own daughter to however the story soon reached my ear which did not more enrage me on my own account than the impudent ridiculous picture the scoundrel had drawn of my father in this supposed horrid scene the recital threw me into such an agonizing rage i did not recover it for a month but the next evening i had the satisfaction of being designedly placed where this villain was to be and concealed behind a screen heard the lie retold from his own mouth  he had no sooner ended than i rushed from my covert and being armed with a thick oaken plant knocked him down without speaking a word to him and had i not been happily prevented should without the least remorse have killed him on the spot i had not breath enough to enquire into the cause of his barbarous falsehood but others who were less concerned than myself did it for me and the only reason he assigned for his saying it was he meant it as a joke which considerably added to the vehemence of my rage but i had the joy of seeing him well caned and obliged to ask my pardon on his knees  poor satisfaction for so manifest an injury  this is indeed the greatest and most notorious piece of cruelty that was ever forged against me but it is a privilege numbers have taken with me and i have generally found in some degree or other my cause revenged though by myself unsought and it is more than morally possible i may live to see the tears of penitence flow from the eyes of a yet remaining enemy to whose barbarity i am not the only victim in the family but    come what come may patience and time run through the roughest day if the person i mean was herself guiltless of errors she might stand in some rank of praise for her assiduity in searching out the faults of others as it might be reasonably supposed the innocent could never wish to be the author of ill to their fellow creatures and those especially nearly allied in blood we have all realities of folly to sufficient to raise a blush in thinking minds without the barbarous imposition of imaginary ones which i and others in the family have been cruelly branded with i shall only give a hint to the lady which i hope she will prudently observe  the faults of others we with ease discern but our own frailties are the last we learn i shall now give a full account of i think one of the most tragical occurrences of my life which but last week happened to me the reader may remember in the first number of my narrative i made a public confession of my faults and pleased with the fond imagination of being restored to my fathers favor flattered myself ere this treatise could be ended to ease the hearts of every humane breast with an account of a reconciliation  but how fruitless was my attempt i wrote and have thought it necessary in justification of my own character to print the letter i sent my father who forgetful of that tender name and the gentle ties of nature returned it me in a blank sure that might have been filled up with blessing and pardon the only boon i hoped for wished or expected can i then be blamed for saying with the expiring romeo    fathers have flinty hearts no tears will move em  children must be wretched this shocking circumstance has since confined me to my bed and has been cruelly aggravated by the terrible reflection of being empowered to say with charles in the fops fortune i am sorry that i have lost a father  i beg pardon for this intrusion on the readers patience in offering to their consideration the following letter  to colley cibber esquire at his house in berklysquare honored sir saturday mar        i doubt not but you are sensible i last saturday published the first number of a narrative of my life in which i made a proper concession in regard to those unhappy miscarriages which have for many years justly deprived me of a fathers fondness as i am conscious of my errors i thought i could not be too public in suing for your blessing and pardon and only blush to think my youthful follies should draw so strong a compunction on my mind in the meridian of my days which i might have so easily avoided  be assured sir i am perfectly convinced i was more than much to blame and that the hours of anguish i have felt have bitterly repaid me for the commission of every indiscretion which was the unhappy motive of being so many years estranged from that happiness i now as in duty bound most earnestly implore  i shall with your permission sir send again to know if i may be admitted to throw myself at your feet and with sincere and filial transport endeavor to convince you that i am  honored sir your truly penitent and dutiful daughter charlotte charke   when i sent as is specified in the letter for an answer i engaged a young lady whose tender compassion was easily moved to be the obliging messenger she returned with friendly expedition and delivered me my own epistle enclosed in a blank from my father by the alteration of my countenance she too soon perceived the ill success of her negotiation and bore a part in my distress  i found myself so dreadfully disconcerted i grew impatient to leave my friend that i might not intrude too far on her humanity which i saw was sensibly affected with my disappointment a disappointment indeed to be denied that from mortal man which heaven is well pleased to bestow when addressed with sincerity and penitence even for capital offenses  the prodigal according to holy writ was joyfully received by the offended father nay mercy has even extended itself at the place of execution to notorious malefactors but as i have not been guilty of those enormities incidental to the forementioned characters permit me gentle reader to demand what i have done so hateful so very grievous to his soul so much beyond the reach of pardon that nothing but my life could make atonement which i can bring witness was a hazard i was immediately thrown into  the shock of receiving my own letter did not excite a sudden gust of unwarrantable passion but preyed upon my heart with the slow and eating fire of distraction and despair till it ended in a fever which now remains upon my spirits and which i fear i shall find a difficult task to overcome  the late mr lillos character of thorowgod in his tragedy of barnwell sets a beautiful example of forgiveness where he reasonably reflects upon the frailties of mankind in a speech apart from the afflicted and repenting youth  when we have offended heaven it requires no more and shall man who needs himself to be forgiven be harder to appease  then turning to the boy confirms his humanity by saying if my pardon or my love be of moment to your peace look up secure of both  how happy would that last sentence have made me as the want of it has absolutely given me more inexpressible anguish than all the accumulated sorrows i had known before being now arrived to an age of thinking and well weighing the consequences arising from the various occurences of life but this i fear will prove the heaviest and bitterest corrosive to my mind and the more i reflect on it find myself less able to support such an unkindness from that hand which i thought would have administered the gentle balm of pity  i am very certain my father is to be in part excused as he is too powerfully persuaded by his cruel monitor who neither does or ever will pay the least regard to any part of the family but herself and though within a year of threescore pursues her own interest to the detriment of others with the same artful vigilance that might be expected from a young sharper of twentyfour i am certain i have found it so and am too sure of its effects from the hour of my birth and my first fault was being my fathers last born even the little follies of prattling infancy were by this person construed in crimes before i had a more distinguishing sense than a kitten as i grew up i too soon perceived a rancourous disposition toward me attended with malice prepense to destroy that power i had in the hearts of both my parents where i was perhaps judged to sit too triumphant and maintained my seat of empire in my mothers to her latest moments and it is possible had she lived my enemy might not have carried this cruel point to prevent what i think i had a natural right to receive when i so earnestly implored it  one thing i must insert for her mortification that my conscience is quite serene and though she will not suffer my father to be in friendship with me i am perfectly assured that i have in regard to any offenses toward him made my peace with the power supreme which neither her falsehood or artful malice could deprive me of it is now my turn to forgive as being the injured person and to show her how much i choose to become her superior in mind i not only pardon but pity her though i fear she rather pursues the rules observed in the following lines  forgiveness to the injured does belong but they never pardon who have done the wrong that i have suffered much is too evidential and though i neither proposed or expected more than what my letter expresses i hope my fathers eyes for the sake of his family who are oppressed may be one day opened for my part i cease to think myself belonging to it and shall conclude this painful subject with an assurance to my brothers two daughters that i am sincerely pleased they are so happily provided for and hope they will have gratitude and prudence enough to preserve their grandsires blessing and never put it in the power of artful treachery to elbow them out of his favor as i have been and that most cruelly  i remember the last time i ever spoke with my father a triumvirate was framed to that end and i was sent for from the playhouse to put this base design in execution after being baited like a bull at a stake and perceiving they were resolved to carry their horrid point against me i grew enraged and obstinate and finding a growing indignation swelling in my bosom answered nothing to their purpose which incensed my father nor can i absolutely blame him for twas undoubtedly my duty to satisfy any demand he should think proper to make  but then again i considered that his judgment was sufficient to correct the errors of my mind without the insolent assistance of those whose wicked hearts were fraught with my ruin  my father having been worked up to a strong fit of impatience hastily quitted his house with a declaration not to return to it till i was gone this i am too well assured  was a joyful sound to cleopatra s ear i staid a few moments after him when she who was once my eldest sister was pleased to ask the rest of her colleagues if they had done with me who answering in the affirmative in a peremptory manner turned me out of doors  i was then married and had been so near four years therefore did not conceive that any one had a right to treat me like a child and could not easily brook being forced into a submission of that nature but the main design was to deprive me of a birthright  and they have done it for which in obedience to the laws divine i beseech heaven to forgive them and bring them to repentance ere it is too late  and let goneril take care she has found a brace of cordelias in the family which that they may ever continue is my heartiest wish and earnest prayer nor would i have the poor children think because they are made happy that i envy them the advantages they possess no so far from it i am rather delighted than displeased as it convinces me my father has yet some power over himself and though deaf to me has listened to the tender call of mercy by a seasonable protection of their youth and innocence  i apprehend i shall be called in question for my inability in conveying ideas of the passions which most tenderly affect the heart by so often having recourse to abler pens than my own by my frequent quotations but in answer to that i must beg to be excused and also justified as mine and others griefs were more strongly painted by those authors i have made bold with than was in the power of my weak capacity i thought there was greater judgment in such references than in vainly attempting to blunder out my distress and possibly by that means tire the reader in the perusal  as i have finished my tragical narration i shall return to the town where i was honored with the young ladys regard our departure from thence happened soon after and kings queens lords and commons were all tossed up in an undistinguished bundle from that place and like sarrons itinerants escorted to another in a cart  as my unlucky stars were ever employed in working on the anvil of misfortune i unknowingly took a lodging in a bailiffs house though not as clodio did who had three writs against him but i was not absolutely certain how long it might be ere so terrible a catastrophe might be the case being then but ten miles from london and every hour of my life liable to be seen by some airtaking tradesman to whom twas twenty to one i might be indebted  under such a circumstance as this to be sure i passed my time mighty pleasingly but that i might be delivered of the anxiety and constant fears that attended me i persuaded our manager who was under the same unfortunate circumstance there was to my certain knowledge a writ issued out against him with which he was soon alarmed and in order to elude the hunters suddenly took away his company by night  i own this was a base trick to deprive the town of the infinite pleasure they must have received from the incomparable representations of our sonorous collection who if noise could plead any claim to merit they were undoubtedly the greatest proficients of the age i have often wondered that these bawling heroes do not as tenderly compassionate their brains as the retailers of flounders in london streets by an application of their hand to one ear to preserve the drum by that necessary caution  however away we went and to the great surprise of the inhabitants of the next place we adventured to about six oclock on a sunday morning we made our entry and besieged the town but as our commander was one of a most intrepid assurance he soon framed some political excuses for the unseasonableness both of the hour and day the landsord who happened luckily for us to be an indolent goodnatured man seeing so large a company and such boxes full of nothing come into his house easily dispensed with the oddity of our arrival and called out lustily for his maid and daughter to set on the great pot for the buttock of beef and to make a fine fire to roast the loin of veal he also ordered the ostler to help up with the boxes which i own were weighty but i believe the chief of the burden consisted of scabbardless rusty swords and departed mopsticks transmigrated into tragedy truncheons  for the first week we lived like those imaginary sons of kings we frequently represented but at length we played a night or two and no money coming upon enquiry what was for dinner the good host with an altered countenance signified he thought twould be better for us to find our own provision and apprehending twould not do he advised us to make one good house to pay him and march off upon which one whose appetite was extremely keen discovered a sudden paleness another enraged at the disappointment and feeling the same demands from nature though not equally passive in his disposition thundered out a volley of oaths with the addition of terrible threats to leave the house which the landlord would have been well pleased had he put in force and with a calm contempt signified as much  as i had a child to support as well as my unfortunate self i thought it highly proper to become a friendly mediator between these two persons and very judiciously introduced myself into farther credit by endeavoring to palliate the matter but the insensible puppy paying more regard to his offended honor than his craving appetite scolded himself out of the house and my daughter and i were continued by my prudently preserving the gentleman instead of launching into the barbarous enormities of the billingsgate hero  business continuing very shocking i really was ashamed to presume any longer on the partial regard paid to me by the injured man and at last proposed his using his interest to put off as many tickets as he possibly could in order to make up the several deficiencies of the company this proposition was kindly accepted and he soon dispersed a sufficient number of tickets to defray all charges with many acknowledgements to me for the hint and that i might not run the hazard of losing the reputation i had gained i set off the day after well knowing that a second misfortune of this nature would not have so happy an end  with a solitary shilling i went to london and took a lodging in about two hours afterward at a private house in little turnstile holborn but being soon enquired after by another manager set out from london for dartford about three oclock in the afternoon on foot in a dreadful shower of rain and reached the town by eight in the evening  i played that night for it is losing their charter to begin before nine or ten but my pumps being thin and the rain extreme heavy i contracted such a hoarseness i was the day following turned off with half a crown and rendered incapable an excellent demonstration of the humanity of those lowlived wretches who have no farther regard to the persons they employ but while they are immediately serving em and look upon players like packhorses though they live by em  when i got to london i had on account of my hoarseness no view of getting my bread as twas impossible to hear me speak without a close application of an ear to my mouth i was then reduced to the necessity of pledging from day to day either my own or childs clothes for our support and we were stripped to even but a bare change to keep us decently clean by the time i began to recover my voice  as soon as i was capable of speaking to be heard i took a second owllight opportunity to seek for business and happily succeeded in my endeavor and as from evil often unexpected good arises so did it then to me i went to play a part in gravellane where i met with a woman who told me she had scenes and clothes in limbo for two guineas and if i could propose any means for their redemption she would make me manager of her company if i thought fit to set out with her i assured her so far from raising two guineas i really did not know where to levy as many pence but in the night contemplating on my hapless fate i recollected a friend that i believed would on trial oblige me with that sum  to strengthen my cause i wrote a letter as from a spunginghouse and sent one of the performers who had extremely the air of a bombbailiff to represent that character my friend moved at my supposed distress directly granted my suit the goods were redeemed and the next morning we set sail with a few hands for gravesend  for about a month we got one week with another a guinea each person from thence we proceeded to harwich where we met with equal success for three weeks more but unfortunately the manageresss husband who was no member of the company was under sentence of transportation in newgate and she being frequently obliged to pay her devoirs to her departing spouse in the dismal castle of distress we broke up and i returned to london  my projecting brain was forced again to set itself to work to find fresh means of subsistence but for some time its labors were ineffectual till even the last thread of invention was worn out at last i resolved to pay circular visits to my goodnatured friends who redeemed me from the jaws of destruction when under confinement in jacksonsalley i thought the best excuse i could make for becoming so importunate was to fix it on a point of gratitude in taking the earliest opportunity my circumstances would admit of to return my sincerest thanks for so infinite an obligation and after having starved all day by the friendly assistance of the night i adventured and was by each person in my several visits kindly received and constantly sent home with a means to subsist for sometimes a day or two which as my circumstances stood was no small comfort to one who proceeded in paralytick order upon every excursion  among the distressful evening patroles i made i one evening paid my brother a visit who kindly compassionated my sorrow and clapping half a crown in my hand earnestly enjoined me to dine next day with him at a friends house who he knew had a natural tendency to acts of humanity and conceived would in a genteel manner be serviceable to me his goodnatured design had the desired effect and in less than three days i was by my brothers friend introduced to l  d a  a who wanted a gentleman being newly come from i  d and nice in regard to the person he intended for that office one wellbred and who could speak french were two necessary articles upon which mention was made of me and an open declaration who i really was with a piteous account of my misfortunes which his lordship very tenderly considered and received me upon the recommendation of my brothers friend  the day following i entered into my new office which made me the superior domestic in the family i had my own table with a bottle of wine and any single dish i chose for myself extra of what came from my lords and a guinea paid me every wednesday morning that being the day of the week on which i entered into his lordships service  at this time my lord kept in the house with him a fille de joye though no great beauty yet infinitely agreeable a native of ireland remarkably genteel and finely shaped and a sensible woman whose understanding was embellished by a fund of good nature  when there was any extraordinary company i had the favor of the ladys at my table but when there was no company at all his lordship permitted me to make a third person at his and very goodnaturedly obliged me to throw off the restraint of behavior incidental to the servant and assume that of the humble friend and cheerful companion many agreeable evenings i passed in this manner and when bedtime approached i took leave and went home to my own lodgings attending the next morning at nine my appointed hour  i marched every day through the streets with ease and security having his lordships protection and proud to cock my hat in the face of the best of the bailiffs and shake hands with them into the bargain in this state of tranquillity i remained for about five weeks when as the devil would have it there came two supercilious coxcombs who wanting discourse and humanity hearing that i was his lordships gentleman made me their unhappy theme and took the liberty to arraign his understanding for entertaining one of an improper sex in a post of that sort his lordships argument was for a considerable time supported by the strength of his pity for an unfortunate wretch who had never given him the least offense but the pragmatical blockheads teized him at last into a resolution of discharging me the next day and i was once again reduced to my scenes of sorrow and desolation  i must do justice to the peer to confess he did not send me away empty handed but so small a pittance as he was pleased to bestow was little more than a momentary support for myself and child when my small stock was exhausted i was most terribly puzzled for a recruit  friendship began to cool shame encompassed me that where i had the smallest hope of redress remaining i had not courage sufficient to make an attack in short life became a burden to me and i began to think it no sin not only to wish but even desire to die when poverty throws us beyond the reach of pity i can compare our beings to nothing so adaptly as the comfortless array of tattered garments in a frosty morning  but providence who has ever been my friend and kind director as i was in one of my fits of despondency suddenly gave a check to that error of my mind and wrought in me a resolution of making a bold push which had but two chances either for my happiness or destruction  which is as follows  i took a neat lodging in a street facing redlyonsquare and wrote a letter to mr beard intimating to him the sorrowful plight i was in and in a quarter of an hour after my request was most obligingly complied with by that worthy gentleman whose bounty enabled me to set forward to newgatemarket and bought a considerable quantity of pork at the best hand which i converted into sausages and with my daughter set out laden with each a burden as weighty as we could well bear which not having been used to luggages of that nature we found extremely troublesome but necessitas non habeat leges  we were bound to that or starve  thank heaven our loads were like aesops when he chose to carry the bread which was the weightiest burden to the astonishment of his fellowtravellers not considering that his wisdom preferred it because he was sure it would lighten as it went so did ours for as i went only where i was known i soon disposed among my friends of my whole cargo and was happy in the thought that the utmost excesses of my misfortunes had no worse effect on me than an industrious and honest inclination to get a small livelihood without shame or reproach though the archdutchess of our family who would not have relieved me with a halfpenny roll or a draught of smallbeer imputed this to me as a crime  i suppose she was possessed with the same dignified sentiments mrs peachum is endowed with and thought the honor of their family was concerned if so she knew the way to have prevented the disgrace and in a humane justifiable manner have preserved her own from that taint of cruelty i doubt she will never overcome  my being in breeches was alleged to me as a very great error but the original motive proceeded from a particular cause and i rather choose to undergo the worst imputation that can be laid on me on that account than unravel the secret which is an appendix to one i am bound as i before hinted by all the vows of truth and honor everlastingly to conceal  for some time i subsisted as a higgler with tolerable success and instead of being despised by those who had served me in my utmost exigencies i was rather applauded some were tender enough to mingle their pitying tears with their approbation of my endeavoring at an honest livelihood as i did not prostitute my person or use any other indirect means for support that might have brought me to contempt and disgrace  misfortunes to which all are liable are too often the parents of forgetfulness and disregard in those we have in happier times obliged too sure i found it so for i could name many persons who are still in being that i have both clothed and fed who have since met with success but when strong necessity reduced me to an attempt of using their friendship scarce afforded me a civil answer which closed in an absolute denial and consequently the sting of disappointment on such occasions struck the deeper to my heart though none so poignant as the rebuffs i met with from those who ought in regard to themselves to have prevented my being under such universal obligations but instead of acting agreeable to the needful sentiments of compassion and sorrowful regret for the sufferings of a near relation where a villainous odium could not be thrown a ridiculous one was sure to be cast even on the innocent actions of my life  upon being met with a hare in my hand carried by order to the peer i had then lately lived with this single creature was enumerated into a long pole of rabbits and twas affirmed as a truth that i made it my daily practice to cry them about the streets  this falsehood was succeeded by another that of my selling fish an article i never thought of dealing in but notwithstanding the wicked forger of this story positively declared that i was selling some flounders one day and seeing my father stepped most audaciously up to him and slapt one of the largest i had full in his face who that has common senses could be so credulous to receive the least impression from so inconsistent a tale or that if it had been true if i had escaped my fathers rage the mob would not with strictest justice have prevented my surviving such an unparalled villainy one moment  i always thought myself unaccountable enough in reality to excite the various passions of grief and anger pity or contempt without unnecessary additional falsehoods to aggravate my misdeeds i own i was obliged till seized with a fever to trudge from one acquaintance to another with pork and poultry but never had the honor of being a travellingfishmonger nor the villainy of being guilty of that infamous crime i was inhumanly charged with  when i was brought so low by my illness as to be disempowered to carry on my business myself i was forced to depend upon the infant industry of my poor child whose strength was not able to bear an equal share of fatigue so that i consequently was obliged to suffer a considerable deficiency by the neglect of my customers and though i could scarce afford myself the least indulgence in regard to my illness i found though in a trifling degree it largely incroached upon my slender finances so that i was reduced to my last three pounds of pork nicely prepared for sausages and left it on the table covered up as i was upon recovery i took it in my head a little fresh air would not be amiss and set forth into redlyonfields but on my return oh disastrous chance a hungry cur had most savagely entered my apartment confounded my cookery and most inconsiderately devoured my remaining stock and from that hour a bankruptcy ensued the certificate of which was signed by the woefulness of my countenance at the horrid view  the child and i gaped and stard at each other and with a despondency in our faces very natural on so deplorable an occasion we sat down and silently conceived that starving must be the sad event of this shocking accident having at that time neither meat money nor friends my weeks lodging was up the next day and i was very sure of a constant visit from my careful landlord but how to answer him was a puzzling debate between me and myself and i was very well assured could only be answered but by an affirmative in that point  after having sighed away my senses for my departed pork i began to consider that sorrow would not retrieve my loss or pay my landlord and without really knowing where to go or to whom i should apply i walked out till i should either meet an acquaintance or be inspired with some thought that might happily draw off the scene of distress i was then immersed in  luckily i met with an old gentlewoman whom i had not seen many years and who knew me when i was a child she perceiving sadness in my aspect enquired into the cause of that and my being in mens clothes which as far as i thought proper i informed her when we parted she slipped five shillings into my hand on which i thankfully took leave went home with a cheerful heart paid my lodging off next morning and quitted it  the next vexation that arose was how to get another for the child was too young to be sent on such an errand and i did not dare to make my appearance too openly however that grief was soon solved by the good nature of a young woman who gave a friendly invitation to us both and though not in the highest affluence supported myself and child for some time without any view or hopes of a return which has since established a lasting friendship between us as i received more humanity from her indigence than i could obtain even a glimpse of from those whose fortunes i had a more ample right to expect a relief from  i had not been many days with my friend before i relapsed my fever increasing to that degree my death was hourly expected and being deprived of my senses was left without means of help in this unhappy situation and had it not been for the extensive goodness of the person beforementioned my child must have either begged her bread or perished for the want of it  when i was capable of giving a rational answer she was my first care and i had in the midst of this extremity the pleasing relief of being informed my friends humanity had protected her from that distress i apprehended she must have otherwise suffered from the severity of my illness i was incapable of writing and therefore sent a verbal message by my good friend to my lord a  a who sent me a piece of gold and expressed a tender concern for my misfortunes and violent indisposition  as soon as i was able to crawl i went to pay my duty there and was again relieved through his bounty and might have returned to my place till something else had fallen out but that his lordship was obliged to go suddenly out of england which as i had a child was not suitable to either him or me  mr yeatess new wells being open and he having occasion for a singer in the serious part of an entertainment called jupiter and alomena i was sent for to be his mercury and by the time that was ready for exhibition i began to be tolerably recovered and a miracle indeed it was that i overcame a dreadful spottedfever without the help of advice nor had i any remedy applied except an emetick prescribed and sent me by my sister marples who was the only relation i had that took any notice of me  as i have no power of making her amends equal to my inclinations i can only entreat the favor of my acquaintance in general and those whom i have not the pleasure of knowing whenever it is convenient and agreeable for them to use a neat wellaccommodated house of entertainment they will fix a lasting obligation on me by going to here is which she opened last thursday the  0th instant in fullwoodsrent near graysinn where they will be certain of flesh fish and poultry dressed in an elegant manner at reasonable rates good wines etc and a politeness of behavior agreeable to the gentlewoman whose hard struggles through seas of undeserved misfortunes will i hope be a claim to that regard i am certain she deserves and will wherever she finds it most gratefully acknowledge  for some few months i was employed as beforementioned till bartholomew fair and as i thought twould be more advantageous to me to be there obtained leave of mr yeates to quit the wells for the four days and returned to him at the expiration thereof  the rumor of my being in business having spread itself among my creditors i was obliged to decamp being too well assured my small revenue which was but just sufficient to buy bread and chief would not protect me from a jail or satisfy their demands had not my necessities been pressing my service would not have been purchased at so cheap a rate but thought i must have been everlastingly condemned had i through pride been so repugnant to the laws of nature reason and maternal love as to have rejected with insolent scorn this scanty maintenance when i was conscious i had not sixpence in the world to purchase a loaf i therefore found it highly necessary to set apart the remembrance of what i had been i then was what i had made myself and consequently obliged to submit to every inconvenience of life my misfortunes could possibly involve me in  the amount of all i owed in the world did not arise to five and twenty pounds but i was as much perplexed for that sum as if it had been as many thousands in order to secure my person and defend myself from want i joined with a man who was a master of legerdemain but on my entering on an agreement with him he commenced manager and we tragedized in a place called petticoatlane near whitechapel i then taking on me that darling name of brown which was a very great help to my concealment and indeed the only advantage i ever received from it or those who have a better claim to it  but to my purpose i soon grew tired of leading such a life of fear and resolved to make trial of the friendship of my late uncle and wrote a melancholy epistle to him earnestly imploring his assistance for the sake of his deceased sister my dear mother to give me as much money as would be necessary to set me up in a public house i told him i would not put it upon the foot of borrowing as twas ten millions to one whether he might ever be repaid and in case of failure of a promise of that nature i knew i must of course be subject to his displeasure therefore fairly desired him to make it a gift if he thought my circumstances worthy his consideration which to do him justice indeed he did and ordered me to take a house directly that he might be assured of the sincerity of my intention  i obeyed his commands the next day and as i have been in a hurry from the hour of my birth precipitately took the first house where i saw a bill and which unfortunately for me was in drury lane that had been most irregularly and indecently kept by the last incumbent who was a celebrated dealer in murdered reputations wholesale and retale  this i through a natural inadvertency never considered nor what ill consequences must reasonably attend so imprudent a choice of my situation choice i cannot properly call it for i really did not give myself time to make one twas sufficient that i had a house and rattled away as fast as a pair of horses could gallop to inform my uncle how charmingly i was fixed  he according to his word gave me a banknote directly and a sum of money in gold besides providence was merciful enough to afford me a decent quantity of patience to stay long enough to thank him in that respectful manner which duty obliged me to and his bounty truly deserved but i remember as soon as i got into the coach i began to think the happiness i then enjoyed to be too great and too substantial to be true  having been so long the slave of misery and child of sorrow it appeared to me like a dream and i was in nell jobsons condition on that score who never wished from a surmise of exactly the same kind ever to wake again i had not patience to go home but stopped at a tavern to count my money and read my note as often i believe as there were shillings in every separate pound till of my conscience i had enumerated every shilling in imagination to a pound  the first thing i did was to hasten to my principal creditor who by the bye had issued out a writ against me a month before but was through a fruitless search obliged to drop his action though really the man was so goodnatured as to hope i would consider the expenses he had been at on that account and that not finding me had put him to a supernumerary charge which i was undoubtedly strangely obliged to him for as a proof how much i thought myself so i begged the favor of him to give me a receipt for the money and when he could prevail upon a reprieved criminal to pay for the erecting of tyburn tree because he was not hanged there he should be perfectly assured of all costs he had been at in tenderly endeavoring to confine me in a prison  the chap i believe was glad of his money but cursedly vexed he had not staid till the report of an amendment of my circumstances which would have run me to an equal expense of the debt through the unnecessary charges the dear man would have put me to  when i had given this cerberus a sop i flew with impatient joy to all the brokers in town to buy my household furniture gave the asking price for every thing i bought and in less than three hours my house was thoughtlessly furnished with many things i had no real occasion for  i dare answer for it that some delicate old maid or prudent wife will bless themselves at this strange recital and with vacant uplifted eyes thank heaven i was no relation of theirs that they did not wonder such an inconsiderate wretch should be so unhappy when poor devils the same fate would have drawn equal encumbrances upon their gravities and perhaps without the advantage of spirits to surmount them as i have done for which  thank heaven alone  i hope as i have been often deservedly and sometimes undeservedly the motive of laughter in others i may be allowed to come in for my share and beg leave to inform the town that i can as heartily join with them in that respect as they could wish and more than they may probably expect  but this affair was attended with such numerous unaccountable proceedings i cannot blame any body for being thrown into a speechless astonishment as for example  as soon as i had cluttered an undistinguishable parcel of goods into my house which was after the hour of five in the evening i resolved to lie there that night beds were to be put up and every thing ranged in proper order by the time these matters were accomplished i was forced to forgo my resolution of sleeping there that night it being near six in the morning before i could advance to my repository where when i was imagined to take my rest my impatient and elevated spirits would not let me continue till the reasonable hour of rising throughout the neighborhood but through excess of joy i arose and contrived fresh means to unlade me of part of the treasure my uncle had possessed me of  i dare venture to affirm i had not been two days and a half in the house before twas opened and as is customary on such occasions gave away an infinity of ham beef and veal to every soul who came and called for a quart of beer or a single glass of brandy the faces of many of them i never saw before or since but was from the number of people that came the first day fully convinced that i should carry on a roaring trade though i afterward found i had successfully run myself out very near seven pounds in less than twentyfour hours to acquire nothing at all  the next great help i had toward getting an estate was the happiness of the unprofitable custom of several strollingactors who were unfortunately out of business and though they had no money i thought it incumbent on me as they styled themselves comedians to credit them till they got something to do not considering when that happened they might in all probability be many score miles out of my reach which indeed proved to be the very case  another expedient toward the making my fortune was letting three several rooms to as many different persons but in principle were all alike and conjunctive in the perpetration of my destruction which i shall define in few words one of the party has very narrowly escaped hanging more from dint of mercy than desert another reduced to common beggary and lying on bulks being so notorious a pilferer as to be refused admittance into the most abject tottering tenement in or about st giless and the third is transported for life  very unfortunately for me the water was laid into my cellar and i having no design of doing injuries suspected none but found too late that my tap had run faster than the watercock and my beer carried in pails to the two pair of stairs and garrets which too frequently set the house in an uproar as the gentry at poor pilgarlicks expense got themselves excessive drunk and constantly quarreled insomuch that they began at length to impeach one another by distant hints and winks assuring me that they believed twould be very proper to observe mrs suchaone when she went about the house what she carried up stairs presently the person of whom i was warned would come to me and give the same caution of the other and in half an hours time the husbands of these people would come and do the same by each other  these hints made me begin to be a little peery and resolved to look round the house to see if any thing was missing in short they had taken violent fancies to my very candlesticks and saucepans my pewter terribly shrunk and my coals daily diminished from the same opportunity they had in conveying off my beer and as i kept an eatinghouse also there was very often a hue and cry after an imaginary dog that had run away with three parts of a joint of meat  as my stock was thus daily and cruelly impaired consequently my profits were not able to make up for the horrid deficiency and as i did not dare to make a second attempt on my uncle i prudently resolved to throw up my house before i run myself into such inconveniences by endeavoring to keep it i might not easily have overcome so suddenly disrobed my own apartments of their furniture and quitted em on which the thieving crew were then obliged to disperse being deprived of all future hopes of making me thus inhumanly their prey  i must beg pardon of the reader for omitting a circumstance that happened about a year before i was thus intendedly settled by my uncle being as i frequently was in great distress i went to see a person who knew me from my childhood and though not in a capacity of serving me beyond their good wishes and advice did their utmost to convince me as far as that extended how much they had it at heart to serve me and upon enquiry into what means i proposed for a subsistence i gave the good woman to understand there was nothing which did not exceed the bounds of honesty that i should think unworthy of my undertaking that i had been so innurd to hardships of the mind i should think those of the body rather a kind relief if they would afford but daily bread for my poor child and self  the woman herself knew who i was but her husband was an entire stranger to whom she introduced me as a young gentleman of a decayed fortune and after apoligizing for half an hour proposed to her spouse to get me the waiters place which was just vacant at one mrs dorrs who formerly kept the kingshead at marylabonne  i thankfully accepted the offer and went the next morning to wait on the gentlewoman introduced by my friends husband and neither he or mrs dorr in the least suspected who i was she was pleased to tell me she liked me on my first appearance but was fearful as she understood i was well born and bred that her service would be too hard for me perceiving me to wear a melancholy aspect tenderly admonished me to seek out for some less robust employment as she conjectured that i should naturally lay to heart the impertinence i must frequently be liable to from the lower class of people who when in their cups pay no regard either to humanity or good manners  i began to be half afraid her concern would make her talk me from my purpose and not knowing which way to dispose of myself begged her not to be under the least apprehensions of my receiving any shock on that account that notwithstanding i was not born to servitude since misfortunes had reduced me to it i thought it a degree of happiness that a mistaken pride had not foolishly possessed me with a contempt of getting an honest livelihood and choosing rather to perish by haughty penury than prudently endeavor to forget what i had been and patiently submit to the severities of fortune which at that time was not in my power to amend  to be short the gentlewoman bore so large a share in my affliction she manifested her concern by a hearty shower of tears and as she found i was anxious for a provision with her we agreed and the next day i went to my place but when i informed her i had a daughter about ten years of age she was doubly amazed and the more so to hear a young fellow speak so feelingly of a child  she asked me if my wife was living i told her no that she died in childbed of that girl whom she insisted should be brought to see her next day and entertained the poor thing in a very genteel manner and greatly compassionated here is and her supposed fathers unhappiness  i was the first waiter that was ever permitted to sit at table with her but she was pleased to compliment me that she thought my behavior gave me a claim to that respect and that twas with the utmost pain she obliged herself to call me any thing but sir  to her great surprise she found me quite a handy creature and being light and nimble tripd up and down stairs with that alacrity of spirit and agility of body that is natural to those gentlemen of the order of the taptub though as hob says we sold all sorts of wine and punch etc  at length sunday came and i began to shake in my shoes for fear of a discovery well knowing our house to be one of very great resort as i found it for i waited that day upon twenty different companies there being no other appearance of a male except myself throughout the house exclusive of the customers and to my violent astonishment not one soul among em all that knew me  another recommendation of me to my good mistress was my being able to converse with the foreigners who frequented her ordinary every sabbath  day and to whom she was unable to talk but by signs which i observing prevented her future trouble by signifying in the french tongue i perfectly well understood it this was a universal joy round the table which was encompassed by german perukemakers and french tailors not one of whom could utter one single syllable of english  as soon as mrs dorr heard me speak french away she run with her plate in her hand and laughing left the room to go down and eat an english dinner having as she afterward told me been obliged once a week to dine pantomimically for neither she or her company were able to converse by any other means  when i came down with the dishes i thought the poor soul would have eat me up and sent as many thankful prayers to heaven as would have furnished a saint for a twelvemonth in behalf of the man who brought me to her her over joy of her deliverance from her foreign companions wrought a generous effect on her mind which i had a convincing proof of by her presenting me with half a crown and made many encomiums i thought impossible for me ever in such a sphere of life to be capable of deserving  in regard to my child i begged not to be obliged to lie in the house but constantly came to my time in a morning and staid till about ten or eleven at night and have often wondered i have escaped without wounds or blows from the gentlemen of the pad who are numerous and frequent in their evening patroles through them fields and my march extended as far as longacre by which means i was obliged to pass through the thickest of em but heaven everlastingly be praised i never had any encounter with em and used to jog along with the air of a raw unthinking pennyless prentice which i suppose rendered me not worthy their observation  in the week days business though good was not so very brisk as on sundays so that when i had any leisure hours i employed em in working in the garden which i was then capable of doing with some small judgment but that and every thing else created fresh surprise in my mistress who behaved to me as if i had been rather her son than her servant  one day as i was setting some windsor beans the maid came to me and told me she had a very great secret to unfold but that i must promise never to tell that she had discovered it as i had no extraordinary opinion of her understanding or her honesty i was not over anxious to hear this mighty secret lest it should draw me into some praemunire but she insisted upon disclosing it assuring me twas something that might turn to my advantage if i would make a proper use of it this last assertion raised in me a little curiosity and i began to grow more attentive to her discourse which ended in assuring me to her certain knowledge i might marry her mistresss kinswoman if i would pay my addresses and that she should like me for a master extremely advising me to it by all means  i asked her what grounds she had for such a supposition to which she answered she had reasons sufficient for what she had said and i was the greatest fool in the world if i did not follow her advice i positively assured her i would not for i would not put it in the power of a motherinlaw to use my child ill and that i had so much regard as i pretended to the memory of her mother i resolved never to enter into matrimony a second time  whatever was the motive i am entirely ignorant of but this insensible mortal had told the young woman that i intended to make love to her which had i really been a man would have never entered in my imagination for she had no one qualification to recommend her to the regard of any thing beyond a porter or a hackneycoachman whether she was angry at what i said to the wench in regard to my resolution against marrying or whether it was a forgery of the maids of and to us both i cannot positively say but a strangeness ensued and i began to grow sick of my place and stayed but a few days after  in the interim somebody happened to come who hinted that i was a woman upon which madam to my great surprise attacked me with insolently presuming to say she was in love with me which i assured her i never had the least conception of no truly i believe said she i should hardly be namourd with one of my own sect upon which i burst into a laugh and took the liberty to ask her if she understood what she said this threw the offended fair into an absolute rage and our controversy lasted for some time but in the end i brought in vindication of my own innocence the maid to disgrace who had uncalled for trumped up so ridiculous a story  mrs dorr still remained incredulous in regard to my being a female and though she afterward paid me a visit with my worthy friend at my house in drury lane who brought my unsuccessful letter back from my father she was not to be convinced i happening that day to be in the malehabit on account of playing a part for a poor man and obliged to find my own clothes  she told me she wished she had known me better when i lived with her she would on no terms have parted with her man charles as she had been informed i was capable of being master of the ceremonies in managing and conducting the musical gardens for she had a very fine spot of ground calculated entirely for that purpose and would have trusted the care of it to my government but twas then too late which i am sorry for on the gentlewomans account who might have been by such a scheme preserved in her house from which through ill usage in a short time after she was drove out and reduced to very great extremities even by those most nearly related to her but i find it is become a fashionable vice to proclaim war against those we ought to be most tender of and the surest and only way to find a friend is to make a contract with the greatest stranger  after i left my unfortunate mistress i was obliged to look out for acting jobbs and luckily one soon presented itself one mr scudamore a sergeant of dragoons who had been some years before a player on his return from battle where our royal youthful hero had immortalized his fame in his fathers and countrys defense took the recruiting officer for his benefit played capt plume and engaged me for sylvia and also to write him a prologue on the occasion which he spoke himself  i dont pretend to have any extraordinary talents in regard to poetry in verse or indeed in prose but as it speaks the warmth of my heart toward the royal family whose illustrious line may heaven to latest posterity extend i will venture to insert what i wrote and hope though i am but an insignificant and humble subject every true briton will let my zeal plead an excuse for my deficiency in the attempting so noble and glorious a theme  from toils and dangers of a furious war where groans and death successive wound the air where the fair ocean or the crystal flood are died with purple streams of flowing blood i am once more thank providence restored though narrowly escaped the bullet and the sword amidst the sharpest terrors i have stood and smiled at tumults for my countrys good but where is the briton dare at fate repine when our great william s foremost of the line with steady courage dauntless he appears and owns a spirit far beyond his years with wisdom as with justice he spurred on to save this nation from a papal throne may gracious heaven the youthful hero give long smiling years of happiness to live and britons with united voices sing the noblest praises of their glorious king who to defend his country and its rights parted from him in whom his soul delights then with a grateful joy britannia own none but great george should fill the british throne though my poetry may be lame my design was good and as i am sensible it has no other merit than that shall say no more about it but that it was well received at the haymarket theater and i was handsomely rewarded by the person whose benefit it was wrote for  i must acknowledge the story of my situation at marylabonne is not properly ranged in my history according to the time it happened but as it made up the number of my oddities i have made bold to hawl it in as i think it is as remarkable as any other part of my life beforementioned  after i left my house which my uncles kind pail of milk enabled me to go into though soon after kicked down by his ridiculous marriage i went to the haymarket where my brother revived the tragedy of romeo and juliet and would have succeeded by other pieces he got up in particular by the run of cymbeline but was obliged to desist by virtue of an order from the l  d c  n i imagine partly occasioned by a jealousy of his having a likelihood of a great run of the lastmentioned play and which would of course been detrimental in some measure to the other houses  while we were permitted to go on my brother and i lived together where i passed my time both cheerfully and agreeably and it is no compliment to own the pleasure and advantage i reaped from his daily conversation was the foundation of that pleasing content i enjoyed whilst he was a resident at that theater  but as my happiness was never of very long duration my brother was invited on the suppression to covent garden theater and i was left to make the best i could with the remaining few who had a mind to try their fortunes with me and indeed to do my brother justice he promised me i should have the advantage of his daughter jennys performance as i was left suddenly and in distress  as she was a promising actress in a tender soft light i designed to set her forth to the best advantage and there was nothing wanting but her fathers presence to carry every thing on as orderly as before though his going was the only means that rendered it practicable for me to keep the house open for when he was removed  we did our safety to our weakness owe as grass escapes the scythe by being low yet i was determined had my niece remained with me to have been as industrious as possible both for her sake and my own and as i had appeared in some first characters was resolved to endeavor at filling up all those with which she was most concerned as our figures were agreeably matched i being but of the bulk and stature of most of our modern fine gentlemen and miss jenny who was a growing girl of sixteen exactly tallyd with me in that respect  when my brother governed the theater he got up the conscious lovers which we played four nights successively to full houses in which i appeared in the character of young bevil the child in indiana and her father in tom  as i had been not only endured but really well received in such a part during my brothers reign i could not conceive that his throwing up the reins of empire could lessen me in the esteem of the goodnatured part of the town who had been kind enough to afford me perhaps more than my share of applause but twas otherwise thought by some of my dear friends who prevailed on my father to send his positive commands to his son to withdraw his daughter on pain of his displeasure  i was then reviving an old play called pope joan in which i afterward exhibited that character to a dreadful house which i partly attribute to being deprived of my niece who was to have performed the part of angeline when the bills were up and her name not there all those who were fond of seeing and encouraging her growing genius sent back their tickets with various excuses for their nonattendance and twas debated in the family twould be a scandal for her to play with such a wretch as i was twas letting her down to be seen with me as her father was not there to keep her in countenance  i should be glad to know what mighty degree of theatrical dignity the harmless child was possessed of preferable to myself as a player i was when even under age received in capital characters at drury lane where i made my first appearance and in such parts my riper judgment makes me tremble to think i had only with an uncultivated genius courage enough to undertake  in regard to her birth i presume i was upon a par with her as her grandfathers daughter and her fathers sister the only disgrace was my being under misfortunes the very worst reason for my familys contributing to a perpetration of that which nature and humanity should rather have excited em to have helped me to overcome  in respect to an improvement in her business i was thought worthy of instructing her in the part of indiana which another of her aunts can testify the truth of who came with her into my own apartment several days for that purpose  i suppose the reason of an application to me on that account proceeded from my brothers hurry of business which prevented his doing it there could be no other motive for i am certain there was no mortal in the universe more capable of leaving the proper impressions of any character whatever on the mind of those who were endowed with the necessary talents to receive em  i dont mention this with the least tincture of disregard to the dear child for i am well assured she would have been glad to have rendered her abilities useful to her unfortunate aunt and i dare say unless her principles are perverted which for her own sake i hope are not she still retains in her heart a secret pity for my sufferings though to avow it might perhaps hazard the forfeiture of that blessing heaven has been pleased to make her grandfather the happy instrument of bestowing which i would not for the universe be the miserable motive of therefore shall not only excuse but even advise her to think as some other of her relations do that i am a stranger to her blood  it is plain the rancourous hate to me had spread itself to so monstrous a degree that they rather chose to make themselves i may say in this case ridiculously cruel than not load me with an additional weight of misery the low malice of taking away the child as i had her fathers consent i put upon the level of schoolboys understandings who quarrel with their playfellow from a jealousy of ones having more plumbs in their cake than to others  had she staid it might have been useful to both as time experience and observation had furnished me with some little knowledge of the stage i would to the extent of my power have rendered it serviceable to my niece and i am confident she would on her part by her performance have been greatly beneficial to me  as i am foolishly flattered from the opinion of others into a belief of the power of cultivating raw and unexperienced geniuses i design very shortly to endeavor to instruct those persons who conceive themselves capable of dramatic performances and propose to make the stage their livelihood  some very good friends of mine have lately advised me to this scheme which i shall put in force as soon as i can with convenience and will on reasonable terms three times a week pay constant attendance from ten in the morning till eight in the evening at my intended academy where ladies and gentlemen shall be to the utmost of my power instructed both in the art of speaking and acting that though they should never come upon the stage they shall be enabled even to read a play more pleasingly to the auditor by a few necessary hints than it is likely they ever would without em  if i should qualify those who may design to offer themselves to the theaters in such a manner as may render them worthy the managers acceptance i shall receive a double satisfaction both in regard to my pupils advancement and rendering my academical nursery useful to the masters of both houses by a cultivation of a good genius which has been often thrown away like a piece of fertile ground overrun with weeds through neglect or want of good husbandry  when this narrative is ended i shall advertise to that purpose in the daily papers and must now beg leave to apologize for swelling out my numbers with my own history which was originally designed to have consisted only of a short sketch of my strange life but on the appearance of the first number i was enjoined nay twas insisted on by many that if twas possible for me to enlarge the account of myself to a pocket volume i should do it  in compliance with so obliging a request which i receive as a compliment from my good friends i have deferred the publication of mr dumonts history till this is finished which will be now in two saturdays more and i hope that though the town is not so well acquainted with the abovementioned gentleman they will be equally curious to become so with his story as they have been with mine and i dare promise that twill afford them such a satisfaction in the reading they will not repent their encouragement of the author  as morality is the principal foundation of the work i venture to recommend it to the perusal of the youthful of both sexes as each will find a character worthy their observation and i hope will not blush to make their example  i intended to have made writing my support if possible when i was dispossessed of the happiness of getting my bread with my brother but my cares increasing i had not time to settle myself properly or collect my mind for such an undertaking therefore was obliged to decline it and trust to providence from time to time for what i could get by occasionally acting  though i was unfortunate in the main yet once in five or six weeks something or other generally happened to relieve my afflicted spirits and i met with two cards running that turned up trumps which led me into an imaginary hope that the measure of my griefs were so completely filled that twas they probable would contain no more  the first of these unexpected joys arose from the tender compassion of his late grace the duke of m  gue who having been told of my hapless fortune gave so tender an attention to it it encouraged the person who related it to advise me to write to his grace  i instantly did and without the least trouble of obtaining admission for the messenger or letter was relieved with several guineas enclosed in a line of soft commiseration under the bounteous hand of my noble benefactor the honor of which notwithstanding my poverty afforded me a more elevated transport than the liberal donation and naturally claims a real sorrow for his loss attended with a grateful and sincere respect for his memory to the last hour of my existence to which he has a right from hundreds more besides myself having been a universal physician and restorer of peace and comfort to afflicted minds variously oppressed  this comfort was in about two days succeeded by an engagement with the late unfortunate mr russel who was then a man of vogue and in universal favor with every person of quality and distinction this gentleman had an italian opera at mr hickfords great room in brewersstreet exhibited by puppets which i understanding the management of and the language they sung was hired after the first nights performance at a guinea per diem to move his punch in particular  this affair was carried on by subscription in as grand a manner as possible ten of the best hands in town completed his band of music and several of the female figures were ornamented with real diamonds lent for that purpose by several persons of the first quality  during the short run i was in respect of my salary which was paid me every day of performance extremely happy but so unfortunately circumstanced i was forced to set out between five and six oclock in the morning traversing st jamesspark till mr hickfords maid arose and for security staid there all day mingling with the thickest of the crowd at night to get home  the benefaction of my noble friend and mr russels salary enabled me to new rig myself and child that is upon the score of redemption but this flowing tide of joy soon came to an ebb both with my friend and self for in a few months after i heard the unpleasing tidings of his being under confinement in newgate for debt  compassion led me to visit him there though i had not power to deliver him from that dismal abode but in my wishes though afterward had he taken my advice he might possibly have proved me a friend by endeavoring to extricate him in bringing on the haymarket stage a humourous piece of his own composing which i believe is still in the hands of some of his creditors where it is of no use to the person who possesses it but as it has merit might be rendered so if properly disposed of  i offered this unhappy gentleman to provide performers with my own service inclusive and to take the entire management of it upon myself without fee or reward unless his nightly receipts empowered him to gratify me for my trouble which had he but been barely set free i should have thought myself amply rewarded in being partly the happy instrument  as to the money i told him i would have nothing to do with it that door and officekeepers should be of his own providing but that if i engaged the people they should be nightly paid according to the agreement i should make with them and for myself would if the thing succeeded leave it to his generosity to reward me as he thought proper which i make no doubt would have been done in the genteelest manner had the affair been brought to any issue  but this distressed gentleman was madly exasperated with the terrible and sudden revolution of his fortune and instead of receiving my offered friendship with that regard a reasonable person might have thought it deserved he rather seemed offended at the proposal which startled me at first but on our farther conversation i was convinced of his growing misfortune and too plainly perceived that he was not entirely in his senses on which i dropped the discourse and with a real concern left him that evening but returned to see him in about two days when instead of finding him in a more settled order he was absolutely changed from the man of sense to the drivling idiot nor was there the least consistency in one single syllable he uttered  i found myself too much shocked to lengthen my visit and more so when i gathered from him an account delivered with heartbreaking sighs and bitter sobs that a person he had entrusted to raise a contribution for him among the nobility had run away with the bounty intended for his relief and which would have more than effected it as there was upwards of an hundred pounds amassed for that purpose  this piteous narration was recounted to me afterward by a gentleman who was his intimate friend and had served him to the extent of his power through the whole scene of misery that ended him  in about a fortnight after my interview with him in newgate passing through i called to know how he did and was informed he was removed by a habeas to the fleet as it lay in my way i stopped there and enquired after him upon which i was desired to walk up two pair of stairs and in such a room i should find him  i expressed to the persons who directed me a great concern for him and they as naturally answered twas very kind and very good in me and desired me very civilly to walk up which accordingly i did and after having rambled into several peoples rooms through mistake i arrived at that where mr russels remains only were deposited for he was absolutely in a coffin which some friend had sent in respect to him  i conceive a description of my surprise on this account quite unnecessary but i really for some time was very near as motionless as the deceased person and in my heart very angry with the woman who sent me up to him without informing me he was dead  when i came down she very reasonably excused herself by reminding me that the tenor of our discourse consisted of nothing more than a tender concern on my side for the unhappy gentleman and she concluded that friendship and curiosity had brought me there to see his sad remains he having been dead two days and therefore she thought i knew it  i assured her i did not and farther told her i was pleased to see he had so handsome a shroud and coffin but she shocked me excessively by telling me he was to be removed out of the one and disrobed of the other to be put into one provided by the parish for twas a law when a debtor died without any effects or means to satisfy their creditors they must be so interred otherwise an indulgence of being buried by friends rendered the warden of the fleet liable to pay all the debts of the deceased if it could be proved that he had suffered it  it is a hard case notwithstanding that humanity should not extend itself even to the dead without hurting those whose principles of christianity excite them to it  thus ended the life of one who was universally admired and had been for some time as much the fashion in families as their clothes but alas misfortunes are too apt to wear out friendship and he was cast off in two or three months with as much contempt as an old coat made in olivers time  though it was represented to his acquaintance how cruelly he had been used by the person he entrusted to solicit them in his behalf it was scarce believed even by those who not long before had laid him nearest to their hearts this is one very remarkable instance of the uncertainty of friendship and the instability of peoples minds who are only fashionably kind  i was in hopes after mr russels death to have got his figures upon reasonable terms and have taken them into the country as they were very small and rather an encumbrance to one who did not understand how to make use of them but when i made an enquiry into the price of them his landlord valued them at threescore guineas and the money down  that last assertion soon ended my project as the reader may conceive so i engaged myself at mayfair and lived on my profits there till the ensuing bartholomew from thence i went into the country where i remained till last christmas for very near nine years  my first expedition was to sunninghill where i had the joy of playing capt plume and blending it with the part of sylvia the lady who should have represented it as i suppose was so strongly affected with the death of her brother owen she was not able to speak a plain word or indeed to keep her ground  this gave me an early touch of the quality of strollers and but twas rather convenient than otherwise to keep out of town would soon have brought me back again but alas this was trifling to what i afterward beheld i have seen an emperor as drunk as a lord according to the old phrase and a lord as elegant as a ticketporter a queen with one ruffle on and lord townly without shoes or at least but an apology for them  this last circumstance reminds me of the queen in the spanish friar once playing without stockings though i must do the person justice to say it proceeded from an unprecedented instance of even a superfluity of good nature which was excited by her majestys observing torrismond to have a dirty pair of yarn stockings with above twenty holes in sight and as she thought her legs not so much exposed to view kindly strips them of a fine pair of cotton and lends them to the hero  i played lorenzo and having no business with the queen had a mind to observe how she acquitted herself in her part being a person i had known many years and was really anxious for her success i found she spoke sensibly but to my great surprise observed her to stoop extremely forward on which i concluded she was seized with a sudden fit of the cholick but she satisfied me of the contrary and on her next appearance i remarked that she sunk down very much on that side i stood between the scenes on which i then conjectured her to be troubled with a sciatick pain in her side and made a second enquiry but was answered in the negative on that score upon which i desired to know the reason of her bending forward and sideling so  she told me twas a trick she had got it is a very new one then says i for i never saw you do so before but i began to suspect something was the matter and resolved to find it out presently the royal dame was obliged to descend from the stage into the dressing room and made a discovery by the tossing up of her hoop of a pair of naked legs  i own i was both angry and pleased i was concerned to find my friends humanity had extended so far as to render herself ridiculous besides the hazard she run of catching cold but must confess i never saw so strong a proof of good nature especially among travellingtragedizers for to speak truth of them they have but a small share of that principle subsisting amongst them  if a person is but a lame hand he or she is despised for that and it is a common rule when benefits come on to say among their different parties which they all herd in mr and mrs suchaone to be sure will have a great house meaning perhaps the manager and his wife who very often are the worst in the whole set and it is very seldom that one couple shall both prove good but the merit of the one is forced to make up for the deficiency of the other  the least glimmering or shade of acting in man or woman is a sure motive of envy in the rest and if their malice cannot persuade the townspeople into a dislike of their performance they will cruelly endeavor to taint their characters so that i think going a strolling is engaging in a little dirty kind of war in which i have been obliged to fight so many battles i have resolutely determined to throw down my commission and to say truth i am not only sick but heartily ashamed of it as i have had nine years experience of its being a very contemptible life rendered so through the impudent and ignorant behavior of the generality of those who pursue it and i think it would be more reputable to earn a groat a day in cinderfisting at tottenhamcourt than to be concerned with them  it is a pity that so many who have good trades should idly quit them to become despicable actors which renders them useless to themselves and very often nusances to others those who were bred up in the profession have the best right to make it their calling but their rights are horribly invaded by barbers prentices tailors and journeymen weavers all which bear such strong marks of their professions that i have seen richard the third murder henry the sixth with a shuttle and orestes jump off the shopboard to address hermione  another set of gentry who have crept into their community are servants out of place and i very lately saw the gallant marcian as well rubbed and curried as ever the actor did a horse in his masters stable this worthy wight having the happiness to write an exceeding fine hand and living formerly with a gentleman in one of the inns of court wisely palms himself upon strangers for a lawyer when his real and original profession was that of a groom  how such sort of people without the help of at least a little education can presume to pick the pockets of an audience is to me astonishing though they have the vanity and assurance to say they please but it is only themselves and were the spirits of departed poets to see their works mangled and butchered as i have too often been a melancholy witness of they would certainly kick the depredating heroes out of this world into the next  i have had the mortification of hearing the characters of hamlet varanes othello and many more capitals rent in pieces by a figure no higher than two sixpenny loaves and a dissonancy of voice which conveyed to me a strong idea of a cat in labor all which conjoined with an injudicious utterance made up a complete tragical emetick for a person of the smallest degree of judgment and yet these wretches very impudently style themselves players a name let me tell them when properly applied is an honor to an understanding for none can deserve that title who labor under the want of a very considerable share of sense  in the course of my travels i went to a town called cirencester in gloucestershire when an odd affair happened which i beg leave to relate as follows  i happened to be taken violently ill with a nervous fever and lowness of spirits that continued upon me for upwards of three years before i was able to get the better of it when i came to the beforementioned town i was so near death that my dissolution was every moment expected but after my illness came to a crisis i very slowly amended and as soon as i could creep about the house was advised by my apothecary to ride out if i was able to sit a horse  as soon as i found myself capable of it i followed his advice and had one lent me for myself and another for my friend the goodnatured gentlewoman who commiserated poor torrismonds misfortune and to whom i am most infinitely and sincerely obliged for her tender care in nursing me in three years illness without repining at her fatigue which was uninterrupted and naturally fixes on me a lasting grateful sense of the favor  the person who furnished me with the horses was a reverendlooking elder about sixty years of age with a beautiful curling head of hair and florid complexion that bespoke at once both admiration and respect his temper was agreeable to his aspect extremely pleasing and his company entertaining with which he often obliged me while my friend attended her business of a playnight  after riding out two or three days the old gentleman perceiving me to grow better asked me if i liked the horse which i told him i greatly approved as it was an easy and willing creature he said he was at my service i very thankfully accepted the favor and before many witnesses the present was made as also the other for my friends use which belonged to a young fellow he called his nephew  he told me that if i thought proper to quit the stage which he imagined in my weak condition was better avoided than pursued he would take me to his estate situate at a place called brill in oxfordshire and if i and my friend would stay with him as long as either he or we should live i should be superintendant over his affairs abroad and my friend should have the entire management of the family at home which he said consisted only of himself and nephew and about seven or eight servants that were employed in husbandry he being as he informed us a wealthy grazier  twas soon resolved that we should give warning to mr linnett who was manager of the company to leave him at the expiration of a month this was accordingly done and as a confirmation of his intention in taking us with him gave mrs brown an oldfashioned gold necklace with a large locket of the same metal which altogether i dare believe by the weight could not be worth less than twenty pounds there being several rows and the beads not small  i desired the old gentleman not to insist on her wearing it till she went home it being an oldfashioned thing i knew as an actress people would stare to see her so equipped though it was a valuable gift but more proper to ornament the neck of a countryhouswife than a tragedyqueen i therefore desired him to keep it till we were settled and pretended for fear of affronting him that she might run a hazard in losing it of a playnight he thought my care was just but insisted on her laying it up herself and i luckily insisted he should have it in his possession till we went away  the thoughts of being so well settled and provided for both our lives was in fact greatly conducive toward the restoration of my health and our friendship with the old gentleman daily increased as also with hi nephew whom he frequently sent into different parts of the country after cattle and with the utmost ceremony begged the favor of borrowing my horse till he could send an order to brill for another  the least i could do was to comply with the request of so valuable a friend and away went the nephew who at length happened to stay three or four days longer than was intended which gave his uncle a great deal of seeming uneasiness that to all appearance was worked into a downright passion with threats of cutting him of with a shilling for rambling about when he had sent him upon business of weighty concern  as i observed him to be very much out of humor i thought it would be but a friendly part to endeavor to appease the uncle for the nephews sake which the old man took very kindly of me and bid me want for nothing that might be necessary toward the recovery of my health assuring me when jemmy came home fifty pounds should be at my service to put to what use i pleased  so generous an offer unasked made me conceive that this man was dropped from heaven to be my kind deliverer from all the sorrows of life but before mr james came back there came a sudden order from the magistrate of the town to insist on the old mans leaving it at a moments warning on pain of being sent to gloucester jail if he refused to obey  in the interim home comes the nephew who received the same charge but they huddled up their affairs in a strange manner and ventured to stay three days longer though very little seen  this put my friend and self into a terrible consternation for still we could neither of us arrive at the real truth of the affair till mr linnett who had heard it from the townspeople and with a frighted aspect and real concern came almost breathless to let me know that my pretended friends were positively gamblers and housebreakers that if we listened any longer to them we should be sure not only to be deceived but in all human probability be made innocent sufferers for their guilt  mr linnetts concern was expressed with all the symptoms of strong truth which startled us both with fear and wonder and made us heedfully attentive to all he related  we immediately gave up all right and claim to our horses and my friend did the same to her gold necklace all which were stolen goods and had she been seen with it about her neck by the right owner it is possible the poor soul might have been provided with one of a rougher kind and each of us disgracefully exalted for being harmlessly credulous  i afterward found out their scheme was to have got our boxes into their possession which as both the old and young man were frequent in their visits to play at cards with me by way of amusement in my illness they had observed were well furnished with very good linen and my friend had just received a present of clothes from her relations had they got these into their possession they would have proved a tolerable booty  but our better stars shone forth that time and though we lost only an imaginary fortune we secured our lives and the little all we were both worth upon the face of the earth  in about a year after the old man danggled into the next world upon a gibbet either at salisbury or oxford which i cannot positively affirm but that was his deserved fate and the young one died raving mad in a prison in or near london  i thought proper to insert this story not only as it is a particular occurrence of my life but to warn the undesigning part of the world of heedlessly falling into company of strangers and being taken in by them  this man by his discourse and appearance would have deceived a much wiser person than myself as he really wore the venerable marks of bearded sanctity and wisdom but his principles were as opposite to that description as an angel to a demon having been upwards of forty years a noted gambler pickpocket and sometimes highwayman  i often lift up my heart to heaven with grateful sense of its providential care of us in preventing the dismal scenes of misery to which we should have been exposed had this wicked man perpetrated his design and we might have been made innocent sacrifices to save his horrid life through villainy imposed and branded with the guilt of crimes we never should have thought of committing i therefore hope our fortunate escape will set others on their guard who may be liable to an accident of the same kind  when we left cirencester we made a short progress to chippenham an agreeably situated market town in the road to bath where i met with many friends as indeed i generally had the good fortune to do go where i would in particular mr thomas stroud who keeps the angel inn and mr lodge master of the white heart were conjunctive in forwarding my interest and i think without compliment to either they are remarkable for keeping two of the most elegant and best accommodated houses throughout great britain a thing seldom known that one little market town should produce two such agreeable repositories for travelers and i am very glad they meet with the success they deservedly enjoy  from thence we took a short trip to a little village called corsham four miles distant from chippenham where we had little else to do than to walk out and furnish our keen stomachs with fresh air and come home and gape at each other for want of a dinner  bad business is a sure means to produce ill blood in a company for as they grow hungry they naturally grow peevish and fall out with one another without considering that each bears a proportionable part of the distress the manager excepted who never fails in all companies to eat as bombardinian says  though all mankind should starve this happening to be my case i was refused a small but needful supply which occasioned a disagreeable argument and i wrote to mr richard elrington to inform him agreeable to an invitation i received some months before upon his sending me three guineas my friend daughter and self would immediately join him  accordingly as soon as the letter could reach him which was as far as tiverton in devonshire he dispatched a messenger on horseback with two guineas and an half and a letter full of joy with the hopes of my speedy arrival which was no small advantage as the company then stood as it consisted but of few hands and one of the women sounfortunate that she was dead drunk in bed the first night of their opening when she should have been soberly employed in the performance of lucy in the beggars opera mrs elrington who was perfect in all the characters in that piece artfully contrived to double the parts of polly and lucy which i suppose she must do as sosia represents himself and alcmena by the assistance of a lanthorn  so dismal a disappointment naturally offended the audience and their nightly receipts fell very short of their expectations from this disastrous chance which reduced them to the necessity of playing three times a week at a little market town called columpton within five miles of tiverton or at least attempting so to do that they might have a probability of eating once in six days and a terrible hazard that was for the columpton audience never amounted to more than twenty shillings at the fullest house which when the charges were paid and the players like so many hungry magpies had gaped for their profits might very possibly afford what they call a stocksupper which was generally ended in a quarrel by way of desert  that barbarous word merit has been the occasion of more fewds in those communities than the whole court of chancery can ever be able to decide or his majestys army overcome i own it surprises me that a single syllable which in itself is truly valuable should be so constant an invader of the peace of those who if i may judge by their abuse of it on the stage are perfect strangers to its derivation and not in the least relative to them who nightly claim an unlawful title to it  however i shall though i find fault with the multitude do justice to those who deserve it mrs elrington has the first demand on my judgment in that case among the travellingcomedians she has a great deal of spirit and speaks sensibly her genius is calculated for lowcomedy entirely and the smallness of her person which rendered her unsuccessful in her attempt on covent garden theater is no detriment on a country stage as the difference of them is upon an equality with a mousetrap and a mountain  when we arrived at tiverton they were gone for a night or two to their more rural retreat and i having a man and two horses to discharge was really with our keeping upon the road for near seventy miles under some sort of confusion and concern for want of the half guinea which was short of our demands  after some private consultation with my friend and daughter who were both trembling with terrible apprehensions of some immunities arising from this misfortune i took heart and resolved to set the best face upon a bad matter as mr elrington was not present to receive us i enquired what houses he used in town and was to my great joy soon informed that there was one in particular the mistress of which was a great friend to him on which i undauntedly set forward and very luckily found the person to be the young mans mother who brought us the money into wiltshire  in mr elringtons name i borrowed the half guinea which to our general joy was immediately granted and the man and horses discharged though a second thought came into my head that as the company was absent and hearing but a terrible account of their progress there i began to be doubtful whether their faith was strong enough to keep so many poor pennyless devils from starving till their return which i was told would not be so soon as they proposed there being a play bespoke to which they were promised a great house  this gave me fresh spirits and i thought it quite proper to engage our guide to walk the other five miles and efcort us to the players the splendor of a shilling soon prevailed and we mounted directly my friend single and my daughter and self double upon a strapping beast which was of a proper size to have been ranked in the number of dragoons  i was not a little pleased notwithstanding their ill success to find mr elringtons credit so good and his character so justifiable that even in his absence a stranger could be entrusted on his account  when we came to our journeys end mrs elrington who was the first person we saw received us with inexpressible joy and gave us a second relation of the miserable state of their affairs but as lady grace says of lady townly she rallied her misfortunes with such vivacity that had not her wit been too strong for my resolution i should have certainly gone back again by the return of the next post  as we were just entering the town a goodlooking farmer met us by our appearance guessed what we were and asked if we were not comedians we answered in the affirmative on which he desired if we had any pity for ourselves to turn back and rapping out a thundering oath affirmed to us that we were going to starve which threw my friend who is not the best horsewoman in the world into such a fright she dropped her bridle from which advantage her hungry steed fairly run her into a hedge and dropped her into the ditch  when she recovered her surprise she was for going directly back without seeing the company but when i assured her the money would not hold out she was prevailed on to go forward  at length the bespoke play was to be enacted which was the beaux stratagem but such an audience i dare believe was never heard of before or since in the first row of the pit sat a range of drunken butchers some of whom soon entertained us with the inharmonious music of their nostrils behind them were seated as i suppose their unsizable conforts who seemed to enjoy the same state of happiness their dear spouses were possessed of but having more vivacity than the males laughed and talked louder than the players  mrs elrington who played mrs sullen having such a lovely prospect before her and being willing to divert me from any design she might suspect of my not staying in the drunken scene between archer and scrub the former of which i played unexpectedly paid us a visit and taking the tankard out of scrubs hand drank mr archers health and to our better acquaintance the least i could do was to return the ladys compliment by drinking to here is after which she ordered my brother scrub to call the butler in with his fiddle and insisted on my dancing a minuet with her while poor scrub comforted himself with the remains of the tankard  this absurdity led us into several more for we both took a wildgoose chase through all the dramatic authors we could recollect taking particular care not to let any single speech bear in the answer the least affinity and while i was making love from jaffier she tenderly approved my passion with the soliloquy of cato  in this incoherent manner we finished the nights entertainment mrs sullen instead of archer concluding the play with jane shores tag at the end of the first act of that tragedy to the universal satisfaction of that part of the audience who were awake and were the reeling conductors of those who only dreamt of what they should have seen  for some time we dragged on our unsuccessful lives without the least prospect of an alteration that i at last gave up all hopes and expectations of ever enjoying a happy moment this according to the usual custom made each wear an eye of coldness and dislike till after a long series of plagues madam fortune in one of her frolicks was pleased to pay us a small visit and during her short stay we began to be better reconciled till the trumpery slut tucked up her tail of good nature and reduced us to our primitive nothing and sour looks with disaffected minds resumed their empire in the breast of every malecontent  in process of time we went to cirencester where i informed the reader i had been once before with mr linnetts company but mr elrington without any previous notice took a place in the stagecoach for london and the very night we came to the town left his wife to manage the company in which i gave my assistance to take off from her as much of the trouble as i possibly could  mr linnett wanting at that time some auxiliaries sent one of his company to engage me and my friend to join him at bath where he then was in a newerected theater in kingsmeadstreet but my honor was so deeply engaged in mrs elringtons behalf i would on no terms leave her as she was pleased to compliment me with being her right hand and at that time not knowing the real design of her husbands going to london looked on her as an injured person which doubly engaged my attachment to her interest though i afterward found it was a concerted scheme to six himself if possible with mr rich which proved almost abortive he staying but one season from what cause i shall not pretend to judge and then went to bath  his wife soon followed and i was left with six more besides myself one scene and a curtain with some of the worst of their wardrobe made up the paraphanalia of the stage of which i was prime minister and though under as many disadvantages as a set of miserable mortals could patiently endure from the before  mentioned reasons and an inexhaustible fund of poverty through the general bank of the whole company even to a necessity of borrowing money to pay the carriage to the next town we all went into a joint resolution to be industrious and got a sufficiency to support ourselves and pay the way not only to that town but were decently set down in the next with just enough to dismiss our waggoner with reputation and were then left to proceed upon fresh credit and contract the strongest friendship we could with each believing landlord  as it is very common for even the lowest in understanding to fancy themselves judges of acting i must give a curious specimen of it in a person who saw me for want of a better attempt the part of hamlet i was lucky enough to gain a place in his opinion and he was pleased to express his approbation of me by saying no man could possibly do it better because i so frequently broke out in fresh places  but i had a much larger share of his esteem after playing scrub which was indeed infinitely more suitable to his taste and left so strong an impression on his mind that a night or two after when i was tragedizing in the part of pyrrhus in the distressed mother he stepped from the pit and desired me to oblige some of his friends as well as himself by mixing a few of scrubs speeches in the play assuring me it would give much more satisfaction to the spectators though they liked me very well he said in the part i was acting  this revived in my memory the curious performance at columpton and rendered me for the rest of the night infinitely a properer person for scrub than pyrrhus as the strangeness of his fancy had such an effect on my risible faculties i thought i should never close my mouth again in the least degree of seriosity  i imagine it is such judges as these that occasion that indolent stupefaction in most travellingplayers and as the lower sort are foolish enough to be pleased with buffoonery in comedy and bellowing in tragedy without a regard to sense or nature in either it makes them forgetful that there are among the country gentlemen and ladies very great judges whose good nature overlooks those monstrous absurdities but at the same time if they took more pains to please them they would certainly find them more frequent in their visitation  it is for want of this consideration in the players which makes the favors they receive from families of distinction rather a charity than a genteel reward for at best their weak endeavors to entertain a set of sensible people who would be glad to encourage the least spark of decency and industry  i know this will be a kind of choakpear to many of the travellinggentry but i am under no sort of uneasiness on that account and think if they make a proper use of the hint they will have more reason to thank me than be offended at it  after traversing through some few towns more mr and mrs elrington rejoined their company and we went to a place called minchinhampton in gloucestershire where we were kindly invited by the lord of the manor a worthy gentleman who was not only a great benefactor in respect of the business but our guardian and protector from the terrible consequences that might have ensued from a most shocking cruelty designed for the company in general but luckily for the rest only put in force against me and two more which was by dint of an information encouraged by a c  r at s  d who meanly supported a decayed relation by procuring him a special warrant to apprehend all persons within the limits of the act of parliament  this ignorant blockhead carried his authority beyond a legal power for almost every traveller that went through the town was examined by him before they could pass freely and often made sacrifices to his interest  my landlord who was a worthy wight likewise was privy to the plot laid against us though affected infinite concern when we were taken and violently exclaimed against his partner in this contrivance though they were equally concerned the scheme was not intended to do justice in regard to the laws but extort money from the players and the worthy gentlemen who they were well assured would stand by us in a case of extremity as indeed he did they carried on their process so far as to take me and two of our men to jail where we were not under the least apprehensions of going from what my landlord had told us  we waited in court expecting every moment to be called upon and dismissed with a slight reprimand but alas twas not so easy as we thought for we were beckoned to the other end of the court and told that the keeper of the prison insisted on our going into the jail only for a show and to say we had been under lock and key an honor i confess i was not in the least ambitious of and for the show i thought twould never be over for it lasted from nine in the morning till the same hour of the next and had it not been for the generous and friendly assistance of the beforementioned gentleman i believe it would have held out till doomsday with me for another day must have absoluteiy put an end to my life  rage and indignation having wrought such an effect on my mind it threw me almost into a frenzy and arose to such a height that i very cordially desired my fellow prisoners would give me leave to cut their throats with a faithful promise to do the same by my own in case we were doomed to remain there after the trial  they were sorry to see me they said so very much disconcerted but could by no means comply with my request endeavoring as much as possible to keep up my spirits and bring me into temper  several times my landlord came backwards and forwards giving us false hopes of our being every minute called upon the last visit he made i began to be quite outrageous and told him all i conceived of him uttering several bold truths not in the least to the advantage of his character  away he went grumbling and i never saw him till the next morning when he came to summons us to the hall the evening wore apace and the clock struck eight the dreadful signal for the gates to be locked up for the night  i offered half a guinea apiece for beds but was denied them and if i had not fortunately been acquainted with the turnkey who was a very goodnatured fellow we must have been turned into a place to lie upon the bare ground and have mixed among the felons whose chains were rattling all night long and made the most hideous noise i ever heard there being upwards of two hundred men and boys under the different sentences of death and transportation  their rags and misery gave me so shocking an idea i begged the man in pity to hang us all three rather than put us among such a dreadful crew the very stench of them would have been a sufficient remedy against any future ills that could have happened to me but those dreadful apprehensions were soon ended by the young fellow who was our wardour for the night making interest with a couple of shoemakers who were imprisoned in the womens condemndhole which till they came had not been occupied for a considerable time  these two persons were confined one for debt the other for having left his family with a design to impose his wife and children on the parish  extremely glad were we to be admitted into the dismal cell which though the walls and flooring were formed of flint at that time i was proud of entering as the men were neat and their bed which my companions only took part of entirely clean  the two gentlemen of the craft had the day we were brought in furnished themselves with each a skin for underleathers which being hollow one within the other i chose for my dormitory and having a pair of boots on and a great coat rolled into my leathern couch secure from every evil that might occur from such a place except a cold which i got occasioned by the dampness of my bedchamber  as we were not there for any crime but that committed by those who informed against us i had the good fortune to prevail on my friend the turnkey to permit me to send for candles and some good liquor to reward our kind hosts and preserve us from the dreadful apprehensions of getting each an ague in our petrified apartment  i continued for the most part of the night very low spirited and in very ill humor till i was roused by the drollery of one mr maxfield my fellowsufferer a goodnatured man and of an odd turn of humor who would not let me indulge my melancholy which he saw had strongly possessed me and insisted as he had often seen me exhibit captain macheath in a shamprison i should as i was then actually in the condemnedhold sing all the beadroll of songs in the last act that he might have the pleasure of saying i had once performed in character  i own i was not in a condition to be cheerful but the tender concern of those about me laid a kind of constraint on me to throw off my chagrin and comply with their request which when ended i fairly fell asleep for about an hour and dreamt of all the plagues that had tormented my spirits in the day  as soon as the dawn of day appeared i sat with impatient expectation of the turnkeys coming to let me into the fresh air and to do him justice he came an hour earlier on my account to let us all look into the yard which is formed into gravelwalks not unlike graysinn gardens though not kept up in that regular and nice order  but rough as it was i thought it comparable to the garden of eden and question much when the first pair beheld their paradise whether they were more transported at the view than i was when let out of my cell  after i had sauntered about for a quarter of an hour deeply immersed in thought down came the rattling crew whose hedious forms and dreadful aspects gave me an idea of such horrors which can only be supposed to center in hell itself each had his crime strongly imprinted on his visage without the least tincture of remorse or shame and instead of imploring for mercy impudently and blasphemously arraigned the judgment of the power divine in bringing them to the seat of justice  while i was surveying these miserable and dreadful objects i could not possibly refrain from tears to see so many of my fellow creatures entered volunteers in the service of that being which is hourly preying upon the weak and negligent part of mankind and as i too plainly saw both age and infancy plunged in total undistinguished ruin  about the hour of eight we received the pleasing news of our being ordered to appear in court at nine and the joy of being removed though but for a few moments from the sight of these unhappy wretches was superior to that i felt when delivered from the torturing apprehension i had some years before of ending my life by famine in the marshalsea  but then the dread of being remanded back to prison suddenly gave a damp to my transport but heaven be praised our kind benefactor sent in the night a special messenger to be ready in the sessions house with a large quantity of gold to protect us from any threatening danger  i had not been in the pen five minutes before i was called upon to receive a letter of comfort to myself and friends who though they assumed a gaiety the night before were heartily shocked at appearing at the bar among a set of criminals the least of whose crimes not one of them would have dared to have been guilty of though but in thought  however we had the pleasure to see the wise j  who for dint of interest to his kinsman committed us march out of court just before our cause came on which ended in a very few words our kind protector having laid our plan of safety so securely with his interest and power we were soon dismissed and can never i think be sufficiently grateful in our acknowledgements for so tender and generous a commiseration of our misfortune  twas a secret pleasure to us to know that the c  r was obliged to walk off having rendered himself so contemptible to the gentlemen on the bench by dabbling in such dirty work that he was not only heartily despised by them but stood a ridiculous chance if he had staid till our dismission of being hooted out of court and i believe if he were to live to the age of methuselah this great action of his life would not be forgot  it is no small comfort to me that some of the best gentlemen in and about that place have dropped his acquaintance on the account as they conceived a man of sense might have employed his time and thoughts more laudably than in giving countenance and encouragement to an action which was founded upon avarice not justice for i can be upon oath and bring many more to justify the truth of my assertion that they brought in a bill of different charges to the amount of near twelve pounds besides a quantity of guineas it cost the gentleman who stood our friend in the affair  i have often heard of peoples paying money to avoid a jail but we were so cruelly imposed on they made us pay half a guinea apiece for going into one and though we had but twelve postmiles to ride charged a guinea a head for conducting us to g  besides the expenses of our horses which they ought to have found us as we were afterward informed  power when invested in the hands of knaves or fools generally is the source of tyranny which has been too often experienced and had not our worthy friend stood firmly by us we must have innocently suffered for laboring to keep ourselves just above the fears of starving  as we were not guilty of any misdemeanor every body pitied our distress and heartily despised the author of it our friend who gave us partly an invitation as he was a person of great worth and power was highly exasperated and took it as a high indignity offered to himself after he had given us encouragement to presume to object against his entertaining his family which was a numerous one in an inoffensive manner and which as he reasonably urged kept many an idle person from lavishing their substance at alehouses equally destructive to their healths and the interest of their wives and children  on our return from g  the gentleman bespoke a play and removed us out of the little town hall into the great one which was his property and in despite of our adversaries supported us with a firm promise to protect us in case of a second invasion if it cost him half his estate but as they knew his power and resolution both invincible they never attempted to molest us afterward  our stay was but short after this unlucky stroke of fortune though it was a bad matter well ended thanks to the humanity of our generous friend we were heartily glad when we left the place and whenever i go to that or any other upon the same expedition i will give them leave to imprison me for every hour of life to come  the autumn following mr elrington and his spouse went again to bath and i was left as conductor to the company a second time just before they went a plot was laid to draw us into another dilemma at dursley but we were upon our guard and luckily escaped their persecution in order to get quite out of their reach we went into another county to a town called ross in herefordshire where we met with tolerable success and from thence proceeded to monmouth in wales which though a very large place we found it very difficult to get a bare livelihood  chepstow was our next station where i met with many friends particularly a widow lady to whom and her family in general i am under great obligations and shall ever with pride acknowledge  i had the honor and happiness of obtaining the friendship of another lady who lived within a quarter of a mile of chepstow and often favored me with friendly letters when i went to abergavenny at the end of which town i left mr elrington with a firm design at that time to quit all thoughts of playing  i immediately took a very handsome house with a large garden consisting of near three quarters of an acre of ground belonging to my friends papa a very worthy gentleman who had eminently distinguished himself in battle in the reigns of king william and queen anne but in the decline of life quitted the service and retired having a very considerable estate to which his daughter is sole heiress  perhaps the reader may think that the repeated rebuffs of fortune might have brought me to some degree of reflection which might have regulated the actions of my life but that i may not impose upon the opinions of the goodnatured part of the world who might charitably bestow a favorable thought on me in that point i must inform them that the aversion i had conceived for vagabondizing for such i shall ever esteem it and the good nature of my friends in chepstow put it strongly in my head to settle there to which end i determined to turn pastrycook and farmer and without a shilling in the universe or really a positive knowledge where to get one took horse from abergavenny to visit the young lady and hire the house  i must do her the justice to say she advised me to forgo my resolution and set before me all the inconveniences i afterward labored under but she found me so determined she dropped her argument and being of an obliging temper forwarded the repairing of the house that it might be ready at the appointed time for my reception  to be short i went to it but that the whole scene of my unaccountable farce might be complete i not only involved myself but the gentlewoman whom i have beforementioned that traveled with me in the same needless and unreasonable difficulties for which i think myself bound in honor to ask her pardon as i really was the author of many troubles from my inconsiderate folly which nothing but a sincere friendship and an uncommon easiness of temper could have inspired her either to have brooked or to have forgiven  as soon as i arrived at chepstow i began to consider that though i had got a house without either bed or chair to lie or sit on it would be highly proper to seek out a place of rest and that i might live as cheap as possible took a readyfurnished lodging for nights and wandered for a fortnight up and down my empty house till fortune came that road to drop some furniture into it  i own it i was secretly chagrind at my exploit but did not dare to make the least discovery of it to mrs brown who had very justifiable reasons to reproach me for an indiscretion she had prudently taken much pains to prevent  my first design was to set forth in pastry it is true i had an oven but not a single penny to purchase a faggot to light it and for the materials to make the pies they were equally uncomeatable but i took courage and went to inform the widow lady of my intention and entreat the favor of her custom  as she is without compliment a person of sense and discernment she very humourously asked me all the natural and necessary questions concerning the motive and means by which i was to settle myself as she well knew i had not a grain of the principal ingredient toward exciting me to such a resolution or the effecting it  i confess i was strangely puzzled to answer her and after several hums and haws told her i hoped fortune would favor my design as i only wanted to get an honest and decent living which was no small recommendation to her favor after having smiled at my rash undertaking she administered that kind of comfort i stood most in need of at that time  to baking we went and partly through pity and curiosity we took twenty shillings the first day i then began to triumph greatly at my success and thought it my turn to upbraid my friend for having reproached me for leaving the stage  i must not forget to insert a strong desire i had to go to the major on the strength of my success and hire a large field of grass and instead of a bed thought of purchasing a horse to carry goods to the neighboring markets but that i might not appear more conspicuously ridiculous than i had done mrs brown wisely dissuaded me from such a mad scheme and a few weeks convinced me i had no occasion for such a chargeable conveyance of my pastry for when every bodys curiosity was satisfied i found a terrible declension of business  however i met with unprecedented friendships especially from val  ne m  s esquire who lives at p  d a young gentleman of a fair character and fine estate his generosity enabled me to put the main part of my furniture into my house and as to linen and many necessary materials besides my good friend the young lady beforementioned supplied me with them  as i found one business fall off i resolved to set up another and went in one of my extraordinary hurries to buy a sow with pig but to my great disappointment after having kept it for near three months expecting it hourly to bring forth it proved to be an old barrow and i to make up the measure of my prudent management after having put myself to double the expense it cost me in the purchase was glad to sell it to a butcher for a shilling or two less than i gave for it  thus ended my notion of being a hogmerchant and i having a garden well stored with fruits of all sorts made the best i could of that till some villainous wretches in one nights time robbed me of as much as would have yielded near three guiness besides barbarously tearing up the trees by the roots and breaking the branches through fearful haste being well assured that the gentleman who owned them would have punished them to the utmost rigor of the law had they been discovered  one plague succeeding another i resolved to leave the place and try my fate in some other spot but behold we were run a little aground so that we were positively obliged to sell the best part of our furniture to make up some deficiencies and we were once more in a bedless condition  with the necessary utensils for the pastrycooks shop and the friendly assistance of some of our good friends we took leave and set out for a little place called pill a sort of harbor for ships five miles of this side of bristol the place itself is not unpleasant if it were inhabited with any other kind of people than the savages who infest it and are only in outward form distinguishable from beasts of prey to be short the villainies of these wretches are of so heinous and unlimitted a nature they render the place so unlike any other part of the habitable world that i can compare it only to the antichamber of that abode we are admonished to avoid in the next life by leading a good one here  a boy there of eight or ten years of age is as well versed in the most beastly discourse and the more dreadful sin of blasphemy and swearing as any drunken reprobate of thirty and he who drinks hardest and excels most in these terrible qualifications stands so most in his fathers favor  there are some few that dont belong to the boats that are reasonable creatures and i am amazed they can patiently bear to reside where there is such a numerous set of cannibals a name they very justly deserve for i believe there are some among them who would not scruple to make a meal of their fellow creatures  i have seen many a suffering wretch who has been wind bound sent away half naked after they had spent their ready money who have been obliged to strip themselves of their clothes and glad to part from a thing worth twenty shillings to obtain with difficulty one to keep them from starving and that without any view of ever seeing it again nay their want of principle and christianity is such that if they outstay the means of raising a sixpence for a bed they will charitably turn them into the street to  rest their heads on what cold stone they please for near six months my friend and i resided in this terrible abode of infamy and guilt but being ignorant at our first coming of what kind of mortals they were we settled amongst them and did not find it an easy matter to remove though we went trembling to bed every night with dreadful apprehensions of some ill treatment before the break of day  i took a little shop and because i was resolved to set off my matters as grand as possible i had a board put over my door with this inscription  brown pastrycook from london  at which place i cannot charge myself with ever having in the course of my life attempted to spoil the ingredients necessary in the composition of a tart but that did not signify as long as i was a londoner to be sure my pastry must be good  while the ships were coming in from ireland which is in the months of june july and august i had a good running trade but alas the winter was most terrible and if an uncle of my friends who died while we were there had not left her a legacy we must inevitably have perished  about the time the news came of her money we were involved to the amount of about four or five and thirty shillings and if a shilling would have saved us from total destruction we did not know where to raise it  on the receipt of the letter i showed it to the landlord hoping he would lend me a guinea to bear my charges to mrs browns aunt who lives in osfordshire where i was to go to receive her legacy which was a genteel one and i should have left her as a hostage till my return  but the incredulous blockhead conceived the letter to be forged and as he himself was capable of such a fraud imagined we had artfully contrived to get a guinea out of him and reward him by running away in his debt but he was quite mistaken as he was afterward convinced and made a thousand awkward excuses for his unkindness when we received the money and had discharged his trifling demands  i consulted on my pillow what was best to be done and communicated my thoughts to my friend upon which we concluded without speaking a word to any body both to set out and fetch the money according to order from her relations though there was two very great bars to such progress in the eye of reason but i stepped over both  one was having no more than a single groat in the world between us and the other my having been obliged to pledge my hat at bristol a fortnight before for half a crown to carry on the anatomical business we haplessly pursued  yet notwithstanding these terrible disasters i was resolved at all events to go the journey i took my fellowsufferer with me who was lost in wonder at so daring an enterprise to set out without either hat or money fourscore miles on foot but i soon eased the anxiety of mind she labored under by assuring her that when we got to bristol i would apply to a friend who would furnish me with a small matter to carry us on to bath  this pacified the poor soul who could scarce see her way for tears before i told her my design which never entered my imagination till we had got two miles beyond the detested place we lived in our circumstances were then so desperate i thought  whatever world we next were thrown upon could not be worse than pill as we were on our march we were met by some of our unneighbourly neighbors who took notice of my being in full career without a hat and of mrs brown with a bundle in her hand which contained only a change of linen for us on our travel  they soon alarmed our landlord with the interview with many conjectures of our being gone off and concluded my being bareheaded was intended as a blind for our excursion but let their thoughts be what they would we were safe in bristol by the time they got home to make their political report and i obtained at the first word the timely assistance our necessities required to procure a supper and bed that night besides what served to bear our charges to bath next morning  the only distress i had to overcome was to procure a covering for my unthinking head but providence kindly directed us to a house where there was a young journeyman a sort of a jemmysmart who dressed entirely in taste that lodged where we lay that night as i appeared barring the want of a hat as smart as himself in dress he entered into conversation with me and finding him a goodnatured man ventured as i was urged by downright necessity to beg the favor of him to lend me a hat which by being very dusty i was well assured had not been worn some time from which i conceived he would not be in a violent hurry to have it restored and framing an excuse of having sent my own to be dressed easily obtained the boon  next morning at the hour of five we set out and staid at bath till the morning following though i remember i was obliged to give the landlady my waistcoat for the payment of my lodging before we went to bed which i had the comfort of redeeming by the help of mr kennedy and company and set forwards on my journey with the favor they were pleased to bestow on me  i never received an obligation in my life that i was ashamed to acknowledge though i have very lately incurred the displeasure of a fine lady for mentioning a person in my third number to whom i shall ever think myself most transcendantly obliged and shall never be persuaded to forget their humanity or to reconcile contradictions and believe in impossibilities  as soon as i was empowered by the help of a little cash we set out from bath to oxfordshire and in three days arrived at the happy spot where we were furnished with that opiate for grief the want of which had many tedious nights kept us waking  our journey home was expedited by taking a doublehorse from whitney to cirencester and now and then for the rest of the way mounting up into a haycart or a timely wagon  when we returned to bristol we met with several of the pill gentry who were surprised to see us and informed us how terribly we had been exploded as being cheats and runaways and though they themselves in our absence were as inveterate as the rest of the vulgar crew were the first to condemn others for a fault they were equally guilty of  i returned the borrowed hat and went home triumphant in my own  paid my landlord and as long as the money lasted was the worthiest gentleman in the county but when our stock was exhausted and we were reduced to a second necessity of contracting a fresh score i was as much disregarded as a dead cat without the remembrance of a single virtue i was master of while i had a remaining guinea in my pocket  business daily decreasing from the want of shipping coming in and the winter growing fast upon us we had no prospect before us but of dying by inches with cold and hunger and what aggravated my own distress was having unfortunately drawn in my friend to be a melancholy partaker of my sufferings  this reflection naturally rouzed me into an honorable spirit of resolution not to let her perish through my unhappy and mistaken conduct which i meant all for the best though it unfortunately proved otherwise and that i might not stay at pill till we were past the power of getting away i sat down and wrote a little tale which filled up the first and second columns of a newspaper and got a friend to introduce me to mr w  d printer on the t  y who engaged me at a small pittance per week to write and correct the press when business was in a hurry which indeed it generally was as he is a man of reputation and greatly respected  i believe if he had been perfectly assured who i was and had known how much i had it in my power to have been useful to him as well as myself it had been much better for us both however it was kind in him to employ a distressed person and a stranger to whom he could not possibly be under the least obligation  having secured something to piddle on for i can call it no better i ran back to pill to bless my friend with the glad tidings and as it was a long and dirty walk from thence to bristol and infinitely dangerous over leighdown which is full three miles in length besides two miserable miles before that to trudge we thought it better to give up what we had to the landlord to whom we were but eighteen shillings indebted though we left him as much as fairly stood us in five pounds ready money but if we had offered to have made a sale of it i knew their consciences would have given us sixpence for that which might be worth a crown or ten shillings so we even locked up the shop and went with the key in my pocket to bristol and in two days time i sent it back with a note to let him know what we had left was entirely his own for that we should never more return  in truth i have been as good as my word and shall continue so for if business or inclination should ever excite me to take a trip to ireland i would go chester way and if travelers knew as much as i do of that horrid seat of cruelty and extortion they would all come into the same determination  having thus comfortably withdrawn ourselves from this hated place we took a lodging at two shillings per week and if i had not had the good fortune to be kindly accepted on by a few friends who were constantly inviting me the remaining part of my wages would not have been sufficient to have afforded us with other expenses above two good meals in a week  but thanks to my friends who empowered me to consign it all to the use of one to whom i should have thought on this occasion if every shilling had been a guinea i had made but a reasonable acknowledgement after having immersed her in difficulties which nothing but real friendship and a tender regard to my health which through repeated grievances was much impaired could have made her blindly inconsistent with her own interest to give into and so patiently endure  this business lasted for one month exactly and i found it impossible to subsist without being troublesome to friends and mr w  d not caring to enlarge my income i took it into my head to try for a benefit and to that end printed some bills in the style of an advertisement which were kindly presented to me by my master  all was to be done under the rose on account of the magistrates who have not suffered any plays to be acted in the city for many years but notwithstanding i slily adventured to have barnwell exhibited in the very heart of it at the black raven in high street where i had as many promises as would have filled the room which was a large one had it been twice as big but alas they were but promises for instead of five and twenty pounds i had barely four and abominably involved by the bargain insomuch i was obliged to march quietly off and say nothing  after i was gone several pitied my misfortune and declared if i would make a second attempt i should be made amends for the disappointment of the former but i thought it mighty well as it was and as i was safe in a whole skin would not run the chance of being a second time deceived nor the hazard of being more deeply engaged than i was  i was so miserably put to my shifts that the morning after my malefit i was obliged to strip my friend of the ownly decent gown she had and pledged it to pay the players who came from wells to assist me which to do them justice was a difficulty they were entirely ignorant of  twas no small mortification to me not to have it in my power to reward them genteelly for their trouble and more especially so as my own daughter was one of the number with her husband whom she imprudently married contrary to my inclination about three years before  though i had no fortune to give her without any partiality i look on her a more advantageous a match for a discreet man than a woman who might bring one and confound it in unnecessary expenses which i am certain kitty will never do and had she met with as sober and reasonable a creature as herself in the few years they have had a company might have been worth a comfortable sum of money to have set them up in some creditable business that might have redounded more to their quiet and reputation  but i fear that is as impossible to hope or expect as twould be likely to unmarry them which had it been in my power should have been done the first moment i heard of the unpleasing knots being tied but as it is  i here do give him that with all my heart which but that he has already with all my heart i would keep from him as my child was at wells with her company nature was more prevalent in that point than necessity to fix me there for there was another set of people i could have gone to thirty miles off a different road but notwithstanding my dislike to her marriage i wanted to be as near her as i could and joined them at wells where i was very well acquainted and as much as players can expect well regarded by the best in the town  about three years before i had been there with mr elringtons company and we met with uncommon success but the last time the smallpox raged violently there and if the ladies and gentlemen had not been extremely kind the poor exhibiters might have been glad to have shared the fate of the invalids to have been insured of a repository for their bones  it is a common observation that evils often produce good effects and such my daughter found from the generosity of the ladies who made her several valuable presents which enlarged their wardrobe considerably and being a wellbehaved girl that recommended her to their consideration in respect of her private character and her public performance on the stage rendered her very pleasing to the audience in general  i humbly entreat to be believed when without partiality i aver her genius would recommend her to a station in either theater if properly made use of as she has an infinite share of humor that calculates her for an excellent lowcomedian though she is obliged having none equal to her self to appear in characters in which her chief merit consists in being positively a sensible speaker  i once saw her play horatia in the roman father and was astonished to find her so truly affected with the scene where she comes to upbraid publius for the murder of her lover and provoke her own death from her brothers hand i confess i was pleasingly surprised and beg pardon for degenerating so far as to speak in praise of so near a relation who really deserved it an error my family is not very apt to run into  a second time she gave me equal delight in the part of boadicea which i should never have suspected from her uncultivated genius but she proved she had one in very justly acquitting herself in that character but yet i had rather see her in lowcomedy as it is more agreeable to her figure and entirely so to the oddity of her humourous disposition and i wish she was so settled as to constantly play in that walk which is a very pleasing one and most useful when players come toward the decline of life for when they have outlived the bloom and beauty of a lady townly or a monimia they may make very pleasing figures in a mrs day or a widow lackit  i wish the girl may take this friendly hint now she is young as i am certain in respect to her years she may in all probability live long enough to make a considerable figure in characters of that cast  i staid with her the run of six towns the last but one of which was honiton in devonshire where i had the happiness of gaining many friends of distinction and perhaps should have continued longer but that i received a letter from my brother to inform me mr simpson of bath had a mind to engage me to prompt and undertake the care of the stage incidental to that office  as i was heartily tired of strolling and being too frequently impertinently treated by my daughters husband i readily embraced the offer and set out for bath with my friend who had been as often and equally insulted by the little insignificant and on my arrival mr simpson in a gentlemanlike manner received me and lent me a sum of money to equip me in my proper character which i repaid him weekly out of my salary and thank him most sincerely for the favor  from the month of september to march i continued there but the fatigue of the place was more than my health or spirits could easily support for i am certain the prompters of either theaters in london have not half the plague in six months that i have had in as many days  it is true mr simpson was owner and ought to have been master of the house but his good nature and unwillingness to offend the most trifling performer made him give up his right of authority and rather stand neuter when he ought to have exerted it  the hurry of business in his rooms which were more methodically conducted than his theater took up so much of his time twas impossible for him to pay a proper attention to both by this means what ought to have been a regular government was reduced to anarchy and uproar each had their several wills and but one which was myself bound to obey them all  this any reasonable person will allow to be a hard and difficult task as i was not inclined to offend any of them and though they herded in parties i was resolved to be a stranger to their disputes till open quarrels obliged me to become acquainted with them and in such cases i was often made use on as a porter to set these matters to rights  this i confess my spirit could not easily brook both in respect to my father as well as having been on a much better footing on a superior theater than any i was obliged to pay a daily attendance on  i can be upon oath during the whole time of my residence at bath i had not even on sundays a day i could call my own and mr bodily the printer can testify i have often left fresh orders while he has been at church either for alteration of parts or of capital distinctions in the bills without which very indifferent actors would not otherwise go on  i think twould have been a greater proof of judgment to have distinguished themselves on the stage than upon a post or a brickwall and i have often thought when i have wrote the word performed it would have been no error to have changed it to deformed of which i have often had melancholy proofs from a brace of heroes who i believe one in particular thought none equal to them and truly i cannot but be of their minds for two such great men were never seen before and it is to be hoped never will again  as to the women the principal which is miss ibbott is really deserving of praise and admiration as all she does is from the result of a very great and uncommon genius i own myself not very apt to be partial but this gentlewoman struck me into a most pleasing astonishment by her performance of many characters but most particularly in the part of isabella in the fatal marriage she not only drew the audience into a most profound attention but absolutely into a general flood of commiserating tears and blended nature and art so exquisitely well that twas impossible not to feel her sorrows and bear the tenderest part in her affliction  i must confess i never was more truly affected with a tragical performance and was rendered incapable of reading a single syllable but luckily for miss ibbott she is always so perfect a prompter is a useless person while she is speaking and it is no compliment to insert what i told her when she came off that   her whole function suited with forms to her conceit i am very certain there were several people of quality down at bath who can testify the truth of what i have said of her and i should think it very well worth the while of the masters of either of the theaters to take her merit into consideration and if she had the advantage of seeing mrs cibber mrs woffington or mrs pritchard in their different lights it would make her as complete an actress as ever trod the english stage  the merit of this person was not a little conducive to the interest of the players in general which was demonstrated in the deficiency of the nights receipts whenever it happened that she was out of a play which indeed was very seldom but as merit generally creates envy her cotemporaries would scarce allow it her either publicly or privately notwithstanding the politest audiences testified it by a universal applause and they themselves proved it by the odds of their revenues when first characters have been stuffed up by those who would have made better figures as her attendants while she had performed them  the business in general was according to all accounts that season better than they had known it for many past and was greatly heightened by the universal admiration of the performance of the justlycelebrated mr maddox who engaged with mr simpson at a considerable salary though not more than he truly deserved  i believe the comedians found him worthy of his income as he not only brought in what paid his agreement but more than doubled that sum which they shared among them yet to my certain knowledge there was private murmuring even in respect to him though they profitted by his success and in spite of their grudging hearts could not help being delighted at his surprising feats of activity on the wire which he is at whitsuntide engaged to perform at mr hallams wells in goodmansfields and intends to entertain the town with several new things which he has never as yet publicly exhibited i hope not only in respect to mr maddox but in regard to mr hallam who is an honest worthy man he will be constantly visited by all people of true taste  soon after mr maddox left bath as mr fribble says a most terrible fracas happened to the states general of both the theaters occasioned by a mercenary view of gain in an old scoundrel who was chiefly supported by charitable donations in which mr simpson whose humanity frequently prompts him to such acts had been often very liberal to this viper who rewarded him by lodging an information against his and the company in orchardstreet  this put a stop to the business for about three weeks and was brought to a public process but i believe an attempt of the kind will never be made again  as bath is the seat of pleasure for the healthful and a grand restorative for the sick it is looked on as a priviledgedplace and those who come only to please themselves expect a free indulgence in that point as much as the infirm do the use of the baths for their infirmities therefore a suppression of any part of their innocent diversions was deemed by the people of quality as the highest affront that could be offered them especially as they and others of distinction are the absolute supports of the place which without them would be but a melancholy residence for the inhabitants if custom had not made it fashionably popular being a town of no particular trade  this reflection ought to put the strongest guard upon them not to be guilty of offense themselves or countenance it in others which was positively the case in relation to this affair as it was proved a certain a  raised a contribution of twenty guineas to bribe the old knave to put this cruel design in force against the players  this greatly exasperated every person of condition who as it was an infringement upon their liberty of entertainment interested themselves greatly in behalf of each theater and carried their point against the insolent invade of their privileges  during the suspension i could scarce walk through the grove but the very chairmen had something to say by way of exultation on the misfortunes of the poor showfolk as they impudently and ignorantly termed them not considering that playnights very greatly enlarged their incomes  among this set of twolegged horses were scattered some of the newsangled methodical tribe who blessed their stars that there was an end put to profanation and riot  it is surprising that the minds of those who wear the human forms can be so monstrously infatuated to be the constant attendants on the canting drones whose talents consist only in making a shoe or a pair of breeches have we not thousands of fine gentlemen regularly bred at universities who understand the true system of religion and are not the churches hourly open to all who please to go to them instead of creeping into holes and corners to hear much less than the generality of the auditors are able to inform their hypocritical pastors  i very lately visited mr yeatess new wells and was persecuted for an hour with words without meaning and sound without sense i own i should as soon think of dancing a hornpipe in a cathedral as having the least tincture of devotion where i had myself been honored as a heathen deity and dreaded as a roaring devil  no mortal but mr yeates could have thought of letting the place for that use and i believe the first symptoms of his religion will be discovered if there ever should be a suppression of this mockery of godliness in the loss of his sanctified tenants and the sad chance of the tenement standing empty  he must pardon me for this liberty but as we are both equal odd in separate lights neither of us can ever be surprised or offended at what the other says or does  my warmth i fear had led me into an unnecessary digression from my story but i confess i think the following these people so inconsistent with the rules of reason and sense i have not patience to think that any creature who is capable of distinguishing between right and wrong should listen to such rhapsodies of nonsense which rather confounds than serves to improve their understandings and consequently can be no way instrumental to the salvation of their souls  if public devotion four times a day is not sufficient for that torrent of goodness they would be thought to have their private prayers at home offered with sincerity and penitence they may be assured will be graciously received and prevent that loss of time bestowed in hearing the gospel turned topsyturvy by those who really are as ignorant of it as the rostrum they stand in and whose heads seem to be branches of the same root  notwithstanding the gaiety of bath they swarm like wasps in june and have left their stings in the minds of many i am certain rancour and malice are particularly predominant in them which they discovered in an eminent degree when the houses were shut up by saying and doing all they could to have them remain so to the destruction of many families who were happy in a comfortable subsistence arising from them  i know twas some guineas out of my pocket and though i grew heartily tired of my office i intended to have finished the season if this disaster had not happened but the uncertainty of their opening again fixed in me a resolution to leave them which was strengthened by some illnatured rebuffs i had met with from the lower part of the company which i scarce thought worth my notice having secretly determined to withdraw myself from that and the fatigue being i think more proper to be undertaken by a man than a woman  one thing i took monstrously ill which i cannot help mentioning some persons of fashion who had seen me in london had a mind that i should appear in the part of lord foppington in the careless husband and at their request i rehearsed it in a visit which they were so obliging to tell me made them more anxious for my playing it as a proof that they desired it they communicated their design to him who ought to have been their commander in chief and he agreed to their proposal till two of his subalterns neither of which were qualified to appear in the character opposed it each hoping to supply it themselves without the advantage either of that ease in their action necessary to the part or being able to utter a syllable of french but what provoked me farther was trumping up a story of my brothers having laid an injunction on mr simpson never to permit me to go on the stage but particularly in that character  i believe the town has had too many proofs of my brothers merit to suppose it possible for me to be vain enough to conceive i should eclipse it by my performance or that he was weak enough to fear it and though i may be judged to have raised my thoughts to the highest pitch of vanity in believing that to be the real case of my two opponents in this cause i am positively assured it was the main motive of their being so industriously employed in preventing my coming on the stage  to say truth i began to be very angry with myself for ever condescending to sit behind the scenes to attend a set of people that i was certain whatever faults i might have in acting not one of them miss ibbott excepted was capable of discerning  the intention of my playing was framed by my friends to give me an opportunity of recommending myself to a benefit who faithfully promised to exert their interest for me but their scheme was soon frustrated through the mean and dirty artifice of these two people who i am certain ought to endeavor at making every one their friends of which i have some modest reasons to believe they frequently stand in need of  mr falkner very kindly offered to enter into the immediate study of lord morelove that the play might not wait for him and was pleased at a seeming opportunity of my being more agreeably engaged than i was but his good nature is no wonder for i must do him the justice to say i never heard him utter or do a thing that was inconsistent with the true character of a gentleman  this illnatured disappointment raised such indignation and contempt in me that i as much abhorred to go to the house as some people do to undergo a course of nauseous physic but i soon removed myself and if they will forgive my ever having been there at all i will promise them never to do so again  before i conclude the account of my bath expedition i cannot avoid taking notice of a malicious aspersion thrown and fixed on me as a reason for leaving it which was that i designed to forsake my sex again and that i positively was seen in the street in breeches  this i solemnly avow to be an impertinent falsehood which was brought to london and spread itself much to my disadvantage in my own family where i was informed it was delivered to them as a reality by an actress that came to town soon after i quitted bath i guess at the person but as i know her to be half mad must neither wonder or be angry at her folly yet as she has sometimes reason sufficient to distinguish between truth and falsehood am surprised she should meanly have recourse to the latter to make me appear ridiculous who never gave her the least provocation to do me so apparent an injury my only reason for not staying was an absolute abhorrence to the office i was in and which i would not again undertake for ten guineas per week  it happened at the time i left bath there was without exception the most deplorable set of nonperformers at bradford that ever wrecked the heart of tragedy or committed violence on the ears of the groundlings i cannot say with shakespeare they were perriwigpated fellows for there was not a wig and a half throughout the whole company and i believe there was not above two men that could boast of more than an equal quantity of shirts  business they had none  money so long a stranger to them that they were in poor sharps condition and had almost forgot the current coin of their own country with these pleasing prospects of despair i joined their community and as my mind was unloaded from the uneasiness i suffered from a fund of impertinent behavior and everlasting fatigue greatly prejudicial to my health i fat quietly down resolving not to repine at the worst that could happen for the short time i intended to stay with them  a young man at bath had a mind to indulge himself with a mouthful of tragedy but that he might have a bellyful at once gormandized the part of othello which brought us a good house and was a very seasonable help for we eat our landladies smiled and we could call about us without the usual tremor that had attended our spirits for a fortnight before with the terrible apprehensions of being answered with a negative or served with reproachful doubts of their being ever paid  a very few days entirely broke up this disjoined company and we herded in parties my friend and i went with another manager almost as rich and wise as him we left when after having starved for two or three towns we received a very gross affront on which i went to the devizes where the abovementioned notable gentleman with his wife and a young fellow besides our two selves made up the whole totte  they concluded we should play there but rather than suffer an insolence from such mortals even in the greatest severity of fortune i rather chose to put myself to the utmost inconveniences i could possibly suffer as a proof whereof not having a farthing in the world i sold a few trifling things for four shillings and with that scanty sum set out from the devizes in wiltshire to rumsey in hampshire which over salisburyplain is full forty miles but as there are no houses over that long solitary walk allowed to receive travelers we went under the plain through all the villages which lengthened our journey full twenty more  our nights expenses for lodging and supper came to ninepence so we positively had no more than three shillings and threepence to support us for sixty miles  my friend as she had great cause began though in a tender manner to reproach me for having left bath and more especially as miss ibbott mr falkner mr giffard and many more who came to see the comical humors of the moor of venice at bradford used many forcible arguments to make me return which i should have done but that i happened to take offense at something said to me on that head by a particular person who notwithstanding i believe meant well but being perhaps in a peevish mood as all the world at different times are more or less i persisted in my resolution of not going back and hope it will be no affront to the theatrical community at bath to assure them from my heart i never once repented it but rather pitied my successor for being encumbered with a very fatiguing and unthankful office  when i set out from devizes i stood debating near an hour on the road whether we should march for london or hampshire as our finances were equally capable of serving us to either place but nature asserted her right of empire in my heart and pointed me the road to pay my child a second visit and after a most deplorable halfstarving journey through intricate roads and terrible showers of rain in three days time we arrived at rumsey having parted from our last three halfpence to ride five miles in a wagon to the great relief of our oertired legs  it may be scarce believed that two people should travel so far upon so small a pittance who had not been from their birth enured to hardships but we positively did and in the extreme heat of the day were often glad to have recourse to a clear stream to quench our thirst after a tedious painful march not only to save our money but enable us to go through the toil of the day till the friendly inn received us where our overwearied spirits were lulled by sleep into a forgetfulness of care  i was questioned not long since whether it was possible for me to have run through the strange vicissitudes of fortune i have given an account of which i solemnly declare i am ready to make oath of the truth of every circumstance and if any particular person or persons require it will refer them to hundreds now living who have been witnesses of every article contained in my history nor would i presume to impose a falsehood where as i was desired to give a real account truth was so absolutely necessary and i believe the reader will find i have paid so strict a regard to it that i have rather painted my own ridiculous follies in their most glaring lights than debarred the reader the pleasure of laughing at me or proudly concealed the utmost exigencies of my fate both which may convince the world that i have been faithful in my declaration either way for none i believe desires through frolic alone to make sport for others or excite a pity they never stood in need of  my stay with my daughter was but short as i had made a considerable progress in mr dumonts history which as i had determined not to lead that uncomfortable kind of life any longer i thought i could easily finish during the weekly publication and frequently declared my intention to my daughter and her husband when i was at newport in the isle of wight with a positive assurance that i would not go any farther with them  this they either did not or were not willing to believe notwithstanding my frequent repetition of it and though i promised to make them happy with what might revert to me through my little labors they injudiciously conceived i was doing them an injury when as i shall answer to heaven i intended it to turn equally to their account as to my own but a want of understanding and good mind on the one part and a too implicit regard and obedience on the other led them both into an error they had better have avoided  i would not have the world believe notwithstanding my aversion to the choice my foolish girl has made that i would not in all reasonable respects have every action of her life correspondent with the necessary duty of a wife which i am certain never can or should exempt her from that she owes me who must while we both exist be undoubtedly her mother  to be short we parted and till i could turn myself about i went with another of their company who left them through fears of the smallpox to lymington where my daughter enslaved herself for life from thence to fareham where under a pretense of bringing over some hands to help us out we being but six in number my daughters spouse came only with a cruel design to take away two of our hands in pure spite to me but against his horrid inclination or knowledge he did me the greatest piece of service in the world for i made a firm resolution never more to set my foot on a country stage  since the pitiful villainy of strollers could reach one so nearly as ones own blood i thought it then high time indeed to disclaim them though i am well assured the girl would not have been guilty of the crime of depriving her mother of the morsel of bread she struggled for had she not been enforced to it by a blind obedience to an inconsiderable fool  i was monstrously ashamed to see an innocent man who was the manager where i was then engaged led into difficulties arising from an impudent revenge on me i did not deserve which the young gentleman was too sensible of and was not more concerned on his own than my account  i prevailed on him to steer his course to london from whence if his affairs could have been properly adjusted i absolutely intended to have returned for a short time into the country with him from a point of gratitude and honor to make him in part amends for the injuries he had sustained from my soninlaw and i shall think he has an everlasting claim on that score to any act of friendship within my power whenever he thinks it consistent with his interest to require it  this goodnatured injured person had not only himself but a wife and child exclusive of my unfortunate phiz to provide for without the least prospect of doing it but as i urged him so strenously to go to london i was determined to contrive the means and applied to a friend of his who very generously complied with the request i made in his behalf and away we went for portsmouth hoping to have been time enough for the wagon which set out that day  we were unluckily too late which obliged us to retard our journey two days and remained at portsmouth on expenses which was a terrible disaster as our finances were at best but slender but had they been much worse i was resolved to see london by heavens permission if i had been obliged to have been passed to it being worn out with the general plagues of disappointment and ill usage that are the certain consequentials of a strolling life  when i set my foot upon london streets though with only a single penny in my pocket i was more transported with joy than for all the height of happiness i had in former and at different times possessed  i hope those who read the description i have given of the inquietudes that all must expect to meet with who come under the impertinent power of travellingmanagers will make a proper use of it by never forsaking a good trade or calling of what kind soever to idle away their lives so unprofitably to themselves and too often disadvantagiously to the inhabitants of many an unsuccessful town  i will not pretend to say that all heads of companies are without a rule of exception but i must confess those i have had to deal with and that very lately too are what i have before described and i doubt not but there are numbers of my former fellow sufferers who are of my opinion  thank heaven i have not nor ever intend to have any farther commerce with them but will apply myself closely to my pen and if i can obtain the honor and favor of my friends company at an annual benefit i will to the extent of my power endeavor to entertain them with my own performance and provide the best i can to fill up the rest of the characters  i shall very shortly open my oratorical academy for the instruction of those who have any hopes from genius and figure of appearing on either of the london stages or york norwich and bath all which are reputable but will never advise or encourage any person to make themselves voluntary vagabonds for such not only the laws but the opinion of every reasonable person deems those itinerant gentry who are daily guilty of the massacre of dramatick poetry but of them no more but a lasting and long farewell  when i first came to town i had no design of giving any account of my life farther than a trifling sketch introduced in the preface to mr dumonts history the first number of which will shortly make its appearance and i hope will be kindly received by my worthy friends who have favored me in this work which i should never have undertaken had i not been positively and strongly urged to it not conceiving that any action of my life could claim that attention i find it has by the large demand i have had for my weekly numbers throughout england and wales for which i humbly offer my sincerest thanks and shall ever own myself not only indebted but highly honored  as i propose my pen to be partly my support i shall always endeavor to render it an amusement to my readers as far as my capacity extends and as the world is sensible i have no view of fortune but what i must by heavens assistance strike out of myself i hope i shall find a continuance of the favor i at present am blessed with and shall think it my duty most carefully to preserve not only in regard to my own interest but from a grateful respect to those who kindly confer it  i entreat the readers to excuse some faults which were slips of the press occasioned through a hurry of business that rendered it impossible to give time for a proper inspection either by me or the printer who has been greatly hurried on account of the benefits at both the theaters which he is indispensibly obliged to pay regard to in point of time  it is generally the rule to put the summary of books of this kind at the beginning but as i have through the whole course of my life acted in contradiction to all points of regularity beg to be indulged in a whimsical conclusion of my narrative by introducing that last which i will allow should have been first as for example  this day april         is published the eighth and last number of a narrative of the life of mrs charlotte charke with a dedication from and to myself the properest patroness i could have chosen as i am most likely to be tenderly partial to my poetical errors and will be as bounteous in the reward as we may reasonably imagine my merit may claim  this work contains  st a notable promise of entertaining the town with the history of henry dumont esquire and miss charlotte evelyn but being universally known to be an odd product of nature was requested to postpone that and give an account of myself from my infancy to the present time   dly my natural propensity to a hat and wig in which at the age of four years i made a very considerable figure in a ditch with several other succeeding mad pranks an account of my education at westminster why did not i make a better use of so happy an advantage   dly my extraordinary skill in the science of physic with a recommendation of the necessary use of snails and gooseberry leaves when drugs and chemical preparations were not comeatable my natural aversion to a needle and profound respect for a currycomb in the use of which i excelled most young ladies in great britain my extensive knowledge in gardening not forgetting that necessary accomplishment for a young gentlewoman in judiciously discharging a blunderbuss or a fowlingpiece my own and the lucky escape of life when i run over a child at uxbridge   thly my indiscreetly plumping into the sea of matrimony and becoming a wife before i had the proper understanding of a reasonable child an account of my coming on the stage my uncommon success there my folly in leaving it my recommendation of my sister marples to the consideration of every person who chooses to eat an elegant meal or chat away a few moments with a humourous goodnatured elderly landlady my turning grocer with some wise remarks on the rise and fall of sugars and teas an unfortunate adventure in selling a link a short account of my father and mothers courtship and marriage   thly a faithful promise to prefer a bill in chancery against my uncles widow who has artfully deprived his heirs at law of a very considerable fortune  n b the old dame may be assured i will be as good as my word  my keeping a grand puppetshew and losing as much money by it as it cost me my becoming a widow and being afterward privately married which as it proved i had better have let alone my going into mens clothes in which i continued many years the reason of which i beg to be excused as it concerns no mortal now living but myself my becoming a second time a widow which drew on me inexpressible sorrows that lasted upwards of twelve years and the unforeseen turns of providence by which i was constantly extricated from them an unfortunate interview with a fair lady who would have made me master of herself and fortune if i had been lucky enough to have been in reality what i appeared   thly my endeavoring at a reconciliation with my father his sending back my letter in a blank his being too much governed by humor but more so by her whom age cannot exempt from being the lively limner of her own face which she had better neglect a little and pay part of that regard to what she ought to esteem the nobler part and must have an existance when her painted frame is reduced to ashes   thly my being gentleman to a certain peer after my dismission becoming only an occasional player while i was playing at bopeep with the world my turning porkmerchant broke through the inhuman appetite of a hungry dog went a strolling several adventures during my peregrination my return and setting up an eatinghouse in drury lane undone again by pilfering lodgers turning drawer at st marylabonne an account of my situation there going to the haymarket theater with my brother his leaving it many distresses arising on that account going a strolling a second time and staying near nine years several remarkable occurrences while i was abroad particularly my being sent to g  jail for being an actor which to do most strollingplayers justice they ought not to have the laws enforced against them on that score for a very substantial reason my settling in wales and turning pastrycook and farmer made asmall mistake in turning hogmerchant went to the seat of destruction called pill broke and came away hired myself to a printer at bristol to write and correct the press made a short stay there vagabondized again and last christmas returned to london where i hope to remain as long as i live  i have now concluded my narrative from my infancy to the time of my returning to london and if those who do me the honor to kill time by the perusal will seriously reflect on the manifold distresses i have suffered they must think me wonderfully favored by providence in the surprising turns of fortune which has often redeemed me from the devouring jaws of total destruction when i have least expected it  i wish the merciful example of the great creator who never yet forsook me had prevailed on the mind of him who by divine ordination was the author of my being and am sorry that he should so oershoot his reason as not to consider when i only asked for blessing and pardon he should deny that which from a superior power he will one day find necessary himself to implore and i hope his prayer will be answered and that heaven will not be deaf to him as he has been to me  i cannot recollect any crime i have been guilty of that is unpardonable which the denial of my request may possibly make the world believe i have but i dare challenge the most malicious tongue of slander to a proof of that kind as heaven and my own conscience can equally acquit me of ever having deserved that dreadful sentence of not being forgiven  the errors of my youth chiefly consisted in a thoughtless wildness partly owing to having too much will of my own in infancy which i allow was occasioned by an over fondness where i now unhappily find a fixed aversion but notwithstanding that unkindness nature will assert her right and tenderly plead in the behalf of him who i am certain through age and infirmity rather than a real delight in cruelty has listened too much to an invidious tongue which had been more gracefully employed in healing not widening a breach between a father and a child who wanted only the satisfaction of knowing her name was no longer hateful to him who in spite of fortunes utmost rigor i must think myself bound by all laws both divine and human still to cherish in my heart and tenderly revere  as i have nothing farther to entertain my friends with as to my life i shall with the humblest submission take my leave of them and as i design to pass in the catalogue of authors will endeavor to produce something now and then to make them laugh if possible for i think it is pity to draw tears from those who have so generously contributed toward making me smile  finis
