remarks on a printed paper lately handed about entitled a catalogue of the sacred vessels restored by cyrus and of the chief jews who returned at first from the captivity together with the names of the returning families and the number of the persons at that time in each family disposed in such a manner as to show most clearly the great corruption of proper names and numbers in the present text of the old testament  addressed to all such gentlemen as have received or read the same  the second edition  by granville sharp  london printed for b white at horaceshead fleet street mdcclxxv  remarks on a printed paper etc gentlemen having received from a worthy friend in the country for whom i have the greatest esteem a printed paper which had been sent him by dr kennicott entitled a catalogue of the sacred vessels restored by cyrus and of the chief jews who returned at first from the captivity together with the names of the returning families and the number of the persons at that time in each family disposed in such a manner as to show most clearly the great corruption of proper names and numbers in the present text of the old testament and being desired to return the said paper when i had perused it i thought i could not handsomely do so without sending my opinion of it at the same time the nature of the subject is indeed so foreign to my own business and way of life that i should scarcely have presumed to meddle with it had not a point of good manners to this gentleman first of all induced me to do so but afterward when i had considered dr kennicotts manner of expressing himself in the title of this catalogue i thought myself obliged through a desire of vindicating the holy scriptures to apply as closely to the examination of this charge against them as my small share of leisure would permit being apprehensise that this paper might cause such prejudices against the integrity of the text of the old testament as the learned author himself perhaps never conceived and would be sorry to have occasioned by his catalogue  the letter to my friend which was the result of this examination was at my desire shown to dr kennicott but the arguments therein had not sufficient weight to convince him that some apology was necessary to be made to his friends to prevent their misinterpreting his real design in the said catalogue and to remove all appearance of his having charged the present text of the old testament with more faults than it really deserves not being able however to lay aside my own apprehensions of the ill effects which might possibly be occasioned by this catalogue i have therefore ventured to print some of my remarks upon it lest any person not having leisure to examine it sufficiently should be led to conceive that all the differences in names and numbers found therein are really corruptions in the present text of the old testament  in the first part of the catalogue the doctor has compared ezras account of the sacred vessels with the account given of the same in the book of esdras and as if he had clearly shown thereby some great corruptions he has affixed the following motto to his quotations viz non potest verum asseri quod   in the letter which i sent to my friend on this subject i endeavored to show that a disagreement in numbers when the accounts of historians are compared is not a sufficient authority to justify a charge of corruption and i supposed an example of two historians giving an account of the number of slain in a battle the one that  000 men were killed and the other that no less than  000 were lost in the same battle and i observed that if the account is true of  000 being killed the other account cannot be called a contradiction to it because a less number is mentioned therein and this i thought sufficient to exemplify that a smaller number when given without an absolute limitation is no contradiction to a greater number but it has been objected to this example that it is by no means parallel to the case in question because the numbers of slain in battle in large armies as given by historians are from the nature of the thing hardly ever to be depended upon whereas when an inventory of goods is given it is reasonably supposed to be exact to an unit because it easily may be so i will therefore mention another example not liable to the same objection and more proper to be inserted in these remarks because it is quoted by dr kennicott see page     of his  st dissertation viz in   kings iv    we read that solomon had  0000 stalls for horses but in   chr ix    only  000 this dr kennicott mentions as one of the instances of mistakes which are most easilyaccounted for by admitting the addition omission or transposition of a cipher and the doctors favorite author father houbigant thinks to remove all difficulty from the same by altering the text in   kings iv    from  to  viz from  0000 to  000  but the ingenious author of a small ms book lent me by a worthy and learned friend to whom i have great obligation on this as well as many other accounts makes it appear very plainly that the opinions of bochart and lud capellus who think the word  instead of  0 should be translated   would cause greater difficulties than what are at present found in the text for says he let this rabbinical use of plural ordinal numbers be what they please yet in the scripture style they are never taken singularly and this i affirm after having examined some hundreds of places where they are either joined with appellatives persons or things or greater numbers as an hundred or thousand and so these hebrew words  signify  0000 beyond exception in all other texts they are found in and so the lxx turn them here and josephus preserves the same high number he then proceeds to show the great probability  from the riches and grandeur of solomon and the more terrible execution a quadriga would make than a biga that solomons chariots were drawn by   horses which opinion he supports by a variety of quotations and learned arguments and afterward observes that as solomon had   00 chariots   kings x    and   chronicles i    the number of horses allowing   to each chariot would require   00 stalls besides the stalls necessary for the   000 single troop horses which numbers will occasion great difficulties if we suppose that solomon had only  000 stalls he also observes that besides the stalls necessary for solomons standing forces standings were necessary for horses presented to him by foreign princes as also for baggage mules and dromedaries which must be very numerous not only for the carriage of provisions tents and other warlike necessaries both for horse and foot but also for water in the vast sandy wild of arabia deserta as far as euphrates moreover he observes that as solomon trafficked by his merchants with horses brought out of egypt furnishing the kings of syria and the hittites so this running trade might occasion these stalls to be so numerous not only serving the purposes of war but of traffic many more reasons are given by the same author which are confirmed by a great variety of learned quotations and authorities but i trust that those few i have mentioned are quite sufficient to prove that father houbigant has been much too hasty in altering the sacred text from  0000 to  000 and that he has thereby loaded it with a real difficulty when he might have avoided the imaginary one by admitting a very reasonable and fair solution which has been approved of by a great variety of learned commentators i mean that of construing the word  not stalls but stables which entirely removes all the difficulty for supposing each stable capable of containing  0 horses you very easily account for the number of  0000 stalls and this opinion is approved of by abarbinel junius and tremellius bp patrick sir walter raleigh mons martin and a great variety of other commentators  some have indeed supposed that the chariot horses spoken of in the parallel passage in  d chronicles ix    were but  000 which king solomon kept at or near jerusalem for his constant guard and that the other speaks of those which were dispersed throughout his whole kingdom  but what is most material to my purpose is observed by the author of the little treatise abovementioned viz the diversity between these two relations viz in   kings iv    and   chronicles ix    amounts to   000 but if the first account is proved true which he most clearly has done the second must be so too as the less is included in the greater number now this is the very conclusion that i drew from my former example viz of the two historians giving different accounts of the number of men slain in a battle which was objected to and this is another reason for my having quoted this example of solomons horses and i have the more pleasure in doing so because it is not liable to the same objection as the former for the numbers therein may as reasonably be supposed to be exact to a unit as the account of any other inventory whatever because it easily might have been so we find likewise that the difficulty therein may reasonably be accounted for without the supposition of a mistake or the necessity of having recourse to father houbigants dangerous and unwarrantable expedient of altering the text   ita diversum est  but this account of esdras is not ita diversum as to amount to a contradiction of the other and therefore the doctors motto is not at all applicable for ezra might at one time make particular mention of such vessels only as were perhaps   a very apt and ingenious objection has been made to this argument and communicated to the writer of these remarks who hopes that the worthy and learned author will excuse his inserting it here at length as the omission of it in this place might perhaps be deemed an injustice to the subject in question the objection was as follows that ezra did not mean to mention particularly the chief vessels only and then to include the rest in the general round sum   00 is evident from hence that he does do this before he comes to make up the sum   00 for he throws together all the vessels not before specified under the article other vessels and into the general round sum  000 and this round sum  000 added to the particular sums before specified ought in common sense to make the sum total which here it does not do  but notwithstanding the seeming propriety of this objection yet while there is any reasonable way left of accounting for a difficulty we ought to be very cautious of supposing a corruption not from any idea of the absolute integrity of the hebrew text but because many very learned and experienced persons have led themselves and others into errors by esteeming some difficult passages to be corrupt when the truth and integrity of the same might have been very sufficiently vindicated  in the present case though i have not met with any thing which in my opinion ought to be adopted as the only true interpretation yet i think that one of the solutions given by bp patrick is so far reasonable that it removes the absolute necessity of supposing a corruption viz it is said in   chronicles xxxvi    nebuchadnezzar carried away all the vessels both great and small now in the account that is here given the larger vessels only which were of greater bigness and price are mentioned among which are also reckoned the  000 other vessels which round sum was not intended to make up the gross but only to include all the other great or larger vessels the species of which were not particularized as josephus testifies and other great vessels a thousand    but the gross sum comprehends all both great and small and amounts to the number   00   chiefly used or were most remarkable and might mean to include all the rest in the general round sum of   00 and yet might afterward think proper to write a more circumstantial history setting down the exact number of each kind of vessel together with the particular amount or total of the whole  in josephus the   0 and the   0 correspond very well with the chargers of gold and basins of gold mentioned by ezra as to the other numbers they all differ as well from the account in ezra as from that in esdras except the  000 other vessels and the addition of the whole amounts to no more than    0  yet as he has not himself given a total number he cannot be said to contradict either of the others now as not one of the articles in the heb account of ezra exceeds the numbers of those in esdras there can be no contradiction therein because each number may be included in the corresponding number in esdras  and farther if the number of each article in ezra had been exactly the same with those in esdras the sum total   00 would have appeared more like a mistake but as they amount to no more than      it is plain that the writer did not mean to enumerate every single vessel because he afterward gives a round sum total of even hundreds viz   00 which is more frequent in historians than exact and particular sums therefore a person must be very little acquainted with history who supposes that this is a contradiction to the sum total in esdras because the odd number    is omitted   this numerical exactness in the account of esdras which is wanting in the hebrew account has occasioned a supposition that the latter by some means or other has undergone some alteration but it must be observed that some ancient copies of the book of esdras have been equally exact in making the sum total the amount of the several sorts of vessels to a unit notwithstanding that the particulars are very different and that the sum total exceeds the common reading by     vessels the old latin bibles from which the present vulgate was taken have the reading just mentioned which was probably translated from mss as ancient as those from which the present greek text of esdras was taken and the same reading is found in tindals old english bible printed in      therefore this numerical exactness is not a sufficient proof of the authenticity of the book of esdras in this place so that if the heb of ezra was to be corrected by it to the same numerical exactness and if such other corrections as have been proposed were to take place in the text of the old testament i am apt to think that our holy bible itself would soon by too many be esteemed as little better than apocryphal   as to the difference of the names by which the vessels are called however unlike they appear in the english translation yet whoever is acquainted with the original text must know that they correspond sufficiently except indeed the heb word which is translated knives and that is capable of being construed several different ways but there is not the least reason to suppose that it has been corrupted  the next thing that i have to observe is that dr k has been particularly unfortunate in fixing upon this part of the sacred history as a proof of the great corruption of the proper names and numbers in the present text of the old testament first  because it was the custom of the babylonians to give new names to their captives so that it was very common among the jewish captives to be called by two names of this the book of daniel gives sufficient proof and therefore this difference is of the less consequence because two different names may mean the same person  and secondly because these three books all agree in the sum total of persons   this agreement of the three books in the sum total of persons has occasioned a supposition that the catalogue in all three was originally the same and that all three are now imperfect in some of the particulars since the particulars in none of them now amount to the sum     0 which is said to be the sum of each but there is no proof that the list which nehemiah found was exactly the same with that from which ezra copied for many different accounts might have been taken by the persons appointed to number the people even under the same title of the children of the province that went up out of captivity etc and though they might find it very easy to agree in the sum total even to a unit by reckoning the people promiscuously by fifties hundreds or thousands in which method the want of pedigrees would cause no difficulty yet in taking the numbers of the families separately they might be very liable to differ on account of the difficulty of ascertaining the legitimacy of some particular persons in many of the said families  it must be observed too that not one of the three lists mentions the number of priests who were rejected for want of proper registers though the names of their families are the very last in each list just preceding the sum total so that there is no doubt but that they are included therein notwithstanding therefore as the consent of all three informs us beyond contradiction of the real sum total so the want of the number of these priests in all three lists seems as clearly to prove that the particular numbers in each were not intended to make up exactly the said sum total because it must otherwise seem very unaccountable that all these three lists as well as all the ancient versions which have been made from them should happen to be corrupted in the same identical place  dr kennicott seemed to be aware of this objection when he first published his catalogue of names in his second dissertation page  0  etc for he has there omitted these three last names which have no numbers specified though he has thought fit to add them to his second edition in the printed sheet because he must have been convinced that they ought to be included in the sum total notwithstanding the triple evidence of these lists that no number ought to be added to the same and consequently that the exact number     0 was never intended to be made appear from the addition of the particular sums in any of these lists    viz     0 and yet none of their accounts amount to that sum by upwards of  000 so that were the names and numbers which are particularized in each book much more different than they really are they could not with justice be accused of contradiction because there is sufficient room left in any of these histories for the mention of many different families which might have been omitted by the others  now those who content themselves with the doctors catalogue without farther examination may indeed imagine that he has shown them most clearly some great corruptions of proper names etc because he has disposed them in such a manner as to compare the name bezai in ezra with hashum in nehemiah and again jorah in ezra with bezai in nehemiah which should have been placed in the line above also hashum in ezra which should have been placed two lines higher with hariph in nehemiah likewise he has placed lod opposite to jericho hadid to lod ono to hadid and jericho to ono each in a wrong line so that he must either allow this to be a great mistake or else that these names are disposed in such a manner as to prove nothing at all of what he pretends   by way of excuse for dr kennicott it has been urged that the names are taken in the order in which they stand in each writer to show how the order of the original catalogue has been disturbed and that he did not intend to compare those names which are manifestly different as if meant for the same person but as no sufficient evidence has ever yet been produced that the order of the names has really been disturbed in any of the lists from what it was when written by the authors of each and as i have in a former note shown a probability that the catalogue in all three lists was not originally exactly the same and as this seems to be proved by these very variations in the order of the names therefore i think that the doctors manner of disposing the names cannot with justice be defended   at the head of the names the doctor has placed a title viz the twelve chief men by which people may unwarily be led to suppose that the chief men were confined to the limited number of twelve but the scriptures make no mention of a limited number of chief men   dr kennicott nevertheless informs us in page  0  second dissertation that the twelve chiefs represented the twelve tribes  but only of names therefore it is not an inconsistency in the account of ezra to mention only eleven names on this account likewise the difference in the names is of less consequence because it is not easy to prove that different persons were not intended to have been expressed thereby on the other hand it may be as difficult to prove that they were though there is some appearance of a proof in one instance viz the names reelius and roimus in esdras if we consider the greek manner of expressing hebrew names will answer very well to reelaiah  in ezra and raamiah  in nehemiah which last names dr k has compared together as supposing them to have been originally the same though the similar names just mentioned in esdras give us great reason to believe the contrary  but before i leave dr kennicotts twelve chief men i will endeavor to clear up another difficulty and will now take his side of the question to prove that he has done right in comparing rehum in ezra with nehum in nehemiah as the name of one man notwithstanding the great difference between them in sound which may at first sight seem to favor my suggestion about different persons and i shall have the more pleasure in doing this because at the same time i shall show most clearly that neither the one nor the other is corrupted now every person who is tolerably acquainted with the chaldee and syriac tongues must know that n  is frequently changed for r  in words derived from the hebrew and therefore it is much more easy to believe that nehemiah like a babylonian wrote  for   nehum for rehum than to suppose that either of the words has been since corrupted  whatever difference there may be between ezra and nehemiah in numbers which are of less consequence as both of them fall so far short of the total yet the difference in names is very immaterial though dr kennicott has disposed them in such a manner as to make it seem very considerable  there is but one name viz hariph in all this long list of families mentioned by nehemiah which has any material difference from those mentioned by ezra and there are but four names in ezra viz jorah magbish hagab and asnah which are not found in nehemiah therefore as there are no names in nehemiah to compare with these last excepting the single name hariph it is impossible for dr k to prove any corruption of names in the hebrew text throughout this whole list of families  perhaps the doctor may imagine that the difference of names in the apocryphal greek book of esdras is a sufficient proof against the integrity of the hebrew text of the other two otherwise he must allow that his catalogue proves very little in this article of names but supposing that these differences were real contradictions which they are not the suspicion of corruption must of course fall on the book of   see dr kennicotts second dissertation on the state of the hebrew text pages  0  and  0  where he entirely gives up the authority of the book of esdras so that its testimony ought to have but very little weight especially with dr k himself in correcting the text esdras first because the two best greek copies of this same book viz the vatican and alexandrian copies differ very much from each other both in the names and numbers  secondly because it is not of equal authority with the others being apocryphal and therefore not received into the canon of the scriptures  and thirdly because two evidences against one though they were all to be of equal authority would undoubtedly gain the cause in this critical trial  but i will now endeavor to show that even the apocryphal book of esdras is not so widely different from the others as the doctor has made them appear in his catalogue and of this i hope the few examples that follow will be a sufficient proof  verse    aterezias is in the original greek  agreeable to the hebrew aterhezekiah  verse    bethsamos is  in the alexandrian copy which is very agreeable to the hebrew of nehemiah  bithozmouth or bethazmaveth  verse  0 gabdes is  the genitive of  agreeable to the hebrew gaba  verse    annaas is  agreeable to the hebrew senaah  ver    carme appears very different from harim in english though they are in the original tongues apparently the same word for the h in harim  in  being a rough aspirate is frequently expressed by the  in greek as   verse    jatal is  in the original greek agreeable to the hebrew  also teta is  which agrees very well with the hebrew hatita  sami is  in the vatican copy which agrees very well with the hebrew shobai for  by the chaldaeans and syrians was frequently exchanged both for  and  likewise the word  as it is expressed in the alexandrian copy is agreeable to the hebrew   verse    graba is  in the vatican copy and  in the alexandrian agreeable to the hebrew hagaba  verse  0 acua is  in the greek which is much nearer to akkub  verse    airus should be  which is plainly derived from  reaiah by prefixing the  or i a thing very common in hebrew names azia should be  which very well corresponds with  called in english uzza  verse    charcus in the original is in the genitive  and agrees well with barkos  nasith is in the vatican copy  which is sufficiently near to neziah  verse    azaphion is in the alexandrian copy  which is much nearer to sophereth  pharira is in the alexandrian copy  agreeable to the hebrew  perida though the greek  expresses the  without dagesch  verse    addus the doctor has had very little regard to the context or he would not have placed this name opposite to barzillai in order to show clearly a great corruption for he might have been there informed that addus married augia one of the daughters of berzelus and was named after his name the word  in the vatican copy is rendered berzelus for the chaldaeans frequently changed the hebrew  into  or   i shall now endeavor to give you some proofs that dr kennicott has condemned the proper names and numbers of the present text of the old testament as being greatly corrupt without giving himself the trouble for any thing that appears in the catalogue to the contrary even to examine the original text and that he has contented himself with setting down the names and numbers merely as they occurred in the english translation  this is not less injustice than if a judge were to condemn a prisoner merely from the report given of him by others without permitting him to appear before him to answer for himself  my proofs of the doctors having merely copied the english version i shall take out of the book of esdras because with that i suppose he meant to correct the hebrew text  verse    he has taken the name sadas and the number      only from the english version for in the alexandrian copy it is  near to the hebrew azgad      and       in the vatican copy so that he trifles with the originals if he thinks in this manner to show their corruptions  verse    he has placed the number     to adonicam as in the english version of esdras whereas the vatican copy reads     and the alexandrian      verse    ananias is called  and  in the original greek  meterus is expressed by  in the original greek  verse    phasseron in the english version and the doctors catalogue has the number  0   but in the vatican copy it has  0   and in the alexandrian      carme as in the english version  0   whereas the vatican copy has only     and the alexandrian  0    verse    ladan as in the english which is  in the original  lastly the number of servants      is plainly a mistake copied from the english version for the original greek as well as the syriac version of the same is agreeable to the hebrew       now as many of the seeming differences which the reader as dr kennicott supposes in page  0   d dissertation will view with surprise are not to be found in the original but are occasioned by the doctors copying merely from the english version as many other differences in names are caused only by the changing of letters according to the common chaldaean mode of expressing hebrew words and therefore are not liable to the charge of corruption and as the most material differences between ezra and nehemiah are made by the doctors having placed the names in the order in which they stand in each writer which has caused him to compare names manifestly different as if meant for the same person so i must conclude all these things considered that not only the disposition of names but the whole performance is entirely unfair because the doctors motto leaves no room for allowances to be made for whatever may have occasioned the several seeming differences but condemns them indiscriminately with a bold insinuation of falsehood viz non potest verum asseri quod ita diversum est  the doctor in his printed sheet has indeed placed this motto close by the side of his quotation from the apocryphal book of esdras but it is plain that he intended thereby to censure the differences in the whole catalogue because he prefixed the same unjust motto to his first publication of the catalogue in his  d dissertation p  0   i call this motto unjust not only because it is there applied indiscriminately to a quotation from two canonical books of the old testament but because st jeromes authority is quoted for it as if he had applied the same words for the same purpose to the book of ezra though it appears very plainly by st jeromes preface to the said book that he was speaking only of differences in the various copies of the greek version when he made use of those words  but notwithstanding the many faults which i have found in the writings of this gentleman yet i have a much better opinion of him than to suppose that he will ever endeavor to evade my censure of his catalogue by alleging that he did not mean by it to show the corruptions of the original text but only of the common english translation which he has here copied word for word and that he meant the english translation where he has mentioned the present text of the old testament  i say notwithstanding the improbability that there is of the doctors ever seeking such an evasion yet he must excuse me if i endeavor to guard against any sort of shiftingoff from the point whatsoever  therefore i must observe that the text of any author cannot mean a translation especially when a person is speaking of corruptions in it for the corruption of any text must mean some wilful or accidental alteration from the original copy of the author  no person therefore speaking concerning the corruption in a translation of any book may say that they are corruptions of the present text of the said book because at the same time perhaps the real and original text contains none of those faults which he complains of  so that should the doctor have really only meant to expose some defects which he might imagine he had discovered in the english version though i cannot think that he intended any such thing by this catalogue yet it must appear to the eyes of all those who know him and his present undertaking as if these unjust censures were levelled at the original text itself  there are many other things i believe which might be alleged against this catalogue but i shall only beg leave to trouble the reader with two more  though there might be many jewish families called after the names of places as bethlehem ramah jericho etc yet perhaps dr k may have difficulty to prove that any jewish families were called telmelah telharsa cherub and addan  immer the next name being indeed an exception although he has placed them in his list of families under the running title of the children of  now if he had attended to the context even of the english translation he might have understood that these were really the names of places and not of families for we are there informed that the families afterward mentioned which went up from the said places sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found  another mistake he has likewise made in comparing cherub and addan the names of places in ezra and nehemiah with charaathalar and aalar the names of men mentioned by esdras though the context plainly shows that there were no other than what i say  i will not however insist on these two last articles because i presume that i have before sufficiently proved that this catalogue does not show most clearly the great corruption of proper names and numbers in the present text of the old testament  now lest my censure of this catalogue should seem to strike obliquely at dr kennicotts present undertaking of collating the heb mss which has been honored with the subscriptions of so many great and learned persons i think it necessary for my own sake as well as in justice to dr kennicott to declare that i think his collation of hebrew mss a very laudable and useful undertaking and that there cannot be the least objection to his new edition of the heb bible if printed according to the proposals offered by him in the year    0 viz  not with a new text but from one of the best editions already published having the various readings inserted at the bottom of every page  i am gentlemen your most humble servant granville sharp  the end
