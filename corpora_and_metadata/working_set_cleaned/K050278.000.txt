considerations on public credit in a letter to a member of parliament  london printed for j roberts near the oxfordarms in warwick lane mdccxxiv price fourpence  considerations on public credit sir according to your desire i give you some short considerations on public credit with a few remarks on what has happened within these last four years  by public credit under the present consideration is meant the value of the debts owing by the public commonly called the public funds  when these can be sold at market for the full value of the principal public credit may be esteemed good  when they can be sold for more then public credit is said to advance  the reason that these public funds have often varied in their value and been depressed in some extraordinary degree has chiefly arisen from the fear and apprehensions of their real security being in danger from foreign invasions force or violence were it not for these pannicks that every now and then possess mens minds the value of the principal would seldom alter in any great degree  common accidents in state affairs and the arts of stockjobbers will always have some influence  but lesser alterations in their value do very much depend on the rate of interest for money at the present or any expectation that it may suddenly alter  as for instance  if men apprehend a great demand of money for public service upon new wars and commotions and that new funds are to be created they will generally run into an opinion of turning as much as they can of their public debts into ready cash in hopes of making considerable gain by loans or purchasing such new funds  on the contrary  when the public is in a state of serenity and the interest of funds duly paid and no new debts are incurred there will then always remain a considerable surplus in the hands of private men every year to be invested again and if no new funds are erected there will be more buyers of the old ones  this naturally gives an advance to what we call public credit and tends to lessening the rate of interest  for so long as the public debts or funds are in reputation and carry an advance of price they are equal to so much money and are to be considered as so much real cash at least whilst books are open for their immediate transfer when sold  what influence then has such a bulk of money with respect to land or trade  as for trade it need only be said that plenty of money is the very life of it and also as it influences the rate of interest by which means the nation is enabled to carry on its commerce in some measure equal with its neighbors  but what respect has this to land  it is not many years ago since an unhappy distinction was set on foot between the landed and the moneyed interest from whence strange notions have been from time to time advanced to the great detriment of both  whereas these two interests are so mixed and blended together that they must be equally regarded by every one that would pursue the true interest of his country  in former times the value of land was reckoned by the quantity of cattle or of corn that it would produce and is so still in some northern parts  but since trade has been carried on in all the kingdoms of europe and by that means great quantities of coined money have been every where current and more especially in england the true value of an estate in land as well as all other things is only known by the sum of money it can be sold for  this value will always vary according to the plenty or scarcity of money  he that recollects and compares the present value of the landed estates in england with what they were fifty years behind us will certainly find a very great difference  four years purchase will amount to more than fifty millions for no body will suppose the land tax to be the truest rule to go by in such computations as these  and not only the value of a landed estate is thus increased by the plenty of money but the improvement of that estate is also much enlarged and the rents advanced  for as the product of land is more or less according to the stock that is employed upon it so will that stock naturally increase if money be stirring and interest at a low rate  if therefore the value of land be thus mended by the plenty of money and this plenty arises by the increase of public credit  it will follow  that if public credit be depressed the value of land will sink in some proportion  and no violence can be offered to what is called the moneyed interest but what will also affect the landed estate  public credit four years ago was at a very great straight and though legal interest was then at five per cent yet public debts that carried but four per cent were sold at par and some of them at more  there was then a hopeful opportunity for lessening the public debts and very easy had it been to have reduced the interest from five to four per cent which was the true way to have put the public funds upon the foot of discharging themselves by their own annual surplus  which surplus would have increased every year and by that means have still given a greater value to the funds and affected the rate of interest and consequently have raised the price of land in some proportion  this was the opinion and advice of men who were then thought to have some knowledge in the affairs of public credit  but this advice was rejected and a scheme put into the hands of some ambitious and avaritious men then in public station who pushed it through the last h of cns with impetuous violence and supported it with the grant of exorbitant powers  which powers had never been obtained without the additional aid of some in the landed interest who were drawn in some of them very innocently by the lucre of fictitious stock by which they were given to understand that if the project could be carried through they should be great gainers if not they could be no losers for they were to disburse no money  strange it is that such powers should ever have been put in the hands of men who had given no great proof of their knowledge in business relating to public credit and soon discovered themselves in the execution of those powers they were entrusted with  powers by which all men were invited and encouraged to become gamesters or to hazard their estates in an uncircumscribed lottery  and the common creditors of the public were in a manner constrained to bring in their annuities for fear of the exorbitant power given the south sea managers to lock up their estates during pleasure  but wherever the fault may be laid whether on the wild attempts of the south sea directors in the execution of their scheme or on the want of proper care in those who ought to have supervised the management or on the infatuation that spread by degrees over the whole nation  or whether the fault must be laid on all these put together the unhappy event was that it soon brought ruin on many great families and numbers of innocent deluded people were reduced from a comfortable way of living to poverty prisons and exile to see their families perish for want of bread and themselves to end their days in sorrow  could a perfect list be made of these unhappy sufferers what a dismal catastophre would it appear to future ages  whilst at the same time stockjobbing brokers and common gamesters were put in a capacity of leaving vast estates to their posterity  and this scheme did not only undo private families and bring confusion on our commerce to its inconceivable damage but it also brought the state it self into the utmost danger  happy was it for us that but few did know that we were so near the brink of ruin  for the south sea managers from mistaken notions about exchequer bills would needs imagine that the taking this branch of credit into their own hands would be of vast service to them  but when the shock came their error soon appeared for the exchequer was drained of specie and no suitable provision made for circulating the exchequer bills  for want of which the very foundations of current credit were like to have been blown up and a total stop of all payments must soon have followed  such a distress when the minds of men were agitated with fury violence and despair might have thrown the nation into an abyss of misery  and it was an unhappy circumstance at that time that his majestys affairs required his presence abroad  however the few that were left at helm interposed with their seasonable advice and assistance and perhaps upon a strict review it will be found that nothing else but such a jumblement of variegated measures as were then pursued could have preserved things in any tolerable order  the reflection on this unfortunate scheme is the more melancholy because it was established in opposition to another that was then thought by impartial men to be much more advantageous for the public  a proposal was forced from the bank for by the south sea scheme it plainly appeared that nothing less was intended than a demolition of that corporation  the proposal that thus came to be offered by the bank was founded on a plain natural scheme of the low rate interest was then reduced to  for it may be remembered that at the time of their proposal the annuities which carried   per cent interest and those which carried but   per cent were much about the same value at market  the reason of this was plain those at   per cent expected to be paid off by others who were willing to advance the money at   per cent  and therefore the  0 per cent offered by the bank as a proemium was nothing more than what the possessors of the annuities were willing to part with  or it may be thus stated  there was then a general disposition to write the annuities into bank stock at the rate of about  0 per cent advance twenty of which was to be given to the public the other thirty being added to the common stock of the bank would have enabled them to continue their dividend of   per cent for many years  which dividend would in all common events have supported their stock at a higher price  and there is no doubt but as things then stood the bank would have carried through their proposal without any great difficulty notwithstanding the dark insinuations to the contrary by some who have never yet thought fit to offer their objections in public  some indeed have imagined that if the banks proposal had been established they would have run into the same measures or have been driven at least by the warm heads of those times to the same excesses that the south sea fell into  but this was impossible  because the bank in their proposal had fixed a rate for all the long annuitants that would come in  and would certainly have set a propottionable one for the short annuities  if stock therefore was to be had at one certain rate for so great a sum as both sort of annuities amounted to there could be no room for such extravagant attempts  the proposal of the bank was indeed accepted and that it was afterward set by is owing to some men then in power who in a very extraordinary manner obtained leave for the south sea projectors to amend their scheme  this was the fatal mistake  for in the interim the men who were infatuated with their project and full of mississippi notions imagined with themselves that they might safely venture to outbid the cautious men of the bank  not considering that their proposal was founded upon the lowness of interest which was not possible to be maintained without the necessary methods of managing credit and these were not like to be compassed but by a bank when in the height of reputation  it is true the bank may be said to have run some hazard in their proposal had any unhappy accident fallen out during the short space in which it was to have been perfected  but as the event has been that tranquillity has attended our affairs abroad it seems most probable that they would have completed the proposal on their part  which would have been followed with peace at home and prevented plots and conspiracies founded upon the discontents of unhappy sufferers in the south sea  and also at this day have lessened the public debts near one sixth part  but whether any such scheme however profitable for the present was really fit to be established is not the subject of these considerations  be that as it will the opportunity is now lost and we are left to consider of proper measures for maintaining public credit which of late has begun to revive  this is not effectually to be done but by lessening the public debt for without some rational prospect of that mens hearts will fail the opinion of public security will languish and its value diminish  schemes and projects we have seen and the mischiefs that have attended em it will be time therefore to return to the safe method and that is the lowering of interest  not by force or violence no nor by coercive laws but by a regular steady careful attendance to its own natural motions  if interest shall settle but at the rate it was four years ago there would then be a fair expectation again that the funds appropriated to the public debts will in process of time discharge themselves by a gradual increase of the yearly surplus  and for the future support of credit it may be useful  that there should be repeated declarations and firm resolutions to maintain public faith  and that the annual expense of the public be reduced as far as ever the necessity and safety of affairs will permit  and also that the funds already established be managed with the utmost frugality probity and application  this last is a wide field and many things readily offer themselves which cannot be crowded in here it is sufficient to say there is room enough for improving the duties and lessening the extravagant charge in collecting  it is therefore humbly offered to the consideration of gentlemen to consider how far their own interest is concerned in the preservation of public credit  the value of their estates will be affected with its rise or fall  and supposing the public debts to be  0 millions and that cum should not be one sixth part of the landed estates their damage in case of any public calamity will in some measure be proportionable for though one may lose his whole and the other but his one sixth yet in one sense their loss will be equal  thus sir i have laid before you some thoughts that possibly may be of use to you in future debates  it must be owned it is a vast debt we have to encounter with  if we look back to the revolution and suppose at that time any one should have affirmed that in about thirty years the subjects would pay above   0 millions in taxes and that yet a debt should remain of  0 millions more it would have been thought utterly impossible  it is indeed amazing to think that wise and great men at the head of affairs should from time to time have run the nation into so great a debt  this with all the observation i could ever make seems to be owing to the frequent change of ministries in the late reigns  who by shifting hands and new friends never failed to establish new funds and create new debts for their present purposes  and it is pretty much owing to the same cause that there never was any suitable enquiry into the misapplication of public money nor the many frauds by which the public debts have been so much increased  those commissions generally ended in some jest or other and served chiefly to gratify the passions of one party in opposition to another without producing any real good to the public  it may be thought by some that it is not yet too late to enter upon so good a work but there have been so many acts of indemnity and our laws are so tender with respect to property especially when it has been once alienated that it is vain now to expect any public advantage by such enquires  he that would undertake any part therein will get nothing but envy and malice to himself and little or no profit to the public  another cause i know is assigned for this great debt which was chiefly accumulated in the last reign and that is that france being pressed with the war extended or rather forced paper money to a prodigious length and this obliged england as well as other of the allies to stretch their credit  but they ought to have considered that france by its dck power could reduce those debts as we find they have done but not without the impoverishment of their people  we have now indeed an opportunity of plowing with their heifer but those methods are so contrary to the liberties of our happy constitution that nothing of that nature can be attempted without hazard of the utmost confusion  if then we must remain with this heavy load upon us let us make it as useful as we can  and if it will tend to the multiplying our money or that which is near equal to it and thereby enrich our land and increase our trade let us improve it to these ends  i am sensible that many are frightened with the apprehension of great difficulties should we fall into any open war  yet i think that this heap of public credit may by a right management be rendered not only useful but highly advantageous in case of any defensive war and i have no notion of any other  but as i hope such a calamity is far distant from us i will not trouble you with any thing on that subject  i had thought also to have desired your assistance in preventing mischiefs by stockjobbing but when i consider how that gaming vice has tinged our morals i am afraid the times will not beat an adequate remedy  i am
