the occasional miscellany in prose and verse  consisting of a variety of letters written originally to a young gentleman who designed to go into holy orders with a specimen of sacred poetry and sermons  vol ii  by john wallis a m late of queen s college oxford  newcastle upon tyne printed by john gooding on the side       the sermons  to the reverend mr wastell rector of simonburn reverend sir i congratulate myself that unaccustomed as i am to make addresses of this public nature such a subject such a theme as yourself has presented you sir on whom even the unpracticed tongue must dwell with such rapture as to be at a loss rather where to stop than how to begin you who never have been detained by interest or indolence distracted by pleasure or diverted by sleep for so many years from the offices of friendship and humanity you who spend the recollective hour in the pleasing review of these virtues while others are pursuing the views of interest exploring new pleasures new preferments are reposing the body or unbending the mind in feasting in quadrille and diversion  had not your mind sir been enlightened by the sun of science you must have enjoyed by the almost divine intelligence of your own nature every good quality every amiable virtue and of yourself have acquired the love and veneration of mankind but now this intelligent improvable nature is assisted by polished education and regular study we see the lovely ideas you have drawn from their excellence by which you have regulated your conduct both as a minister and a magistrate and at once improved your head and your heart important lesson to the great to teach them what merit there is in an exalted mind or an inward grandeur of soul which gives majesty and splendour to every thought action or discourse  i should enlarge upon this topic but what i express is i am afraid unequal to what i feel and i forget that my business at present is not to search for materials but to set bounds to my dedication and if i err in any extreme it shall be that of too much caution rather than too little prudence for i would not willingly offend the delicacy of that virtue i so ardently desire to do justice to  there may be something in the dignity of persons raised very high above the rank of other men which may set them at perhaps too great a distance from the love of their inferiors and make us often pass them over with a silent fort of disregard especially if they are such as otway describes  who perched on fortunes top sit only watchful with their heavy wings  to cuff down newfledgd virtues which would rise  to glorious heights and make the grove harmonious    but he who in a station thus exalted above the wants and miseries of mankind can feel them with the tenderness of an equal while he relieves them with the beneficence of a superior whose heart is as open to the sentiments of urbanity and benevolence as his mind to the impressions of truth and justice such a person on all occasions deserves our utmost felicitations and applause and he need not blush to be followed through his hours of retirement or viewed in the milder light of domestic life  i shall only add sir that if any effulgence beams from the pages of the following work it must be owing more to your patronage which in the humblest manner it sues for and the candor of the goodnatured reader than any merit in the composer  i am reverend sir your much obliged and most obedient humble servant john wallis  the preface it is very observable that there is hardly any topic more discoursed of by the clergy to the people than that of the necessity of bringing all our actions under the rules of religion and making the wisdom of the christian spirit be the visible exercise and demonstrations of our love to god and yet i believe there is none less put in practice than this very thing it is ordinary to see men go to church and even fearful of being absent from thence and yet see them spend all the rest of their time by humor or chance just as if they never had been there or had heard nothing at all that concerned them and if you was to ask them the reason of their not living to such ends as are suitable to the glory of god and why their lives are not of the same nature with their devotions full of the same excellent spirit the same wisdom the same holiness and heavenly tempers they immediately would tell you that they live as well and as much unto god in all the ordinary occurrences and actions of their lives as the parson of their parish does very seldom does their christianity afford him a more respectful appellation and that they matter not what is said about wisdom or religion as long as they are sure they act as wisely and religiously as he meaning their minister and besides say they if there was any such necessity for bringing all our actions under the rules of religion or any excellency or wisdom in being of such a spirit as you talk of surely our parson would live otherwise than he does it is true we often hear him commend these things hugely in his sermons but we do not discover that in his ordinary life he aspires much more after it than ourselves  thus you see how malapert people are in their replies when they are asked to account for their unreasonable and absurd ways of life you no sooner can advise them to live by reason to study the perfection of their natures to model and frame their lives according to the doctrines of our blessed savior and his apostles to prescribe rules and ends to every action that relates to common life to let the wisdom of the christian spirit be the visible exercise and demonstration of their love to god to live as primitive saints in spiritual watching in holy fear and heavenly aspiring and earnest longing after immortality i say you can no sooner tell them of the practice of these things but they think you talk exceeding strangely and that you seem like st paul at athens a setter forth of odd kind of doctrines and instead of returning you a modest answer bid you look at the clergy thinking thereby to stop your mouth at once  the truth is these people perceive that some of the clergy in their way of life their usual manner of spending their time and fortunes their inquietudes cares and fears in their recreations pleasures and indulgences in their spiritual labors daily business and devotions they are not much unlike the rest of the world this is it that makes the libertine and the fop the careless and inconsiderate part of mankind set so little estimation on the exact piety and regular devotions of industrious clergymen because they see the devotions of others extend no farther than the reading of prayers and preaching of sermons and those they allege sometimes are none of their own and when divine service is over they live no more unto god till the time of performing it returns again but live by the same humor and fancy and in as full a fruition of the follies of life as other men  no wonder then that ministers the messengers of the king of heaven meet with so little respect in the discharge of their sacred employment they do not all burn it seems with zeal for the salvation of souls and study to redeem children unto god some of them appear to have no other spirit of religion but that of occasional worship their chief and ruling tempers it is said if examined according to the main and greatest articles of their lives or the most glorious doctrines of the gospel have but little of the spirit of an apostle but little conformity to the wisdom purity and holiness of the christian spirit but little heavenly love suitable to the high expectations of another life but little humility but little poverty of spirit though it is recommended by our savior as the noblest state of the soul of man but little forbearance and longsuffering but little condescension to the weaknesses and infirmities of their brethren but little love for their excellencies give but little encouragement to their virtues but little relief in their wants have little rejoicing in their prosperity and in a word as little compassion in their distress  these may be some of the many reasons perhaps why the names of parson priest and levite are become names of reproach and a byeword amongst the people  palmerius they tell you is a sober temperate clergyman of considerable preferment in the world but of little reputation with his parishioners his living being about a hundred pound a year he has farmed it out to a poor tenant for forty pounds more than any tenant could possibly pay and keep body and soul as we say together comfortably as he has two churches that require attendance once at each place every sunday and he does not choose to reside there himself but rather six or seven miles from it so he makes it matter of conscience to maintain a curate that is as little beloved as himself of the same tempers and equally vain in his desires whom he hires to look after the souls of a large parish at as low and reasonable a rate as a man of notorious temperance can be had  palmerius has a great value for our present government and a like esteem of our common prayer is reckoned very orthodox in his discourses and as often as he visits his parish which is as often as he has rent to take or the holy sacrament to administer he is commonly very laborious in giving them a good sermon out of brady or tillotson to convince his hearers of the necessity and importance of running the race that is set before them  palmerius has had no great reason they say to complain of ill fortune in the course of his ministry only he has had those inquietudes cares and fears that they have who are worldly or earthlyminded in their employments and are carried on with vain desires and covetous tempers the stubbornness and ill nature of his parishioners the neglect and remissness of his predecessor the torment uneasiness and vexation he had in ejecting an old tenant are often the subjects of his conversation and though he enjoys better than two hundred pounds a year yet the want of higher preferment is a great pressure upon his spirits  palmerius is full of esteem for show and equipage and fine buildings he has lately consumed some part of his wifes fortune in erecting a new structure to the end of his parsonagehouse not with a design ever to live in it but for his better appearance as often as he comes among his parishioners and is now very angry at the builders of the old dwelling for placing the windows toward the churchyard it being so melancholy a sight he says never to have any thing before ones eyes but tombs gravestones and repositories for the dead  he cannot endure it and therefore is resolved to turn them another way  now if you was to wait upon palmerius at his house they tell you you would find him the companion of the silliest people in their most silly pleasures fond of every impertinent entertainment and diversion full of esteem for quadrille a great admirer of plays and most of the ludicrous pamphlets that come from the press an admirable lover of an idle gossiping conversation and if there is any misrepresentation of the character of a person or any ill report that tends to the diminution of his good name or the prosperity of his condition against whom he allows himself in foolish hatreds and resentments you may be sure it loses nothing by being told by palmerius nay if nothing can be said in prejudice of the party so disrespected palmerius will most commonly trump up something or other to tell those with whom he lives in foolish friendships and fondnesses who are no sooner behind his back but they laugh at him to see his poor vulgar way of resentment  but the best of it say they is palmerius never swears any or utters any oaths unless it is upon occasion when his coachman and servants do not please him and then no more than becomes a gentleman of his spirit and distinction  again they tell you if you was to be with palmerius but for one day you would hardly miss of hearing him tell of the beauty fashion and richness of the furniture of his house of the neatness and regularity of his gardens the commodiousness of his summer house and the loveliness of his fish ponds nay sometimes he would be so trifling as to tell you of the quantity of his poultry how he rises early every morning to feed them and which chicken he designs to kill next  thus you see what a mixture of ridicule the world observes in the life of palmerius and what sort of conclusions are drawn from it is but too evident men are glad to find their teachers set them such copies in vice and immorality and are never so well pleased as when they find such as palmerius give them a plea for their sins  but now if such as palmerius to be even with the world would but renounce all their evil habits and tempers and idle dispositions their fondness for great preferment show and distinction their selflove pride and indulgence their foolish friendships and groundless hatreds their levity of mind and trifling spirit their vain ways of consuming their time and money their love for silly diversions and corrupt conversation would they but deny themselves the practice of these things and propose to themselves the example of some primitive clergyman in the church who lived in its best and purest ages who durst not allow himself in the indulgence of any even the least of these tempers how soon would they redeem the dying honor of the priesthood restore its ancient purity stop the mouths of careless and worldly men and make the ministry become again a glorious ministry then beautiful would be the lives of those who attend at the altar of our lord and savior jesus christ then the people would have no reason to complain unless it was because they could not serve praise and glorify god enough  i could wish that men of known wisdom power and authority would in imitation of our blessed lord dare to break through all the irreligious customs derisions and oppositions of the world and speak more zealously of god and religion and more heartily of serious truths for by this they would highly promote the christian cause and gradually recover the primitive holiness and apostolic stedfastness by this they would fill heaven with saints and finish a kingdom of eternal glory unto god in a word by this they would confirm and edify good men in their piety and insensibly work upon evil ones for by setting before them such a regular and uninterrupted pattern of virtue and goodness they would either be inclined to imitate it or at least be restrained from being so barefacedly wicked and so scandalously abandoned as now they are  the contents sermon i ii iii the practice

sermon i   timothy and part of the  th verse but godliness is profitable unto all things having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come godliness comes strongly recommended to our practice when rivers of pleasure are placed on her right hand and in her left riches and honor rewards are always looked upon as great incentives to act well in the various scenes of life and one would imagine that mankind would endeavor in some measure to make their goodness proportionable to the present good they receive or to the reward in reversion but notwithstanding the several promises of present as well as future happiness made to the just and upright man in scripture and though men perceive that then they are the most happy when they act up to the dictates of unbiased reason and follow the precepts laid down in the gospel and though they have the sure word of god that piety will be finally rewarded in another world yet for all this men will forsake the paths of wisdom whose ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace and pursue what is the very reverse of godliness and religious wisdom folly and irreligion were men once induced to think that godliness is great gain that it gives health to the body and marrow to the bones and gives what nothing in this vale of tears will afford peace and tranquillity of mind we might then expect in the moral world what always obtains in the natural harmony and an uniformity of action but some as if piety tended to nothing but the propagation of misery in the world pursue what they think the most consummate happiness the deceitful paths of sensual pleasure such indeed show signs of joy but are never truly joyful even in the midst of their jollity and lewd mirth the heart is sad and they cure at least they endeavor to cure themselves of what is the peculiar privilege of a reasonable man reflection their mirth indeed is like a storm loud and not lasting they run from toy to trifle from vanity to vice and run through the whole unsatisfactory circle of amusements in order that they may more effectually forget the design of their creation and the very end of their being  besides these sensualists some there are who having the form of godliness want the power of it such as these the apostle in some verses preceding my text bids timothy reprehend these men forbad to marry and commanded to abstain from meats and were more careful in the observance of some ceremonies than in the cultivation of the substantial duties of christianity such senseless and fabulous traditions of these jewish teachers timothy is exhorted to reprove and discountenance because bodily exercise that is external observances which they pretend to be so strict in profit little and are of no moment in true religion whereas godliness that is the practice of all christian graces has all possible advantages having the express promise of the life that now is and of a certain reward in the next from the words thus explained and in order to encourage you in the practice of religious wisdom i shall consider these following propositions i that religion has a direct tendency to promote our present happiness in this life and ii that such a religion that has such a tendency carries an internal evidence of its divinity along with it and therefore iii it ought to be embraced not only upon account of its divinity or future rewards it proposes but because our happiness even in this life is consulted by it     then i am to consider that religion has a direct tendency to promote our present happiness in this life  as our duty to god our neighbor and ourselves is comprehended under the word religion i shall endeavor to show how our present happiness is promoted by a strict observance of each of these duties  and first with respect to god  god is a being from whom we have received every good and perfect gift in whom we live and move and have our being we are indebted to him for our creation preservation and more particularly for our redemption no wonder then considering the great advantages we have received from him that he has exacted from us obedience to his just commands and that he might encourage us his rebellious creatures who are more prone to evil than goodness in the way that leads to eternal life he has so blended our duty with our interest that we cannot neglect the former without manifestly losing the latter would we enjoy riches honors and the several blessings of life and would we make our very enemies to be at peace with us we have our saviors own word for it that if we seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness all other things shall be added unto us and if we return good for evil and benefits for works of malice we thereby heap coals of fire upon our enemy and melt him into kindness benevolence friendship would we enjoy contentment peace of mind and a conscience void of offense which is the only happiness in this state of miscry if we honor god and keep his commandments we shall be content and our minds serene undisturbed with bitter reflections and freed from the gnawings of a troubled conscience conscience must be a troublesome tormenting companion to the wicked but unto the godly it is health and the balsam of life when storms arise and poverty comes upon the good man like an armed man when friends those beings of a summers day forsake him in his adversity and leave his cooler shade for the warmer habitation of the son of fortune or when detraction and envy those malicious attendants upon goodness would blacken the reputation of the good man or when in short natural evil under variety of shapes makes his days uncomfortable and his whole life a burden even in these scenes of horror and severe hours of trial the good mans confidence is in the lord his god who is his present help in time of trouble and rock of salvation in the day of calamity he considers these light afflictions as marks of gods love and paternal tenderness inflicted not only upon account of the many failings he is by nature liable to but in order to awake the sleeping sparks of piety in him which in the day of prosperity are too apt to be nigh extinguished david thought it an happiness when he was afflicted for then he turned to god and called his ways to remembrance thus he obtained what some thoughtless libertines at the solemn hour of death would give the whole world to obtain peace of mind and a pleasing prospect of future happiness in the mansions of the just  god too besides the prospect of an eternal weight of glory has anexed to our duty of loving him a secret internal intellectual pleasure this selfcomplacency every good man enjoys which makes him with the greater steadiness embrace the one thing needful we are never better pleased than when we are grateful for benefits received we cannot help expressing our joy by the serenity of our countenances and our inward tranquillity by our outward demeanor and expressions of thankfulness if gratitude be attended as it certainly is with such pleasure rather to be conceived than expressed when it is performed toward our fellow creatures what must the pleasure be when god our creator preserver and redeemer is the object of our gratitude then for want of words to signify the greatness of the favors conferred upon us and to demonstrate our incapacity to give god his due praise and proper honor we melt into an affectionate tenderness are ravished with the superabundant goodness and are lost in thought and silent wonder this is a joy the good the religious few only know the wicked that either deny god in speculation or forget him in practice are untter strangers to this still permanent unspeakable joy their joy like a dream or the morning dew passes away and is gone and even the recollection of such joy resembles often too much the frightful appearance in some dream which never occurs to the imagination without horror  the good mans happiness is best illustrated by drawing a portrait of the wicked mans condition  were happiness attainable solely by impiety and were it proportionable to a mans proficiency in wickedness there would be then some temptation to live without god at least without supposing a superintendant being in the world but as things are now constituted it is our interest to be pious the wicked man notwithstanding his commission of wickedness with greediness yet in his more serene hours when conscience is suffered to act the judge declares that he has no pleasure in sensuality his appetites are strong craving restless indulgence strengthens them enjoyment makes them craving and continual exercise upon unlawful objects makes them restless and never to be satisfied pleasure is generally the object of the appetites but pleasure like quicksilver eludes our utmost skill and grant it is obtained what is it but rank poison in our veins moral is generally productive of natural evil gluttony produces a complicated scene of disorders variety of pain torture woe the drunkard takes his glass with a quivering hand the lascivious man is a living whited sepulcher whose inward parts are one continued scene of misery corruption rottenness and what is the most lamentable of all his soul because of its intimate union with the body contracts a greater impurity but supposing the wicked man not intemperate and luxurious yet if he be covetous he must be perplexed with many excruciating thoughts and his body is generally a fit emblem of the leanness of his soul care about what he at present enjoys fears of losing anxiety about increasing his possessions cunning contrivances how to overreach the unwary and hellish schemes in order to grind the face of the poor must make the covetous man amidst his abundance of all men the most miserable when a man is thus oppressed with the weight of worldly care he has no room for or relish of what gives the greatest pleasure to a rational soul the agreeable consciousness of having pleased god and what pleasure can such a man take in honoring god who in his life denies his very being is not he conscious that he has set up the golden idol and worshipped it in opposition to the true the living god and if such a one does pray to and praise god yet how can he expect a blessing when he does not honor his maker with his substance will not his prayers be rather turned into sin since his hypocrisy demonstrates his mockery of that being who is a jealous and a terrible god unhappy then must be the case of this miserable man if he cannot forget god in thought as well as practice recollection must be terrible and apprehension of a future state where all must be rewarded according to their works especially in time of sickness or at the hour of death must be an agonizing pain and a sort of foretaste of misery which the damned only feel in such a state god appears to him frowning unmerciful vindictive this dismal notion naturally throws him into an amazement horror despair and he desires what is in such a situation the ardent desire of the most abandoned that he might live yet a little longer and that he might at last die the death of the righteous and that his latter end might be like his but god the good the gracious the merciful who long bore with the repeated transgressions of the wicked man in expectation that he would repent and amend and consider at last what belonged to his peace now cuts him off in the midst of his sins and leaves him to the dismal apprehension of approaching judgment if men would really consider this melancholy state of the wicked man and that there is no peace unto him either in time or in eternity if they would seriously consider the almost infinite difference between a life of misery and a life of real pleasure even in this state of probation they would no longer be tempted to sin by their lawless passions or by the agreeableness of any object  but unhappy for us it is that we often resist the good motions of gods ordinary grace within us are little attentive to the voice of the charmer charm she never so wisely and reject the common means of salvation which god has graciously vouchafed us and though all things in the creation are serious and perform the several offices agreeable to their respective natures yet man endued with reason and for whom god died as if he had no returns of gratitude to make for the many favors received either trifles away life unthinkingly or is lost between sinning and repenting or follows what is the destruction of all solid intellectual pleasure in this life the low gratifications of sense for a season and certainly that man who prefers the body to the soul the mortal to the immortal part little deserves the rank he obtains among rational beings for we then show greatest signs of rationality when we answer the end of our creation and we then answer the end of our creation when we perform a rational worship toward our best benefactor god almighty and we are then best pleased with ourselves and therefore best pleased with those about us when we show by our words and works that we are at peace with god  besides we then have the most intense pleasure when our souls are the least conversant with material objects the body has been always reckoned a clog to the soul in her operations she cannot think with her native freedom but is cramped in her speculations often lost in the mists of error whilst human science is the object of her contemplation yet notwithstanding that the appearance of truth and the solution of any difficulty delights the soul with such a sensible pleasure that speculative men think it an ample reward for the labor of the brain and such has been the force of this rational pleasure that it has reclaimed the libertine and made him neglect the beauty of the body for the neverfading beauties of the mind if such be the pleasure as it certainly is when we deal in human science what must be the pleasure arising from the knowledge of ourselves and a contemplation of that being from whom we receive every good and perfect gift who is there of so hardened a nature as to receive no grateful sensations from the consideration of gods love in the redemption of fallen man and is not this pleasure greatly augmented by the additional consideration of our being adopted thereby into the number of the sons of god this is comfortable assistance under every circumstance of life when storms arise or when the wicked triumph or when death that king of terrors threatens to cut the thread of life it is a present help in time of trouble and is to the good man what orpheuss lyre is said to be to the miserable in the infernal regions a soothing cordial in calamity and makes him almost forget even in torture and misery that he is miserable  as the loving and honoring god is attended with such exquisite pleasure so likewise from the performance of our duty to our neighbor we receive recompenses of pleasure suitable to our several acts of beneficence as ye would that men should do unto you even do ye likewise unto them is the grand gospelprecept upon which hang all the law and the prophets if men would observe strictly this behavior toward one another there would be no longer wars and bickerings among us but rather because we expect gentleness civility and complaisance and honorable behavior from other men we ought to put on the same amiable conduct in order to gain what may be wished for rather than expected in the world peace and unanimity of sentiments a virtuous conduct however though it does not always gain a suitable return yet affords a suitable reward for the performance of it no man does a virtuous action without perceiving a secret satisfaction in the doing of it so that virtue in this sense it its own reward in this life and has a direct tendency to promote our present as well as future happiness but every action that is attended with a mental pleasure may not be virtuous men that are strongly affected at seeing miserable objects are even forced by their natural make and constitution to contribute to the relief of such misery and when they are relieving others they at the same time relieve themselves of an uneasiness and consequently do themselves a pleasure but as they do not give relief to the distressed because god has commanded it their communication of such relief is no virtue and therefore of no moment in the sight of god and i am afraid that such giving of alms which is looked upon as a covering for a multitude of sins but too often will only meet with its reward here and yet we may pronounce it a great happiness that some rich men are so softly constituted by nature that they will perform an action in order to free themselves from a present uneasiness when they would not have done it for the sake of a fellow creature or because god has commanded it to have a feeling sense however of anothers misery is reckoned a happy temperament of body which is generally productive of benevolence and benevolence is an incentive to beneficence and beneficence if we do it not for the relieving our own minds or for the sake of popular applause will lead us to rivers of pleasure in a future state besides then the natural pleasure of doing a virtuous action the consequent satisfaction of having pleased god is an additional spur to moral goodness but if we will not be religious or in other words perform our duty to god or our neighbor because of the pleasure attending them yet one would imagine we would be dutiful to ourselves  as the practice of virtue is the health of the soul so is it likewise the health of the body our bodies are generally the most freed from pain when we conform to the gospel rules the meek shall inherit the earth because he is free from passion and violence from haughtiness and turbulency the temperate in all things is able to fight the good fight and to finish his course with joy because he keeps the body in subjection to the mind whereas those who are led by their passions are tormented both in body and mind the angry man is often distracted with pains in the head breast stomach and no wonder since one irregularity naturally produces another and since anger is occasioned by an irregular flow of blood into the head it is no wonder that pain is consequent upon such a motion because a too great distension of the vessels is naturally productive of pain the intemperate man too for the same reason though arising from different causes is most tormented with pain the top of his head to the sole of his foot reminds him of his luxury gluttony drunkenness the envious man by his emaciated body gives us a demonstrative proof of the uneasiness he labors under his body is a sufficient emblem of the weakness of his mind and when there is such a connection and sympathy between the soul and body the one cannot suffer without the other and the body then is most distempered under a wounded spirit so true is the wise mans observation that envy is the rottenness of the bones  if then we would be just to ourselves we should practice the moral virtues if we will not do that for our souls health let us at least for the ease of the body for every man that indulges his passions in any criminal pursuit offends not only against god reason or his own soul but likewise against his own body a violation of chastity is a sin committed against the body and all other vices of whatever complexion they be or however they be colored over by the specious glosses of designing men are nevertheless destructive to the body as well as the soul  a general when he delivers a castle to be defended by any inferior officer charges him to stand firm to his post to repair the breaches an enemy has made to strengthen the old fortifications by new works to stock himself with arms and ammunition men and money and after all to use diligence prudence and precaution that he may not be attacked by surprise or be betrayed by the cowardice or treachery of his garrison this is the very case of man god has assigned him a post to defend against his adversary the devil he is to arm himself with the sword of the spirit the breast plate of righteousness and the helmet of salvation and after he has done all to stand to be collected in himself and to repair the breaches sin has made and fortify himself with good resolutions that he may not be surprised to injure his body or soul by the beauty or attraction of surrounding objects by a deluding imagination or strong affections from within if he thus performs his duty to god to his neighbor and himself he will receive particular satisfaction from the practice of each of these duties and he will be inclined to think that that religion must be divine which has so well blended our duty with our interest and has made our present happiness depend upon our present goodness which was the second thing i proposed to treat of in this discourse but i must with gods leave omit it for another opportunity  now to god the father god the son and god the holy ghost be ascribed as is most due all honor praise might majesty and dominion both now and ever amen  sermon ii   timothy iv and part of the  th verse but godliness is profitable unto all things having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come whatever tends to the happiness and perfection of mans being should be the object of every mans desires for this reason whatever has a direct tendency to make us lovely and amiable in our lives whatever if steadily practiced will consequentially add vigor to the body and be perfective of the better part of us our souls whatever is commendable and praiseworthy if there be any virtue or any praise we ought not only to think of but desire and not only desire but pursue with that heroic constancy which not only becomes a man but something more than mere man the good christian  all laws or systems of laws which are or have been enacted in the world ought principally to regard the good of the community for which they were enacted now if any be found deficient in this respect and are either contrived to promote partial selfish ends or contain something shocking to reason and disagreeable to human nature in them we may with good reason when proposed to our understandings consider them as the invention of frail man but if on the contrary we should have the good fortune to meet with a system of laws every way calculated to make us wise just and good and naturally contributing to the obtaining of that which all men pretend they are in pursuit of present happiness we might then with the greatest justice conclude that the author of them must be an allwise and good being who best understanding the several relations we stand in to one another knew how to draw us even by violence by the cords of love and the bond of peace to consult what every pretender to reason ought to consult his present as well as future happiness  for this reason the gospel considered merely as a system of laws ought to merit our attention and may reasonably claim a fair and candid examination from every rational enquirer who though he regards a future state as a chimera would only be happy in this world which when compared to a more glorious mansion of the just may be emphatically styled the very shadow of being  and if upon a fair examination it shall appear that nothing is enjoined us in the sacred oracles as a duty but what will by the constant exercise of it make us happier we shall then be inexcusable if we neglect so great and at the same time so unmerited salvation for such it may be termed if it has a natural tendency to free us from what is consequent upon unrestrained appetites a distempered body or from that greatest of all calamities which can befall degenerate man a wounded spirit that the practice of religious wisdom is attended with such a freedom the experience of every good man abundantly testifies so that if you will not believe an inspired writer believe what any of you may experience that godliness is profitable unto all things having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come in a former discourse upon which words i proposed to consider the following propositions i that religion has a direct tendency to promote our present happiness in this life and ii that such a religion that has such a tendency carries an internal evidence of its divinity along with it and therefore iii it ought to be embraced not only upon account of its divinity or future rewards which it proposes but because our happiness even in this life is consulted by it   the first of these propositions i have already considered by endeavoring to show that godliness that is religion consists in our duty to god our neighbor and ourselves and that a constant perseverance in welldoing in these several branches of our duty was the only happiness which can in this life be properly called so or ever be obtained and as religion produces such an happy effect we may justly conclude that its origin is divine which was the second thing i proposed to consider  it has been the constant observation of the unprejudiced part of mankind that ever gave themselves liberty to think that the productions of men always were attended with some failures which sufficiently discovered the imperfections of their several authors systems of laws that were contrived for the promotion of the happiness of the particular communities for which they were made not only discovered the corruption into which men in general were fallen but likewise the degeneracy of their compilers it would indeed be unnatural for us to expect that perfect purity should flow from a corrupted heart for interest or inclination or both those two great enemies to truth too often hoodwink what should always supposing the want of revelation determine the will the rational faculty and that this should be the case with frail humanity that sees but through a glass darkly and that too with the additional disadvantages of having a dense medium to see through the passions and prejudices which divert the rays of truth from entering in a proper disposition to inform the understanding it is no wonder since streams that flow through minerals always contract the qualities of the bodies through which they run and doctrines like streams can never flow pure when either the fountains or the channels through which they are conveyed are impure it is observed indeed that like water which as it runs refines mens notions about moral good and evil continually improved as they flowed down the stream of time from father to son but notwithstanding that some imperfection some bad principle after all their researches discovered itself to disgrace human nature and even their best notions had little weight in them because they wanted those sanctions which every rule of action should be attended with rewards and punishments  the christian scheme or the rule of life delivered to us in the gospel whose end and aim is the perfection of our natures is in itself entirely perfect it is to us what the tree of knowledge was to our first parents the knowledge of good and evil but with this material memorable difference to them it was the knowledge of variety of pain misery death but to us it is not only the tree of knowledge but of life whofe root though fixed in earth yet loses its top in heaven by the kindly assistance of whose branches we may though with difficulty ascend to that happy kingdom where reigns universal righteousness and therefore universal harmony the heavenly jerusalem  whatever then has a direct tendency to make us perfect just and good must immedidiately if heartily practiced make us happier and the contrivance of such means must be attributed to a good benevolent being who best understanding our natures knew best how to prescribe what was the most productive of happiness for this reason we may justly imagine that god gave us the gospel dispensation which both for the excellency of its precepts and universality of their extent can claim no other original  no religion in the world that was planned by mere man ever prescribed universal benevolence to man love and charity was only to extend to guests friends citizens to this confined contracted sphere was heathen benevolence extended till the dayspring from on high the sun of righteousness shone in their hearts and melted them into tenderness compassion benevolence hence their hearts were enlarged and in their understandings there sprang up a light which soon dispelled the mists of ignorance and directed their wandering steps through the mazes of error to something more desirable than all the volumes of vanity and empty deceit in the world the glorious gospel covenant  the benevolence which it proposes is universal as christ loved us so are we to love one another as the benefits of christs passion diffused itself through the whole rational part of the creation so is our benevolence to be circumscribed by no particular time place or person but like its great author its circumference is to be no where and its center every where  such a benevolence as this which is entirely suited to mans nature and is necessarily productive of his happiness as it is attended with complaisance humility sincerity charity hospitality and a delight in pleasing and every other laudable perfection must take its rise from divinity for if we take a view only of the several sects which deviate from the gospelpurity we shall find them so far from cultivating an universal benevolence that they are ready to pronounce damnation on those that differ from them only in sentiment in forms ceremonies or any other matters merely indifferent but such severe judges ought to consider that when they mingle their own contracted notions with the gospelprecepts they not only dishonor god by such an unnatural composition but also by a sour moroseness of temper destroy that cheerful benevolent disposition which is one grand characteristick of every good christian  no greater internal evidence for the divinity of the sacred writings can be produced than benevolence which almost in every page is taught and not only taught but enforced by example it strikes at the root of all these passions which for the destruction they bring upon the peace of all society are emphatically styled the diseases of the mind where it has rivetted itself into the heart of man there is no envy because a neighbor is more prosperous no hatred for real or supposed injuries no revenge because it is referred to the execution of that being to whom alone vengeance belongs it excludes anger and all the degrees of it except it has for its object that most deformed and the most pernicious of all objects sin and it excludes in short all sorrow all godly sorrow excepted which extends itself not only to a mans own failures in duty but likewise to the infirmities vices and unmerited misfortunes of others but all repining and murmuring at the wise dispensation of providence and all sorrowing for injuries and disappointments received from men are utterly unwarranted by this gospelbenevolence for we are not only to wish but to forward the salvation of all men even of our most inveterate enemies that they seeing our good works may at last be restored to the paths of peace and be excited to a glorious emulation to glorify together with us our father which is in heaven and if we love god and believe him endued with every possible perfection we can never repine at his proceedings but whether he gives us health or sickness prosperity or adversity we must conclude it wisest justest best  and as benevolence keeps the mind free from all hurtful passions so does it likewise restrain the possessor of it from every thing bad in practice no man can be unjust and at the same time benevolent for love works no ill to his neighbor and therefore nothing bad in practice can be consequent upon it no man that sincerely wishes his neighbors welfare will defraud him or spoil him of his goods will injure his person or endeavor to take away that which is more precious than life to every good man reputation no man in short that has this benevolent principle will deal in deceit censoriousness contention but rather because he considers himself as a member of this great society the world and also as designed for a more durable mansion in heaven he will practice every social virtue by the assistance of which he may more effectually ascend thither where true joys are only to be found  this principle however good as it is in its tendency is but little practiced in the world and it would be less so if god was not proved the author of it most men are naturally selfish angry revengeful few men even under the gospel have a general respect but fewer have universal benevolence for their fellow creatures men should respect one another because they are partakers of the same common natures should love another because god is the creator and preserver of every individual and we should forward each others salvation because the lamb of god condescended to empty himself of his glory and gave us a life inimitable both for its benevolence and also for the beneficence exhibited by it  not so unthinking man he as if wiser than the god that made him will not love his friends much less his enemies he returns hatred too often for good will and ingratitude for works of the greatest kindness he can expose to ridicule the infirmities of friends and in order to show his malevolence can for the diversion of his acquaintance murder their reputation he can scatter his arrows firebrands and death and yet he can have the modesty to say am not i in sport to such a one may be applicable that observation in the fable what is sport to thee is death to me nay to suffer thus in reputation is worse than death a natural death is generally finished in the twinkling of an eye but a moral one the death of reputation continues not only too often with life but likewise extends itself beyond the grave the horrid spectre is too maliciously conjured up not to excite paleness the attendant upon fear but blushes in the innocent faces of posterity better it is to be silent than to be witty at the expense of innocence better it is to be deemed a man of narrow thought than to show by our much speaking that we think neither humbly of ourselves nor heartily of our neighbors and there is no greater argument of a fool than a multitude of bad words inconsistent with common honesty  the nature of man being thus prone to deeds of darkness ill nature and defamation what could be invented as a more proper remedy for it than the gospel benevolence and can it be imagined that the heart of man would contrive such a cure is it in the least probable that man who is by nature selfish and revengeful would himself make laws which neither he nor the rest of mankind would follow or would he enforce these laws with proper sanctions when they contradicted the natural bent of his temper and supposing that he saw the expediency of such laws could he for that reason imagine that men would follow them merely because he prescribed them but would not a too great fondness for self covetousness pride envy and false honor prevent the enacting of such salutary laws as we find inculcated in the gospel would meekness forgiveness of injuries and humility be prescribed as practicable convenient or commendable would charity that great law of kindness which comprehends almost all virtues be so much as thought of much less practiced supposing that it had not descended with its great author from heaven and since men do not practice these virtues commanded by god himself would they have thought them suited to mans nature if man had prescribed them the truth is man is prone to sin and averse to goodness his passions are strong and apparent good is genenerally their object hence arises the neglect of precepts every way adapted to promote private as well as public happiness hence men act contrary to conviction and receive doctrines for good which they may intend indeed to pay a regard to but never do practice but when men are grown old in sin they would willingly carve out for themselves principles every way suitable to their practice hence christianity is rejected and the dictates of corrupted reason i should say passion are substituted in its place hence is corruption patronised by the pretended light of nature and universal benevolence is lost in a low sneaking particular selfishness if men were left to themselves and there was no established form of worship we would soon see what destruction would be brought upon the gospel every one would adopt or reject precepts as they saw them agree or disagree with their several interests every one would have their favorite path to tread in till at last they would leave no remains of the gospelpurity a no small argument this that man never contrived the gospelscheme for it is impossible that we should ever gather grapes of thorns of figs of thistles or that a corrupt tree should ever bring forth good fruit  as the excellency then of the gospelprecepts sufficiently prove the divinity of their author so likewise does the universality of their extent they are calculated not as the jewish dispensation for a peculiar people but for the benefit and happiness of every nation under heaven all laws that ever appeared before the gospel covenant only extended to particular communities only obliged those for whom they were made and some of them ought not to have been obligatory because they were disagreeable to reason and consequently were detrimental to society whereas the gospellaws because the happiness of all men is their constant object are for that reason supposing their divinity could not be proved obligatory for when laws are as all laws should be founded on reason no man can reject them as unreasonable and therefore those who disregard them must do violence to their reason and consequently are inexcusable both in the sight of god and man that the gospel contains a reasonable service every one that has practiced the rules comprehended therein can best tell and if it appears that the observance of them shall make one man as happy as this state is capable of why may not all men be happy for the same reason and that all men may be happy by the constant and uniform practice of the gospelrules every mans unbiassed reason as well as experience will inform him and if it could be demonstrated which indeed is impossible that these rules were not productive of universal good then there might be some excuse pleaded for the not receiving of them but as infinite love for the human race was the great motive for the promulgation of these rules and as the divine love was the very basis and foundation of them so is love said to be the fulfilling of the law for no man can be a breaker of it that truly loves his god his neighbor and himself happy would the people be who are in such a case yea happy the people who follow the rules prescribed by their god  but it may be asked if our love and benevolence must be universal must we for that reason offend no man are we not commanded to rebuke them that sin before all and yet are we not commanded to follow peace with all men to this it may be answered that if by disobliging and offending some persons we can do them the greater good if we can reform and save them or however can promote the public happiness by disturbing their repose more than by leaving them in tranquillity then it is that considerations of peace so far cease as they are inconsistent with piety and charity for it is for the good of mankind that vices of what complexion soever should be discouraged as they have an immediate tendency to bring on the ruin of societies kingdoms and even the destruction of the whole earth hence it is the duty of every christian to endeavor at least to oppose the overflowing of ungodliness that the guilty might be reformed and the innocent not be hurried away in the mighty torrent if by rebuking the sinner we can reclaim him from the error of his ways we give the greatest instance of charity and by saving a soul alive we cover a multitude of sins if the swearer blasphemer drunkard libertine and all the black catalogue of sinners enumerated by st paul could be terrified into goodness by harsh expressions or where those gentler methods fail by severer treatment would we not in so doing perform a deed of charity and contribute thereby to the glory of god to behave thus indeed in these our days when gravity is thought moroseness and sanctity of manners hypocrisy when the infamous mirth of the son of fortune is every where preferred to the man of sense when to preserve ones integrity one must avoid the conversation of most men when modesty that great guard of virtue is laughed out of countenance when the smooth tongue lying face and corrupted heart are more valued than simplicity sincerity and a regular tenor of good actions when the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life make men either infidels or something worse than infidels careless christians in such times to rebuke such vices as these requires a great deal of goodness an unwavering resolution clear courage and a zeal according to knowledge  but all these beforementioned roots of bitterness that branch out with great luxuriance from the heart of man might easily be checked in their growth if men would only try their conduct by the gospelrules the passions that swell too high and rage with direful impetuosity would soon ebb and sink into a profound calm and be confined within their proper channel reason then would assume the gentler sway and be regulated by revelation would conduct our shattered barks through the unavoidable storms of life through rocks and quicksands which because latent are the more dangerous till they arrive safe in the eternal haven where they would be  if we would be meek patient tenderhearted showing bowels of mercies to all men what a pleasant serene peaceable state would the world enjoy it would then be apt to tempt men to desire what is the earnest desire of all men notwithstanding the several natural and moral evils incident to human nature length of days and long life men would not only be of one mind in an house but likewise universal love would be the ruling passion in the rational part of the creation hence health and peace of mind those natural attendants upon goodness would carry all men with a composed even cheerfulness of mind to the mansions of immortal youth where they will shine as stars in the firmament such is the excellent tendency of the gospelprecepts and such the universality of their extent both of which sufficiently evince the divinity of their author who by such means has largely contributed both to our present and future happiness  but if we will not receive the gospel because of its divinity or future rewards let us at least for the sake of making this gloomy state of things tolerable to us embrace it which was the third thing i proposed to consider in this discourse but of this at another opportunity  now to god the father god the son and god the holy ghost be ascribed as is most due all honor glory majesty and dominion both now and ever amen  sermon iii   timothy iv and part of the  th verse but godliness is profitable unto all things having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come it is a constant observation of all writers that mankind is mostly affected with things present that their desires are generally confined within the narrow limits of this world and that surrounding objects almost always exclude what should be the constant subject of a rational being the glorious thoughts of immortality the reason why they thus act seems to be this real happiness which indeed is not attainable in this life seems to be the expectation of most men even in this transitory state of things where joy and sorrow hopes and fears light and shade constitute the life of man the imagination paints things delusively and in borrowed colors it gives solidity to emptiness beauty to deformity and worth to meanness and has the power of egyptian superstition it can transform an ape into a god but what is the more surprising it pretends to realize nothing no wonder then that man under such an erroneous flattering guide mistakes misery for happiness and agonizing pain for solid permanent pleasure no wonder that sensuality is preferred to temperance and confusion to the love of order or that mankind rather than oppose the mighty torrent of affection chooses to swim smoothly down the current of inclination to contradict passion a libertine thinks an arduous unnatural nay an impossible task to follow nature which is nothing else but a criminal indulgence of every sense is with him answering the end of his creation not considering that the beauty of life like the beauty of a good picture consists in a regular harmony and concert of all its parts and in a conformity to the rules of reason if every one was to follow the propensities of his depraved appetite for one man has as much right as another we would not only in all human probability see the death of morality but the destruction of the sons of adam such has been if the history of all ages may be credited the dismal consequence of a total depravation of manners so true is it that righteousness exalts a nation but sin is the destruction of any people when men throw aside the natural distinction between good and evil all restraints from ill are consequently broke vices then of all complexions must deluge the earth like a mighty inundation and drown the very seeds of virtue the notion of a god likewise is then either lost or confused his providence that by secret springs directs the harmonious motion of the universe is too often depreciated except lightening that terrible instrument of vengeance flashes conviction to their understandings or thunder that dreadful attendant upon the deity awakens their sleepy consciences and forces them to own with confusion of face the presence of omnipotence  but the good the religious man amidst lightenings thunder whirlwinds and earthquakes sits humble resigned composed he knows no fear but the fear of the almighty who amidst every terror is his strong tower and rock of defense a present help in time of need is there any that would secure to himself a friend let him be but good or religious and he will have an almighty friend is any oppressed with the weight of sin and disturbed with the gnawings of a troubled conscience there is an advocate with the father who graciously invites all that labor and are heavy laden to come unto him and he will give them rest is any sick or in adversity let him apply to that almighty and allmerciful physician who raises the dead to life and the poor out of the dust would any one enjoy life and see good days or inherit a blessing let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil and who is it that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good goodness then is the necessary armor for every man that would fight the good fight and procure to himself the blessings of peace in this world and a crown of glory in the next for god will withold no manner of good from those that sincerely love him thus godliness has not only the promise of the life that now is but also of that likewise which is to come  in two former discourses upon which words i considered these two propositions  first that religion is the surest road to happiness in this life and that secondly because it tends to make us happy it proves its divinity the first of these i endeavored to prove from the happiness that must necessarily result from the strict observance of those relative duties of which religion consists to god our neighbor and ourselves  the truth of the second proposition i endeavored to prove from the excellency of the gospelprecepts which man as he is a compound of great ignorance much folly and little goodness would never have invented and also from the universality of their extent as they are excellently well calculated to promote universal harmony and therefore universal happiness among all the kindreds of the earth  i come now as i proposed in the last place to consider our particular obligations to religion because of its promoting our present interest  i am not ignorant that it may be objected here that temporal motives to obedience ought not to be so much insisted on and that i ought rather to have painted the joys of heaven or the terrors of hell in order to invite or deter the sinner from the error of his way  to this i answer that objects generally affect men according to their distance the prospect of present gain in the commerce between man and man is usually attended with greater pleasure and consequently pursued with greater vigor than the view of larger advantages placed at a more remote point of light the same holds with respect to things temporal and eternal the things eternal not being present and consequently not exposed to our view do not affect us so much as sensible objects if then men can be persuaded from the enjoyment of the pleasures of sin for the season they continue pilgrims here either because they are shameful prejudicial to their affairs or destructive to the body ought not such arguments taken from convenience be made use of in order to invite men from sin it must be owned indeed that if men are virtuous upon no higher motives than because virtue is convenient and productive of health and present happiness and if men are seemingly religious merely because religion is the fashionable convenience in order to color over sinister designs such mens virtue and religion with regard to another world must be vain because we ought to be virtuous and religious not only upon account of a present convenience and advantage but likewise in obedience to gods just commands  however from whatever motive men practice virtue whether out of ostentation and to gain popular applause as some or because it promotes the health of the body and the grateful peace and indolency of mind as others or lastly which should always be the case because god has proposed piety and virtue as the terms of acceptance with him from whatever of these motives men are virtuous just and good both they themselves and the world must receive no small advantage from it so true is it that virtue even in this scene of things which is diversified with good and ill is its own reward and that godliness is great gain  to insist upon the practice of virtue therefore upon account of temporal inducements is not one of the least motives to behave well our savior himself in the sermon upon the mount in order to induce his hearers to practice meekness mercy and the like tells them that not only a reward in reversion but the inheritance of the earth will be consequent upon the practice of these virtues  experience too tells us that many of little or no religion practice some virtues if such a practice exclusive of the will of god may be termed virtuous because such virtues augment the health of the body and increase thereby a thoughtless indolence of mind such will not live jovially and luxuriously because sickness is generally the concomitant of sensuality the desire of continuing here which to a good man is not very desirable occasions a consequent desire of using such means as seem best calculated for the promoting length of days and long life and as virtue has this happy tendency it is no wonder if it be looked upon as the one thing needful to promote temporal felicity by those who have shown by their lives and more particularly by their writings that they are advocates for no religion a great argument this however that morality must be very serviceable to societies but the practice of it must be very precarious and uncertain when the will and consequently the fear of god are excluded from supporting of it when the main pillars the support of a building are taken away would it be strange if the superstructure should fall to the ground and in like manner if the will and fear of god were not thought the foundation of all moral obligation what an inlet to all manner of licentiousness would there be every one then would be at liberty to carve out for themselves a system of morals such as inclination not reason would dictate the contrivance and execution of which would put all hell in triumph and the blessed benevolent host of heaven into mourning  happy however exceeding happy it is for the world that the will of god is generally acknowledged as the foundation and the fear of him the kindly remembrancer of all moral obligation few are so very hardy except the rich and powerful as to deny that god is the author of all the relations that subsist and consequently of the duties arising from these relations and therefore all our obligations to the performance of these duties terminate at last in the will of the creator who by creating us created all these relations from whence both our moral and religious obligations are immediately derived  our obligations then to godliness which comprehends every duty arise i from the consideration of his having created us and ii from his providential care over us and continual preservation of us in being and iii from his having condescended to reveal his will by his only begotten son who by his death and passion adopted us into the number of the sons of god and lastly because this revelation contains nothing but what is both agreeable to reason and perfective of our natures     these are the principal obligations which we lie under to be pious just and good obligations sufficient one would imagine to induce every rational agent to love and consequently honor his maker not only with his lips but in his life not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as men professing themselves creatures of his hands and that consider the end of their creation the means offered them in order that they might obtain salvation and the vocation wherewith they are called these inducements to godliness are or at least ought to be so well known that i shall not make any further observation upon them and as i have principally insisted upon temporal obligations to virtue in these discourses i shall consider further that we are obliged to practice religion first because it is easier for us to be good and virtuous than wicked and vicious and secondly because a religious practice gains us reputation and lastly because a blessing will not only attend us if we hold fast our integrity but likewise descend upon our posterity  the first of these propositions is founded upon this supposition that we are obliged to contribute to our present satisfaction in this life which none will deny except enthusiasts who make religion which is the greatest disposer to cheerfulness consist in morosenfs gloominess melancholy if this position the granted as it certainly ought that we should endeavor to obtain present ease and happiness it will hence follow that virtue ought to be embraced and vice avoided for whatever method gives us more trouble in the performance gives us less satisfaction and consequently more trouble and uneasiness that the practice of vice produces this effect is evident from experience when a man is vicious and at the same time is desirous of saving appearances in order to keep up his credit in the world every one may imagine that he must be put to great perplexities the very consciousness of guilt makes the guilty person think that the earnest penetrating look of another whom he meets supposes a knowledge of his crime and if he finds that it is known it gives him additional vexation and he endeavors to lessen the heinousness of his own misdemeanors by blackening the reputation of those who have thus justly reflected upon his conduct thus one vice is connected with another and painful reflections the natural result of and the necessary concomitant upon vice are like jobs comforters miserable and unmerciful tormenters of a wounded conscience which is but a sorry recompense for the loss of virtue  suppose too a man is profuse and lavish in his expenses and at the same time covetous for contradictions often meet in the same person will not these very extravagancies make him uneasy and will not the desire of supplying them be an augmentation of his unhappiness will he not if he is not abandoned be afraid of a censorious world and if he is reduced at last to live upon the generosity of friends whose pity and relief would be cruel because attended with bitter reflections upon his past conduct would he not which is too often the case choose strangling rather than life  and supposing that his covetousness does keep him from losing his all yet art in raising of money low cunning used in order to circumvent the unwary lies forged in order to gain credit and promises to return what he is neither able nor willing to return fear of creditors on one hand and of poverty on the other and in short which he thinks the worst of his case the fear of losing all pleasure and pleasurable moments which he usually dedicated to sensuality are things that must necessarily create flatness of spirits distracted thoughts and wearisomness of life before he has learned what every one in this state of probation ought to learn to live  man was never designed for such misery god in all his dispensations designed him happiness and if man will counteract the allmerciful designs of the most benevolent being is god or man to blame man surely was not placed here merely to stalk about look about him breathe the fresh air and to perform other offices in common with other animals or to propagate misery disorder and confusion in the world he was placed here for wiser and nobler ends the proper business of man is war his enemies are his own flesh and the devil when an house is divided against itself except great prudence be used it must fall and as the grand adversary the devil acts unseen and for that reason is the more formidable ought not greater circumspection foresight and activity to be used in order to prevent both temporal and eternal misery  the prevention of both these the good man has particularly in view as he considers himself in a state of warfare he levies proper forces to annoy his enemies arms himself with all the christian graces and moral virtues with which he is not only enabled to make a brave defense against but to conquer his enemy  this is no difficulty to a man of courage who is resolved let others do what they will that he and his house will serve the lord he knows that the ways of vice are perplexed and intricate and terminate in sorrow and that though godliness seems terrible to the doubleminded and irresolute yet a determined constancy in the practice of it not only makes it easy but desirable convenient pleasant  we find that sloth and idleness are the great bars both to temporal and spiritual riches they make every little seeming difficulty a bugbear a lion in the way though the path will naturally bring a man to present and future eminence in glory see thou a man diligent in his business such an one shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men see thou a man pious just and good such an one shall not only live with angels but with the living almighty god all which may be obtained at the easy expense of bringing every inordinate affection in subjection to the gospel of christ  easy and reasonable terms as these are they are reckoned hard and unreasonable by the indolent careless and sensual part of mankind but supposing them difficult which there is no occasion to suppose a man of true courage and elevation of soul would attempt the practice of them for that very reason and the pleasure that attends the conquering of a difficulty would be a motive sufficient for the attempt  happy however it is that no great difficulties are to be met with in a life of godliness all that are to be met with are of mens own raising they sin and when they find it troublesome to persist in it they find it painful too to measure back the steps which they have already run in sin here is the great pain which is easily prevented by keeping the appetites under a continued good regulation lest they should conceive and bring forth sin and therefore sorrow anxiety remorse  as godliness contributes to our present satisfaction by delivering us from what is consequent upon the practice of vice natural evil so likewise it establishes a mans reputation and makes him esteemed in life  as dishonesty brings a man to contempt so integrity and a firm adherence to truth is the most compendious wisdom it creates confidence in those we have to deal with saves the labor of many enquiries and brings things to an issue in a few words whereas dishonesty is troublesome sets a mans invention upon the rack and one trick needs a great many more to make it good it is like building upon a false foundation which continually stands in need of props to shore it up and proves at last more chargeable than to have raised a substantial building at first upon a true and solid foundation but integrity is firm and substantial and there is nothing hollow and unsound in it and because it is plain and open it fears no discovery it gains strength by use and the more and longer any man practices it the greater service it does his reputation by encouraging those with whom he has to do to repose the greatest trust and confidence in him which in affairs of life is an unspeakable advantage  were men of dishonest minds only acquainted with the advantages resulting from an upright conduct they would be honest not out of any love for truth but out of mere knavery that they might more effectually advance their several interests but divine providence has justly hid this truest point of wisdom from their eyes that bad men might not be upon a level with the upright and serve their wicked designs by honest and lawful means  indeed if men were only to continue here for a day and had no prospect of a future state there might be less reason for the securing of a good reputation but as things are now constituted it behooves us particularly to have our conversation honest in the sight of all men our esteem amongst men depends upon it our reputation is founded upon it and without it neither a blessing will descend upon us or our posterity which was the last thing i proposed to consider  god as if selflove was not sufficient to make us observant of his laws and as if we were as careful of our posterity as ourselves has upon condition of obedience to his just commands pronounced not only upon us but our posterity a blessing if then we have no value for ourselves let us at least value our descendants if we are temperate in all things and followers of that which is good we do our best toward producing not only an healthy but a numerous and pious offspring  and if we look upon gods promises and threats in no other light than mere political inventions yet we should even in this case pay some deference to human authority by a suitable deportment for the contrivance of making the community and all the members of it happy for the health of the several members is the health and support of the bodypolitick whereas infirm sickly members are the destruction the death of the constitution it is the duty of every one therefore to behave well not only for his own sake but for the sake of his family his children his country  but as the word of god is no human invention but the contrivance of divinity itself to make us happy why halt we between two opinions why are we divided between god and the world is his arm shortened or has he said that he will bless us and our posterity and will he not do it consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you if ye seek the kingdom of heaven and his righteousness o ye of little faith  if there be any amongst you that disbelieve these gracious words of the lord of life because you are either in distressed circumstances or afflicted with sickness consider before you accuse the just the good the merciful god of injustice whether your thoughts words and actions have been conformable to his laws if upon the research you find that they have not let me entreat you to lead a new life to trust and delight in the lord and he will not only feed you but grant you your hearts desire and make your righteousness as clear as the light and your just dealing as the noonday  and supposing you have endeavored to preserve your integrity in every circumstance of life and have not fallen away in the day of temptation yet notwithstanding this regularity of conduct you have met with various afflictions to discompose both body and soul and have received instead of a blessing what you think a curse before in these proceedings you call god unjust consider that the potter may deal with his clay as seems proper to him and expose it to what fiery trial he pleases either with a view to try its firmness or to put it into a proper temperament shall not god then have the same power over his creatures as the potter has over his clay shall we receive good at the hand of god and will we not be content to receive evil also observe the characters of the faithful abraham and holy job did they in their several trials repine murmur or charge god foolishly were they not humble submissive obedient and are you much better than they that you have the boldness to say to your creator why have thou made me thus you should rather show by your resignation your obedience and reflect that god when he chastises you looks upon you as sons and not bastards temporal evil therefore is a blessing a kindly monitor of our dependent state and that we ought to look for a better country more durable eternal in the heavens  and let us always remember that the lord orders a good mans going and makes his way acceptable to himself though he fall he shall not be cast away for the lord upholdeth him with his hand  i have been young says the psalmist and now am old and yet saw i never the righteous forsaken or his seed begging their bread the righteous is ever merciful and lends and his seed is blessed  keep therefore innocence and take heed to the thing that is right for that and that only will bring a man peace at the last  which that all of us may obtain may god of his infinite mercy grant etc  innocence the only proper qualification for heaven a sermon a sermon luke xviii    verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein innocence is here looked upon as the only proper qualification for heaven as it consists in a freedom from every vice little children for that reason may be justly thought proper emblems of it our savior in the verse preceding my text tells us expressly that of such is the kingdom of god because they are lively images and examples of that good temper and disposition by which alone men can be fitted for the kingdom of heaven that freedom from pride covetousness and worldly designs from prejudice evil customs and habits of sin that easy and teachable disposition of mind that innocence plainness and simplicity of heart which appear in all the actions of little children are the principal qualifications which every one of us ought to endeavor to attain if we would be worthy members of christs church on earth and inheritors of his kingdom in heaven  but it may be asked here how is it possible that men whose minds must almost necessarily on account of their being conversant with material sensible objects contract a vitiated biass toward the things of this world should ever continue in dispositions and inclinations as children and if they do not persevere in the like innocence with children must they be excluded heaven  in answer to which it may be observed that god is not such a severe judge as to be extreme in marking what is done amiss by his creatures nor does he require an unsinning obedience from us because we have strong propensities inciting us continually to the commission of evil with greediness and supposing since we are thus fallible by nature that we do fall from our integrity yet god who always receives those into favor that sincerely repent and amend will forgive us likewise if after deviating from the paths of peace we repent us of the evil and confirm that repentance by a life of righteousness if our intentions are always honorable and our actions square with our intentions we shall not only as children be fitted for the kingdom of heaven but also as men endued with reason who have received and acted according to the salutary commands delivered to us in the gospel  men then may deserve a higher reward in all probability than children children can have only good dispositions but men may have not only good dispositions but likewise something better consequent upon them good actions children only think and act as they are taught and therefore are not properly free agents men on the contrary can think and judge for themselves and if they are sincere in the examination of every thing that is proposed to their understandings and consequently act according to the result of such a previous examination they will if they persist in their sincerity be received finally as little children into the kingdom of heaven  but it may be again asked how is it possible for men whose original seeds of corruption are strengthened by living in a degenerate world ever to be in disposition as children for it may be well supposed that there cannot be the same innocence where the original biass to ill is necessarily augmented and therefore men cannot receive as a little child the kingdom of heaven  in answer to which i shall observe that even in disposition men may be as innocent as children for even in them we find too often pride anger malice revenge and a covetous disposition but as these bad passions do not properly proceed from their own choice and as their reasoning faculty is too weak to discern the distinction between moral good and evil so if their strong propensities to ill should spring forth into action we would call such actions because the result of ignorance and want of judgment sins of infirmity and consequently would be excusable through the merits of christ in the sight of god but it may be observed at the same time that as the minds of children are mere blanks and are capable of being filled up with either good or bad principles so those under whose care they are whether parents or masters should do well to consider that if they instill bad principles either by precept or example into the minds of children they may perhaps in this but they will assuredly in the next world repent of such unchristian behavior so true is it that our good or bad conduct in life depends chiefly upon the first impressions given us in our infancy and whilst our reason affords us insufficient light to guide our steps through the mazes of error but to return  children as i before observed have their propensities to ill and these propensities often naturally but always when encouraged and indulged bud forth into action if this be once granted as experience but too fatally proclaims that it ought then it will by consequence follow that men may be in disposition as children and therefore may as well as them obtain eternal salvation  for why may not men be indifferent as indifferent i mean as is consistent with religion about the concerns of this world one may certainly live in the world without any criminal compliances to the bad customs and practices in it and if scripture may be credited we may both be if we are properly disposed conversant among men and have likewise our conversation in heaven it does not follow because we may happen to fall into profane company that therefore we conform in a similar behavior but rather such profaneness may raise our abhorrence of such vileness and cause us to contemn the mean practitioners of it so that we may live like noah amidst an inundation of ungodliness and yet keep free from the general infection and have our minds more enflamed with zeal for god and his religion and consequently our dispositions more heavenly in order to encourage such a disposition in you i shall consider i the reasonableness and ii the necessity of it   the reasonableness of having always a good disposition will appear first from the advantage that it will bring our neighbors and ourselves secondly from its being our best preparative to holiness and therefore our best passport through the everlasting doors of heaven to the king of glory  this disposition which we meet with in children must be of great advantage to society because it is productive of neither bad designs nor bad practices for persons endued with it must be free from pride and covetousness and consequently must have no ambitious or oppressive views must be full of simplicity sincerity and what is rarely to be met with plain dealing for though as i said before children too often discover the bad passions predominant in them yet these passions are generally excited by the imprudence or rather impious folly of those that attend them which by the way ought to be an awakening consideration to all parents to choose only such attendants upon their children as will cherish benevolent affections and check the least tendency to vice and parents themselves that are by their circumstances obliged to have an immediate eye over their children ought to sow no seeds in their minds but what will by a proper encouragement produce a glorious harvest of corresponding good actions and such parents as neglect this necessary as well as pleasant duty are answerable not only to god and their own conscience but to the public for such careless immoral irreligious behavior and it must be a melancholy consideration to those parents who either by connivance precept or example have contributed to make their unhappy descendents only fit companions for the devil or to be what is horrible to think of the devils proxies but this as the minds of children are susceptible of any impression may be easily prevented so true is the observation that if you train up a child in the way that he should go when he is old he will not depart except with great difficulty from it  and if men should have such docible such flexible dispositions to good and were always determined to embrace or reject things according to their reasonableness or unreasonableness or according to the present or consequential good or ill attending them we should enjoy no litigiousness quarrels or oppression in civil life and no disputes about the doctrines or modes of worship of this or that particular church but we should be all of one mind and one fold united under one shepherd the captain of our salvation jesus christ  this union however though much desired by every good christian can never be effected as long as men continue in their present unsociable and unchristian dispositions selfinterest prejudice and bigotry are the hinges upon which the affections of mankind turn few we see so benevolent or so beneficent as to perform an action without a direct or indirect view of advantage from the person whom they thus deign to oblige and some there are who notwithstanding their many and great obligations to the contrary will not assist the indigent for this inhuman and impious reason because they are indigent an unhappy turn of mind this unhappy did i say nay i may venture to call it hellish because it naturally leads thither where destruction has no covering  prejudice too whether in things of either a political or religious nature has almost a necessary tendency to disunite men both in affection and interest for when they think that they have separate interests from one another especially in cases of a civil nature they immediately commence hostilities by first envying one another and then by throwing out reflections both moral and personal without any regard either to decency justice or truth and much unbecoming common sense much less open professors of christianity which are not so much to the discredit of their antagonists as themselves who because of such an unsociable and unchristian behavior must naturally be looked upon i think in the eye of impartial reason as the very dregs and refuse of mankind  and as prejudice and bigotry to a party in the political life hinder harmony and produce what is hateful to every good and peaceable disposition faction so likewise in religion they give rise to a most unchristian disposition which neither reason nor revelaion can justify a furious spirit of persecution this fiery zeal which cannot be according to knowledge because the spawn of ignorance implicit faith and spiritual tyranny bigotry and superstition extends to all those who rightly differ from them in matters of faith and practice or what ought to cause no breach of charity in mere ceremony but such unreasonable bigots ought to consider that if they want charity that bond of peace and cement of society they cannot possibly be fit for that place where all is harmony where all is peace and love the kingdom of heaven  and as long as selfinterest prejudice and bigotry are the springs of action in the human soul we may naturally expect what will break the chains that link society together envy hatred and inhuman scenes of disorder but these may be easily prevented by cherishing in our minds only such dispositions as will necessarily recommend us not only to the favor of men but what is infinitely better to the friendship of god and god has required such dispositions to be exerted into actual holiness that by such qualifications we may be the better fitted for his kingdom  but no man can be holy without an holy disposition this must be the necessary preparative to purity in action we should deal with our minds as we generally do with a garden where before we sow the good seeds we extract the roots of every noxious weed lest by their growing up together with the useful herbs they should either choke them at their first rise or hinder their growing up to perfection if we were to deal thus with our minds and endeavor to eradicate every latent root of bitterness and cherish every seed of virtue and transplant from other soils whatever would contribute to the dignity and true ornament of the better part of us our souls we should not only then have good dispositions but those dispositions would be exerted into actual holiness and as one good disposition produces another so does one virtue naturally give rise to many more till all the blank in the tender mind is filled up with every thing that is amiable productive of its own peace and promotive of the happiness of the whole rational part of the creation but this is not often the case tares that is dishonorable notions are suffered to grow up in the human mind and they are often cherished by those very persons that ought to endeavor to root them out and this generally happens with two sorts of persons to persons born to opulent fortunes and to the dregs of the people when a man is born to inherit riches he is too often induced to think forming his judgment from the behavior of those about him that riches are the only proper foundation for honor and esteem and this confirms him in error when he sees virtue because meanly clothed and in tattered robes neglected slighted affronted thus the human bladder is blown into an extravagant tumor so that it consequentially forgets the relation between it and its fellow creatures and what is worse its dependence upon that being who gave it existence thus are wrong principles taught by example and they are suffered to take root in young minds the more easily because the world gives a sanction to them by encouraging the practice of them  the very lowest and illiterate part of mankind too as well as the rich and powerful has but too commonly abandoned dispositions sneaking low tricks deceit in every shape impatience of restraint drunkenness oaths curses imprecations and a vile propensity to follow the commands of the powerful and opulent notwithstanding the injustice of them are sufficient proofs of the badness of their dispositions and of their entire contempt of all moral and religious truths no wonder then that the unhappy descendants of such worthless wretches inherit the same dispositions and practice the same indecencies since children are soonest infected by example and are easily induced to believe that they cannot do wrong if they tread in their parents steps who by their age ought to know and whose interest it is or at least ought to be to point out to them the things that tend both to their present and everlasting peace thus are the diseases of the mind like those of the body propagated from one poluted generation to another till the longsuffering of god being quite worn out in expectation of their amendment they are entirely eradicated by the change of the subject in which they existed  to prevent which diseases of the mind and the judgments of god sooner or later consequent thereupon we may naturally infer what i proposed to consider in the second place the absolute necessity of having our dispositions as children  i observed before the bad effects which evil dispositions naturally produce both in the religious and civil life i shall therefore show under this head that if we do not take care that the dispositions of our hearts be good we must of consequence fail of present and future happiness for when the inclinations and dispositions of the heart are bent toward evil continually there can be no ease and therefore no happiness reason which should be the governing principle of the soul and direct the affections to their proper objects no longer presides at the helm but is forced to give way to that destroyer of the human bark the ruling passion when affection is thus suffered to reign in the heart of man the mind is blind both to private and public interest no persuasion can remove the darkness with which it is involved and no instruction can enlighten it and thus it is hurried down if the grace of god interpose not by the violent stream of inclination into the terrible ocean of inextinguishable flame  to avoid which dismal unhappiness it is incumbent upon every one of us to keep our hearts with all diligence because out of them are the issues of life or death for if we do not keep our hearts pure nor keep a constant guard over them evil inclinations will spring up and surrounding objects will add life and vigor to them till they grow too luxuriant to be controlled thus they will influence both our belief and practice truth though shining in her original brightness cannot gain admittance into our hearts when the mists of passion are so dark and obscure for truth gospel truth especially is of too pure a nature for a corrupted heart all the evil dispositions latent in it immediately declare war and put themselves in a posture of defense against god and goodness and against every thing that has the least tendency to root them out it is therefore owing to the evil dispositions and inclinations of the heart and not to principle that we have infidels amongst us such indeed when the affections are heated may own no god but bacchus and pay no devotions to any but him and venus but when jollity ceases and the mind is at leisure for reflection or when thunder and lightening proclaim the avenging jehovah these infidels not only in such circumstances own a god but likewise condemn the bad dispositions of their hearts and the vicious actions consequent thereupon and would be glad if the merits of their despised redeemer could save them from impending ruin  but that our case may not be such and that we may not fail of attaining an eternal weight of glory it is incumbent upon us to keep a strict guard over our hearts because they are allowed to be deceitful above all things for we naturally if we have been once deceived beware of having any intercourse with the deceiver for the future and we generally search that place diligently that formerly has concealed a thief that would if not timely prevented have deprived us of that which in some measure makes life comfortable money if such care caution and circumspection is requisite with regard to things temporal certainly when an eternity of inexpressible happiness is at stake and when the attainment of it depends upon our good behavior we should let no corrupt inclination prevail over our reason and deprive us of that which the gaining of this present world can by no means counterbalance eternal glory  and to this guarding of our hearts from all impure affections let us add prayers to god that he would enable us by his holy spirit not only to be pure in will but likewise in deed that thereby as little children we may be received into the kingdom of heaven for without such holiness no man shall see the lord  whom that all of us may be thus qualified to see may god of his infinite mercy grant etc  a religious life the best return for a national deliverance a sermon preached october        being the day appointed for the public thanksgiving after the defeat of the rebels a sermon psalm viii          it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me  he delivers me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou have delivered me from the violent man  therefore will i give thanks unto thee olord among the heathen and sing praises unto thy name   to show a becoming gratitude for favors received is a duty justly expected between man and man a favor conferred supposes a debt to the person that conferred it and where there is a debt there is an obligation to the payment of it when opportunity offers to the performance of this every man is obliged though human laws sometimes cannot enforce it the law of nature loudly proclaims and religion suggests to us that it is an argument of a mean ungenerous spirit to be forgetful of benefits  if gratitude be allowed to be a duty as it certainly is between man and man the obligation to the practice of it is greater both according to the nature and likewise in relation to the bestower of it when man gives he does not often consider either the goodness of the thing he gives or the worthiness of the object upon whom he confers it ostentation too often gives rise to his largesses and fancy not judgment directs him in the choice of a favorite hence it often happens that many are made instructors of the ignorant before they have learnt what ought principally to be regarded the primary intention of their office hence some are made interpreters of the laws whose sole aim seems to be nothing more than to sink those whom they ought to raise into the greatest poverty hence others sit in the judgment seat who have neither patience abilities nor integrity to be proper dispensers of rewards and punishments and it may be laid down as a maxim that those that are unjust to themselves with regard to their true interest can never be inflexibly just to others  men then you see have offices often assigned them for which they are either naturally or morally unfit and that this should be the case why should we wonder since interest prejudice humor and caprice are generally the chief managers of the affections and since man is guided by such uncertain fallible directors it would be an impropriety to expect favors and benefits always properly conferred either upon the wise or foolish  not so the allwise governor of the universe he both sees and gives us what is fittest for us in every circumstance of life he makes rain to descend upon the just and unjust and gives to both by his ordinary providence fruitful seasons but he reserves in the mean time more particular blessings for those that diligently seek him he no doubt gives poverty to those who in prosperity might set up their horn and a stiff neck and by that means both forget themselves and their god and sometimes too he permits the wicked to go on prosperously and their affairs to run on in an easy smooth course till he sees them ripe for destruction and then he tumbles them down from their improper eminence not only for their own punishment but to be standing monuments of his just dealing toward ungodly men when a nation has in a great measure forsaken the allegiance it owes to that being to whom it is indebted for being a nation when it is grown proud ambitious luxurious and executes not true judgment when pomp wealth and titles entirely engross the attention of the inhabitants when vice appears upon the stage of life not only countenanced but encouraged when private vices have been inculcated as public benefits when laws which were enacted for the prohibition of intemperance are repealed for the sake of raising money to the government when magistrates whose business it is to see laws put in execution are careless and are afraid to offend a vicious neighbor is it strange when such things as these are permitted and encouraged in a nation that god should punish such a kingdom as this  no wonder then that war bloodshed and death should be consequent upon such a scene of disorder corruption and every evil work no wonder that sickness walks in darkness or that fevers destroy at noonday when a nation is almost totally corrupted a desperate remedy is required to bring it to a proper sense of its duty and such is the heinous nature of ingratitude for the innumerable blessings of life showered down upon us by providence that it naturally kindles the sparks of the divine wrath against us and it is no wonder if then we are visited with scourges and with a rod of iron had we in the times of peace walked humbly with our god and been properly grateful for the blessings of peace had we instead of luxury practiced frugality instead of either an entire neglect of or an indolent dispassionate carelessness in relgion had we been sincere and resolute in the worship of the true god he would not in all probability have permitted civil discord to have raged horribly amongst us or if he did would not have seemed to laugh at our calamity or to have mocked when our fear came when our fear came from the north as a desolation and our destuction was approaching as a whirlwind  notwithstanding however our notorious and repeated transgressions he has at last turned away his fiery indignation and in the midst of judgment remembered mercy because he has thus delivered us from our enemies and has lifted us up above those that rose up against us because he delivered us from the violent man therefore will we give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and sing praises unto thy name  david used these words in order to show his gratitude for his deliverance from the unjust persecutions of saul who is here exhibited to us under the character of the violent man and as we of this nation have suffered the like injustice from the violent i shall show i that it is incumbent upon us to be grateful for the deliverance from violence and ii that our gratitude should rise in proportion to our deliverance and iii that the best return we can make for such mighty deliverances is a religious life   first then i am to show that it is incumbent upon us to be grateful for such a deliverance from violence our obligations to which will best appear from the consideration of a superintending providence over us and consequently from the notion of our dependence upon providence if it be once admitted that we are gods workmanship and that we owe not our existence to that imaginary being chance we must in consequence of such an admission deduce the creators providential care over us for it is absurd to imagine that a good being would give existence to his creatures and would not at the same time consult their wellbeing the same goodness that prompted him to create prompted him likewise to preserve what he created we see the whole animal creation anxiously striving to support and protect their young shall animals of confined contracted sense endeavor to preserve their species and shall not the creator of all things have the same providential care over his creatures as he has created so will he feed the fowls of the air and as he has not only given existence to the flowers of the field but likewise has made them appear more splendid than solomon in all his glory shall he not because ye are much better than they provide for you o ye of little faith  reason then not only proclaims a providence but a watchful one too it is about our path and about our bed and spieth out all our ways if we ascend into heaven it is there or if we descend into the nethermost parts of the earth it is there also when violence and oppression lay waste a nation is it not probable that providence directs the storm of war and permits it to rage furiously in order to humble the sinner and make him repent and live this no doubt has often been the instrument of vengeance in the hand of god and the finger of omnipotence never appears more eminently conspicuous than in times of sedition tumult war have we not seen lately a victorious enemy loitering like the old carthagenian as if infatuated when in all human probability it might have seized the capital have we not seen even our own troops who before had braved danger with the utmost intrepidity fly when there was no great occasion for fear and seek for shelter when no enemy pursued and have we not seen the enemy suspend their pursuit when by pursuing they might in all human judgment entirely have destroyed our army such behavior as this so contrary to true policy so directly clashing with their true interest seems to point out the interposing hand of providence who confounds the most deeplaid schemes of designing men in order to vindicate his glory and to give evident demonstration that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong that no arm of flesh might boast and say that with my own right hand have i got myself the victory  when providence thus visibly appears in the defense of a nation and has made the crafty violent man fall into the pit which he had made for others when it has made the storms of war a calm so that the waves thereof are still ought not the people that have thus the blessings of peace conferred upon them to give the greatest tokens of thankfulness if we own a providence as every man in his senses must gratitude is due to it for its ordinary care over us but when it more evidently affords us its protection from the violent man when he had brought desolation upon our country is it not high time to be grateful apagan directed only by the light of nature could for his deliverance slay whole hecatombs of animals in order to show gratitude to his gods shall a pagan part with a large portion of his substance in order to appease his false gods and shall not he who is assuredly the true god and our protector and who has done great things for us already receive from us the small tribute of praise and thanksgiving  many too many i am afraid if one may be allowed to form an estimate of their behavior toward god from their conduct toward their fellow creatures would be glad to receive favors at the hand of god almighty but would be ready to give no acknowledgment for the reception of them they seem rather to receive them as a debt and as if god almighty was obliged to shower down his mercies upon his creatures let their behavior toward him be what it will in time of calamity indeed they can show all the dismal symptoms of sorrow such as the soft gate the ghastly melancholy aspect eyes drowned in tears and now and then directed toward heaven deep sighs solemn groans mournful plaints with the additional frequent invocation of lord have mercy on us but when the thunder that seemed to threaten their destruction has spent itself and the storm is entirely blown over and when by the serenity of the heavens it appears that all apprehension of danger is past the god that preserved them in such danger that rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm is immediately forgot they remember not his works nor sing his praise but like true sons of belial they show their gratitude by their drunkenness and their thankfulness by their loud hymns to bacchus  these things ought not so to be god is not praised by loud tumultuous joy nor by debauchery is he honored such honor and such praise is the sacrifice of fools such honor is mockery and such praise ingratitude when god is truly honored men frequent his temple not the tavern and there from the heart celebrate the mighty acts of the lord their joy is serene pure peaceable lasting and always in some measure proportioned to the benefits received which was the second thing i proposed to observe  how great our joy ought to be will be best estimated by taking a view of the dangers we have been delivered from tyranny whether it respects the body or the mind has in all ages been justly looked upon as the worst of evils no property or civil rights are secured where it obtains and there can be no freedom religion where implicit faith to spiritual governors is insisted upon in each case our lives and fortunes are continually exposed an expression only glancing toward liberty either civil or religious might be as it often has been misinterpreted for treason and an opulent fortune might be as it often has been a sufficient reason for taking away the life of the possessor  but that tyranny is still the more oppressive when it forces the mind to assent to things which are entirely disagreeable to reason as the good of the people is the end of all government that end is generally frustrated where absolute monarchy prevails kings as they are but men are easily induced by ambition to be lavish of the blood and fortunes of their people their will is their law and their sword which is as violent as their will is both the guardian and executioner of it interest is the grand principle by which they are moved but the misfortune is their own grandeur not the good of the subject is looked upon as their proper interest men of integrity therefore because entirely averse to such proceedings are the objects of their hatred and because they are looked upon as great impediments in their execution of unreasonable and therefore unjust projects they must be removed out of the way and they must suffer because they had the courage to stem the torrent of corruption and be just to themselves their country their god in such a dismal situation a gloomy melancholy aspect is deemed treason and to whisper liberty is death  these are the dismal effects of absolute power when centering in some individuals when indeed they are not invested with power they can assume the appearance of the softest humanity and practice in order to deceive the unwary all the smoother arts of persuasion but when they have seized the helm of government they will immediately neglect the peoples good that known chart by which they ought to steer their course and substitute in its stead that most variable of all directors their own humor  and this nay more than this we might have expected if the late violent man had succeeded in his pernicious schemes could we have hoped for security of liberty when he not only was bred up at the foot of tyranny but also sucked it in with his very milk and suppose he were really descended from the stuarts which is very much questioned could this descent be any recommendation to him have we not seen them endeavoring always to lay aside our parliaments which if honest we ought to look upon as the guardians of our liberties have we not known them oppress by unjust taxes and force those that were to execute justice to give their assent to injustice and can it be imagined that this supposed son of violence would behave better than his heroic forefathers none sure could imagine that he would except the needy the factious and such as hold that imaginary doctrine of hereditary right or the bigotry superstition and idolatry of the church of rome  besides what could we have hoped for from one who was at the head of a bigoted party and had his own head filled with italian superstition it is meritorious with men of this stamp though contrary to reason or the more glorious light of the gospel to propagate their unreasonable and wicked opinions by fire and sword i call them unreasonable because they have no foundation in reason and wicked because contrary to scripture our great criterion by which we ought to judge of doctrines whether they be of god or man  i might here give you a detail of the several impious doctrines of the romanists and of the pernicious tendency of each in order to give you a just notion of the dangers you have escaped and to raise in you a just sense of gratitude for your deliverance from them but i shall only observe at present that as both our temporal and eternal welfare have been particularly consulted by our deliverance from civil and religious tyranny we have the highest reason imaginable to ascribe unto our deliverer worship and strength and to give the lord the honor due unto his name because his wrath has endured little more than the twinkling of an eye because he has given strength to his people and to his inheritance the blessings of peace  but as the praise of the lips of itself is no gratitude but mere hypocrisy i shall consider as i proposed lastly that the best returns we can make for such deliverances is a religious life  as obedience to a parents just commands is looked upon as sufficient gratitude for a parents care or as a subjects dutiful allegiance is a suitable as well as an expected return for a princes protection so a regularity of conduct both in religion and morality is justly expected by our gracious creator as long as we are observant of his just commands so long we are entitled to his favor and protection but when we set at naught his counsel and will receive none of his reproof when we leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness and rejoice to do evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked is it in the least probable that god should still be gracious longsuffering and of great goodness and send peace upon our jerusalem should we not rather expect judgment instead of mercy confusion instead of order and discord instead of harmony disagreements and civil rage amongst individuals as well as kingdoms are generally consequent upon immorality and irreligion and these are generally the effects of riches and power and too great plenty when men are placed in this eminent situation their minds wax wanton they forget the donor of these good gifts and set up their horn and a stiff neck their eyes are lofty and their eyelids are lifted up the fatal consequence of this pride is want of charity meekness patience and a mutual forbearance of injuries from whence arise that motly and hellish crew of monsters sedition tumult war bloodshed and death  in order to prevent which it is incumbent upon each of us in our respective stations to do to all men as we would they should do unto us in the like circumstances always remembering that our present and future happiness depend upon our practice of this golden rule it will make us not only of one mind in an house but make us likewise live like a city at unity with itself whose inhabitants are virtuous amidst abundance and religious without superstition both in prosperity and adversity being thus armed with the breast plate of righteousness the sword of the spirit and the helmet of salvation they are able to curb the insolence of an haughty enemy and gain through the assistance of an almighty protector the unspeakable advantages of a lasting peace  this if we are not wanting to ourselves will always be our case if we do not fail in our duty god will not fail us his eyes are always over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers why then will we any longer provoke him to anger by our evil deeds and make him send among us what we have lately severely felt the evils of war what we have felt we should receive as a fatherly correction as a rock upon which our barks by the negligence of their masters had nigh split and that we may not for the future hazard them against it we should take care that the tide of passion swell not too high and force us by its violence into evident destruction this if we do we shall make a suitable return for the deliverance we have lately received and thereby recommend ourselves to the favor of that being who only can protect us make us dwell safely and free us from the apprehension of every evil  which that all of us for the future may be delivered from may god the grand disposer of all events of his infinite mercy grant through the merits of jesus christ our lord amen  the principal causes of pride and its effects as discoverable in human nature considered in three sermons sermon i prove xxx    there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up this short description seems to point out to us pride and one particular property of it contempt loftiness of eyes seems to intimate the inward temper of mind a particular distemper which it labors under and by the eyelids being lifted up it discovers the effect which is produced by this distemper as every distemper in the body has its particular symptom and consequently is discoverable by it so is every distemper of the mind expressed by some outward sign as demonstrative of the inward ailment pride then that empty tumor is well signified by high looks and lofty eyes because every tumor occasions a stiffness of the part affected and if it be inward and has any relation to or communication with the outward parts an external effect will be produced proportionable to the inward cause thus pride naturally swells the eye gives an high indirect unobserving cast and the eyelids lifted up signifies not only pride but also that the person thus touched with it is something or at least thinks himself something of a more exalted nature than those of the same species with himself and therefore it denotes contempt which of all other effects is least becoming frail human nature except it has for its object that greatest disgrace of human nature vice  but it may be asked is pride in no sense commendable must it be condemned without reserve and will it admit of no limitation may not a man be said to be ambitious of behaving well and ambition always supposes pride as the foundation of it  in this case where pride is supposed the spring of good actions it is taken for courage or a sense of duty when a man contradicts sense and acts in opposition to the common received modes of behavior in the world though he may be said in the vulgar way of speaking to be proud or ambitious of welldoing yet such actions cannot derive their original from pride because a bad cause such as pride is cannot produce a good effect such actions therefore must have a better and more noble cause and i think no better than the before mentioned can be assigned namely a sense of duty conveyed to man by the gospel dispensation for this sense has a noble end proposed to it happiness and no wonder that courage and all the faculties of the soul are exerted in order to the attainment of it  but again it may be asked if a man that has behaved well and even excelled his fellow creatures in performing the duties of the gospel can have for that reason a toleration for being proud for good actions always suppose merit and consequently one would imagine that where there is merit a man may think well of himself or in other words has reason to be proud  supposing then according to the question that a man acts up to the prescriptions of the gospel and supposing even more that he even performs every precept he does not therefore merit because he does only his duty and by consequence has no reason to be proud but if we consider the infirmities of human nature its proneness to and its several lapses notwithstanding its utmost caution into sin we may reasonably conclude that pride was no more made for fallible man than the jewel for the swines snout  besides there is a difference between pride and a mans thinking well of himself pride is puffed up and supposes more merit than it really has it is bold haughty presumptuous requires a particular respect and deference to be paid to it is a scorner and a raiser of contention and when the sparks of discord have nigh spent their force one hint or single expression will add fuel to the most extinguished fire and blow it into flame  whereas the thinking well of ones self though it does suppose comparative merit as the foundation of it is not inconsistent with the greatest humility because if we act according to the rule of life delivered to us in the gospel we must be virtuous and more than nominal christians and consequently there will arise from such a tenor of action a tender selfcomplacency or sort of selfesteem which the wise disposer of the drama has out of his great goodness given us not only as a foretaste of our future allotment but likewise as a present reward and encouragement for us to behave well in our several future scenes upon the stage of life we may then think well of ourselves upon a very laudable account because upon comparing our lives and conversation with the gospel rule we find in the result of the comparison that an entire harmony reigns between our faith and practice and consequently the consciousness of having acted our parts well upon this great theater must not only in the still scenes of life but also when we sail upon a troubled ocean in a shattered bark afford us the greatest comfort imaginable thus pleasant is one selfapproving hour it shows the souls health and contributes to the satisfaction of the body whereas pride is the disease of the soul and is to it what too great fullness of blood is to the body the vessels must burst by being overstrained and a dissolution is the soonest occasioned by a tumor  but it may be asked whether there be not a dignity in human nature and if there is that very expression supposes a reason to ground pride upon  those who talk the most loudly of mans dignity may mention it upon three accounts either because it may boast of a divine original or upon account of its future prospect or because it is endowed with a reasoning principle which enables us to discover in some measure its duty toward that being who gave it its existence and though many talk of this dignity in any of these senses yet they do not suppose that man has sufficient reasons to be proud since the worm boasts the same original since humility becomes a pilgrim that has no continuing city here and that is in quest after one to come and since reason at the same time that it evidences the strength gives demonstrative proof of the weakness of unassisted human nature  since the pride is not in any of the before mentioned cases a commendable quality and since there is a generation whose eyes are lofty and whose eyelids are lifted up i shall consider i the principal causes of pride and ii two particular species of it and their effects as discoverable in human nature and lastly i shall conclude with an exhortation to humility   first then i am to consider the principal causes of pride and these are strength beauty riches honor and knowledge concerning each of which i shall speak in the order they now stand as to the first namely strength we shall have little reason to be proud of it if we do but consider how infinitely weak it is with respect to god that made us how frail with respect to duration and how liable every moment to be lost we generally value or at least ought to value things either upon account of their duration or usefulness a mans strength in the ordinary course of things cannot be of long continuance it may stay with him in the bloom and meridian of life but when he descends the hill the blood no longer performs the same brisk circulation nature grows weak and languid and sickness at last puts a final period to the ruins of old age thus this boasted strength or rather weakness is soon brought to desolation and becomes the food of worms such a consideration is sufficient one would imagine to hinder us from rejoicing in having strong bones nerves and sinews but considering the many accidents of life which in an instant can deprive us of our mighty strength we have no reason to glory in it upon account of its duration  its usefulness however one would think might furnish us with matter for pride since by it we are enabled to surmount great difficulties and endure the several vicissitudes of fortune with the greater firmness and are in a capacity to attack the common enemy of our country for vide gibson s anatomy p     courage is oftener owing to constitution than reflection with greater magnanimity  notwithstanding it is attended with these and many such advantages yet we ought not to conclude from thence that a man should so far forget himself as to be ignorant that it is the gift of god and that it is the same being that he ought to be grateful to for the continuance of it  besides if our creator had thought it very perfective of our natures it would not be so unequally distributed amongst the human race for it often happens that strength is void of wisdom and that the greatest souls take up their residence in the minutest bodies which certainly is a presumptive argument at least that we ought not be proud of our great strength but if men will be proud of it let them herd with the brutecreation who enjoy it in a much greater perfection without showing they are proud of it and then they may learn like nebuchadnezzar not to be highminded but fear  but if nothing else would bring such proud men to reason the bad effects consequent upon this sort of pride might be sufficient to terrify them from thus misplacing their affections contention duelling bloodshed and death are too often the mournful attendants upon it such proud contemners of heaven do not consider that a blessing is particularly pronounced upon those who are the maintainers of peace and that they and they particularly shall be called the children of god  as strength affords no reason for pride so neither does beauty a set of features or complexion nor a just harmony and proportion between the several parts of the body the flowers of the field are just emblems of beauty and are a lively representation of its frailty and short duration it appears charming in the spring and summer of life but in its winter scarce any faint traces or resemblance of what it was appear hollow eyes a wrinkled furrowed front and meagre cheeks are the dismal exchanges and make us reflect upon this present earth which by its ruins gives us a faint idea of the beauty of the ancient world to this unpleasant state the most consummate beauty will be reduced by old age it is not however the only enemy that beauty has to encounter with the whole family of diseases are set in battlearray against it and attack it very often in the bloom of life and bring it to a sudden desolation but how dismal is the condition of a beauty either decayed by sickness or old age can she lose this cause of her pride without a sigh nay rather does she not shed floods of tears at the very thought of it is she not dejected sullen melancholy and what is worst of all when she appears abroad is she not conscious that those whom she formerly contemned will scorn her and turn her to ridicule will not the neglect of cultivating her better part and of procuring what is above all price and the greatest ornaments of her sex the beauties of the mind strike her dumb with amazement at her own ignorant choice what is it now that she has lest to charm mankind with in the room of beauty has she good sense nay has she tolerable unimprovd sense do not her former admirers wonder at themselves for thinking her a wit whilst she had beauty she mostly resembles an idol placed in a magnificent temple whose proportions are just features regular and varnish exquisite in such a situation the spectators think something more than human inhabits the place till time that great discoverer of human vanities makes the temple and idol gradually decay and moulder into its primitive atoms and how ridiculous must it be to find after so many years of idolatry instead of a deity an unthinking idol thus a proud beauty appears upon the stage of life where art and nature equally contribute to the decoration of her externals where she has similar devotion paid to her and much the same wrongheaded unthinking attendants till time or accident discovers the cheat and frees he admirers from their impious devotions  beauty indeed when attended with innocence and clothed in humility attract strongly the eyes of the beholders awes the libertine into virtue silences by a constant perseverance in welldoing the stings of envy and detraction humanizes the cruel and polishes the savage into man but such a divine person is a rarity it appears only sometimes in the world like a meteor which though it enlightens astonishes the spectator and fills them with nothing but admiration  beauty then when unattended with virtue and good sense must choose itself as it is of a social nature companions of a degenerate kind and there are too many to press into the service vices of all complexions present themselves as volunteers and the mind being at leisure it is no wonder that they gain admittance and that follies prevail in the absence of wisdom why should we any longer admire that pride and vanity are the handmaids of beauty since all the avenues to the soul are not guarded by wisdom and prudence and since that busy flattering thing within us must have materials to work upon and since there is no nearer an object of thought than self it may be an easy consequence to be proud of this accidental transitory personal perfection whose enjoyment is trouble and whose end is bitterness besides as in sedition there are never wanting incendaries to blow up the sparks of discord into flame so it happens to a beautiful person encomiums praise adulation are generally the baneful poison served up to beauty each passage to the heart therefore should be fortified by wisdom otherwise the poison will work and destroy that virtue most becoming frail human nature humility  if beauty indeed was of a durable nature there might be some excuse for being proud of it but since it is rather an imaginary than a real good and since it is a snare rather than a blessing to the possessor since it leads people to the cultivation of the body to the neglect of the better part the soul and since it is almost as frail as the flower of the field we should no longer for these reasons be proud of beauty but if we will let us consider that to be proud of a frailty and consequently of a weakness is the disgrace the death of reason  but as frail and perishing as strength and beauty are yet in the true estimate of things we have less reason to be proud of riches since they are more foreign to us and contribute nothing to the perfection of our natures since they are said to make themselves wings and to fly away and since they ought to be valued according to the use that is made of them we ought therefore rather to be proud of the usefulness of riches than riches themselves because it is not possible that inanimate matter should have any intrinsic merit in it one would imagine that a little shining metal would not make us look big and attract our attention more than what is of infinitely more consequence the treasures of heaven but it is said that riches make the gentleman and so it seems if we would form our judgment from the general behavior of the world if a man has a splendid fortune he is thought to have reason to be proud and such a deference is generally paid this son of fortune that he begins to think himself master of some qualification that he did not perceive before no wonder then that this man of opulence and condition considering that he has so many cringing fawning sycophants about him becomes his own idol notwithstanding however the wrong judgment of the world in general it has been justly observed that manners and good sense constitute the man without taking the additional apparatus of fortune into consideration our necessities indeed and conveniences of life without mentioning them as necessary in every state make riches valuable they may be splendid proofs of humility and other christian graces they may by our feeding the hungry and instructing the ignorant and other instances of christian charity not only be the happy passports through the gates of true fame here but what is inexpressibly better convey us to a glorious heavenly jerusalem where are rivers of pleasure at gods right hand for evermore who then in his senses would make any other use of riches who any longer would make them the instruments of pride ambition pomp and grandeur nay who that has any reflection would place any trust in uncertain riches do they show any godlike power can they save or deliver from pain or can they free us from death are they not rather oftenest the instruments of pain and the infallible cause of a sudden death why then should we look upon them as our support and rock of defense since the hour of death the most solemn part of time allowed to mortality discovers their weakness and want of power they are then seen with impartiality and found like all other idols of mankind but vanity  but ought not that to be exceedingly valued that procures us all the satisfaction in life and makes lifes cup go sweetly down ought not that which procures us friends dependents equipage rich lands magnificent buildings and the pride of life to gain our affections more than any thing besides would we not be ungrateful if we did not set our hearts upon them  we would be ungrateful if we did set our hearts upon them god will not suffer divided affections for he is a jealous god and will not allow of any thing to stand in competition with him it is reasonable that it should be so are not we his workmanship did he not fashion us and if he did as reason and revelation loudly proclaim that he did is it not reasonable that the creature should pay homage to the creator in token of his dependence if in civil life one petty prince shall pay homage to another of superior dignity for some little earthly dominion how much more agreeable to reason is it that he who gives life and every good thing should receive daily homage of praise and thanksgiving from those he has created besides is it not absurd to love a creature more than the creator are not riches his creatures and are they not framed by the wise disposer of all things for our use we ought not then to turn gods mercies to our destruction but to make them subservient to one great end we should always have in view the salvation of our souls this will always make riches flow in their proper channel and their stream will convey us regularly and uniformly till we reach the ocean of eternity if we make riches our stay our boast our comfort and only support it would be no wonder if god say to us as he did to the rich man in the gospel ye fools this night your souls are required of you this exertion of his power would show the nothingness of riches and his right of dominion  and though riches are said to procure us the satisfactions of life yet the glittering outside of an ample fortune is too often like the doctors medicine or the whited sepulcher poison or rottenness are generally latent under these specious coverings and are true emblems of high life pomp and splendour men only see the gilded external they cannot see care envy malice ambition and all the passions strengthened by luxurious living by indulgence and for want of proper control could men see these licentious unrestrained passions of the mind exerted and pride directing this storm of the soul they might have a very good notion of a raging sea where waves succeed waves with the utmost violence and are agitated into foam by the strongest of all pilots the wind thus it is when reason does not preside at the helm instead of the passions those elements of life directing and wafting us like gentle breezes through this troubled ocean of life we find nothing but disorder and a kind of anarchy where each separate passion would direct the human bark its own way without listening to the dictates of reason or the pungent gnawings of a troubled conscience  besides we often find that amidst the abundance of all things the heart is cloyed with desiring and the senses with gratification and on the contrary we may observe that there are others whose desires increase with their revenues and like haman their minds are not easy or serene but rather a jarring scene of unharmonizd passions as long as they meet with any obstacles to their aspiring hopes  hence it appears that satisfaction or contentment is not consequent upon the enjoyment of riches and therefore we have no reason to be proud of that which impartially considered according to its real worth produces no solid content pain sickness and death are good criterions by which we may judge of their worth and discover them in any of these states as a false friend in the time of adversity neither of them discover any signs of relief but are strong convincing arguments of affections misplaced and of the want of a quick apprehension and a discerning judgment  though we ought not to be proud of strength beauty or riches yet honor it may be imagined is a good foundation for pride but to this i shall speak with gods leave at another opportunity  now to god the father the son and the holy ghost be ascribed as is most due all honor and praise might majesty and dominion now and for evermore  sermon ii prove xxx    there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up in a former discourse upon these words i proposed to consider the several causes of pride which generally excite that hellish passion in human nature these causes which i took notice of such as strength beauty riches honor and knowledge are the great elaters of the human mind though indeed some to the disgrace of reason be it spoken are so lost in sensuality that they are proud of vice and folly and others again are so stupidly vain and are so little deserving of the blessings of health that they are proud of nothing but what is an entailed curse upon human nature disease if such have reason to be proud the worms certainly that devour such vain corrupted wretches ought no longer by their creeping to show their humility but erect the head and set up a stiff neck others again are so humble that they are proud of disgrace contempt and what nowadays passes for the greatest contumely and is the most detested poverty and others in short are so humble that they are proud of a wicked rich mans company and think so meanly of themselves as first to get drunk and afterward like swine to wallow in the mire and some men are so submissive as to to think it an honor and are consequently proud of being the standing jest of men superior to themselves either in fortune or preferment and they measure their own greatness which is an amazing argument of their stupidity according to the ridicule with which they are received but such men that are thus ridiculously proud are not worth a serious reproof i leave them therefore to be treated with what they are so mighty fond of ridicule i shall proceed to the more natural causes of pride which remain to be considered namely honor and knowledge  and first with respect to honor some may imagine that it is a good foundation for pride because it supposes merit in the person honored it supposes honor to be due to personal merit and that merit thus honored should appear something superior to the rest of mankind because eminence of station conveys to us an idea of grandeur magnificence and superiority  that merit should be honored is not the question but whether the person thus honored upon account of his merit should be proud of it s the question to be solved which indeed will admit of no dispute if we do but consider its uncertainty emptiness and unsatisfactoriness honor as its consists in the idea of persons about us must be very precarious some there are who will not allow us any merit and consequently will neither honor or esteem us others there are who notwithstanding we have no merit yet upon account of some advantage accruing to them from us will both honor and esteem us hence then this sort of honor is uncertain because it depends upon the notions of people about us it is of a precarious tenure because peoples minds are changeable upon the least hint and by consequence we are often deemed honorable or dishonorable with little or no reason out of whim and contradiction out of malice or goodnature this is the general way of judging by the bulk of mankind but if we would be proud of any sort of honor attributed to us we should be proud then and only then when the man of true honor and an honest heart of sound principles and impartial judgment condescends to honor us with particular marks of esteem then we might conclude with the moralist that it is a glorious thing to be commended by a person of known integrity this however in reality ought not to be the occasion of pride but rather an incentive to adorn our minds with every christian virtue which would promote the peace and tranquillity of the human soul  if we consider the honors and titles of men in an higher sphere of action we shall see less reason to be proud of them when men are in full pursuit after them they are charming to the eye and fill the imagination with chimerical notions of happiness the prospect at a distance is delightful though the way to them is like the way to heaven narrow rugged intricate they appear like a meadow at a distance nothing but one continued bed of flowers but when the candidates for them have gained the summit they find to their great disappointment the flowers thinsown the weeds innumerable thus empty and unsatisfactory are the honors and titles that men make such a bustle about they are like the poor mahometans dreams of sensual pleasure in his future paradise which if scripture and reason may be credited will in the end like all other dreams appear nothing else but mere delusion that honors and titles are of the same unsatisfactory nature we are informed by that best of all informers experience while men are in quest after them they are then thought to be great augmentations of happiness not considering that what they pursue is within themselves in their own power otherwise the greatest far the greatest part of mankind that are deprived of honors and titles would be unhappy and live in a particular flatness of spirits would be pensive and overcome with the black passions we find on the contrary that happiness is confined to no station if a man will think himself happy he is happy it therefore consists in opinion is a thought and has its existence nowhere but in the brain those then that are content with their present allotment assigned them by providence are as happy as this present state of things will allow them but such as are always thirsting after something external are unhappy the desire supposes a want and where want is there is a want of happiness both those then that are in quest after honors and titles and those that recede from honors and preferments and find no satisfaction in titles must be unhappy because change of station supposes unhappiness in the stations from whence both parties receded agreeable to this is the opinion of the heathen moralist we seem says he as if surfeited with the toils of state and therefore choose a fit place for contemplation yet in that very place of retirement where we thought to have met with composure ambition springs up with a fresh gale and drives our shattered barks into a second ocean of troubles thus happiness is the growth of no particular soil confined to no age or situation in life it is every where where there is contentment but never there where the appetities are unruly and where cares are predominant the still scenes of life bid fairest for it and high life is the most remarkable for the want of it why then should men pursue after that which in the very pursuit is troublesome whose enjoyment is unsatisfactory and whose conclusion is vanity and certainly it is very unbecoming a rational being whose hopes and views are not limited by time but extended to eternity to pursue after place his confidence in and be proud of unhappiness solomon as much as any man living experienced the truth of this observation he gathered together every thing that he thought would contribute to his happiness he became great and increased more than any before him at jerusalem and withheld not his heart from any joy but what was the result of this enquiry nothing but a melancholy reflection that all was vanity and vexation of spirit in the next place he considered wisdom and folly and madness and saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness but whether we ought to be proud of it shall be our next enquiry  that we ought not to be proud of wisdom the end proposed to be obtained by it is a sufficient evidence it has been observed that all our knowledge is to know ourselves we are to consider the different relations we stand in to god and mankind our extensive ignorance and minute knowledge if this be thoroughly weighed this very knowledge will awake the sleeping sparks of humanity in us and make us think justly of god meanly of ourselves and humanely of our fellow creatures reason was given us for wise ends at the same time that it assists us in the several necessaries and occurrences of life it is a light to guide our steps in all moral and religious truths but at the same time that it is a principal assistant in the attainment of knowledge it ought to be a check upon us on supposition that we are more knowing than other men letters were termed humaniores by the latins because they were supposed to polish and refine mens manners and the poets supposed that learning had the power of humanizing savages into men but it is strange that those who are the most remarkable for an extensive knowledge should be the greatest examples of inhumanity stranger still that those who teach mankind their duty should be the first transgressors of it strangest still that those who contradict the whole world should not be able to bear one single contradiction if in common conversation such give a full liberty to their tongues scandal flows from them in copious streams and like water that partakes of the mineral through which it passes always leaves a stain behind that denotes its impurity such men have not yet attained the greatest knowledge the knowledge of themselves they have indeed the knowledge that puffs up which like the philosophy of old is vain empty and engenders pride  but ought not the knowledge of our excessive ignorance to pull down our vanity do we know certainly what passes within us do we know ourselves do not we seem rather to have no notion if we are to be judged by our actions of our beings end and aim and with respect to things without us can we be said to have any knowledge to boast of can we comprehend their natures uses and ends for which they were created do we know causes from there is scarce a production in nature says the great mr boil the uses whereof to human life are thoroughly known or understood and in another place he observes that very few of natures works have been sufficiently considered even as to those qualities that belong to them there is a kind of terra incognita in every natural body reserved for the discovery of futurity  vide boil s phil works vol   effects or can we really account for all or any appearances of nature is not rather most of what we call knowledge of these things founded on conjecture and even with relation to our duty do we know when virtue ends and vice begins are we not rather often ignorant of the boundaries of each and if it be admitted that we are ignorant of the most common occurrences why should we any longer pretend to fathom by our finite capacities the mysteries of the gospel or correct the various dispensations of providence as if we were wiser than the wise disposer of all things this carping state of ours mostly resembles if i may be allowed the poetical comparison the fly placed upon a large tower which though it cannot see an inch around it yet it has the impudence to condemn the structure of the whole so it is with man placed in this sphere of action he is more apt to cavil with gods proceedings than humbly to acquiesce in real ignorance the truth is every one would be termed a man of knowledge hence arise endeavors to strike out new lights which oftentimes instead of serving as a clue to guide us out of the laybrinths of error only increase the mazes and bewilder the reasoning faculty hence arise cavils disputes criticisms authors are made to speak by a perverse interpretation a sense they never meant and often every error every folly is to the scripture laid a sad instance this of the ignorance or perverseness of human nature a pregnant proof of vanity selfsufficiency and disingenuity such should consider however that then men show the greatest signs of knowledge when they ingenuously own that they know nothing as they ought to know this humility is generally the product of great experience laborious thinking love of retirement and an assiduous application to books and no wonder since the knowledge of the great ignorance of mankind naturally leads or ought to lead men at least to the suspicion of their own  but supposing that we do know a little which is nothing in comparison to what we are ignorant of what reason is there for us to be proud of it if it be true that an increase of knowledge is an increase of sorrow certainly there can be no reason or foundation for being proud of knowledge would not every person of sense imagine that he who is proud of a disease or any distemper because it is fashionable is a proper object for ridicule and by parity of reason i think none who have experienced that the search after knowledge is painful causes a wearisomeness of the flesh and damages the organs of thinking will conclude that men ought to be proud of what they know because it is an absurdity to maintain that men ought to be proud of that which contributes largely to the unhappiness of life  this pride however does not take its rise from the knowledge of our duty christianity inspires no such meanness humility is prescribed as the properest dress for man to appear in and human nature is the object of universal benevolence if men were not above studying the sacred rule of life we should meet with more humility and less contempt more candor in judging and less rancour more sincerity and less cunning a tenderer regard for human misery and less fondness for self  but as long as this divine luminarys forgot neglected despised it is no wonder that folly springs up and choaks the remaining seeds of virtue is there a man wise in his own conceit that boasts of his superior knowledge and in consequence of that grows supercilious there is more hope of a fool than of him is there a man passionate when his sentiments are contradicted there is more hope of the conversion of an infidel than of him is there a man doubting of and consequently enquiring into the foundation of moral obligation whether it is placed in the nature reason or truth or relation of things without taking into consideration the greatest incentive to action the will of god such a one may show himself a proud reasoner but he will make us think that he has little reason for action and is not too much burdened with christianity such generally usher their sentiments into the world not with too much civility and complaisance words however delivered with modesty deference and ingenuity best become fallible man whereas words delivered with a scornful tone of voice with a contemptible look and haughty gesture either move our pity laughter or hatred of the ridiculous speaker pride makes a man discover his knowledge and consequently his ignorance at once but modesty like the blushing rose only unfolds its beauties by degrees that the world might not be dazzled with all its charms at one view  a smattering knowledge in the sciences has been looked upon as a dangerous thing it is apt to intoxicate and make the head giddy it is incumbent upon us therefore to drink deep or taste not of the fountains from whence our knowledge flows if we look into the world we shall see the bad effects of little knowledge we shall have a full view of controversy and all its noisy attendants anger abuse detraction impertinence insincerity all enlisted to fight under her banners and pride commanding the attack better would it be if men were ingenuous with a little knowledge than employ an extensive knowledge in order to corrupt mens morals or to the prejudice of religion better it is to know nothing than to use a little or an extensive knowledge to their eternal ruin fools are suffered to speak for our diversion and amusement but learned or halflearned fools that misapply extraordinary or tolerable talents and are actuated by a bad principle such as pride is must remember that pride generally goes before a fall that it is contemned by good men in this world and what is an aggravation of it it is an abomination to the great judge of heaven and earth both in this world and in that which is to come  since then none of the beforementioned arguments made use of in the behalf of pride are significant i shall as i proposed in the second place consider two particular species of pride and their effects as distinguishable in human nature  the first that i shall mention is pride in power which is of an assuming nature and thinks that every thing is its due it contemns and looks upon all mankind as its vassals and consequently if it meets with opposition it swells itself into a tumor and like imprisoned sulphur and nitre when rarefied to a great degree it thunders out destruction against every thing that opposes its course self generally does and indeed ought to mingle with all our actions and what has been said of that soft passion of the human soul love is more applicable to self for it more particularly mingles with life and forms the very soul but for a man to show too great an esteem for self in exclusion of all benevolent affections toward human nature and all good dispositions toward god is in reality to make himself both idol and idolater criminal indeed it is to set up an idol in any sense in opposition to the true god but to set up imperfection against all possible perfection is to act contrary to common sense and the dictates which our common infirmities suggest to us  this sort of pride may truly be reckoned a false mirror it magnifies objects above their natural magnitude and makes even the infirmities of our nature appear as something meritorious it gives a gloss and false coloring to every action and hinders a man from thinking like a moral agent from speaking like a rational one and from acting like a christian a man of this wrong turn is supercilious because vain affected in his discourse and generally speaks as if he trod in buskins because to talk otherwise would be falling from his dignity and a criminal compliance with the vulgar he loves to see people flock to his levee because that proclaims his greatness and to keep them to dance attendance a good while before that he is pleased to favor them with an admittance at once demonstrates his superiority and their dependence  but what is worst of all to be favored with a gracious smile after some years fruitless attendance is often looked upon as an hopeful reception though it too often proves a pregnant evidence of his insincerity and their want of discretion  this method of acting is generally observed by the proud man toward those that are not of a much inferior rank but if we view him in another light in relation to the bulk of mankind we shall find him their tyrant not their benefactor he considers them as made for his service and values them only as we do brutes for their usefulness if they offend him he rages if they contradict him he is furious and ready to commit the greatest violence and what is worst of all he carries his honor in the point of his sword not considering that humility is the greatest ornament of greatness and that humanity exercised toward mankind that partake of the same common nature that have the same creator the same redeemer and the same sanctifier joined with the same prospect of happiness is what becomes every descendant from adam  but if we shift the scene and introduce this proud man under the character of a friend we shall find that he is not capable of that refinement that delicacy of soul which is necessary to the very existence of friendship can he throw off that affectation of superiority which when affected is generally the death of friendship can he in common conversation on indifferent matters give ear to a friends advice can he thwart his own inclination in order to do him a pleasure can he forgo an advantage that he may thereby be serviceable to his friend will he make his friends cause his own will he oblige him without telling him of the obligation will he connive at his failings without making them the subject of his rude mirth and illtimed ridicule will he comfort him in sickness or when under the pressure of adverse fortune will he support him nay rather will he not expose him to a merciless world which will scoff at poverty and sneer at human misery whose pity is even cruel and whose charity because attended with barbarous reflections is almost equal to the agonies of death the truth is the proud man as he would not choose to have any upon a level with himself cannot have a true friend he may be attended with sycophants and such whose interest it is to keep fair with him he may have vassals that will give into any criminal compliances in obedience to an imperious master but he is deprived of true friends whose counsels are the medicine of life whose wounds are faithful and whose affections are perpetual  the reason is there cannot be an union of souls where a distance is kept up and where men endeavor to maintain an inequality where there is a distance there is reservedness where there is reservedness there is want of confidence where there is a want of confidence there is a want of sincerity and when all or any of these are wanting no real friendship can exist  this is the very case of the proud man his dependants fear him and perhaps hate him his equals contemn him and if he has superiors they make a jest of him and this too is owing to his contemptuous behavior and his supposed inequality which he affects toward other men well were it for such a man if he were placed in such a situation of life where he might taste the sweets of friendship he would no longer practice the forbidding aspect the haughty gesture or the civil leer a gentle softness would steal upon him unawares and make him feel what he never felt before joys at anothers prosperity and a becoming distress for anothers woes  but the principal reason why he is not susceptible of friendship is because proud and haughty scorner is his name because he deals in proud wrath as virtue is the basis or foundation of all true friendship so vice is the death of it anger proud anger especially is a fruitful source of ills it is an enemy to truth peace candor benevolence and by consequence is a mortal enemy to friendships sacred flame friendship has been called a religion that takes its source from the first and points like it to heaven and almost in this scene of misery antidates its bliss miserable then must be the condition of this proud man without this balsam of life because health is reckoned a disease life death without the agreeable society of a friend  but of this and some other effects i shall speak god willing at some other time  now to god the father the son and the holy ghost be ascribed as is most due all honor and praise might majesty and dominion now and for evermore  sermon iii prove xxx    there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up in two former discourses upon these words i considered first the several causes of pride which either upon account of their uncertain tenure or their unsatisfactoriness could not be any proper foundation for such an elation of mind in the next place i proposed to treat of two particular species of pride and their effects and lastly to conclude with an exhortation to humility one species of pride which is pride in power and one effect of it namely its being incapable of friendship i have already considered i come now to consider farther this proud man in a religious view and here we shall find him behaving after the same manner to his god as he did to his neighbor for it may be observed as an invariable maxim that a man that has not good principles in morality can never have good ones in religion and religion on the contrary enforced by proper sanctions is the best cause of good morals the proud man then cannot be a good religionist because a bad moralist and certainly from the contempt of his neighbor there is a natural and easy transition to the contempt of the god that made him and it is no wonder on the contrary that if he despises his maker and preserver he by consequence will despise those of the same species with himself and if a man will work himself up to such a pitch of wickedness as to think meanly of gods handiworks we may easily conclude that whatever comes from god will afford matter for ridicule to the proud man to be a proud boaster an haughty dogmatical dictator a proud reasoner and an imperious and abusive writer are ingredients which are almost nay i may venture to add altogether essential to the composition of this proud man  no wonder then that the contempt of revelation is owing to pride and that for two reasons either because first the proud man is guilty of great immoralities and then it is no wonder that a religion whose purity forbids all irregularities of soul and body should not meet with a good reception with one that has contracted vicious habits and what is worst of all a dishonest heart to submit to such a restraint which contradicts the immoderate sallies of indulged passions and commands him not to set up his horn nor a stiff neck and likewise that he should not be highminded but fear shows as he erroneously thinks an abject meanness of soul not considering that to act viciously is to act meanly and to contemn what god has given us for a rule of life is to set up weakness in opposition to omnipotence and human folly in contradiction to infinite wisdom or  secondly this proud man despises revelation because he thinks reason is able to bring him to happiness now if we consider the strength of human reason since the fall of man we shall find it a bad pilot heathen ignorance heathen superstition and heathen follies are a demonstrative evidence of its profound darkness and if it was not sufficient to direct them to an happy immortality how should it direct us since all are not it is allowed by all that if man does but act up to reason supposing no revelation from god to exist he will finally obtain mercy this is the opinion of the learned concerning the heathen world philosophers to the glorious mansions of the just and if it does but see through a glass darkly even when illuminated by revelation certainly when unassisted it must be only the glimmering of light and must resemble the lightening which as it pierces through a dense dark cloud only serves to make the darkness visible and the horror of it more horrible thus reason at the same time that it affords the understanding a little light evidences likewise its want of it can we then be proud of this boasted reason which is darkness when compared to the light of the gospel or is it not reasonable that it submit to that which god has declared by signs and wonders to be his will does it not daily prove its own weakness and the darkness that it is involved in by a thousand instances is it not daily overturning old hypotheses and framing new ones is it not often lost in doubt and conjecture and has not doubting been a science what has reason then in it that we should admire it to our destruction is not thus to admire it like preferring a taper to the light of the sun such a preference brings the romantic dungeon into our view in the middle of which is a taper burning which only discovers the gloomy horror of the place and the confusion and indistinct appearance of objects or rather it resembles the poetical descent into the infernal regions where the ghosts specter gorgons hydras and chimeras glide along just discernible the pitchy darkness interspersed with faint rays of light adds horror to the scene by making if i may be allowed the expression the darkness visible thus is reason it consists of light and shade but its shadowy parts like those of a melancholy representation are predominant it sees indistinctly apprehends slowly and for the most part judges erroneously to ascribe then too much to reason in disparagement of revelation not only discovers pride but demonstrates likewise the perverseness as well as ignorance of human nature and certainly to glory in that whose imperfections the writings of all ages fully evince shows that one cannot boast of weakness and infirmities without incurring the censure of having a weak understanding one might imagine that reason would mortify our pride since all the errors all the follies committed either in thought or action may be attributed to reason so true is the observation of the schoolmen that the act of the understanding preceeds that of the will  these are the common effects of pride in one sort of men but if we take a view of another sort and its effects which i proposed to treat of we shall find it the reverse of the former this is with great propriety termed pride that will lick the dust that is it will submit to a mean unbecoming behavior so that it may by that means raise itself to a greater height it can be supple and cringing to any that can do it a service but when the service is done it can as readily disavow it it can appear in any shape and become all things to all men that it may gain some to its interest it can like that cunning greedy animal the hyena when it wants to make a prey seign the distressed tone of voice by way of decoy it appears under the mask of friendship and discovers itself in gentle smiles obliging gestures and complaisant professions of good offices thus the gilded pill of insinuation goes smoothly down and proves in the end rank poison to those that are so unfortunate as to swallow it for it is certainly true that those who are so weak as to suffer themselves thus to be imposed upon are generally contemned and ridiculed by the very persons that made use of them as the instruments of their ambition and when we have a full view of such persons in power and see them arrived at the height of their most sanguine hopes we cannot help comparing them to gaudy butterflies that undergo several changes of their condition before they appear in their variegated plumage and as the progress of the latter through their several states before they arrive at any tolerable state of perfection is abject and grovelling so those mean candidates for honor and preferment ascend step by step through a tedious chain of meannesses and before they can be men in power they must be the tools and instruments of ambition and oftentimes to be thoroughpaced villains is the only recommendation for them to a post of honor thus mean condescensions and criminal compliances are made that men may gain the highest spoke in the wheel of fortune not considering that such an eminence requires a sound head and a particular firmness of soul otherwise a giddiness may seize them and tumble them to the lowest spoke to their own confusion nay perhaps destruction and joy of the gazing multitude  but this sort of pride is oftentimes more eminently criminal than the former because it is particularly guilty of that foul crime of ingratitude it wears a mask till it has gained the full completion of its desires but when that is once gained it no longer appears under a borrowed shape but shifts the scene and reassumes the true character hence is it that riches and power are said to discover the man then he is at liberty to act as inclination dictates whereas before narrowness of circumstances and a contracted sphere of action were terrible obstacles in the ways of vice experience confirms this if we take a view of mankind the younger part especially that abound in riches we shall see them not like epicurus given to a contemplative life but like his followers immersed in voluptuousness sunk in pleasure and swimming down the current of inclination if then you would know mankind grant them the full extent of their wishes and then you will see a new sort of inclinations in the bud and gradually branching themselves out to an immoderate height unless timely checked in their growth by discretion so true is the observation that the vices of a great many are not of an enormous size because they occupy but a low station in life something similar to this is produced in the serpent winter congeals its poison and hinders its malign influences but when the summer appears it dissolves the poison and makes it pernicious in its operations no wonder then that pride is the spawn of riches and power and that ingratitude takes its rise from pride since it thinks it demeans itself prettily if it pays or owns an obligation especially to persons of no figure it thinks its eminent station a sufficient security against insult and that its riches can ward off any blow that is aimed at it on account of its ingratitude hence this vice is the child of pride and nursed by riches both of them are to the mind what vernal showers are to the earth each contributes to the nourishment of its respective plants and at the same time that some of a good quality thrive others either unprofitable or of a noxious nature swell into an immoderate size and it is not surprising if ingratitude shoots up its head in a luxuriant soil when fostered by a genial warmth and if it does spring up as experience shows it too often does it proves the most detestable of all vices because to it as to one common center the other vices incline but more particularly breach of faith breach of friendship injustice oppression and what is worst of all murder often concludes the black catalogue and shuts the dismal scene since there is such a connection in vice and more eminently in this it is no wonder that the ancients honored ingratitude with a particular mark of distinction to denote at the same time the unnatural offense and also their abhorrence of it  but ingratitude is not the only vice that attends this sort of pride impudence with its handmaids intemperance and uncleanness are generally attendants upon it for pride in power cannot brook a contradiction to its inclinations if it should it would argue want of power to compass what inclination prompted to not considering that a bad inclination thwarted tends toward the conquest of ourselves than which nothing is so difficult and at the same time so honorable but this sort of pride generally behaves with the same inherent meanness when in power as when in its rise and if it could put off all modesty in its dawnings of power it is not strange if it displays itself in scenes of lewdness when power is added to inclination  and as this sort of pride is ungrateful and debauched in its practice so is it envious at anothers success superior merit either in action or conduct superior fortune or superior titles or a princes favor are sufficient motives to envy the desire of raising himself to the state of superiority without sufficient abilities to enable him to do it is the very cause of an envious man and the very knowledge of anothers larger talents is often the object of envy because sometimes from superiority of abilities one may with some degree of certainty predict anothers future eminence in life this perhaps might be mordecais case otherwise what reason had haman to be discomposed at the behavior of a man so much beneath him the reason indeed is said to be this mordecai would not pay him a proper deference he neither stood up nor moved for him therefore was he under hamans great displeasure and though haman enjoyed the greatest honors the greatest riches and was blessed with a multitude of children yet continued he all these avail me nothing so long as i see mordecai sitting in the kings gate besides the contempt shown by this jew to the kings prime minister there must be some other reason why this proud man could not bear a sight of mordecai he hated him probably for his open contempt envied him by reason of his relation to the queen and because he seemed to have qualifications sufficient to enable him to supplant haman in the royal favor if this was not the case why was hamans wrath so violent as not only to thirst after the blood of mordecai but likewise the blood of all the jews a little contempt one would imagine could not do all this i should rather suppose this proud man painted his own downfall and the rise of mordecai in his imagination this melancholy consideration might make him envious envy would naturally make him hate and hatred might hurry him on to desire the utter extirpation of the jews not so the generous spartan he was glad to know that there were brave men in the city besides himself great and good men have a benevolent disposition and as they are good themselves they love to see it in others and are ready to forward others too in their several prosperous pursuits in life whereas envy is a bitter enemy to anothers fame and as in natural bodies there is required a fitness to reflect the rays of light so in the human soul it is requisite that there should be a fit disposition to receive the brightness of anothers fame otherwise it will be susceptible of that odious passion envy which generally throws a shade over the bright parts of anothers character like opaque bodies that suffocate the rays of light and as every shadow owes it birth to light so fame true fame especially produces calumny and censure  besides the beforementioned effects i might here mention that pride is often the cause of infidelity because first pride occasions an affectation of singularity which is wont to take much with such persons as desire to be distinguished by being thought to have a greater share of penetration than other men  and secondly because it raises a desire of being independent and uncontrollable by any one when this meets with persons of an imperious temper as all proud men generally are of such a temper it is a strong temptation to skepticism and infidelity but as this would carry me beyond my present purpose i shall as i proposed in the last place conclude with a short exhortation to humility  when i recommend this virtue to the world i would not be so understood as to recommend all kinds of humility there are two sorts of a degenerate nature the first respects our behavior to man to whom we may attribute too much and too little to ourselves this may be of dangerous consequence to our integrity because if we suffer ourselves to be directed entirely by others we may often meet with ill advisers and consequently with ill advice if in religious matters especially where reason may be safely appealed to we will not make use of our own reason but the reason of others it is no wonder that some amongst us make shipwreck of their faith and deny even the lord that bought them for the thinking too little as well as too much of human reason is equally dangerous and opens a wide gap to errors both of principle and practice  the second respects the great author of our being whom some have painted as enthroned in terrible majesty and splendour not to be approached in prayer by any mortal and since he is not immediately to be applied to intercessors have been invented that should convey their petitions to the throne of grace this is degenerating into heathenism and is an introduction of a plurality of gods because to apply the attributes of god to creatures is to make gods of those creatures and consequently is both robbing god of his honor and likewise making his workmanship upon a level with him this behavior is particularly inveighed against by st paul when he says let no man beguile you of your reward by a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels this command of the apostle is confirmed by reason because it is absurd to offer up prayers to beings of a limited nature who can be supposed neither omnipresent nor omniscient and therefore cannot be the proper objects of our addresses  true humility then is of a different nature from the beforementioned sorts it relates to god and our neighbor that which relates to god consists in a due sense of our own meanness and his excellency which produces in us a lowly and unfeigned submission to his will and that which has reference to our neighbor consists both in having a mean and low opinion of ourselves and also in being content that others should have so of us the first of these is contrary to pride the other to vainglory which is always an attendant upon pride as the practice of this virtue contributes greatly to our present as well as future happiness as it comes strongly recommended to us by the doctrine and example of the blessed jesus who was meek and lowly of heart why should it be any longer thought a meanness to behave with humility dare the proud and haughty scorner say that it is mean to imitate a god so much every proud man avows that will not follow the great pattern of humility proposed in the gospel such declare themselves not only the enemies of god but likewise of mankind because no human society can subsist happily without humility and because this eminent virtue is the very basis and support of all as well social as religious virtues  whoever is humble is likewise meek is benevolent is beneficent his years pass on with pleasure and fly softly away being accompanied with the kind wishes of his fellow creatures and the pleasing consciousness of a wellspent life these serve both for ballast and a pleasing gale to waft the human bark safe through the storms of time till it arrives at the still ocean of eternity where saints and angels are ready to hail him welcome to the happy and eternal shore  whereas pride is accompanied with shame and contempt in this gloomy and melancholy state of things and when it has passed the confines of this world it must be consigned over to those unhappy and dismal mansions where the proud contemners of heaven the devil and his impious adherers reside in perpetual anguish  which that all of us may avoid may god of his infinite mercy grant etc  candor and mild humanity recommended a sermon a sermon galat vi   brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted the great virtue so much talked of and so little practiced in the world is charity every one can reflect on his neighbor for the want of it but when he is to speak charitably himself of his fellow creatures and to make allowances for their several failures in duty he forgets not only that he is a man but that he has like other men the principles of corruption strongly interwoven with his very nature why men are thus uncharitable two reasons may be particularly assigned pride occasions it in some and consciousness of guilt in others when the proud man asperses his neighbor it is supposed that he is innocent himself of the crime with which he charges another and consequently this dispraise is a tacit commendation of himself none he thinks behaves with that strict honor justice and integrity in the cause of truth or with greater piety toward god but he ought to consider that if he wants charity which neither envieth thinks ill or is puffed up he is as sounding brass or as a tinkling symbol each of which is a sufficient emblem of the proud man whose best works because tinctured with bad principles are lighter than vanity and as sound supposes emptiness in the sounding instrument so a carping censorious temper supposes a want of that charity which is never uneasy at anothers good it supposes a want of humanity and fellowseeling for those that partake of the same common nature and a forgetfulness that he is surrounded with the same temptations and liable to error and misconduct by the importunate impulses of the same depraved nature if the proud man would look into his own instead of his neighbors breast and there probe with the sword of the spirit into every wound that sin has made if he would not shrink at the scrutiny but examine to the bottom of every sore with impartiality he would find so much need of his healing art in his own corrupted self as would hinder him from either wounding the reputation or making wider orifices in those already wounded this would learn the proud man humility instead of an overweaning opinion of himself and instead of censoriousness a fear of committing the like offenses with other men  but though pride is often the cause of uncharitableness yet the consciousness of guilt is generally the greatest cause of the want of charity guilt is of a sociable nature it loves company though not perhaps to evidence its crimes yet to give a countenance to its criminal behavior none would stand alone or be the butt or talk of a multitude especially in things of a shameful tendency but when a number of men practice the same enormities they make vice fashionable and therefore lessen in some measure in the eye of the world the evil and consequently the shamefulness of sin for this reason it is why we are commanded in scripture not to follow a multitude to sin we too naturally conclude when the generality of mankind are unanimous in the practice of any one thing though morally bad that it is not so evil as represented otherwise such numbers of men would not unite in the practice of it hence it is that such a general practice if coinciding with the natural bent of their tempers is a great inducement for others to swim down the same stream of inclination and to act as if there were no superintending observer of their actions this society this partnership in wickedness being such an alleviation of a crime at least in the eye of the wrongjudging world it is no wonder that we find persons of bad conduct prattling about the malpractices of others they have no doubt some end to be served by it and this certainly is the very end they would serve by their uncharitableness they would choose to have others guilty at least supposed guilty of the like meannesses with themselves to be the only persons guilty of irregularities would be too scandalous to be endured with any tolerable assurance they would be then looked upon as enemies to society and men would avoid them for fear of catching the infection and at the same time that they would be the objects of pity they would likewise be the objects of contempt but as i before observed as society in wickedness in some measure though unjustly palliates the commission of it hence arises that grand motive to uncharitableness men that are vicious would have others practice the like vices and when they see others fall away from the peaceable paths of wisdom they immediately conceive an inhuman hellish joy and like death in milton grin horribly a ghastly smile  since the angels in heaven are said to express a particular satisfaction for the recovery of one sinner from the error of his way though these happy beings are exempted from the infirmities common to human nature we certainly who are sharers of the same nature and liable upon account of that nature to err should have a mutual compassion and consequently should mutually connive at each others failures and those that are so unhappy as to fall away in the hour of trial we that stand firm in the cause of virtue should endeavor to restore in the spirit of meekness lest we also be tempted and after temptation fall and then our circumstances would need the same compassionate allowances which we had formerly shown toward our erring fellowwarriors  to such a behavior though those that are spiritual are particularly obliged yet it is incumbent upon the laity as well as the ministers of the gospel to exhibit the same lenity meekness and compassion toward their offending brethren because as they are men they may err and consequently may stand in need of the same indulgence with those toward whom they have extended their mercy  the text indeed points out to us the particular duty of every minister of the gospel but as the great law of charity ought to be practiced by all none excepted i shall consider in this enlarged sense i that every one ought to seek not only his own but his neighbors good and ii that we never show a greater regard for our neighbors welfare than when we endeavor to restore him to a state of grace when he has been overtaken in a fault and iii we ought to do this because all of us may stand in need some time or other of the like charity   i then i am to show that every one ought to seek not only his own but his neighbors good and this will best appear from the consideration of our dependence upon one another mutual wants always suppose mutual assistance one mans deficiency should be assisted by another mans abundance whether it respects the body or the mind if a man has a plentiful fortune he ought to consider it as a treasure with which he is entrusted in order to supply the wants of his fellow creatures or if he has wisdom he may easily imagine it was given him to serve him for some good end and no better end can be assigned than the promoting the good of society wisdom indeed is naturally of a communicative nature and extends its benign influence like its great author god almighty to all around it the bad as well as the good find its benesicial effects both with regard to their temporal and eternal interest but as their temporal bears no proportion to their future interest it is the business of a wise man to let the light that he is possessed of shine for the benefit of his fellowtravellers lest they having their understandings darkened by the mists of passion might lose the way that leads to happiness thus the ignorance of one man demands the aid of anothers superior wisdom and it is an injustice to deny to him that wants this necessary aid because we are commanded if we have wisdom not to have it to ourselves and the very notion of its being communicated to us by the father of lights supposes that we ought to imitate the bright author of it and the communicating it in greater proportion to one than another supposes likewise that those who have it in greater abundance should make up the deficiences by a proper communication neither can we evidence a more grateful return for this blessing of wisdom nor greater wisdom in ourselves than by employing it in the service of virtue and religion  but our obligation to consult our neighbors good will still be more evident if we consider that we all partake of one common nature the being subject to the like infirmities demands a similar sympathy of affection and this very sympathy this rejoicing with those that do rejoice and grieving with those that grieve is surely a strong argument for the doing our neighbor all possible good and if it was not given for this end in several cases it would occasion our unhappiness this sympathy which prevails more strongly in some constitutions than others makes us uneasy and consequently unhappy at the sight of some particular objects and this uneasiness often continues upon the removal of the objects and never deserts us till it has strongly impelled us to relieve their misery and place them in a more happy condition if indeed there was not this impulse this strong propensity in our natures many would be forgetsul of the relations that subsist between them and their fellow creatures and not withstanding this inherent monitor we too often sind by experience that some are of such hardened dispositions that neither the ties of humanity affinity or religion will incline them to acts of kindness or even to show that which will cost them nothing benevolence  the behavior of some however toward their fellow creatures ought not to encourage us in the like cruelty as we have the same infirmities of nature these very infirmities should teach us compassion but this charitable indulgence ought no otherwise to be extended to flagrant workers of iniquity than by endeavors first by gentle means to recall them from the broad path that leads to destruction and in the next place if these lenitives fail corrosives ought to be applied in order to correct in time the grossness of their humors and the corruption of their habits lest others should catch the infection and be carried by the violence of its stream into the ocean of eternity  to form exeuses for such and to color over their behavior with artful glosses would not be charity but an evident demonstration of our own latent corruptions it would be inhuman to palliate them and prove that we have no regard either for the present or future wellbeing of such offenders interest indeed that director of the human affections is too often in these days the grand obstacle to the performance of this charitable duty it is the grand motive to a false complaisance lying face smooth tongue and supple knee all which are used at the expense of truth sincerity and every thing laudable to tell a man his crimes even with the most compassionate tenderness generally is attended with the criminals enmity and aversion and even to speak truth in indifferent matters to some is the direct way to kindle the latent sparks of anger and blow it into flame but in either of these cases is the exercise of the great law of charity or the defense of truth to be neglected because some have neither the virtue nor good sense to hear either the one or the other with patience certainly we should pay a greater deference to reason religion and the dignity of our own natures than to see ungodliness deluging the earth without endeavoring to impede its progress or without attempting to dry up such overflowings that will if permitted to spread affect both the present and future health of society to feed the hungry to clothe the naked and to direct the wandering bewildered traveller into the way that leads to the haven where he would be are looked upon as actions truly charitable and as the promoting of the temporal interest of our fellowworkers is deemed an act of charity so by parity of reason the assisting of our fellowtravellers to the obtaining an higher good eternal in the heavens must be proportionably a greater act of charity and consequently the obligation to the performance of it must likewise be greater more weighty and therefore the neglect of it the more criminal but this charity ought to be exhibited to our neighbor because  ii we never show a greater regard for our neighbors welfare than when we endeavor to restore him to a state of grace when he has been overtaken in a fault and this regard we may show in two respects both with relation to his principles and practice when the heart from whence proceed the issues of life or death is corrupted the stream that flows from it must be consequently impure the fountain then must be purified and refined before it can produce salutary streams the noxious qualities which it has contracted either upon account of its stagnation or by reason of its having received unwholesome particles from other bodies must be purged away and then it will satisfy the thirsty soul with good as the heart then may be considered as a fountain where the first principles of action lie concealed and as according to the goodness or badness of those principles men proceed to act well or ill so a strict guard should be set over the heart lest it should form schemes both detrimental to itself and society and as generally we keep a watchful eye over a man that has once deceived us let his future professions of honor be what they will so likewise as the heart often deceives us and has been pronounced by one that knew what was in it that it is deceitful above all things we ought so to attend its inward workings as to make it produce something that may advance both our present and future health great care then ought to be taken when the heart is young and tender and therefore susceptible of any impression to stamp only such images upon it as will excite not only agreeable but beneficial sensations when thus the pleasant and profitable are so beautifully united we may naturally expect a glorious harvest of corresponding good actions but first every one ought to encourage none but good dispositions in his breast otherwise like the deaf adder he will not hear the voice of the charmer charm she never so wisely the instructor that endeavors to sow the seeds the first principles of goodness in the hearts of his hearers meets with but very indifferent success when either the ears of his audience are not disposed to hear or when the devil has sown tares beforehand in their hearts  instruction however is never more seasonable than when the heart is thus corrupted bad principles ought to be checked in their growth or they will be too luxuriant ever to be entirely eradicated and if men will not check them themselves it is charity in another to admonish them of their danger and show them the precipice from whence if such principles spring forth into a continued series of vicious actions they must unavoidably fall this is snatching a man out of the fire and placing him in a state of safety where he will meet with no disturbance from conscience or any uneasiness from the destruction of bad principles  and as it is charitable in a physician to prescribe to a neighbor that has the seeds of a dangerous disease latent in his body which would if not timely prevented have been fatal to him so by checking bad principles by doctrines which are entirely calculated for the health of the soul we perform a charity truly christian and as the charity in a physician is still greater when he extend his care to a fellow creature when the disease threatens the dissolution of soul and body so likewise is our charity proportionably greater when we restore a man to a state of grace from a total depravation of mind and a consequent commission of wickedness with greediness it is justly reckoned a charitable action to deliver a man whose life and goods were in danger from robbers or from the grinding oppression of men of superior fortune as the charity is great in this case so likewise it is greater to be freed from that most cruel and tyrannical of all enemies sin it robs us of our present peace and makes us forfeit our future expectation in the mansions of the just for it is impossible that we should if we practice every thing but what is commanded in the gospel be ever at peace with ourselves and if we are not at peace in our own breasts how is it possible for us to be at peace with our creator this consciousness of guilt amidst the greatest affluence makes the heart sad wine cannot entirely overcome it nor company divert it and to hear others praised for excellencies which we are conscious we have not is a great mortification it is a tacit admonition that we should fill up the blanks we have made in life with a steady active virtue and eradicate those great destroyers of ours and our neighbors peace the seeds of vice  and if any one who sees our pain arising from the practice of guilt should charitably interpose and should mediate peace between us and heaven such kindness would demonstrate both his humanity and also his christianity but charitable advice is too often rejected with disdain either because the adviser is generally looked upon as superior at least in wisdom to the person advised or because the manner in which the advice is conveyed to us is disagreeable in the former of these cases when men think it a discredit to their understandings to be instructed as too many are overwise in their own conceits there seems to be no better method used in order to bring such to their right minds than by seeming to allow them sense and then in all probability they would admit truths to descend into their hearts which if delivered in an authoritative manner might have displeased to dictate therefore to others magisterially is the way to raise their aversion and consequently will make them rather dispute the truth of what we say than humbly acknowledge the justness of our sentiments but to use the spirit of meekness and to show at the same time that we are interested in the behavior of offenders and that we cannot see them act counter to their present and future interest without the greatest concern is such a melting such an irresistible charm that it dissolves the obstinate hardened offenders into a tender concern at least for a time for their miserable circumstances some indeed are not to be wrought upon but by severity a candid compassionate rebuke only paves the way for a ridiculous jest or makes them show what is a scandal to a rational being an heedless unconcernedness for this reason we ought to deal with them as with natural bodies those of a soft composition and less firm texture we generally dissolve by a smooth yet subtle penetrating fluid but those whose solidity resists the application of fluids we generally resolve by that most subtle of all elements fire we thus ought to behave toward men those that offend out of frailty ignorance or not maliciously should meet with gentle humane treatment from us and we should study like every good physician the proper temperament of each patient otherwise we cannot prescribe a remedy any way salutary to them  but the spirit of meekness generally speaking is the properest means for recovering of offenders from a state of sin and we are under an obligation to use it because  iii and lastly all of us may some time or other stand in need of the like charitable behavior as we are all frail by nature and have the seeds of corruption born with us it is no wonder that those seeds considering that the best of us are not always upon our guard spring into action and if we observe farther that objects are to these seeds implanted in the mind what heat is to grain sown in the earth where in each case the seeds are invigorated with life and produce fruit in proportion to the strength or weakness of their respective causes we may from thence conclude that considering the evil tendency or the real or supposed charms of surrounding objects we may all easily fall from our integrity the command given to those who stand that is who still combat sin and are active in the cause of virtue that they take heed lest they fall supposes not only a possibility but a probability that the best men may yield to the swelling tide of some predominant affection and commit the sin which most easily besets them as men are thus liable to give way to the deceitfulness of sin such proneness to it should teach us candor toward others and should incite us to set a guard over our own hearts to rebuke offenders with a dogmatical haughty tone of voice abusive language or what is least becoming fallible man swearing supposes that such censurers partake not of humanity or that they are placed in such a secure situation that they can never deviate from the paths of wisdom as a perfect unsinning obedience cannot be expected from any so no man for that reason ought to act inhumanly toward those who actually fall away in the day of temptation and suppose men were entirely perfect that rebuke others yet their perfection would not justify proud wrath toward others the persons thus treated might imagine that they are treated roughly not so much because they have been guilty of breaches in their conduct but because those who severely reflect upon them satisfy thereby a peevish moroseness of temper or would show what is distasteful and odious to every one superiority  our blessed savior in this cafe is a noble pattern for our imitation though he himself was entirely exempted from imperfections necessarily attending other men yet he who judged not according to mans judgment nor acted after the same partial selfish manner behaved with the utmost candor tenderness benevolence offenders of all kinds he received into favor with the greatest meekness and it is no wonder that those that labored and were heavy laden and whose spirits were wounded by the consciousness of sin applied to the son of righteousness since he descended from the father of lights with healing in his wings  as he knew what was in man he knew how to induce him to enter into his service and make him fight manfully under his banners he in order the more effectually to advance the present as well as future peace of offenders gave them the most engaging invitations if they would only believe in him and live agreeable to that belief he told them that not only remission of sins but an inheritance in heaven would be the happy consequence of such a faith and such a practice and this he told them with the greatest gentleness compassion affection but notwithstanding that in general he was meek yet when he had to deal with men that were grown obstinate in wickedness such as the haughty scribe or hypocritical pharisee who would neither embrace his doctrine nor let others be admitted into a state of salvation he then could show a becoming warmth and resentment and denounce what will always be the consequence of impenitence and unbelief woe  shall godman then behave with the utmost candor toward offending human nature and shall we who partake of the same fallible nature forget that nature and judge every man uncharitably not considering that by such judgment we endanger our own salvation and besides judging uncharitably shall we who stand in need of the humane compassionate sentiments of others not only judge but condemn others unmercifully this however we may lay down as a maxim that those among us who are thus liberal of their censures and reprove their offending brethren with bitterness are generally persons that hate instruction and despise reproof and who under a show of zeal for gods honor take the liberty to abuse all because they are well assured that they deserve the just censure of all  such haughty scorners such contemners of their brethren though we cannot expect any amendment of life in consequence of our reproving them if for no other reason yet for this we ought to smite that is rebuke them friendly that the simple may not by a false shame follow their steps and catch the infection by imitation  all offenders then of what complexion soever they be ought toreceive rebuke exhortation consolation these however ought to be done in the spirit of meekness lest instead of reforming those objects of our charity we irritate them not only to contemn our good advice but likewise make them run out of mere obstinacy greater lengths in wickedness  and this those may be tempted to do whom we unjustly call depraved and entirely corrupted because they have been so unhappy as to offend in one remarkable instance though their former life has been unexceptionable not considering that no man can be termed with justice bad from one breach of duty but from the general tenor of his behavior david was guilty both of adultery and murder yet god who knew the whole of his life pronounced him a man after his own heart to judge thus heartily we are all obliged because the judge of all men has given us the pattern and then we will be best disposed to judge others with proper allowances made to frail humanity and consequently will give our advice with greater mildness when we judge ourselves and after judgment condemn what we find amiss in ourselves with impartiality  and if our good advice when tempered with candor mildness and humanity meets with disdain which is too often the case yet god who regards the good intentions as well as the good works of his creatures will if we still persevere in this benevolent disposition admit us in consequence of such behavior and the merits of our dear redeemer into the mansions of immortal youth  which that all of us may be admitted into may god the proper judge and rewarder of every charity of his infinite mercy grant etc  rough unpolished manners destructive to the peace of society a sermon a sermon prove xv   soft words turn away wrath but grievous words stir up anger these words convey to us an important lesson for the conducting of that most unruly of all members the tongue we are taught here what particular sort of words to use in order to mollify men that are in wrath they are called soft words from the effect which they produce in the hearts of those who are vehemently heated with passion for the word wrath implies a degree of rage and madness inciting to revenge but this rage this madness this desire of revenge may be easily conquered at the expense of a few soft words but what sort of words may be properly termed soft words may not be so properly determined we may however from our observation upon the different effects which different expressions produce in the minds of men probably arrive at their meaning we find then by experience that if we have excited the passion of anger or the excess of it wrath in any person by a real or supposed injury the best way to conquer such danger or such wrath is by using such words as denote our sorrow and design of making reparation for the injury given this method of proceeding generally melts the most savage minds into tenderness and humane sentiments and disarms them of that furious spirit upon anger and wrath  and as soft submissive expressions turn away wrath so on the contrary grievous words stir up anger by grievous words are meant all bitter reflections whether just or unjust all abuse detraction and whatever words have a natural tendency to excite the passion of anger in those persons we either converse with or whom we make the subjects of our discourse the term grievous may signify too all hints or inuendoes suggested to a neighbors prejudice all illnatured and illtimed jests and every unkind and unprovoked harshness of expression but lest this inoffensive menner of behavior should seem to many only prudential rather than matter of strict duty i shall endeavor to show i the reasonableness and ii the necessity of using soft words   but before i proceed to show the reasonableness of them i shall previously observe what the terms soft words do not mean first then they do not mean that we should use smooth flattering speeches in order to deceive the unwary or with a view to promote our particular interest to the detriment of our neighbors either with regard to their moral and religious character or with relation to what many value more than the two former their fortunes neither secondly ought any one to imagine that it is lawful to avert the passion of anger at the expense of truth truth generally as truth does not often offend especially those of an ingenuous turn of mind it is commonly the manner of speaking of the truth which gives the offense if then we must speak the truth to an angry person we should deliver it without harshness especially if it be an ungrateful truth and with all the signs of sincerity compassion and affection this manner of behavior has without doubt a great influence over those who if harshly treated in their wrath would have contemned the advice notwithstanding the goodness of it upon the account of the imprudence of the adviser there is a particular art which every one is not master of in preparing the mind of an angry person for the reception of truth for we must not deal with angry persons as with men in their senses we should rather deal with them as with those unhappy persons confined in bedlam who are not told of the causes of their disorder for fear of increasing it but are led gently to other subjects which softens their savage fierceness for a while makes them methodize their ideas and to forget for a time that they are mad thus as poets dream souls in a state of misery in the infernal regions were charmed with orpheuss music in such a manner as to forget for a while what they could vehemently wish to forget for ever inexpressible torment  if therefore we thus artfully and gently deal with angry persons we shall soon soften their dispositions and melt their savage fierceness into humanity and when their minds are thus softened they become capable of any good impression that we are pleased to stamp upon them truth then though dressed in somewhat disagreeable colors may have a free passage into their minds and occasion what is effected in every ingenuous mind a reformation from error  nor ought we thirdly to turn away the wrath of an angry person by such expressions as either give them hopes or discover to him the means of avenginghimself of those that have occasioned his wrath this only cures one ill by the commission of a greater for when wrath is settled into hatred malice and a desire of revenge such rancour is not to be cured by any expressions whatever and he who has soothed this passion of anger by exciting that hellish disease of the mind malice deserves so well of mankind as to merit the utter exclusion from all the happy advantages accruing from society  having thus premised what the terms soft words do not mean i shall proceed as i proposed in the first place to show their reasonableness  and this i shall do by considering that it is the best means of promoting our temporal concerns and of procuring what cannot be obtained by a contrary practice health of body and peace of mind  and first the use of soft words will make us more successful in our temporal affairs  it must be allowed that what gains us respect and esteem will consequently procure us credit and therefore must naturally make our affairs prosperous smooth soft words when used out of no selfinterested view but out of a principle of duty have properly benevolence for their cause and when men do talk from such a principle it may then best appear when they cannot possibly gain any advantage to themselves besides the satisfaction of having done their duty when men thus behave with gentleness meekness moderation and justice the world in general is prejudiced in their favor and because they hear with meekness what is proposed to them and are impartial in their determinations in doubtful cases submitted to their decision they are commonly pitched upon for arbitrators a character this which always supposes superior abilities wisdom integrity meekness for without meekness a man might provoke or be provoked by harsh unguarded expressions to make the breach which ought to have been healed up much wider but when each side of the question is heard with patience and the parties concerned see that a strict scrutiny is made into the merits of the cause without any favor or affection they submit to the determinations of such honest men without anger murmuring or repining but before men can attain this happy composed temper of mind several difficulties are to be conquered selfishness the cause of almost every meanness in the human soul is generally the reason why there is little benevolence in the world it gives the mind a narrow contracted way of thinking it makes a man think much of himself but little of others this makes such men careless in their behavior toward other though at the same time they are fretful and passionate if a particular deference is not paid to themselves how then must we act toward men of this wrong turn must we humor their pride and sooth their vanity may we tickle their imaginations with the softest expressions that fancy can invent must we not rather speak the truth with soberness gentleness meekness and will not such behavior demonstrate our own integrity and greater affection for them soft words or gentle expressions we may use without degenerating into flattery and though other through a proud selfish temper do not please to speak well of us and treat us with such common complaisance and civility as is due to mankind yet let not us behave with the same meanness we must remember not only that we are men but men too that profess christianity and then we cannot fail of wishing even our enemies well and of doing them when in our power what will demonstrate the sincerity of our wishes all manner of good this softness of behavior under ill treatment must always gain us respect amongst those of ingenuous minds and consequently must in proportion to our esteem advance our honest schemes in the world  but the advantage of this softness of action will be better illustrated by considering the disadvantage that the contrary character labors under  imagine then a man of rough unpolished manners haughty fierce passionate dogmatical and incapable of bearing any contradiction and you will soon without any hesitation conclude that such a character is neither amiable nor productive of its own nor the peace and wellbeing of any society it is not an austere look an haughty tone of voice boisterous or passionate expressions that command respect and give success to our affairs these qualifications may excite fear and what is worse hatred may provoke the best and most faithful friends to desert us and betray our secrets and consequently may disconcert our best contrived and deeplaid schemes this is not founded on fancy but on a surer foundation experience men are not naturally of such flexible tempers as to bend to our injunctions when either imperiously or harshly commanded and as with regard to natural powers the effects will be always like their causes so in morals generally speaking causes and effects are similar an angry person will produce the same passion in another and one injury begets another so that we may from hence conclude that the humane not the rough treatment gains us friends and consequently gives success to our affairs  and as a humane candid disposition exhibited in words and actions makes us more successful in the world so does it promote the health of body and soul  it must be granted that whatever keeps the blood and animal spirits in a continued equal motion must have a great tendency toward the preservation of the body that meekness produces this effect every one who has experienced its contrary can best tell violent motions of the blood and spirits shake the animal economy distend the vessels excite pain bring on diseases and what is worse often occasion sudden death whereas meekness and humane dispositions keep those springs of life in a regular flow which consequently add vigor to the body and what one would think might recommend it to the acceptance of all it naturally produces health and long life so true is the observation of our savior that blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth they shall enjoy the earth because their bodies receive no rude shocks from the storms of passion and because all is harmony peace and love within  and as meekness or softness of behavior is the bodys health so does it promote the peace and serenity of mind meekness is always productive of good actions from hence arises a secret and agreeable satisfaction in the mind for it always supposes patience and what should always be a prevailing principle in every individual benevolence it supposes too a readiness to hear a willingness to speak and a proneness to lend a helping hand to all ones fellow creatures when any are possessed of this amiable quality which indeed is a complication of good qualities because it cannot exist without other virtues they must be easy cheerful and because pleased with themselves they must be consequently pleased with others what agreeable sensations this behavior must necessarily excite in the mind the passionate may tell with sighs and lament the want of it with sorrow they know what anguish attends a life dedicated to the wild impetuous sallies of ungoverned passions pain they must receive on account of indecenies committed in these heats and additional pain too from the observation and judgment of the sensible and serious part of mankind but the conscious pleasure the heartfelt joy arising from the benevolent affections from meekness forbearance longsuffering and brotherlykindness are pleasures far unlike those of the body which always please and never satiate give real satisfaction because lawful and proceeding from a sense of duty and are lasting because rational these advantages resulting from an uniform softness of behavior may be sufficient in some measure to prove the reasonableness of using soft words the necessity of using them is what i proposed in the next place to consider  under the foregoing head i have spoke particularly concerning the advantages of meekness because whoever is of a meek mild disposition must consequently be remarkable for an agreeable softness of speaking and acting the necessity of which i shall show first from the injustice of retaliation and in the next place from the consideration of a future state  and first with respect to the unlawfulness of retaliation when an angry person attacks us with unjust reproaches and lays things to our charge that we know not nay let his charges be just or unjust the question is whether we ought to answer him with the same sharpness or to endeavor by soft words and the mildest address to humanize this savage into man this question may easily be solved both from reason and revelation men while they continue in a passion throw out their arrows even bitter words but whilst they remain in this state they are justly termed madmen because they are deprived of reason and consequently are not worthy our attention or displeasure but as in the human body the acrimony of the blood and juices are corrected by soft lenient medicines so that passion of anger that shortlived madness is soonest composed either by silence or by answers delivered with gentleness and if we are unjustly accused of any thing base in the heat of passion and crimes are laid to our charge that we know not since our consciences accuse us not why should we be disturbed why should we regard a madman retaliation in such a case would be an argument of guilt rather than of innocence it would be a plain proof that we pay a greater deference to the corrupt practice of human nature than to the pure dictates of unprejudiced reason or to the more refined and beneficial injunctions of an infallible god  besides as virtue consists in the due regulating of our conduct according to reason and revelation so to suffer ourselves to be hurried away by the violent stream of passion at the hearing of anothers angry unjust expressions is not virtue but the extreme of it true heroism consists in bearing and forbearing in bearing injuries and in forbearing from revenge and after this plan the christian hero is to be formed it is true human nature strongly presses forward for revenge but it is brave it is godlike to correct the errors of that nature and to demonstrate by our peaceable behavior that god is within us of a truth  and from revelation it still more evidently appears that we ought not to return injury for injury but on the contrary we are commanded to return good for ill and blessing for cursing for if our brethren for all men in an extensive sense are our brethren should offend seven times or seventy times seven in a day it is our duty to forgive them to forgive them did i say nay more we must pray for them and forward by all means possible their salvation but is this the practice of the world are men slow to wrath and ready to make allowances for anothers failings are they compassionate tenderhearted forgiving if this be not the case why do we profess christianity why do we enlist ourselves as soldiers under christs banners if we will not execute his just commands to act thus resembles judas who professed himself christs disciple that he might the more effectually betray the lord of life or it is like the man who after he was told what he should do to be saved went away sorrowful because he could not enjoy his present grandeur and an eternal crown of glory in reversion  but those men are of worse dispositions who are angry upon every slight occasion who are furious for a trifle and would kill their best friends for the least indiscretion but this temper is inconsistent both with the happiness of society and likewise with the possession of that happy place where all is harmony peace and love which leads me to consider what i proposed lastly that a mild forgiving disposition is the necessary preparative for a future state  heaven is described to be a place where nothing but love and its kindredvirtues can enter where pride envy hatred malice anger wrath debate and contention are eternally excluded god is said to be love not only because his love is extended to all his works but because he admits no soul living to enjoy him but such as has perfected itself by love in this state of probation twas love that created it is love that preserves and twas love that redeemed a miserable world and if we consider what keeps the heavenly bodies in perpetual harmony we shall find it to be attraction which is only another name for love what is it that unites each class of beings but love and even in inanimate bodies what is it that occasions such cohesion of parts such union regularity symmetry but attraction sympathy love and shall love or something similar to love obtain in the irrational inanimate creation and shall anarchy disorder confusion and every evil work prevail amongst the last and best of gods works and the very heads of the creation men a sad reflection upon reason this a reflection did i say nay more it is the disgrace the death of reason because such behavior sets human nature below those beings which though naturally less perfect follow the laws prescribed them by the author of their existence god almighty  and since love is the uniting principle of all things and the very cement and chain by which all things are linked together both in heaven and earth why should we break the chain and endanger both our present and future peace are we not made for happiness and is not love made the prime qualification of that happiness  let us then lay the foundation of meekness patience and forbearance and the agreeable superstructure love must follow for unless we are of a mild forgiving disposition we can have no love no benevolence for our fellow creatures and the love of our fellow creatures is made the measure and standard of our love to god for if we love not our brother that is our fellowmen that we have seen how shall we love god that we have not seen  and as love is the principle that characterizes heaven is it not our duty to practice that virtue which will fit us for that peaceable habitation certainly except we bear the faint resemblance of the divinity except we keep the lamp of life always burning in our hearts and except we keep it always shining for the benefit of our fellowwarriors we shall neither be happy here or hereafter but if this be in us and abound we shall not fail of turning away wrath by soft words and a mild gentle behavior and this must naturally gain us the kind wishes of the benevolent which will serve us as a pleasant gale to waft our peaceable souls to that happy state where the waves of life cease to roar where the afflicted cease from troubling and the weary be at rest  which happy state that all of us may enjoy by a meek and patient behavior a life of righteousness and the merits of our dear redeemer may god of his infinite mercy grant etc  the duty of giving alms cheerfully to the poor recommended a sermon preached at st nigholas new castle upon tyne a sermon romans xii   latter part he that sheweeh mercy with cheerfulness the apostle in these words gives us an account of the manner how this duty of showing mercy to the poor s to be performed and practiced and that is with alacrity and cheerfulness  he that shows mercy let him do it with cheerfulness  it is not enough to perform a duty commanded by god but we must likewise be careful of the manner of its performance that it be done duly and in such a way as is suitable to it  there is a decency that is to be observed even in liberality to the poor which seems to consist in its being performed with such cheerfulness as may express the godlike pleasure that is to be met with in obliging our fellow creatures that may show goodnature and benevolence overflowed and do not as in some men run upon the tilt and taste of the sediments of a grudging uncommunicative disposition  for some people by their way of consenting to a benefaction shall make it lose its name whilst others double the kindness and the obligation from some the desired request drops indeed at last but from so doubtful a brow that the obliged has almost as much reason to resent the manner of bestowing it as to be thankful for the favor itself others invite with so pleasing an air that they seem to meet the petition half way and consent to a request with a countenance which proclaims the satisfaction of their minds in assisting the distressed  in the practice of every virtue there is some additional grace required to give a claim in excelling in this or that particular action a diamond may want polishing though the value be still intrinsically the same and the same good may be done with different degrees of luster no man should be contented with himself that he barely does well but he should perform every thing in the best and most becoming manner that he is able  when we come into gods courts to hear his word and be instructed in our duty it is not enough for us to give unto the minister the hearing of the ear but we must be careful to hear in a due manner with reverence with attention and without prejudice  when we spread forth our hands toward heaven and open our mouths in prayer unto god it is not enough that we offer the motion of our lips but we must likewise be careful that our hearts go along with our mouths  when we fast and afflict ourselves before god it is not enough to hang down our heads like a bulrush and to spread sackcloth upon our loins to rend our garments and smite upon the thigh but all this must be attended with hearty penitence with a real remorse and compunction of mind  and so likewise when we practice the duty of almsgiving when we show mercy to the poor it is not enough for us to extend our hands to the indigent to give of our bread to the hungry or to proffer drink to the thirsty or to cloth the naked with our garments but all this must be done with a willing mind and with a cheerful heart for othewise our showing of mercy is not performed in a due manner and for want of this the duty will prove an insignificant thing and therefore it is no wonder if the apostle although he does suppose and take it for granted that a christian is not wanting in the practice of almsgiving in showing mercy to the poor enjoins us that we be particularly careful that this be done with cheerfulness for no greater misery can befall the poor than to be forced to depend on the help of such persons whose tender mercies are cruelties that can never be a love of our brethren that can never be cheerful benevolence which does not sympathize with the miserable that can never be true cheerful benevolence which begins with trampling on that selflove which is inseparable from the human breast and never relieves the indigent soul till it has wounded it in its tenderest part that can never be cheerful benevolence which throws into despair those that are the objects of it some pretenders there are to this virtue who never bestow an alms or relieve the poor but they unmercifully insist on a particular enumeration of all their miseries they bring face to face the whole groupe of their misfortunes of themselves for ought these impertinents can tell insupportable and though the ceremonial of their questions or rather of their burdensome examination preceeds the assistance they are pleased to afford the poor yet they are pleased to call that benevolence they are pleased to call that brotherly love but in my mind it is an act brutal barbarous and inhuman and insult upon selflove and not the result of any generous any christian sentiment it is a benevolence in short that does violence to the advice of the apostle who would have us to show mercy to the poor with cheerfulness  the business of this discourse on these words of the apostle shall be to show the several ties and obligations we are under of showing mercy unto the poor with cheerfulness  and that i shall do from the following considerations    we ought to show mercy unto the poor with cheerfulness because of the relation they stand in as to god for as poor and mean soever as they are yet it is certain they are not such despicable persons as the disguise of their misfortune under which they appear does represent them the very meanest of them has an immortal soul by which he does nearly resemble god himself and is comparable to the angels and all of them derive their pedigree from heaven and can call the king eternal the sovereign lord of all the world their father such they are as men but much more considerable are they as christians for as vile and contemptible soever as they look as meanly as they are clothed yet god himself has such a regard to them that for their sakes he descended from heaven and took their nature upon him in the person of his son and was pleased to lay down his life for them as contemptible soever as they look and as meanly as they are clothed yet by virtue of their christianity they are all of them members of christ children of god and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven in a word as contemptible soever as they look and as meanly as they are clothed yet all of them are the objects of gods especial providence and care of his fatherly love and affection and that equally with the greatest princes and potentates since elihu tells us job xxxiv    he accepts not the persons of princes nor regards the rich more than the poor they are all the work of his hands  but   dly we ought to show mercy unto the poor with cheerfulness because of the relation they stand in as to us they are our kinsmen nay our very brethren both by nature and grace by nature all nations of men being made of acts xvii    one blood as the apostle expresses it and by grace all christians being children of the same heavenly father all christians being regenerated into the same lively hope and being coheirs of the same eternal inheritance so that if we do not consider the necessities of the poor and relieve them with cheerfulness according to our ability we hide ourselves from our isa lviii   own flesh as the prophet expresses it we are unkind to our very kinsmen and brethren nay if we are wanting in this duty we disclaim all our title to christianity all relation to christ our elder brother the love of our fellow creature and the showing mercy to them with cheerfulness being the only infallible evidence and demonstration of our love to him by this shall all men know says he that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another he does not instance in faith or in hope in knowledge or in any other christian virtue but he pitches upon brotherly love and makes that the mark and character of his disciples by which they may be distinguished and known from all the world beside  nay the love of our brethren and the showing mercy to them with cheerfulness is made the test of the sincerity and reality of our love to god the father   john iv  0    this is my commandment says our savior that he that loves god love his brother also he that loves not his brother whom he has seen how can he love god whom he has not seen  that is if to men john xiii    with whom we daily converse we do not express any love what reason is there to imagine that we sincerely love god when of our love to him and the sincerity of it we were never able to make this trial because we never saw him nor had opportunity offered us of showing any real acts of love and kindness to him but somewhat may be judged i think from the difficulty of the thing for certainly he that does not the easier will hardly be supposed to do what is more difficult now you may easily imagine that it is hard to love one i never saw but no such difficult matter to have a kindness for the person i have seen since sight and conversation is one motive of affection and therefore inasmuch as we never saw god at any time but do see our brethren daily it very well may be concluded that he who loves not his brother whom he has seen does not neither can be supposed to love god whom he has not seen though he should make never such zealous protestations of his love to him but if we love our poor brethren whom we have seen and show mercy unto them with cheerfulness fullness it is a certain sign that we have a sincere love for god who has appointed them to be his deputies and proxies and he has promised to look upon that which is given to them as given to himself prove xix    he that has pity on the poor lends to the lord says the wise man and says our savior speaking of those who had fed the hungry and clothed the naked matthew xxv  0 inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me heb vi  0 and god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have showed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister says the apostle when therefore at any time we see a real object of charity before our eyes we may very well imagine and it is no vain fancy to imagine as much that we see christ our savior standing before us and ready to receive an alms at our hands to whom we may be kind and courteous if we please we now having an opportunity offered us for showing our kindness toward him  such is the relation that the poor stand in as to us that by showing mercy to them with cheerfulness we are assured in scripture that we shall obtain mercy ourselves at the hand of god matthew v   blessed are the merciful says our savior for they shall obtain mercy upon this account it is that daniel advises nebuchadnezzar to dan iv    break off his sins by righteousness and his iniquities by showing mercy to the poor and st james tells us that ja ii    mercy rejoiceth against judgment  it boasts it triumphs over judgment that is it appeaseth gods wrath and prevents our condemnation and punishment  such is the relation that the poor stand in as to us that by showing mercy to them with cheerfulness we are promised all earthly blessings such as health and peace and prosperity and deliverance in time of trouble comfort and consolation upon a sickbed psalm xli   blessed is he that considers the poor and needy the lord will deliver him in time of trouble the lord will preserve and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing and make all his bed in his sickness and because there is one seemingly considerable objection that may be made against the practice of this duty viz the fear of impoverishing ourselves and prejudicing our estates for the removing of these fears god has solemnly promised not only security from want but also a thriving condition to charitable persons prove xxviii    he that gives to the poor shall not lack ib xi    the liberal soul shall be made fat  all these things considered it is monstrous i think how a man can live with so little reflection as to fancy he is not in a condition very unjust and disproportioned to the rest of mankind while he enjoys wealth and exerts no benevolence or bounty shows no mercy to the needy and afflicted who stand in so near a relation both to god and himself one would really imagine from the behavior of the rich to the poor that they stood in no manner of relation to each other that they were creatures quite of a different species especially when one looks about him and sees a creature all in rags crying out in the name of all that is good and sacred to behold his misery and give him some supply against hunger and nakedness and the rich and their very servants passing by them with an air of scorn and triumph but so it is that poverty and riches stand nowadays in peoples imaginations in the places of guilt and innocence and when they would speak to the advantage of others they say they are people of condition but in all seasons there will be some instances of persons who have souls too large to be taken with popular prejudices and while the rest of mankind are contending for superiority in power and wealth have their thoughts bent upon the necessities of those below them the charityschools which have been erected in this town are the greatest instances of public spirit the age has produced in this part of the world and for the particular occasion of them there cannot any offer more worthy a generous mind would you do an handsome thing without return do it for an infant that is not sensible of the obligation would you do it for public good do it for one who will be an honest artificer would you do it for the sake of heaven give it to one who shall be instructed in the worship of him for whose sake you gave it it is methinks a most laudable institution this if it were of no other expectation than that of producing a race of good and useful servants who will have more than a liberal a religious education what would not a man do in common prudence to lay out in purchase of one about him who would add to all his orders he gave the weight of the commandments to enforce an obedience to them for one who would consider his master as his father his friend and benefactor upon the easy terms and in expectation of no other return but moderate wages and gentle usage it is the common vice of children to run too much among the servants from such as are educated in these places they would see nothing but lowliness in the servant which would not be disingenuous in the child all the ill offices and defamatory whispers which take their birth from domestics would be prevented if this charity could be made universal and a good man might have a knowledge of the whole life of the persons he designs to take into his house for his own service or that of his family or children long before they were admitted this would create endearing dependencies and the obligation would have a paternal air in the master who would be relieved from much care and anxiety from the gratitude and diligence of an humble friend attending him as his servant in short those that have the happiness to be contributors to such religious institutions of innocents can never i am sure dispose of money more to their satisfaction and advantage as for my own part the good will i bear to mankind makes me heartily wish those pious works may be encouraged that the present promoters may reap the delight and posterity the benefit of them  but whilst we are cultivating this young hopeful offspring and showing mercy to them with cheerfulness let not the ancient and helpless creatures be shamefully neglected there are i know many impostors among them lameness and blindness are very often acted but still there are many proper objects that implore your charity there are many industrious poor housekeepers who submit to the hardest labor and coarsest fare rather than endure the shame of taking relief from the parish or asking it in the streets that we ought not to overlook they are the hungry the thirsty and the naked that we are commanded by our savior to relieve and we ought to be persuaded that if any man is come hither for shelter against persecution or oppression that he is the stranger that we ought to take in if any countryman of our own is fallen into the hands of infidels and lives in a state of miserable captivity this is the man in prison and we should contribute to his ransom it were endless to mention all the variety of wretchedness and the numberless poor that are proper objects and to whom we ought to show mercy with cheerfulness who without an eye of pity can see a disabled sailor the purveyor of many of the advantages of life destitute of necessaries who can behold an honest soldier that bravely withstood the enemy prostrate and in want amongst his friends let not such as these upbraid their countrymen with inhumanity and want of mercy let not our ears be deaf to their complaints nor our eyes overlook their persons  i should propose it as a rule to every one who is provided with any competency of fortune more than sufficient for the necessaries of life to lay aside a certain proportion of his income for the use of the poor this i would look upon as an offering to him who has a right to the whole for the use of those whom he has described in sacred writ as his own representatives upon earth at the same time we should manage our charity with such prudence and caution that we may not hurt our own friends and relations whilst we are doing good to those who are strangers to us  we should prescribe to ourselves many particular days of fasting and abstinence in order to increase our private bank of charity and set aside what would be the current expenses of those times for the use of the poor and needy we should divert the money which we sometimes design to spend in going to a concert or an assembly a coffeehouse or a tavern or the entertainments of the theater upon some object of charity or the first necessitous person that falls in our way by these means we may be charitable to the poor without impoverishing ourselves or our friends and enjoy our estate or income by making it the property of others  there are few men so cramped in their private affairs who may not be charitable after this manner without any disadvantage to themselves or prejudice to their families it is but sometimes sacrificing a diversion or convenience to the poor and turning the usual course of our expenses into a better channel this is i think not only the most prudent and convenient but the most meritorious piece of charity which we can put in practice by this method we in some measure share the necessities of the poor at the same time that we relieve them and make ourselves not only their patrons but their fellow sufferers  before i conclude i cannot forbear making an extract of several passages which i have always read with great delight in the book of job it is the account which that holy man gives of his behavior in the days of his prosperity  oh that i were as in months past as in the days when god preserved me when his candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through darkness when the almighty was yet with me when my children were about me when i washed my steps with butter and the rocks poured out rivers of oil  when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i searched out did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me what then shall i do when god rises up and when he visits what shall i answer him did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the womb if i have withheld the poor from their desire or caused the eyes of the widow to fail or have eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless has not eaten thereof if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep if i have lifted up mine hand against the fatherless when i saw my help in the gate then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone if i have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me or lift up myself when evil found him neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors to the traveller if my land cry against me or that the furrows thereof likewise complain if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockles instead of barley  in what heroic instances is charity here described and with what a noble heat of sentiments if the account which that good man gives of his demeanor in the days of his affluence were considered only as a human composition it is a finer picture of a charitable and merciful man than is to be met with in any other author and an exemplar worthy of our imitation as far as it is in our power it should excite us not to contemn the poor for their poverty and behave to them with that churlishness that is customary with narrow minds but to commiserate their condition relieve them in a proper manner with cheerfulness and not add to their calamity by that of insult and mortification which is more cutting and insupportable than poverty itself  if we suppose that there are spirits or angels who look into the ways of men as it is highly probable there are both from reason and revelation how different are the notions which they entertain of us from those which we are apt to form of one another were they to give us in their catalogue of such worthies as are now living how different would it be from that which any of our own species would draw up  we are dazzled with the splendor of titles the ostentation of learning the noise of victories they on the contrary see the philosopher in the cottage who possesses his soul in patience and thankfulness under the pressures of what little minds call poverty and meanness and distress they do not look for great men at the head of armies or among the pomps of a court but often find them out in shades and solitudes in the private walks and byepaths of life the evenings walk of a wise man is more illustrious in their sight than the march of a general at the head of several thousand men a contemplation of gods works a voluntary act of justice to our own detriment a generous concern for the good of mankind tears that are shed in silence for the miseries of others a private desire of resentment broken and subdued in short an unfeigned exercise of humility or any other virtue are such actions as are glorious in their sight and denominate men great and reputable the most famous among us are often looked upon with pity with contempt or with indignation while those who are the most obscure and contemptible among their own species are regarded with love with approbation and esteem  to conclude we should not be led away by the opinion of the world in our estimation of one another but consider the figure that every person will make both rich and poor at that time when wisdom shall be justified of her children and nothing pass for great or good which is not an ornament or perfection to human nature  which that we may all do may god of his infinite mercy grant etc  the danger of faction and bandying into parties with the proper methods of allaying them considered a sermon preached at st nicholas newcastle upon tyne september         a sermon gal v    but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another this is an excellent lesson of advice given by the apostle st paul to the christians of galatia who were engaged in great heats and eager disputes about some matters which might easily have been compromised and made up if they had come to them with that calm consideration and christian love which became the holy religion they professed and the things about which they contested  he suggests to them by the way that most of the matters they pushed on in their disputes with so much fury and contention were either no parts of religion at all viz some nice punctilios of the ceremonial law or else did not deserve such high regard in their affections as to come in competition with the love of their brethren which was either laid aside or much weakened by their fierce contentions about these lesser matters this he enforces by telling them all the law is fulfilled in one word which is this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself that is that the love of our neighbor as it is a short and easy so it is a principal lesson of christianity and ought not to be lessened but in differences of the highest importance which christian love and charity as it is agreeable to the will of god so it is like to have a more especial blessing and reward but as for factions and contentions and peevish disputes among christians without just occasion he tells them plainly that they must expect no good effects from them but that if they be not speedily stopped they are likely to end in their utter ruin and confusion but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another  no more need be said toward the explaining these words of the apostle which are plain to every understanding they affording us a very wise caution against faction and sedition from the consideration that they are the pest and destruction of every society and therefore what i shall at present speak upon this subject i shall reduce to these three heads and show i how faction and bandying into parties tend to the ruin of any church or nation ii by what proper methods factions may be allayed iii i shall make some application with respect to ourselves and the present state of affairs   i i am to show how faction and bandying into parties tend to the ruin of any church or nation  now faction and bandying into parties tend to the ruin of any church or nation   st because this very much weakens the strength and power of any such community a community without unity is a dead and lifeless thing it is this which gives it a soul and nerves and vigor and so many degrees as you take off from this union so much the nigher it comes to its dissolution and a perfect anarchy when the members of a society are tied together by a hearty affection and an unanimous concurrence in their designs they are like the numerous threads of a cable twisted into cordage of an immense strength whilst the same disunited and parcelld out into different interests are but like a single twine subject to the snap of the weakest hand but faction is yet more prejudicial to a community than a bare negation or want of union for every single factious person in a nation not only denies his own assistance to the community but takes off likewise an equal force of his adversary so that a nation which consists only of two millions of people is equal in strength to a nation of ten millions whereof eight millions are engaged in two contrary factions for on this supposition the two remaining millions are the only effectual persons to be depended upon for the security of the nation the other parties being set and at a stand and wholly taken up in their mutual opposition to each other this is demonstrably true whenever the two contending parties are steadily resolved upon each others destruction and will not be awakened into concord from the danger of a common enemy and as history has given us frequent instances of this infatuation and madness so no party in the heat of their contention can be assured either of their own prudence or of the grace of god that they shall not fall into this desperate folly and the case is exactly the same in a church or body of christians and among innumerable faults unity or mutual concord is the only virtue that i know which is peculiar to the church of rome in this they are wiser in their generation than the children of light by these prudent methods under the permission of god for the punishment of the sins of the world they have kept up their idolatrous polity for so many ages whilst we of the reformed church in the midst of so many animosities and divisions have had nothing to preserve us but the unaccountable providence of god and a better cause   dly because this very much perplexes their councils it is the highest advantage for a nation to have their affairs go on under the influence of wise and steady councils when men of the greatest ability are gathered together who with the utmost compass of a sagacious capacity can take in all the possibilities of fortuitous events which may affect the government they are entrusted with who can with impartial consideration scan over whatever is proposed in those great debates and separate the plausible and the specious from what is solid and of lasting convenience to the nation and who will set aside nothing that is wisely offered out of any invidious regard but will with readiness embrace every thing which has a fair prospect and tendency to the good of the cummunity from whatsoever quarter it comes as well from the mouth of a private adversary as a bosomfriend now a nation can enjoy the happiness of this blessed effect only when they are at perfect union with themselves and no faction is reigning among them for faction quite poisons all political debates represents whatever is most honestly and wisely advanced in the worse colors raises suspicions of the most entire proposals and puts men upon projects which in their conscience they believe to be less conducive to the public rather than let their hated adversaries of the opposite party reap the honor and success but of a prudent proposal this incites men out of envy and revenge to betray the counsels they are bound to conceal to calumniate the actions of good ministers of state and to gloss over the pernicious designs of bad ones to be scanty and precipitate in debates for the public good but to spare no time or application in advancing the interest of a party in defending the faults of their own friends and exposing those of their adversaries in excusing or extenuating great crimes or punishing smaller with unmerciful severities these have been the constant effects of faction in the councils of nations throughout all ages andnever any government had a downfall or decay but that these unhappy accidents were the first of its misfortunes and gave a rise to its following ruin   dly because this exposes them to their adversaries the power of a nation does not always consist in the actual strength of forces or the abilities of a ministry there is oftentimes a great deal owing to opinion and an enemy frequently withholds his hand not because a country is insuperable but because he thinks it so nay where sufficient strength is not wanting if you lay a nation open to contempt and make it vile in the opinion of its enemies you have gone half way into the conquest of it before a stroke is struck for an adversary comes on then amain and pushes forward with alacrity and courage when he has poor and mean thoughts of those who are to oppose him now can any nation be pictured out in such wretched colors and be rendered so despicable in the sight of their enemies as that people which is divided into great and spightful factions how do they load one another with all the opprobrious language which an envenomed rage can suggest upbraiding each other with falseness and treachery cruelty and villainy or any other crime which is best suited to blacken the character of their opposites a court is represented as full of flattery and dissimulation or intent only upon the advancing of private fortunes and crushing the public liberties a city traduced for mutiny and sedition and a country sometimes for want of zeal and affection for their governors and at other times for a superabundancy of it some calumniated for endeavoring to introduce an arbitrary power and others as designing a democratical license some traduced for hypocrisy and others for profaneness some noted for weakness and others for corruption some branded for bigots and others for atheism now whenever national distempers are wrought up to these heights what advantage cannot the common enemy propose to themselves when they have to do with a people which without the expense of intelligence will trumpet out their own failures themselves and proclaim to the world that they are already conquered by their own vices   thly because this renders them obnoxious to the anger of god there is no command of god in scripture more positive and plain and no invitation more pressing than those which engage us to peace and unity and dissuade from strife and contention it is the particular command of our blessed lord and the last and most pressing close of a very affectionate discourse of his  mark ix  0 have peace one with another and the apostle to the hebrews advises us to  heb xii    follow peace with all men men therefore that are engaged in a faction can never be good christians for that malice and bitterness which usually possesses the minds of those that are in a party is perfectly inconsistent with the charity which the christian religion indispensably requires  proceed we now to show  ii by what proper methods factions may be allayed  now i shall here lay down some few rules which according to the best of my judgment i conceive may be very expedient to this end submitting it always to the better judgment of others especially to those whom i have now the honor of speaking before   st to allow those who are of a different opinion or interest from us a pretty frequent and easy conversation there can be no party in a nation so wicked and detestable that we should hate them like dogs and snakes they do not forfeit the rights of common humanity and good neighborhood from entertainng some thoughts different from ours nay by a fair correspondence our differences do very much lessen for then we have no alienation of affections to keep us at a distance and nothing lies between us but the pure merits of our cause and in a calm and friendly debate of mutual misunderstandings i never yet knew two adversaries but that they were nigher in opinion to each other than they thought they were whilst they kept at a distance for their strangeness and shyness to one another kept up always their passions eager and as it were ready charged for execution they entertained a world of groundless jealousies and suspicions and were blown up into yet greater flames by the misrepresentations of designing men which have been all laid aside and quietly composed as they came to understand and freely converse with one another then their mutual civilities the gentleness of their language and the sweetness of their behavior has so endeared their affections that the mistaken person seldom fails of conviction and giving himself up to truth or however the difference is very much lessened and all hatred and malice being laid aside there is only the opinion of the party without the virulence retained  now our blessed savior prosecuted this method with the most happy success for he vouchsafed to undergo the stain of conversing with the worst of men with publicans and sinners and with the keenest of factions the pharisees and sadduces but by his endearing conversation and by his taking the prudent occasions of instilling wise and holy and peaceable principles in a short time he brought into one common religion the most opposite parties and made the greatest saints out of the most flagitious offenders   dly another method to allay a faction is by avoiding all calumnies and invidious reflections upon the opposite party the apostle st jude makes a very excellent observation with regard to this point drawn from the example of michael the archangel who had an adversary liable enough to exception viz the devil and yet he would not bring even against him a railing accusation and indeed calumnies and spiteful reflections do no good in any cause nay generally they do more mischief to the quarter from whence they come than to those against whom they are sent for such sort of expressions make no impression upon any wise man and can never convince or bring over any man these may make men hate their calumniators but they seem the worstlaid expedients for to persuade them but it is a jest for men to wish an end to factions and contests and to pray for unity and concord whilst they are loading their adversaries with hard names and such heavy imputations as serve only to keep up and as much as in them lies to eternize the quarrel for one illnatured reflection begets another by way of reprizal and that again gives birth to a third till the faction like the wind gathers strength by repercussion and what was at first in a manner harmless and imperceptible rises by degrees into the fury of a storm and rends and tears and breaks all to pieces before it scandalous reports and invidious names of distinction are the alarms to faction they are the drums and trumpets that give the call to sedition and draw off men from the common interest to the particular squadrons of their party but lay aside these and men fall in again into the public body they go forwards in pursuing once more the common good till at last they are united both in interest and affection   dly another method of allaying faction is by setting aside old animosities there will never an end be put to differences if the old ones be still brought to account and when men are at present disposed to quiet they must not be allowed quarter by reason of their former offenses besides in a long and lasting faction where enmities are handed down and as it were bequeathed to posterity it is very unreasonable that a new generation should be answerable for all the irregularities committed by their predecessors and that we should revenge that upon them which their forefathers have done this is a way to entail quarrels upon our own children and to leave them to be reprized upon in the next generation for unkindnesses we have done to other men in this to be for ever ruminating upon an old injury and when time begins to wear off both the sense and memory of the offense for us industriously to revive it and it spite of nature to keep up the keenness of it is methinks unnatural and contrary to the very frame of our temper even princes and states who have the nicest sense of honor and for the interest and security of their countries stand obliged more particularly to resent indignities offered even they make leagues and alliances without a liquidation of antiquated accounts for to scan over all these with exactness would engage the world in an eternal war and therefore i do not think but that it is a duty incumbent upon their subjects to make as many paces toward a peace and union among themselves at home as their superiors with relation to their neighbors abroad   thly another method toward allaying a faction in a nation is by setting aside all private interest now whatever men pretend of either side in a faction whether the prerogative of the prince or the privilege of the people the good of the church or the welfare of the state these are too often but specious pretenses and words without a meaning but the true reason of all their angry words and spiteful treatment of their adversaries is because they interfere with one anothers interest and profit places of great advantage are with greedy expectance hunted after by some whilst others are vexed with the loss of them or put themselves upon the worst methods for retaining them it is from hence that the loud clamours and accusations arise it is this occasions the suspicions of being disaffected to the crown or else of bearing in upon popular liberty it is this which draws in all friends and dependents of great men on both sides till whole nations are in a manner divided for the sake of a few ambitious men and do oftentimes ruin themselves to make others great this has been the constant method of faction through all ages it was the love of such interest that led on caesar and pompey and crassus to divide the power of the whole roman world between them twas this that raised such jealousies and discontents of corrupt and arbitrary ministers on one side and designing innovators on the other till that mighty empire was all blown up into a flame and for almost half an age lay weltering in its own blood and we may reasonably presume that this is the case of faction in our age and nation and will be so in future times there will never be a time in which some men will not be aspiring to power and others endeavoring to support or supplant them in it unless it shall happen as i believe it never will that there be left no designing and no unthinking people in the world twas a sad reflection that on the people of rome panem and circenses that they might be brought over to any mans interest by feasts and shows but later times have shown that men can raise parties without so much as the virtue of liberality and draw in people to quarrel for them at the expense only of pamphlets libels and seditious talk   thly the last method i shall propose for allaying faction is a hearty zeal for the public good and a sincere concern for holiness and true religion when men have only an aim at the public welfare they can never be engaged in a faction for a faction is an uncertain thing it either acts for or against the public good as the leaders of it are disposed nay there is seldom a faction of ten years continuance but within that space of time it acts inconsistently and in contradiction to itself therefore it is a good way to lessen a faction and to avoid the misfortunes and levity of it with a steady eye to pursue whatever a man thinks to the best of his judgment to be for the true interest of the nation and not to fall into it because he sees others of his party doing so before him or to be against it because others are for it whom he does not affect this if men would do sincerely though they should appear to be mistaken god will never call them to an account for it besides the numbers of the opposite parties would continually decrease men would pursue the concerns of the nation with as much application as they do their own and the honor and power of our country would grow as fast as private fortunes and so if a point be labored between the two contending parties let every man seriously lay his hand upon his heart and attentively consider and ask his own conscience impartially to speak what it judges to be most tending to the glory of god and the advancement of true religion if they would do this upon every difference between party and party and party i do verily believe in every dispute that four parts in five of the nation would be of one side  but to hasten to our third general head  iii to make some application from what has been said with respect to ourselves and the present state of affairs  i have hitherto in this discourse shown the great mischief which faction brings to a nation and the most proper methods of allaying it drawn chiefly from the observation i have made from ancient history without any strictures upon the unhappy differences of our own times and the arguments and reasoning i have made use of are very obvious to every ones understanding and what most men do of their own selves take notice of though few through the heat of opposition deduce them into practice and would to god these few hints i have here cursorily given may obtain such a blessing of god upon them as to awaken us into a better temper and to allay those unchristian heats which have so discomposed us we of this nation have unhappily stood divided pretty nigh upon the same footing longer than any people i have met withal in story even so high as queen elizabeths time the puritans began their clamours against the church who being cherished too much by some grandees in the court by their tumults and libels became at last formidable to the state unhappy jealousies and bickerings of this sort ran throughout one of the most peaceable reigns viz of king james the first and in the time of his good though unfortunate son nothing was seen but sedition and plunder and sacrilege and an ocean of civil blood and since that even in later reigns we have been perplexed with plots and rebellions and at present are under continual apprehensions of an approaching enemy an enemy that would endeavor to introduce popery and arbitrary power may we therefore all of us join in heart and mind to oppose the attempts of this our common adversary and let us in this reign revive the glory of the last when the wellaffected nobility and gentry city and country were all striving who should go greatest lengths for the honor of their prince and the interest of the nation and may god grant that as it was the happiness of that reign to cripple the then exorbitant power of the disaffected in the nation so may it be the distinguishing glory of his present majestys reign for the security of our religion our laws and our liberties by the happy success of our arms to prepare a way for the downfall of the pretender to these kingdoms  twas a noble stand which his late majesty made against popery and i think his present most gracious majesty has shown as great an aversion to that foul superstition our adversaries would bind upon us and how great an enemy he is to arbitrary power is at present sufficiently demonstrated by his carrying on his arms with so much vigor and courage against the common usurper of the rights of mankind under his happy government we all of us enjoy our liberties our laws and our religion and those upon as firm a security as can be desired and what can any reasonable man desire more as for offices of great profit and honor they can be enjoyed but by a few and if the want of these was a ground for contention there could be no end of quarrelling till we became a nation of magistrates and officers of state the best and wisest way is to leave the disposal of these to our superiors who to be sure understand them best and for the generality are more impartial than men are wont to be in the opinion of themselves upon the whole therefore let us avoid the being made tools to ambitious mens designs and to be set on to worry one another to manage other peoples game and in which there is not one in a thousand of us shall find any account let us live in a dutiful subjection to the present government and in an entire conformity to the established church  finis
