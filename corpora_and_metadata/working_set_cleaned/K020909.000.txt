i am in one sad moment deprived of friends and fame but what are these to the sharp pangs that rend my tortured heart for his unkindness who should heal my grief assert my innocence and clear my fame but he alas thinks meanly of me and in that thought the measure of my sorrow is accomplished  i am a wretch indeed   enter a servant ser madam the gentleman you sent to is below and desires to see you   emi show him in   exit servant how shall i tell my story how make my innocence appear   enter lord belmont l bell that i am glad to see you any where my dear emily this visit will evince but i confess i am surpised at meeting you in such a place as this when i who have the honor of being so nearly related to you am master of a house in london i think your billet said you were alone i now expect you will explain this mystery by other means than tears and blushes  pray speak and clear my doubts   emi innocence should be bold my lord but maiden innocence is full of fear pray pardon my hesitation i know not how or where i shall begin   l bell recollect your spirits and be assured you speak to one who to the utmost of his power will prove a brother to you  my sisters too i will answer for them when once acquainted with your person and merit will be your sisters also   emi your kindness has encouraged me your lordship knows my mother died while i was yet an infant and that my father married soon again  from that unhappy hour i became an alien to his heart and person under pretense of education i was sent to school where i received the honor of your lordships frequent and friendly visits and remained there till about two years since  would i had never left it   l bell pray proceed   emi the taunts the cruelties i met at home are not to be described till about six weeks since there was a match proposed to me with the most detestable of men which i prostrate at my fathers feet and bathing them with tears refused   l bell he could not sure attempt to force your hand   emi every argument was used to persuade every threat to terrify me into compliance but in vain during this time of persecution my fathers ill health obliged him to visit bath i was permitted to attend him upon promising to try to conquer my aversion to this hated marriage  i promised any thing to gain a respite   l bell as you describe your situation i cannot blame you  but was it aversion to the match proposed or prepossession for some other object that ruled your will i beg you will be sincere your blushes answer me  but go on   emi i do not mean my lord to hide a single thought sincerity is the fair garb of virtue and they who know no guilt need no disguise at bath i met a gentleman whom i had known at school his sister was my friend and favorite there and in my childish days he used to call himself my lover  even then i thought him as sure he is this moment the most amiable of his sex   l bell poor emily i begin to tremble for you   emi this gentleman renewed his former courtship if i may be allowed the term while my first impressions recurrd with added strength he asked me of my father who absolutely refused and forbad me ever to see him more  cruel inhuman sentence   l bell this was indeed severe   emi i received a billet from him requesting me to see him when the family were retired to rest my father had ordered every thing to be got ready for leaving bath next day   l bell and you of course consented to this last adieu   emi he came and while he uttered the tenderest vows of everlasting love we heard a noise in my closet to which he flew and on forcing it open to our mutual astonishment a gentleman rushed out my dear deceived unhappy lover called on him to draw and casting a look of rage mixed with contempt at me said life is no longer worth my care thy perfidy has made it hateful to me i threw myself between their swords and screamd so loud that it brought my father and all the family into the room at sight of him my terror and confusion redoubled i ran down stairs into the street without knowing whither i went or what to do the night coach was setting off for london at that moment i got into it without determining on any thing but that i would not return and hither it has brought me   enter a servant ser sir charles somerville has this moment alighted at the door and seeing your lordships chariot there begs leave to pay his respects to you  exit emi quick let me fly my lord  runs to the door l bell you will meet him that way into this closet i will not suffer him to keep you long a prisoner  she goes into the closet enter sir charles somerville l bell welcome to london my dear charles but to what happy chance are we indebted for your return i understood that you meant to pass a philosophical summer at your seat in the west in reading and retirement but it grew dull i suppose it would not do sir charles though you have not made a very long trial of it i think neither   sir cha i have not indeed my lord made the smallest attempt toward the rational scheme you hint at thoughts of a very different nature have for some time past wholly occupied my mind and left no room for any thing beside but friendship and lord belmont   l bell lord belmont is much yours but from this sententious speech and that grave countenance i think i may without being a conjuror pronounce that the gay and lively sir charles somerville is on the point of matrimony with some welljointurd widow or rich heiress and that he is at this very moment making an exact calculation of the fortune he shall allot to his seventh son by and of that marriage lawfully begotten   sir char your lordship was never more mistaken  so far from it that i have bid adieu to the whole sex and am determined to quit england in a few days with a firm purpose never to revisit it a loud sigh heard from the closet ha whence could that sigh proceed   l bell sir charles i beg a thousand pardons but i must entreat you to withdraw immediately and request the pleasure of meeting you at my house in half an hour   sir char i shall obey your commands but can scarce forgive your suffering my present intrusion  exit lord belmont opens the closet l bell emily she faints   emi be not alarmed my lord the closeness of the place overcame my spirits i shall recover soon but is sir charles resolved then does he leave england immediately what have i said i mean my lord is the gentleman quite gone is there no fear of his returning one is apt to rave after fainting you know my lord   l bell there is method in your madness emily but though i dare say you did not mean to trust me with the name of your lover be assured i am extremely pleased at discovering him in the person of my friend sir charles somerville   emi he is indeed my lord the object of my hopes and my despair but to what purpose do i own my passion he quits his native land to fly from me   l bell be patient emily  from his known character of truth and honor i am certain he will do you justice dare you abide that test   emi most willingly my lord   l bell the way to hope for candor from somerville the world and me is by a frank confession who was that gentleman he found concealed   emi by all my hopes of candor from the world of esteem from you and love from somerville i know him not nor why or wherefore he came thither   l bell i must believe you emily there is a charm in truth that strikes upon the mind like light upon our eyes  it is irresistible yet passion i will grant may cast a veil on either i therefore can excuse sir charles for judging wrong   emi oh blame him not my lord appearances were strong against me but while we talk he flies   l bell your fears are those of love but let them rest and be assured he shall not break the double toil that love and friendship spread to hold him fast but come my emily i am impatient till i place you in a fitter situation and present you to my sisters   emi by no means my lord think how improper it would be for me to appear in your house or any where in my own character till time shall have unravelled this cruel mystery scandal has as many wings as tongues and in a few hours i may expect to be the general subject of discourse and object of reproach besides you may suppose my father will pursue me and if under your roof i must be discovered   l bell your objections are just and yet you can be no where so safe as under my protection suppose then you were to be introduced to my aunt and sisters who have never seen you under a feigned name and character as the daughter of a clergyman a particular friend of mine they have often heard me speak of such a person who has been some years dead his name was lawson   emi i put myself under your lordships guidance and shall assume whatever form you please till heaven thinks fit to let me wear my own with honor   l bell i hope you will not continue long in masquerade but now my dear your hand  exeunt scene iii a dressing room in lord belmont s house lady mary at work and lady louisa with a book in her hand l mar my dear sister let me dissuade you from carrying on this affair with mr freeman any farther if he really loves you and his family and fortune may pretend to such a match why not consult my brother who has an undoubted right to be considered as a father from having acted on all occasions like one   l loui you have very vulgar notions sister i suppose if you should ever have a lover you will bid him ask your parents whether you shall like him or not  poor soul but is it aunt bridget or uncle frank he shall apply to ha ha do you know my dear that as well as i love my strephon if he were to say one syllable about me to my grave brother it is an hundred to one i should detest him secrecy is the very essence of love and like all other essences it will evaporate the moment it gets air   l mar i am sorry to differ so much in opinion with you louisa but i cannot help thinking that the most innocent correspondence which can possibly subsist between men and women becomes in some degree criminal when it is carried on clandestinely at least it must appear as if one party was ashamed of the other which you must allow to be a sentiment by no means consistent with heroic love   l loui read read my dear and improve yourself for you are really very ignorant did you ever hear of a heroine in tragedy or romance who consulted any third person in the disposal of her heart   l mar i cannot say i have read many of either but to such overweening confidence in ourselves i believe we are indebted for many tragical subjects   l loui a truce a truce dear girl and for this once assist me it is impossible i can refuse to see him this evening when he so ardently entreats it in your grave mathematical calculation he has been absent three weeks but that you know is three thousand years in a lovers calendar   l mar my dear louisa i will though against my judgment to the utmost of my power assist you but if my lord should pass the evening at home i cannot guess how it is possible without alarming him or what is much worse making confidants of the servants to effect your purpose   l loui give me your aid and leave the rest to me   enter lady bridget l brid your servant ladies  what at work you are a most indefatigable creature niece mary and sometimes remind me of those industrious maidens that worked beds and hangings as i have heard my grandmother say for those mechanical amusements were entirely out of fashion before my youth was capable of instruction   l mar your ladyship has given up your time to more abstruse and difficult employments the study of the learned languages but as every person may not have capacity or inclination to employ their minds in that way i look upon works of fancy as pleasing and innocent amusements   l brid they are perfectly simple indeed and of course may be innocent   enter lord belmont l bell good morrow ladies have you enlivened the park with your presence this morning louisa or staid at home on the rational plan of reading and working by turns with lady mary  i hope i see you in good health madam  to lady bridget   l brid tolerable not exuberant i thank your lordship   l loui we have been quite on the domestic plan my lord and of course extremely dull   l mar we have felt the loss of your lordships company who are generally so good to make yourself the master of our revels   l brid that is a bad phrase niece revels imply revelling which is a term indecent for so young a lady to make use of i declare i was turned of twenty before i could be prevailed on to pronounce the word jollity and then it was at the earnest entreaty of poor dear mr feeble that i would give it utterance it was a dying request for he expired of a galloping consumption in a few hours after i had granted his desire   l bell as i could wish to justify lady marys expression i will for this once take upon me the character her politeness has assigned me by making a present to ye all that will i hope both improve and enlarge the circle of your pleasures   l loui aside what can it be sister i die to know   l brid some improvement i suppose nephew in the encyclopoedia there are many sciences yet left imperfect   l bell no madam it is a living volume i mean to offer to your inspection and i think a fair one it is the daughter of my old friend mr lawson who is come to town upon business and i have entreated her to make this house her own   l mar we shall doubtless do every thing in our power to render it agreeable to her   l bell i will present her to you instantly  exit l brid her father was a very learned divine and who can tell but she may understand the rabbinical text o if she can but translate the lexicon i shall be quite happy   enter lord belmont presenting emily l bell i hope madam you will now consider yourself as in a brothers house and as another sister to these two ladies   emi if they will condescend to accept my friendship and esteem they shall be truly theirs   l mar we thankfully receive and shall endeavor to deserve them both by sending ours to meet them more than half way  fie sister why are you so cold pray speak  aside to louisa   l loui  to l mary she is vastly handsome  every person who has the pleasure or seeing you madam must necessarily feel such  prepossession in your favor as willingly to accept what you so kindly offer   l brid very courtly and correctly spoken on all sides my lord but ladies the hour appropriated to the adornment of our persons draws near and i shall request the favor of this young lady to accompany me to the temple of the graces or in other words the toilet aside i think that was elegantly expressed and must inspire her with a proper idea of my erudition   emi i shall esteem it an honor to attend your ladyship   lord belmont bows as taking leave l brid is your lordship also on the wing come then you shall conduct us   exeunt lord belmont lady bridget and emily l loui there are some very odd whims come into my head about this girl sister she is quite a beauty nay seems accomplished too a clergymans daughter that is the old story but in short maria i begin to think this wise brother of ours has his failings like other men and growing indolent as they all do chooses to bring his favorites near home did you observe with what an enquiring eye he looked at you he thought he might easily impose on poor aunt bridget and me but he is mistaken was this his fine present   l mar for shame louisa how can you think so badly of a man who has deserved so well left to his care even from our earliest years what tenderness what delicacy has he not shown both to our sex and age   l loui i grant the utmost but still there is a somewhat that strikes upon my mind and tells me there is mystery in this affair and i am determined to find it out if i can   l mar indeed sister there is something very ungenerous in suspicion if the tenor of our lives cannot exempt us from censure with respect to this world we act virtuously in vain   l loui o for heavens sake my dear let us have done with this wise discourse it actually gives me the vapors and i would tune my spirits to their highest key for freeman will be here tonight winds catch the sound   l mar positively sister if you abridge my morality i must insist on an abatement of your transports   l loui well then  formed by thy converse happily i will steer  from grave to gay from lively to severe is not that quite civil now   l mar vastly polite indeed   l loui but still this most important business remains unsettled  let me consider  have you a pocketalmanack   l mar not about me but prithee why do you ask   l loui no matter he shall come through the garden by moonlight   l mar what whether the moon shines or no   l mar i know it will cynthias the lovers friend and lends her silver lamp to light them on their way   l mar again in heroics louisa   l loui i have done  his letter says his servant will be here in an hour from my fair hand to receive his masters doom  is not that galant sister   l mar yes but i dare say he does not apprehend your ladyships sentence should ordain the dagger or the bowl   l loui no truly i shall be a merciful judge his doom will not be death   l mar you seem at present a very complete emblem of justice for in my humble opinion you are acting blindfold though you might see if you pleased   l loui never let that bandage from my eyes remove which hides the faults of him i fondly love  exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i a drawing room in lord belmont s house enter lord belmont and sir charles somerville sir char i have now my lord frankly related to you all the circumstances of this extraordinary novel except the ladys name which i hope for her sake will ever remain a secret what the denouement will be on her part i cannot guess but am determined it shall not conclude in the usual style with me for from this hour i disclaim all future thoughts of a serious connection with any of the sex   l bell is it possible sir charles that passion can so far triumph over reason as in one moment to destroy the good opinion of a character formed on a long acquaintance you say you knew the lady from her childhood   sir char my dear belmont you have stated this argument quite wrong it was not passion that triumphed over reason but reason that subdued passion i can now see nay feel what an abject wretch he must be who trusts his happiness in a womans power  damned smiling mischiefs all  i will henceforth see and admire the pretty baubles as i would a fine piece of china but no more attribute worth and honor to them than maleability to that for if my emily could deceive there is no truth in woman   l bell this is mere commonplace sir charles   sir char by calling it common my lord you allow it the general sense of mankind which is no doubt founded on experience i am therefore determined to profit by it so far as to retain my freedom at least i think i almost feel the shackles i might have worn but for the old gentlemans refusal  oh how i thank him   l bell perhaps you misplace your gratitude i am not yet sure that you are under any manner of obligation to him   sir char certainly the greatest though his refusal then was daggers to my heart  fool that i was i thought her what she seemed an angel and but for him ixion like i had embraced a cloud but why do i still talk or think of her she is not worth a thought and i hope to get quite clear of her idea before i reach harwich   l bell believe me you deceive yourself her form will haunt you fly wherever you will and for the same reason that murderers fancy ghosts  for i am persuaded you have injured her   sir char what shall i not believe my eyes by heaven the consciousness of her guilt even conquered female fear she threw herself upon a madmans sword such i then was but twas to save her lover and my rival ungrateful woman   l bell you seem inclined to lay hold of the dark side of every circumstance but there is one you seem not yet to have attended to or you could not think of leaving england immediately may not the gentleman you encountered in your mistresss chamber possibly suppose you fled from him   sir cha that thought had quite escaped me i left a servant behind whom i expect this night in order to discover who my rival was and also to find out what her father had done or meant to do with his unworthy yet too lovely daughter i fear he will use her cruelly my lord   l bell and can you think of that and talk of quitting england   sir char why faith my lord i have always looked upon chivalry as a very ridiculous science and yet i begin to think it has its foundation in nature for i never yet heard of a damsel in distress that i did not wish to relieve her   l bell sir charles this affair is much too serious to jest with you have asked my opinion and as a man of honor and your friend i now declare i think your traveling scheme should be entirely laid aside until this mystery is properly explained notwithstanding your affected gaiety i am certain you still love this lady   sir char there again your lordship is guilty of a small error only mistaking the past for the present tense say i did love her if you please   l bell well sir charles grant you no longer love you are certainly a man of honor and must therefore think it incumbent on you to clear a ladys character which may possibly have suffered as much on your account in the minds of others as she has done in yours from this unlucky accident   sir char would to heaven that i could clear her to my own heart from all suspicion with as much justice as i can to the world of what relates to me in her whole conduct and behavior toward me she was purity herself her soul seemed even lovelier than her form and cast a kind of glory round her beauty which while it awed transported raised and chastisd desire  yet she is false   l bell i cannot think so   sir char be that as it may your lordship has convinced me that i should not leave london for a few days within that term or never a clue will certainly be found to lead us through this maze i therefore will abide the event certain it cannot be worse than what i fear   l bell i must insist on your acquainting me with every step you take you know you may command me on the most difficult occasions   sir char i certainly rely on your lordships friendship   l bell the moment your servant arrives pray let me know i cannot tell you how much i am interested in this affair  i shall be at home all day   sir char i shall call upon your lordship in the evening   l bell till then adieu  exeunt severally scene ii a dressing room in lord belmont s house lady bridget at her

my word brother you seem to be verging toward the state of second childhood you act directly like a baby one moment purchasing toys and the next weary of them but as the great mr dryden observes men are but children of a larger growth i hope you are an admirer of mr dryden miss lawson   emi all persons of sense and taste madam i believe admire his writings and though i by no means pretend to either of those characters i join my humble suffrage   bell odso she talks very handsomely lady bridget i have a great notion she is very learned pray madam do you understand coins   emi not in the least sir   bell i am sorry for it because if you did i would have treated you with a sight of my best otho it has the true green mold on it and is so very antique that all traces of the figure are worn out so that it looks for all the world like a bit of plain copper   l brid and so to be sure it is pray brother dont expose yourself and interrupt our conversation   bell why there it is now you dont like to hear any one talk but yourself lady bridget but i will not hold my tongue for all that i will go this moment and fetch my otho and the lady shall be judge whether it is not a fine one and if she says it is i will make her a present of it to vex you   emi i must beg to be excused sir i can by no means think of depriving you of a treasure that would be totally useless to me   bell aside i am afraid she is but filly  useless madam an otho useless i must beg pardon   emi i only said it would be so to me sir who am not a virtuoso and want taste to know its value   l brid this absurd conversation is an outrage on my patience which i can no longer submit to pray brother give me leave  i should be glad to know miss lawson if your father bequeathed you any ancient manuscripts in the hebrew or greek languages   bell o sister dear lady bridget let me enquire about them are they much wormeaten o if i had them to present to the society of antiquarians i should be enrolled among the literati and be reckoned a great man dear miss pray let me have them i will make you a present of all my birds flowers and shells since you dont like antiques   emi i wish it was in my power to oblige either your ladyship or mr belmont but i really am not in possession of manuscripts in any of the learned languages   l brid but you understand them miss   emi madam   l brid come come you are too modest i am perfectly informed of your great erudition   emi upon my word madam i cannot say i am mistress of any language being but a very poor proficient in french and italian which are the only ones that i was ever taught   l brid aside i am vastly disgusted at her ignorance  how could your parents so shamefully neglect your education but i presume your mother gave up her time to the making of conserves and distilling of simples not understand greek it is an exalted language and all its ideas are refined   bell now hang me if i believe she understands it herself but she is like the man in the play that loved and honored the sound but miss if you will give me the manuscripts i will not tell lady bridget upon honor   emi i do assure you sir    bell you will for ever oblige me miss

expected your lordships summons with the utmost impatience  have you seen sir charles   l bell yes emily bur all my arguments were vain he holds his purpose and is this very moment on his journey   emi and does this wretched body still subsist after the soul is fled   l bell this is the language of romance you must forget him i have matters of more consequence to acquaint you with   emi why did you not suffer me to see sir charles he must he would have credited the truth and thought me what i am injured and innocent but at this instant he detests my name he thinks me false and strives to banish me from his remembrance   l bell then do the same by him retaliation is held just   emi never my lord he is deceived and my poor heart now bleeds for what his generous soul must feel when he shall be convinced that he has wronged me   l bell that may possibly never happen or if it should the time must be far off and we have not a moment now to lose i have received a letter from your

somerville and you be a man of honor and one whose family and fortune may pretend to you to turn your thoughts on him i really know no other way to escape your fathers wrath and rescue your own character   emi is cruelty so catching has somerville infected your humanity and caught you to insult my wretchedness must i again repeat i do not know him   l bell aside her emotion affects me it is strong and natural she has again convinced me  excuse this little trial of your truth which friendship and not cruelty suggested   emi a wounded heart my lord ill brooks suspicion   l bell pray pardon

once   l mar i believe my lord the general experience of mankind will allow that true love visits us but once in our lives   l loui lord sister how you must be laughed at should you hint such an oldfashioned notion among the beaumonde  why there is scarce a man of quality in england who has not been violently in love with half a dozen fine women at least before he thinks of marrying and if every one of them were to carry off but a corner of his heart there could scarce be an atom left for the poor lady to whom he devotes his hand   bell i am sure if that was true i should have no more heart than a mummy for i have suffered love many and many a time and yet i think that i am heartwhole still and have as large a stock of love to dispose of as ever   emi you very possibly may have preserved your whole fund entire sir for it is my belief they never knew to love who knew to change other passions sometimes assume its form and impose even on ourselves but the true the real flame subsists even till the lamp of life itself is quite extinguished   l loui aside she talks very feelingly upon this subject   l brid true miss lawson i will not blush to own that i am a fatal illustration of this sentiment the redundancy of my regards for mr feeble even in the tomb shall ever make me decline marriage  to his memory have i consecrated my virgin bloom   bell lord sister i never heard that you were in love till now and have often wondered mightily that you did not marry some learned man   l brid the delicacy of my sentiments brother forbad a promulgation of my passion

antinous and it might be two thousand years of age for ought he knew   l loui and so it may uncle if you can preserve it so long and though it may not now it will then certainly be an antique   bell i will go instantly and find out the fellow that sold it to me and if he cannot prove my ring a thousand years old at least i will give him a hundred strokes with my ratan and get my fifty guineas again  exit l mar my poor uncle has generally some violent distress of his own making   l loui o this is nothing to the grief i saw him in last year upon the blowing of a tulip which he fancied would be black and unfortunately proved to be red and yellow   l bell he like many others mistakes a passion for science for the knowledge of it and is therefore for ever liable to imposition but we have all our failings and let his pass i think louisa you gave up your opinion too tamely i was in hopes we should have a notable argument but your withdrawing has left miss lawson and your sister in possession of the field   l loui i have not courage sufficient my lord to encounter such odds even lady bridget joined them that was three to one but if your lordship will declare on my side i am ready to renew the attack and have no doubt of victory   l bell come on then ladies all brave men should engage on the weaker side   l mar if numbers can give strength my lord i fancy there will be

our friends are fewer madam they will be more sincere and of course like british soldiers braver than those venal troops that are ready to fight under all colors   l brid permit me my lord to bring this argument to a conclusion by observing that young ladies cannot expatiate on the thesis of love without giving an intimation that they are adepts in the science which would be rather an oppribrium than an honor to persons not yet adult but if your lordship pleases you and i will support the argument in a socratic manner and treat the subject as they would have done in the athenian porch   l

vain you strive to hide him from me  were he ennobled with all the honors majesty can give he cannot be raised above resentment and were he sprung from the lowest of mankind my emilys love has dignified his meanness and made him in point of happiness at least far my superior therefore again i do entreat you tell me   l bell there is something very extraordinary in your persisting in a request that is impossible for me to grant for by my honor i do not know the man whom you suppose your mistress has preferred nor ever heard his name   sir char not know the person whom i this very hour saw come out of your house by the backdoor that leads into your garden   l bell you must mistake sir charles it cannot be   sir char do i know you am i awake or in my senses if these things are

think it is impossible   sir char my dear lord belmont if i have injured you by imagining you to be this unknown persons friend therefore no longer mine what apology what atonement can i make   l bell indeed sir charles you have wronged both truth and friendship i never had a friend i dared to injure or disclaim yet if it was not a vision that you saw you are in some degree excuseable  yet why should he come here   sir char that is indeed a mystery  but as i could not imagine he came to any one within these walls except your lordship i hope you will pardon the frenzy of a man who thought himself aggrieved in the most tender points his love and friendship   l bell sir charles your seeming motives for resentment were so strong that i can readily forget the effects  i hope we are friends

banish from my mind all thoughts of love her guilt is fully proved she fled that fatal night from bath with her seducer curses blast him   l bell what reason have you to think so  aside it is plain he does not know she is here nor can i now inform him   sir char my servant is returned and brings this sad account he left her poor unhappy father setting out in pursuit of  i cannot name her my once lovely emily   l bell in such a scene of complicated distress may she not have fled for refuge to some friend why will you think the worst   sir char o no my lord she had no friend to fly to for sure he is the worst of foes as well as villains that would destroy her innocence i doubt not but the wretch may abandon her to want and infamy   l bell i cannot think that she is in his power it is improbable that a welleducated maid should take so rash a step but on a certainty of marriage with the man she loved   sir char i should rejoice to think as you do and were there but the slightest foundation for hope would gladly rest upon it but all my doubts are at an end i am therefore determined to quit england but not till i have found the man who has robbed me of my peace and emily i will

when i left london on the death of my first wife   l bell i am sorry sir not to have been better known to so near a relation pray how does my cousin emily i used to visit her often while she was at school   south she is very well my lord and that is my greatest grief if she had died with her mother she would have been happy and so would i   l bell you will pardon me sir but that thought seems so very unnatural   south not at all not at all my lord she has been a plague to me ever since she was born and my present lady mrs southern always said she would be so and mrs southern let me tell your lordship is a parlous wise woman and never was mistaken in her whole life at least i never thought her in the wrong and therefore never contradicted her   l bell i should be sorry to think mrs southern never erred in judgment for then my cousin must have verified this infallible ladys prediction   south and so she has my lord i like a careful father as i was and in regard to her poor mothers memory provided a proper and convenient match for her my neighbor winterbottom my lord a man pretty near my own age one that was fit to conduct and manage such a raw headstrong chit as she a discreet person let me tell you and a great favorite of mrs southernes   l bell you could not surely think of marrying my cousin to a person as old as her father sir   south why not why not my lord she made no objection to his years but truly she disliked his family and person because he was not a fine smockfacd beau and could not trace his pedigree up to adam forsooth a conceited undutiful minx as she was   l bell i cannot blame my cousins spirit sir her birth youth and fortune entitle her to a very different match but were she a beggar sir she had better serve to earn her bread than wed the man she hates   south very fine my lord but stay till you hear the end of that high spirit   l bell whatever her conduct may have been sir i fear yours toward her has justified it   south no no i was too tender of her when she got into the pouts and cried and roared i promised not to force her to this marriage but if she would be a dutiful child and consent to it i would take her with me to bath she promised she would try to obey me and in an ill hour to bath i brought her   l bell and there i suppose she married the first man that asked her   south worse much worse than that she sent a fine spark a baronet i think he was to ask her for his wife though she knew very well that mrs southern had passed her word she should marry winterbottom and did she think i would make my lady a liar no no i sent him a packing and ordered madam to prepare for southernehall directly   l bell may i not presume to say sir that this proceeding was too violent   south pray dont interrupt me my lord and you shall hear how this gentle lady behaved  about eleven that night when i was smoking my pipe i heard her squall i ran into her chamber and there i found the knight and another of her lovers i suppose tilting at each other i beat down their passes with my crutch the candle fell to the ground and before the servants could bring light madam and all were fled   l bell have you heard nothing of her since   south not a syllable nor would i ever have enquired about her but that my ladys honor is engaged to winterbottom now if you can assist me to discover where she is i will bring a replevin for her and carry her home directly if winterbottom will marry her so  if not i will keep her close enough to prevent her bringing any farther disgrace on me while i live i warrant you   l bell have you found out who the gentleman was who fought with the baronet   south yes her maid sally a forward young flirt like her mistress told the servants that his name was freeman   l bell aside freeman that is something gained  a thought occurs   south now i beg my lord that you will send out immediately to all the inns and lodginghouses about town to look for emily my servants shall go one way yours another and i think we cannot well miss of her though london is hugely grown since i was here that is certain   l bell you may be sure sir that i shall take every proper method for the service of my cousin but it is not by a replevin that her character is to be recovered though her person may you as her father sir are first bound to do her justice to call the man who has wronged her to a strict account and make him clear her fame by instant marriage   south what i call any one to account i fight for her not i truly i am a civil magistrate the law is my weapon and if i can reclaim her by that i will   l bell but what are we to do sir with the fair fugitive when we have recovered her   south even what your lordship pleases you shall be heartily welcome to dispose of her to whom you will for me try if you can make a match for her suited to her birth and youth since you dont approve of that i had proposed but not a penny will i give to buy her a fop or a coxcomb or a title yet if either of those fellows she went off with will marry her without money why i will even give my consent that i may he no longer plagued with her though i am very much afraid that mrs southern will be angry   l bell you talk sir as if your daughter were already found   south why my lord if she should never be found i cannot help it but as i am come so far i will even stay in town till the horses are rested  poor things they have not had such a journey this many a long year   l bell sir if you will leave the management of this affair to me i will act as if my cousin were my sister but remember sir you have promised your consent to the baronet if he should again solicit it   south ay ay my lord he shall have her if he chooses to wait for her fortune till my death i must now go smoke my pipe in the

to consider it in that light louisa i am almost sorry that i prevented my brothers meeting mr freeman it must have brought on an eclaircissement which i am of opinion is absolutely necessary   l loui you are not in earnest sure you could not be guilty of any thing so inhuman   l mary i think it would have been rather kind than cruel   l loui o absolutely barbarous aside i fancy she is vexed at not having a lover herself i will not trust her any farther   l mary our sentiments are so different upon many subjects that i am not surpised they do not accord on this what objection can mr freeman have to lord belmonts being made acquainted with his passion my brothers tenderness demands our confidence and it is robbing him of what he has fairly purchased to withold it   l mary how often must i tell you lady mary that it is i and not mr freeman that would have this affair kept secret  there is something so indelicate in public courtship and weddings that i cannot bear the thought   l mar you will pardon me louisa if i pronounce it much more indelicate for a young lady to receive the addresses of a lover privately than if authorized by the approbation of her friends in this case her compliance might appear a condescension to their desires in the other it looks too much like granting an indulgence to her own   l loui your ladyship has stated the case as you call it with all the wisdom and gravity of a lawyer i hope you will be married to a judge sister you will be a vast help to him in his business and may save him the expense of a clerk but pray madam coke upon littleton in the aforesaid case is not the young lady to be considered as the principal party and is it not quite as necessary she should be pleased as any of her kindred and parentage   l mary doubtless my dear but will the approbation of her friends prevent her liking   l loui why yes i think it might  for example were my uncle to recommend a husband to me he must be a virtuoso if my aunt he must be a pedant if my brother he must be a philosopher and if my dear maria was to choose for me he must possess every great and amiable quality have a large fortune and a title now as i am not vain enough to hope for the last and have a mortal aversion to all the other characters i will even choose for myself and then i shall have no body to complain of   l mary nor to  remember that louisa   l loui i hope i shall have no cause but if i should i detest compassion of all things i should not like even to have your pity   l mary i am sorry for it because i am afraid you will want it   l loui psha   enter emily

that you will not refuse such a trifle as he offers it is a thing of no sort of value indeed i think of neither use nor ornament   bell not so despicable neither madam   l mar however highly you may rate it sir there is a degree of politeness in lessening the value of what we bestow   bell circumstances vary cases niece there are some things we should not depreciate   emi i rate the gift so far above my worth sir that nothing shall ever tempt me to accept of it   l loui bless me miss lawson you are the very paragon of humility though i confess i think you are right not to be teized with such a disagreeable animal a thing that by pretending to imitate human speech puts one out of humor with the sound of our own voice as much as a monkey does with our species i hate parrots and monkeys   bell yes but you love fops and coxcombs dont you let me tell you madam your tongue runs before your wit you dont know what you are abusing   l loui i should be sorry to find fault with any thing you liked sir but i thought it was merely as a naturalist that you kept such a number of parrots i did not think it was for the pleasure of hearing them talk   bell i can tell you madam i would rather hear them chatter than you   l mar yet they sometimes cast reflections mal a propos as well as my sister sir   bell pray ladies let me draw breath  was there ever such a couple of vixens   aside to emily dont mind them miss but consider what i have said i am sure it is entirely for your good i speak you dont know what a vast collection of pretty things i have and they shall all be yours   emi where things are in themselves indifferent sir persuasions and temptations may avail but where our resolutions are founded in reason nothing can or should alter them   bell hush hush miss not a word more upon this subject i have a great deal of business upon my hands but pray miss do think about it i will get you a very fine noesgay tomorrow i will pull my paul diack tulip for you the root cost me twenty pounds but you shall have it sure you will not be cruel to me now dont say one word for i must run and you shall have the tulip at any rate  exit enter lord belmont l bell your servant ladies was not that mr belmont that left you i suppose he has been entertaining you with some of his curiosities   l loui i think he is himself a greater curiosity than any in his collection my lord but i fancy he has a mind to dispose of them all together and means to give a bargain of them to miss lawson   emi he has done me the honor to offer me abundance of rarities madam but i am not disposed to receive favors that i cannot return therefore his treasures are all safe for me   l mar i fancy he loads his gifts with hard conditions and would persuade you to accept himself along with them is it not so miss lawson   l bell i congratulate you on your conquest emily your eyes can do wonders it seems and light up sparks in dying embers   emi i rather think my lord that mr belmonts flame is of that kind which dying fires emit to show their near extinction and the faint blaze has but by accident cast it is pale light on me any other object might have been brightened by the same glimmer   l bell you wrong my uncles taste i have not heard of his proposing to marry any lady these five years before that time he used to be generally in love twice a year and had his summer and winter passions which he constantly changed with his clothes for the season   l mar i am surpised my lord that among such a variety of mistresses he never found one that would marry him his person must have been tolerable when he was young his family and fortune unexceptionable   l bell be assured sister that was not the case but by the time he had brought the lady to think favorably of him he began to discover some imperfection in her perhaps her nose was a hairs breadth longer or shorter than it should be according to the exact rules of proportion a foot or a finger perhaps disgusted him on which he immediately quitted his pursuit and went in search of another model   l loui it is happy the men are not so nice nowadays or we should never be able to fix a lover   l bell i fancy louisa that must be at all times a difficult matter to accomplish a fine woman will doubtless captivate many but there is something more than beauty necessary to preserve her conquest over one   l loui why so they say my lord but i protest i cannot credit it it is impossible i think for a woman to lose her power while she retains her beauty   l mar a moments recollection must furnish you with such a number of instances to contradict your assertion louisa that i am afraid the argument will drop on your conviction and i should like vastly to have it carried on   l loui o never fear well keep it up but i will not admit of odds it is only with my brother i argue   l bell well then i grant that while beauty lasts it will always have admirers but these louisa are but pageants to a conqueror the triumph must be found at home in the heartfelt love and esteem of a man of sense and honor   l loui true my lord but that same beauty that causes admiration and attention in other men will necessarily preserve our husbands love   l bell by no means louisa possession damps the ardor of desire merit alone can keep the flame alive and hinder every wanton gale from blowing it abroad that like the vestal fire must be preserved by constant watching   l loui by your account my lord a married woman has just as bad a life as a vestal if her whole time is to be spent in keeping one spark alive   l bell i will allow her task is full as arduous though more pleasing men are naturally inconstant and a husband may sometimes see a woman fairer than his wife but it is her fault if in the whole circle he can find one that so well deserves his love whose temper manners conduct and behavior are so much suited to his sentiments who knows no wish or will but to please him  these charms the homeliest woman may acquire without them the fairest form that ever struck our eyes cannot retain one heart   l mar indeed my lord we are vastly obliged to you for this excellent lesson and ought to think ourselves extremely happy in such a sensible and kind instructor   l bell you make me so as i hope that these slight hints i have thrown out may be of use to you but why so grave miss lawson i hope i have not made you melancholy   emi i have heard your lordship with the utmost pleasure and most sincerely wish that my whole sex had done so too   l loui i think though we ought not to wish that the other sex had heard his lordship it would make some of them horridly insolent   l bell be assured louisa that i have only spoke the general opinion of every rational man but a truce with the subject

dare not look upon her   y free sir charles had your passion suffered you to have asked me then my errand i should have frankly owned it but while i had hopes of lady louisa i could not with any decency have revealed these last particulars and now that i have done all in my power to set matters to rights and atone my faults i can only in palliation of my behavior say that it was not badness of heart but dislike to a sedentary life which tempted me to leave my sphere and soar at higher objects in which i am now sensible i have justly failed and must encounter the deserved fate of those whom vanity seduces from the situation of life provided for them   e free the daring to confess we have been wrong is not only the highest act of bravery but the best security for our future amendment

humility but beg you will allow me to indulge my own generosity by assuring you that through this whole affair i never once condemned but pitied your mistake   sir char my generous emily   bell why what is all this about if you like my niece why dont you come and take her and her pity and her pardon together and i will give you a good five thousand pounds into the bargain come brother give her hand to sir charles and let us make an end of it   south with all my heart brother if they are both willing for i promised my lord to give my consent   l bell now emily it rests on you alone to show that noble minds most easily forgive   emi i have been only on the defensive my lord during this whole warfare and such an enemy is generally ready for terms of peace therefore if you should hold out the olive branch in my name to your ally you may suppose i shall accede to the treaty   sir char no words can speak my gratitude my hearts too full for utterance transporting charmer every way you
