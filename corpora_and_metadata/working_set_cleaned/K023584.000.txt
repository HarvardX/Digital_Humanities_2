introduction to shakespeares plays containing an essay on oratory  london printed for john bell near exeterexchange in the strand and c etherington at york mdcclxxiii  dedication to david garrick esquire sir it is matter of great doubt whether any dedicatory address was ever freer from taint of flattery than the present if we pronounce you the best illustrator of and the best living comment on shakespeare that ever has appeared or possibly ever will grace the british stage it is merely echoing the public voice and concurring with that unparalleled unanimity of praise which during so long a course of years has attended your incomparable merit  this compact edition of shakespeare is offered you as a grateful though small return for the infinite pleasure and extensive information derived from your exquisite performance and judicious remarks by  sir your most obedient humble servants the editors  advertisement shakespeares admirers even the enthusiastic ones who worship him as the god of their idolatry have never scrupled to admit that his most regular pieces produce some scenes and passages highly derogatory to his incomparable general merit he frequently trifles is now and then obscure and sometimes to gratify a vitiated age indelicate but can any degree of critical taste wish the preservation of dark spots because they have grown upon dramatic sunshine is not the corrective hand frequently proved to be the kindest critics like parents should neither spare the rod nor use it wantonly  there is no doubt but all our authors faults may justly be attributed to the loose quibbling licentious taste of his time he no doubt upon many occasions wrote wildly merely to gratify the public as dryden wrote bombastically and congreve obscenely to indulge the humor and engage the favor of their audiences no man can suppose that the former considered his rhiming dialogues as marks of sublimity nor that the latter imagined his double entendres were wit one wanted money the other fame for which pompous sounds and gross ideas were then popular baits consequently chaste criticism and delicacy were without scruple sacrificed to their several views  our author did not go quite so far but very frequently preserved himself free from taint reining his fiery pegasus with an able masterly hand why then should not the noble monuments he has left us of unrivalled ability be restored to due proportion and natural luster by sweeping off those cobwebs and that dust of depraved opinion which shakespeare was unfortunately forced to throw on them forced we say for it is no strain of imagination to suppose that the goths and vandals of criticism who frequented the theater in his days would like those who overran the roman empire have destroyed and consigned to barbarous oblivion the sublime beauties which they could not relish and it is matter of great question with us whether the fool in king lear was not a more general favorite than the old monarch himself  the above considerations first started the idea and induced the undertaking of this edition and as the theaters especially of late have been generally right in their omissions of this author particularly we have printed our text after their regulations and from this part of our design an evident use will arise that those who take books to the theater will not be so puzzled themselves to accompany the speaker nor so apt to condemn performers of being imperfect when they pass over what is designedly omitted upon this point however it is to be observed that the difference of power of voice and execution between different performers may make one erase more than another nevertheless we come so near the mark of all that scarce any perplexity can arise in tracing them besides we would hope that a reasonable standard being thus laid down professors of the drama will not be so forward as capriciously and arbitrarily to deviate from it it is commendable to consult the extent of expression but through idleness to retrench what is beautiful and necessary or through vanity to retain what is heavy and unessential to action we deem an affront to the public and a disgrace to the performer  as an author replete with spirited ideas and a full flow of language especially one possessing a muse of fire cannot stop exactly where stage utterance and public attention require some passages of great merit for the closet are never spoken such though omitted in the text we have carefully preserved in the notes  and now being upon this part of our subject we hold ourselves bound in justice and gratitude to mr garrick to mention a delicate fear which he suggested when we first solicited his sanction and assistance this fear was lest the prunings transpositions or other alterations which in his province as a manager he had often found necessary to make or adopt with regard to the text for the convenience of representation or accommodation to the powers and capacities of his performers might be misconstrued into a critical presumption of offering to the literati a reformed and more correct edition of our authors works this being by no means his intention we hope it will not become liable to such an unmerited misconstruction in justification of ourselves also we take this opportunity of declaring that to expect any thing more of this work than as a companion to the theater is to mistake the purpose of the editors  having been long convinced that multiplying conjectural verbal criticisms tends rather to perplex than inform readers we have given those readings which to us appear most consonant to our authors manner and meaning without obtruding one capricious opinion on another  we have furnished an explanation of technical and obsolete terms pointed out the leading beauties as they occur without descanting so much as to anticipate the readers conception and investigation we have shown with a becoming impartiality what appear to us to be blemishes and imperfections the requisites for representing every character of importance are defined and the mode of performance essential for scenes peculiarly capital is clearly pointed out  we have earnestly consulted correctness neatness ornament utility and cheapness of price we have avoided all ostentation of criticism compacting our notes as much as possible in regard whereof it may be justly said that we could have enlarged the number and extended the phraseology with much less trouble than it cost us to give them their present form it has been our peculiar endeavor to render what we call the essence of shakespeare more instructive and intelligible especially to the ladies and to youth glaring indecencies being removed and intricate passages explained and lastly we have striven to supply plainer ideas of criticism both in public and private than we have hitherto met with  a general view of each play is given by way of introduction  though this is not an edition meant for the profoundly learned nor the deeply studious who love to find out and chase their own critical game yet we flatter ourselves both parties may perceive fresh ideas started for speculation and reflection  the editors  essay on oratory though it is not strictly within the limits of our plan to range at large over the extensive field of oratorical correctness fancy and excellence as it respects the pulpit senate and bar yet it is hoped we shall so far touch on the essentials of them all as to give hints which may prove useful to each of the three degrees  if we say that an orator like a poet to excel should be born such it will be no strained assertion and if we add that he must be more indebted to nature than a son of the muses it will be easily admitted cultivated imagination regulated by judgment constitutes one who totally void of external requisites may shine from his closet though ever so deformed in figure rude in features weak in voice or blemished in appearance  the other though he may by peculiar excellence of delivery and the help of a feeling subject well treated on be able to impress an audience with little more than a good voice yet experience powerfully convinces us that a graceful person respectable marking features expressive eyes and ornamental gesture are of the utmost utility it is no argument to say that a man as in the case of sir john fielding though the visual gates of sympathy be shut may show strong marks of oratorical merit for the question naturally follows would he not be much more powerful in expression if the indexes of thought enjoyed their natural and proper vigor especially where particular feelings are to be excited  it is too common for ignorance and avarice to misapply the talents of youth especially in this point of view many are destined for and brought up to the most serious the most important concerns of life wherein public speaking is required who labor under glaring defects and imbecilities of expression hence so many drowsy irksome preachers so many senatorical ciphers and such a number of imperfect pleaders this parental blunder is much the same as breeding a purblind boy to watchmaking or one hard of hearing to music  supposing a person qualified by nature let us see how far art may be called in the complete orator must have a general and intimate knowledge of himself the world and mankind a clear conception of the passions and affections of those he is to instruct and persuade a perfect acquaintance with the various distinctions of virtue and vice he should be critically intimate with all the beauties and blemishes of the ancient writers he should be an historian and a logician possessing a correct idea of and taste for the liberal arts if a competent knowledge of the mechanical ones is added so much the better he should possess a quick conception and a retentive memory he should be able to break through with ease the cobwebs of sophistry and above all enjoy that grand ingredient recommended by cicero social philosophy  he should be master of all the arguments for and against his subject in short to sum up all with the great roman orators own words he should be furnished with logical acuteness philosophical wisdom and poetical imagination embellished with the most polished elocution and gesture of the stage  to expatiate upon the obvious advantages deriveable from each of the above qualifications required to complete this very comprehensive character we are considering would be to spin out a needless length of explanation which could answer no end but anticipating the readers reflective investigation wherefore we shall quit this point with observing that when so many requisites both internal and external are necessary it is no wonder that a complete orator is so very scarce a character  declaimers who may be justly styled the pageants of oratory possess the flowery but not the argumentative part they appeal boldly to fancy and the passions but cautiously shun rational inquisition show and plausibility completely set up one of this dangerous kind of public speakers who oftener make proselytes among the weak and ignorant than sound orators do as they are mostly pleasing though seldom instructive bishop sprat speaking of them in his history of the royal society emphatically says of all the studies of men nothing can be sooner obtained than a vicious abundance of phrase the trick of metaphors and a volubility of tongue  having come thus far the three celebrated orators of antiquity seem to fall in the way demosthenes isocrates and cicero the first spoke from the heart the second from the head the first was animated by his subject and powerfully enforced it the second decked it profusely with rhetorical flowers one flashed conviction by irresistible imagery the other amused imagination with fantastical allusions of isocrates we may say his eloquence resembled a pleasant but shallow stream which tickles the ear with an agreeable murmuring demosthenes a deep majestic current that in its course thunders on attention and bears down all opposition isocrates possesses ease and elegance demosthenes power and persuasion cicero who rises far above the former does not in our idea come up to the latter he is however a very masterly mixture of both and therefore more likely to obtain general admiration than either of his predecessors  oratory is well defined the exercise of eloquence eloquence the fluency of speech and rhetoric the guide of both it is odd that these three terms should frequently be used as synonimous when they so essentially differ  oratorical composition should be founded on a progressive unity of parts but not like some of our sermons which are disgraced with insipid methodical formality commonly styled heads it should enter modestly upon warm into the subject and if required kindle to fire when the audience are ready to receive heated impressions an impassioned exordium generally produces a cold conclusion and that piece which endeavors to catch attention too suddenly will either not catch it at all or be obliged soon to let it slip  fenelon archbishop of cambray describing the beauties of eloquence speaks to the following effect of what use can any ornament be that does not tend to prove to paint or to affect those ornaments which only please are false beauties those which please and persuade solid ones the just and natural emotions of an orator have much grace and beauty in them his correct and spirited painting charms us all the essential parts of eloquencce tend to please but merely pleasing is not the most important aim ideas and expressions which only tickle the ear may be deemed quaint turns all graces of style which serve to invigorate persuasion are to be wished for but all witty punning conceits all quibbling upon words all strained metaphors all forced glaring imagery and all luxurance of idea which only serve to flash and glitter upon fancy disgrace sound oratory  in public speaking as well as in poetry and painting art should be carefully concealed where perceptible it has a coarse and mean aspect the orator should so entirely possess his audience of the subject as to make them forget the speaker  from the affecting exclamation of gracchus mentioned by cicero and a dilation of it we perceive how expression strengthens or enervates a subject wretched man that i am whither shall i turn myself where can i go to the capitol it swims with my brothers blood shall i go to to my own house there to see my wretched mother dissolved in tears and overwhelmed with sorrow this is a beautiful bold and affecting picture of perplexed grief mark how faded the tints of originality appear in the following faint copy i know not where to go nor whither i shall turn myself amidst my misfortunes  the capitol is the place where my brothers blood was shed and at home i shall find my unhappy mother lamenting her sad condition with very narrow comprehension and very dull feelings we may readily perceive the falling off in this languid extension and variation of phrase  we shall offer an instance of the turgid and chaste in the following comparative contrast suppose a person addressing an english audience on a presumed decay of english liberty should thus declaim most renowned britons  in the magnanimous volume of time we may read  even purblind eyes may see the glaring type that there was a period when liberty diaphanous as sunbeams at noon exhilarated this oceanic isle when like the bird of jove it soared aloft and gazed with pleasure on the face of day now it faintly glimmers like the fogwrapped moon and our glorious eagle is become a bird of night  now let us see how the same subject may be treated in opposition to this overcharged bloated tabernacle harangue which delivered in the moorfield manner must prove a laughable morsel of mirth to divert common sense and astonish ignorance  fellow citizens there was a time when liberty diffused its blessings through this once happy isle when its value was known and its worth revered when like the sun it was a common comforter the parent of pleasure ease and security now corruption and our own depravity have brought it to so enfeebled and precarious a state that every real friend of his country must tremble as i do at the painful idea of its speedy and inevitable dissolution  if eloquence a very dangerous weapon in the hands of illdesigning men is used to any other purposes than the following we may consider it as in a censurable state of perversion  it should enforce the clearest proof of any useful truth with such interesting motives as may affect the hearers and work their passions to virtuous purposes to raise indignation against ingratitude horror against cruelty detestation against vice abhorrence against slavery compassion for misery love for virtue reverence for religion obedience to superiors and benevolence to all thus employed eloquence appears in its full force and beauty mere harangues seldom fail to catch the ear but rarely touch the heart and as seldom inform the head  it is necessary that an orator should call the passions to his aid but then he should be very cautious not to impose on or assail them too violently the one is cruel the other impolitic he should be clear in his ideas and concise in his expression he should perfectly understand just arrangement of matter and the proper climax of argument he should be thoroughly possessed of every principle and part of his subject he should provide a sufficient number of apposite affecting figures thus prepared he must speak and effectually from an untrammeld imagination  the following passages from bishop burnets discourse on the pastoral care seems well calculated for the improvement of lay as well as pulpit speakers the extempore orator should frequently converse with himself to let his thoughts flow freely from him especially when he feels an edge and heat upon his mind for then happy expressions will spontaneously come to his mouth he must also write essays on all kinds of subjects for by writing he will bring himself to a facility and correctness of thinking and speaking and thus by close application for two or three years a man may render himself such a master this way that he can never be surprised nor will new thoughts ever dry up upon him if in his meditations happy thoughts and noble pathetic expressions offer themselves he must not lose but write them down  we perfectly agree with the right reverend author that much oratorical merit may be derived from frequent wellregulated soliloquies and essaywriting and are induced to offer a few more of his thoughts though not in the exact words nor confined light wherein he has proposed them  one most essential point is that an orator should have a due and deep sense of the truth and utility of his subject he must have a life and glow in his thoughts with relation to it he should very sensibly feel in himself those things which he explains and recommends to others he should speak as if what he uttered came from the heart the orator unless he really is or seems to be in earnest will never make any material impression there is a degree of authority even in the simplest matters that can be treated of if they appear genuine while the most important points fall into neglect when conveyed through the cold vehicle of languid expression  for a general wellcompacted idea of oratory we shall refer to some speeches from fenelons dialogue between demosthenes and cicero  cicero what do thou pretend that i was but an ordinary orator   demosthenes not an ordinary one for it is not over an ordinary person that i affect superiority thou were doubtless a celebrated orator thou had great parts but did frequently deviate from the point wherein perfection consists   cicero and pray had thou no faults at all   demosthenes i believe i can be taxed with none in point of eloquence   cicero can thou compare richness of genius with me thou who art dry unadorned who art ever confined within narrow and contracted limits thou do not amplify any subject thou from whom nothing can be retrenched so impoverished so starved is the manner in which thy subjects are treated whereas i extended mine displaying a copious and fertile genius which gave judicious critics occasion to say that nothing could be added to my works   demosthenes he from whom nothing can be retrenched has said nothing but what is perfect   cicero he to whom nothing can be added has omitted nothing that could adorn his work   demosthenes thou find thy discourses more replete with flashes of wit than mine  confess honestly is not this thy claim to superiority   cicero since you urge the point i acknowledge it my compositions are infinitely more beautified than thine they speak far more wit more ingenuity of turn more art more ease i exhibit the same thing under twenty different shapes when people heard my orations they could not help admiring my parts nor being surprised at my art they were constantly shouting and interrupting me with vehemence of applause thou must have been heard very quietly with i suppose little or no interruption   demosthenes thy observations on both are true but the inference drawn from them is thy mistake thou tookst up the audience with thyself i engaged it only with the affairs i spoke upon people admired thee i was forgot by the auditors who saw nothing but the course i wished them to take thou did entertain with flashes of wit i struck down with bolts of thunder thou made men say how finely he speaks i made them exclaim come let us take the field against philip they praised thee they were too much dispossessed of themselves to praise me thy harangues came forth adorned none ever discovered in me any ornament there was nothing in my pieces but precise strong clear argument and thence impulses like lightning which nothing could resist thou were a perfect orator when thou were like me  simple grave austere without apparent art in a word when thou were demosthenical but when wit turn and art shone in thy discourses then were mere cicero departing so far from perfection as thou departedst from my character   mr rapin in his reflections upon eloquence observes that there are two extremes which should be equally and carefully avoided the frigid style and the boyish the former renders discourses dry and insipid by a languid flatness of expression the latter ungrateful and shocking by a turgid loftiness and affected amplification those who use the frigid style call in pompous expressions when the subject requires plain ones and they who affect the boyish one employ low expressions in the loftiest themes the frigid style properly includes all such expressions as are too strong or too sparkling strained metaphors and frequent witticisms the boyish style comprehends strokes of humor and quaint conceits upon serious subjects loose and heavy repetitions in that part of an oration which ought to be close and concise too violent exaggerations and too laborious figures  one would think that malbranche had the enthusiastic religionmongers of those days in view when he observed that one of the greatest and most remarkable proofs of the strong influence that some heated imaginations have over others is the power of extensive persuasion without a shadow of proof false eloquence like the prisniatic glass its gaudy colors spreads on every place the face of nature we no more survey all glares alike without distinction gay but true expression like the unchanging sun clears and improves whatever it shines upon it gilds all objects but it alters none expression is the dress of thought and still appears more decent as more suitable pope on criticism   stage delivery for theatrical expression cannot be styled oratory including more variety and more force of passion is consequently more difficult it requires the finest and most significant feelings in the performer to create by sympathy proper sensations in the audience  that noble and almost peculiar sense of human nature sympathy makes us not only share in the distress of a fellow creature but also pity the miserable brute it varies shapes and strength according to the objects and circumstances which occur there are two principal degrees sympathy of compulsion and sympathy of election the first is when irresistible motives arrest the heart the second when it becomes interested by choice compulsive sympathy instructs us to sigh with successless love to kindle with real or well painted rage to weep with grief and to mourn for virtue in distress elective sympathy is when we make choice of objects in different situations and become without any personal knowledge or immediate concern anxious for their success in cases of competition whether of a pleasurable or of a serious nature man cannot remain a spectator totally indifferent he must assist one side or the other with a sympathetic wish in the choice he is free yet that choice is frequently so capricious that no firm reason can be offered why it becomes fixed  imagination is the vehicle which conveys sympathy to and draws it meliorated from the heart that which the theater raises is produced by the bold painting of the poets pen aided by the natural and forcible talents of a good actor who is in every sentence an illustrative comment upon his authors idea  this is that kind of sympathy which the ingenious dr smith in his theory of moral sentiments describes to arise from the view of emotions in another person the passions may be transfused from one person to another instantaneously and antecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the person principally concerned grief and joy strongly expressed in the look and gestures of any one exclusive of voice at once affect the spectator with some degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion a smiling face is to every one who sees it a cheerful object as a sorrowful countenance on the other hand is a melancholy one  what the ingenious professor says of mankind at large may be brought to the point we have immediately in view every faculty in one man when he judges of propriety is the measure by which he decides upon the like faculty in another i judge of your sight by my sight of your ear by my ear of your reason by my reason of your resentment by my resentment of your love by my love i neither have nor can have any other way of judging about them this position granted we are not to wonder at the endless variety of and frequent absurd critical opinions upon the real and mimic stages of life  if an actor creates sympathy which to do should be his foremost aim he will command attention if not vain are the best requisites and all the adventitious aids of theatrical decoration  for what follows we have been obliged to a pamphlet written by mr gentleman some few years since  reading and declamation consist of emphasis climax modulation pauses breaks transitions tones cadences and gesture  emphasis may be divided into two branches explanatory and expressive by the first is meant that stress of utterance which presents more clearly to conception the meaning of what we deliver as for example  a popular man is in truth no better than a prostitute to common fame and to the people he lies down to every one he meets for the hire of praise and his humility is only a disguised ambition  by marking the preceding passage so the meaning strikes immediately with full force whereas if the stress was laid upon other words or if the whole was uttered with monotony a sameness of tone the sense would be confused and to a hearer whose apprehension was not very quick perhaps quite unintelligible  in cases where the sense is doubtful proper emphasis is indispensably necessary for instance did the englishman deserve to die  if i lay the stress upon did then it marks a question arising from surprise if englishman is distinguished then it implies that others were concerned and that i would know his case particularly  if die is marked then it appears that i admit guilt but want to know if his crime was of such a nature as to deserve capital punishment  expressive emphasis is that which we use to render a passage whose meaning is obvious more forcible as may appear by properly marking the following quotation from shakespeare all words printed in italic except proper names are those on which the emphasis is to be laid but words in capitals require a more powerful emphasis   in this ye gods you make the weak most strong in this ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony towers nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself let us take another example from an higher epic  he bids the spiry firs arise the cedar vigorous pierce the skies from lebanons chill brow fearless amid conflicting storms the towering stork his cradle forms high on the sounding bough  0 th psalm by laying the emphasis on spiry in the first line the peculiar form of the trees mentioned is explained whereas had the stress been laid upon firs it would leave us at liberty to think upon oaks elms etc spiry too  the word arise is marked as being the purport of a command and though in general the voice falls at the end of a line yet in this case the meaning requires it should be raised but not too high nor abruptly  in the second line vigorous is marked as a property of the cedar indeed all epithets whether they precede or follow require emphasis  pierce is noted as painting a quickness and boldness of vegetation while the imagination is raised to a more than ordinary height by particularising skies  in the third line chill is distinguished as a characteristic quality of the climate of lebanon  fearless in the fourth line is pointed out as an extraordinary attribute of a bird and conflicting storms are emphatical as a proof of that attribute enlarging the idea much more than the simple word fearless unassisted would have done  in the fifth line towering is distinguished as an epithet and cradle which happily describes the storks nest in that rocking situation is pointed out as the motive of the birds resolution  in the last line high is marked as a material circumstance of the imagery and sounding not only as an epithet but also as referring to its turbulent situation among whistling or roaring gales  i have chosen the above stanza from the psalms as picturesque poetry rests more upon emphasis than any other species of writing and i have been so minute in the explanation of it not only that my meaning might be understood as to this branch of expression but likewise to show that emphasis should be founded on reason not laid merely for a jingle or variation of sound  having thus marked and explained one stanza i shall propose two more for the exercise of the student without any marks of distinction  he as a curtain stretched on high the vast cerulean canopy and gave with fires to glow twas he tremendous potentate built on the waves his hall of state wide as the waters flow he walks upon the wings of wind and leaves the rapid storms behind their monarchs awful will seraphs await in dread suspense and swifter than the lightnings glance his mighty word fulfill after all that can be said the degrees of emphasis are so many and so variable that no precise rules can be laid down for their application  in reading and declamation as in music there must be taste to give beauty without it mere rectitude will be most unaffectingly insipid this quality though improveable must certainly be first derived from nature  a reader before he can reach bare propriety must thoroughly understand what he reads for which reason the custom of putting children to peruse the bible in which there are many difficult words and abstruse passages is by no means to be commended nay if we consider it in another light it is highly blameable for by being made the subject of puzzle and embarrassment by being tossed about in a careless and slovenly manner that love and respect which the sacred writings justly claim are too frequently set aside in youth this important point is very judiciously enforced by mr hull in a note on one of mr prestons genuine letters  he objected to the absurd custom practiced then as at this day of suffering children to learn to read from the bible whence they too often contract a distaste to the most edifying and important volume that can in the process of their lives be laid before them vol i letter    page      we are told that among the turks if a piece of written paper appears on the ground it is taken up and carefully preserved lest the word allah or god be inscribed on it  mark the contrasted irreverence of christians who not only profane with their mouths that most awful name upon the most trivial occasions but also frequently use as waste paper whole sheets in which not only his sacred name is mentioned but every letter a part of his divine word  another reason against making the bible an early book among learners is the frequency of periods and peculiarity of style in which it differs widely from most other compositions it is not rare to find many persons who by laboriously conning over the chapters can stumble their way pretty tolerably through any part of it yet put them to any other book you shall find them lamentably hampered and frequently at an absolute stand  but to return more particularly to my subject  as no absolute rules can be laid down for emphasis in general we must be content with remarks upon particular cases such as that opposition or antithesis requires an emphasis upon each of the opposed words and that most monosyllables beginning a question must be strongly marked as why did he so what can he mean how did she look in compound words that are opposed to others the emphasis or rather accent properly falls on the distinguishing syllables for instance the virtuous are modest  the vicious immodest  the righteous are blessed  the unrighteous are miserable  here i have opposed simple to simple and compound to compound were the words immodest and unrighteous to be pronounced without opposition the accent would fall upon the second syllable instead of the first  in explanatory emphases the very same words are differently marked according to the writers design as what did my master say if i lay the stress upon what it is a general interrogation if i place it upon my it implies that other masters were concerned if master is distinguished it notes that there were other persons and if the emphasis lies boldest upon say it shows i want to know his particular words  both the cause and the effect in any sentence require an emphasis  example to live well is to die happy  only to be good is to be great  guilt is the source of sorrow  climax is that progressive force and exaltation of expression which more powerfully impresses each subject on the mind and is not only of indispensible use but also highly ornamental in the execution of this there is much nicety as the rise in most cases should be gradual always harmonious and upon many occasions very forcible  to illustrate the matter i shall offer several examples of different degrees of climax first from shakespeares brutus which should rise with a full smooth philosophic weight and dignity   if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steal with valor the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans who have spoke the word and will not falter or what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it the climax of reasoning in these lines is too obvious to be insisted on therefore i shall only observe that the glow of expression as i may call it should warm with the argument  the sublime and beautiful from moses last song  give ear oh ye heavens and i will speak and hear oh earth the words of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity  just and right is he  for the lords portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him and kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirs up her nest fluttereth over her young spreads abroad her wings takes them bears them on her wings so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him  we have an example from addison which calls for dignity softened and impassioned by the most pathetic feeling of manly grief a feeling which very few have imagination to conceive happily and as few powers to express properly   it is rome demands our tears the mistress of the world the seat of empire the nurse of heroes the delight of gods that humbled the proud tyrants of the earth and set the nations free  rome is no more oh liberty oh virtue o my country               whatever the roman virtue had subdued the suns whole course the day and year are caesars for him the selfdevoted decii died the fabii fell and the great scipios

princess among the provinces how is she become tributary she weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all her losses she has none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they have become her enemies for these things i weep mine eye runs down with water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me my children are desolate because the enemy prevailed my eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people  of pathetic descriptive melancholy from shakespeare   of comfort no man speak let us talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let us choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbrokes and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as dust and cover to our bones for heavens sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the deaths of kings how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they dispossessed some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed all murdered  for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court  throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me ail this while i live on bread like you feel want like you taste grief need friends like you subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king k richard ii the following passage from otway should gradually warm into rapture  can there in woman be such glorious faith sure all ill stories of thy sex are false oh woman lovely woman nature made thee to temper man we had been brutes without you angels are painted fair to look like you there is in you all that we believe of heaven amazing brightness purity and truth eternal joy and everlasting love an instance of climax in vindictive rage we have in the following lines of young  yet ere i fall be it one part of vengeance to make even thee confess that i am just thou see a prince whose father thou have slain whose native country thou have laid in blood whose sacred person  oh thou have profaned whose reign extinguished what was left to me so highly born no

accept this dark opprobrious den of shame the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay  no let us rather choose armed with hellflames and fury all at once over heavens high towers to force resistless way turning our tortures into horrid arms against our torturer  when to meet the noise of his terrific engine he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage amongst his angels  and his throne itself mixed with tartarian sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments  but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with adverse

adverse  who but felt of late when our fierce foe hung on our broken rear insulting and pursued through the deep with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low the ascent is easy then  the event is feared  should we again provoke our enemy some worse way he may find to our destruction if there be in hell fear to be worse destroyed  what can be worse than to dwell here  driven out from bliss condemned from this abhorred deep to utter woe where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger when the scourge inexorable and the torturing

us and reduce to nothing this essential happier far than miserable to have eternal being or if our substance be indeed divine and cannot cease to be we are at worst on this side nothing and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heaven and with perpetual inroads to alarm though inaccessible his fatal throne which if not victory is yet revenge a climax of jealous rage shakespeare

our ground singeing its pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart any person who can do justice to these or similar passages either by genius or instruction may claim a sufficient knowledge of climax which however as well as emphasis is farther explained under the term modulation  if we consider the human voice through the whole extent of its several divisions we shall easily discover that nothing can require more the assistance of art to render it pleasing and expressive  the art of harmonious expression is distinguished by the term modulation for the better comprehending of which let us borrow a division from music countertenor tenor and base or upper medium and lower notes every one of these so far as reading and declamation extend may be found or created more or less perfectly in every voice according to the organs of utterance and the proper use of those organs it then remains properly to appropriate each of the divisions  to all plaintive amorous passages humble insinuation flattery and frequently to exclamations of joy and distractions the countertenor is most properly applied as will appear from the following examples first from otway in the plaintive strain  oh belvidera doubly i am a beggar undone by fortune and in debt to thee want worldly want that hungry meagre fiend is at my heels and chaces me in view can thou bear cold and hunger can these limbs framed for the tender offices of love endure the bitter gripes of smarting poverty when banished by our miseries abroad as suddenly we shall be to seek out in some far climate where our names are strangers for charitable succor  will thou then when in a bed of straw we shrink together and the bleak winds shall whistle round our heads will thou then talk thus to me will thou then hush my

soft murmurs interchange our souls together drink the crystal of the stream or taste the yellow fruit which autumn yields and when the golden evening calls us home wing to our downy nest and sleep till morn theodosius humility and insinuation are thus happily set forth by shakespeare  thus brutus did my master did me kneel thus did marc antony bid me fall down and being prostrate thus he bade me say brutus is noble valiant wise and honest caesar was mighty royal bold and loving say i love brutus and i honor him say i feared caesar honored him and loved him if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him and be resolved how caesar has deserved to lie in death marc antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith julius caesar dissimulation which requires the same tone of expression we find in these lines of young  it hurts not me my lord but

better too cleared from those errors which though born of virtue are such as may hereafter give you pain  revenge instances of exclamation in joy and rage are thus set forth by shakespeare   oh my souls joy if after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have wakened death and let the laboring bark climb hills of seas olympus high and duck again as low as hells from heaven   whip me ye devils from the possession of this heavenly sight blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire  othello of despair from sophocles  alas alas the truth now appears too plainly  oh light this is the last time i shall behold thee  alas alas wretched man where am i  whence comes it that my voice so suddenly fails me  oh fortune whither art thou

less sorrow to myself and friends i should neither have become the sanguine murderer of my father nor the incestuous husband of my mother  the preceding examples may suffice for the upper tones of voice which however should never be suffered to run into feigned squeaking or unnatural softness  the middle notes or tenor of expression suit all common narrations dissertations and those parts of declamation which do not touch upon the passions i presume it would be deemed superfluous to give various examples of what every book which presents itself for perusal calls for in general therefore i shall only transcribe one short passage from milton for the medium notes   know that in the soul are many lesser faculties that serve reason as chief among these fancy next her office holds of all external things which the five watchful senses represent she forms imaginations airy shapes which reason joining or disjoining frames all that we affirm or what deny and call our knowledge or opinion

vindictive rage  instance of gloomy reflection from young  whether first nature or long want of peace has wrought my mind to this i cannot tell but horrors now are not displeasing to me i like this rocking of the battlements rage on ye winds burst clouds and waters roar ye bear a just resemblance of my fortune and suit the gloomy habit of my soul revenge an example of horror we have in these lines of row   an universal horror struck through my eyes and chilled my very heart the cheerful day was every where shut out with care and left a more than midnight darkness such as might even be felt a few dim lamps that feebly lifted up their sickly heads looked faintly through the shade and made it seem more dismal by such light while those who waited in solemn sorrow mixed with wild amazement observed a dreadful silence instance of horror from shakespeare  is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee  i have thee not  and yet i see thee still art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight or art thou but a dagger of the mind  a false creation proceeding from the heat oppressed brain i see thee yet  in form as palpable as that which now i draw  thou marshalst me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use mine eyes are made the fools of the other senses or else worth all the rest  i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before  there is no such thing  it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes  now over one half the world nature seems dead  and wicked dreams abuse the curtaind sleep  now witchcraft celebrates pale hecates offerings and wiherd murder alarmed by his sentinel the wolf whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace with tarquins ravishing strides toward his design moves like a ghost  thou sound and firm set earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout and take the

following passages of enraged discontent from row claim the under notes of expression  come lead me to my dungeon plunge me down deep from the hated sight of man and day where under covert of the friendly darkness my soul may brood at leisure over her sorrows         i tell thee slave i have shook hands with hope and all my thoughts are rage despair and horror tamerlane these lines of the same author present us with cynical roughness and contempt   yes thou have thy sexs virtues their affectation pride ill nature noise proneness to change even from the joy that pleased them so gracious is your idol dear variety that for another love you would forego an angels form to mingle with a devils tamerlane picture of deep diffident cruelty from shakespeare  good friend thou have no cause to say so yet but thou shall have  and creep time never so slow yet it shall come for me to do thee good i had a thing to say  but let it go  the sun is in the heavens and the proud day attended by the pleasures of the world is all too wanton and too full of gauds to give me audience  if the midnight bell did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth sound one unto the drowsy race of night if this same were a churchyard where we stand or thou possessed with a thousand wrongs or if that surly spirit melancholy had baked thy blood and made it heavy thick which else runs tickling up and down the veins making the idiot laughter keep mens eyes and strain their cheeks with idle merriment a passion hateful to my purposes or if thou could see me without eyes hear me without thine ears and make reply without a tongue  using conceit alone  then in despite of broadeyd watchful day i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts  etc king john having thus given examples for each of the three divisions of voice it becomes necessary to remark that the variations in each are many and that the appropriations i have made are only meant in general there are certainly several exceptions but these must be left to the instructors or students discernment as entering into every particular would be if not impracticable at least intolerably tedious  pauses next present themselves to consideration and chiefly occur in meditation doubt or confusion no exact time can be fixed for them but they ought to be made longer or shorter according to the importance of the subject and in most especially passages of reflection the voice should have a tone of continuance which constitutes the difference between a pause and break the former is a gradual stop the latter a sudden check of expression  pauses of the first sort occur in the following lines of shakespeare and as the subject is of great weight should be of considerable duration perhaps while one could number six or a period and half to each  it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general  he would be crowned  how that might change his nature  there is the question  it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him  that  and then i grant we put a sting in him which at his will he may do danger with julius caesar or these lines from the same author  to be  or not to be  that is the question whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them  to die  to sleep  no more  and by that sleep to say we end the heartach and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to  it is a consummation devoutly to be wished  to die  to sleep  to sleep perchance to dream  ay there is the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause  hamlet pauses of confusion are shorter than those of reflection and are to be filled up with hesitative panting breath while every succeeding word or sentence varies in tone of expression from the former  instances from shakespeare as follow nay good lieutenant  alas gentlemen  help ho  lieutenant  sir  montano  help masters  here is a goodly watch indeed  who is that  who rings that bell  diablo  ho the town will rise  othello         yes it is emilia  by and by  she is dead it is like she comes to speak of cassios death the noise was high  ha no more moving  still as the grave  shall she come in were it good i think she stirs again  no  what is the best  othello  every discerning reader will readily perceive that the latter example is of a stronger but slower confusion than the former  breaks as i have before hinted are only pauses of a different nature more abrupt and sudden as when a passion cuts short before the meaning is fully explained these most frequently occur in violent grief and impetuous rage and the tone of voice alters as the passion rises or falls one general rule in the expression of grief is that when gradual the tones should swell pathetically but when sudden they should burst forth and break the voice still avoiding any dissonant scream or croak  in these lines of shakespeare we find pauses of grief swelling slowly and working upon themselves  i prithee daughter do not make me mad  i will not trouble thee my child  farewell  well meet no more  no more see one another  let shame come when it will i do not call it  i do not bid the thunderbearer strike nor tell tales of thee to avenging heaven mend when thou can  be better at thy leisure  i can be patient  i can stay with regan  king lear examples of breaks in impetuous rage as follow   darkness and devils  saddle my horses  call my train together  degenerate viper  i will not stay with thee i yet have left a daughter  serpent monster lessen my train and call em riotous all men approved  of choice and rarest parts that each particular of duty know   do thou understand me man the king would speak with cornwall  the dear father would with his daughter speak  commands her service are they informed of this  my breath and blood  fiery  the fiery duke  tell the hot duke that  no  but not yet may be he is not well  king lear having thus particularly and distinctly explained the proper application of the three grand divisions of the voice in order to bring what has been said into a narrow compass and to place it in one point of view i shall produce for an example the seven ages of shakespeare and mark the lines according to the variations which agreeable to the foregoing observations ought to be made in speaking or in reading this passage the countertenor or upper notes i distinguish by italics the tenor or medium retain the common type and the base is marked by capitals  all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and each man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages  first the infant mewling and pewking in the nurses arms and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school  and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow  then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like a pard jealous in honor  sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lined with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shanks and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in the sound  last scene of all which ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing every emphasis and variation of voice should be founded on reason it may be proper therefore to show why the several parts of the preceding lines are thus distinguished in the first age of infancy the upper notes are most descriptive of that tender time as they are also of the whimpering schoolboy and their softness likewise suits the sighing of the lover the forward confidence of the soldier demands a fullspirited medium and the corpulent importance generally imputed to magistracy is well pictured by the jolly swell of the base notes while the feebleness of fast declining age calls for the countertenor tremulated as it were with weakness  thus much for general explanation which i have delivered in as full and clear a manner as the nature of my design would possibly admit and having set forth such examples as explained by teachers or carefully investigated by students may give a full idea of what is intended i shall proceed to some brief remarks upon utterance and action in which though it is not probable that many will excel yet most may be improved  first then if a voice is naturally harsh great care should be taken to avoid guttural expression nor should the tongue be allowed to play too much between the teeth the breath drawn as it were from the stomach and vibrated upon within the mouth will soften harsh notes and render them much more tuneable on the contrary a weak shrill voice should borrow solidity and force from the throat as too great an expansion of the lips is disgraceful to the features so unnatural contraction of them will render expression unmeaning and imperfect  stops and cadences are a most essential point of consideration and cannot be better set forth than in the following remarks of a french author it is necessary for us says he to respire from time to time but the voice does not repose equally at the conclusion of every sense in a sentence of considerable length we respire at every comma but this short pause is made in such a manner as to show by the tone of continuance that we are to go farther the ear remaining unsatisfied because the pronunciation continues suspended till the sentence is completely finished as for example at such a time the king having taken these matters into consideration determined here attention is inquisitive to know what follows the colon and semicolon are marks of more considerable respiration yet still leave judgment in suspense till the period unfolds the whole and calls for a concluding cadence in every part or parts of a sentence there is elevation and depression of the voice which never absolutely reposes but at the conclusion of a period all other respiration being of continuance    there is undoubtedly much judgment in the composition of harmonious and comprehensive periods a dissonant unconnected style will take greatly from the beauty and force of expression as a discordant piece of music must disgrace a performance of the ablest master and injure the utterance of the most perfect instruments  frequent use strengthens and meliorates the organs of expression and practice will teach a most essential point that of pitching the voice to any place or number of persons there is considerable nicety in knowing the different effect which the same notes of voice may have in places of equal dimensions but of different construction of a place containing but few auditors or thronged with a large number and this point of excellence must be attained by much practice and observation only thus much may be observed in general of the operations of sound that where it undulates considerably the louder a reader or declaimer goes beyond the just pitch the more indistinct he will be of which we find very frequent instances in cathedral churches a full audience in any place will require at least twice the force of expression of a thin one which exclusive of some buzz that must unavoidably attend a numerous assembly may be philosophically accounted for by an essential density of air from the conjunct respiration of so many people  the voice being pitched and modulated through the several variations which may be found necessary it remains to consider to comprehend and to feel the subject without which expression must be languid unaffecting and wearisome what we read or speak unfelt must be like painting without light or shade there may be just symmetry of parts and good coloring but unless they are raised and brought forward both pall on the view and die upon the canvass  spirit and feeling are necessary to idea as well as to sight for which reason teachers should not only make their pupils understand every word they read but their general sense in a state of connection a point of care seldom attended to  emphatic expression feeling and taste are particularly essential to poetry as that in general appeals oftener to the passions than any other species of writing cadences also are more critical in numbers than in prose in both they should be smooth gradual and die away almost insensibly yet so as to preserve and to impress the last syllable both upon the ear and mind without snapping short the breath or sound which is extremely grating to a judicious hearer  how often is verse of every kind miserably mangled a sort of unmeaning pedantic recitative tedious from a repetition of misplaced unharmonious tones is substituted for dignity thus we find many who make a tolerable shift with prose the moment they see any number of measured syllables throw aside nature reason nay even common sense to display their knowledge of versification and what they think its peculiar importance  what can be more absurd genuine poetry needs no pompous affectation to dignify it for as by transposing the words you cannot reduce it to prose neither can you take from its harmony by plain natural expression  i know not any thing which has done our language and the reading of it more injury than the gingle of rhyme especially that which is thrown into heroic measure it being certain that the more correct an author in that way is the more he will lead to monotony instance mr pope who has been so critically exact in accenting particular syllables that very few of his pieces can be read with any tolerable variation of voice for which reason i would have learners kept from rhyme in heroic measure till they are well grounded in a just mode of utterance indeed we are not to wonder that the generality chaunt verse in so lamentable a manner when some of those who have sketched rules for reading insist upon such a servile obedience to the author as not only to change the accented syllable but even to favor his bad rhyme with false pronunciation for example to sound the last syllable of liberty as an exact rhyme either to flee or fly  to prescribe a stop or half pause at the end of a line whether the sense requires it or not is another rule that has been given equally erroneous and disgustful  in reading properly so called action has no concern but declamation is very defective without it yet except upon the stage and among many there miserably methodized we scarce find any  when i recommend action i would not be supposed to intend that a speaker should be in continual motion or that puppetlike he is to lift up first one hand and then another merely to lay them down again  no  i would have motions few easy graceful and for my own part i know not how a declaimer can possibly feel and stand stockstill but admit the possibility of this i will venture to say there is but little probability that his audience will think him in earnest i know that some delicate persons are afraid of becoming too theatrical but there is a very wide difference between the action of an orator and an actor unless when the latter judiciously represents the former but i shall no further urge the necessity of a point so obvious let us proceed to the thing itself  first then action should be entirely reserved for those passages which contain somewhat interesting or important as demonstration or the enforcing of a charge this should be attended with the right arm stretched forward to the full extent the fingers even and the palm of the hand downwards or sometimes the hand turned sideways the fore finger only pointing if the circumstance demonstrated or given in charge be very momentous the well known and admired action of st paul preaching at athens stretching forth both arms palms downwards has much force and propriety  where grief is to be expressed the right hand laid slowly to the left breast the head and chest bending forward is a just indication of it to express confidence and resolution the same hand must move to the same place but with quickness and vigor recoiling as it were from the heart which thereby seems to meet it with this action the head should be thrown back and the chest forward the expression of ardent affection is to close both hands warmly at half arms length the fingers intermingling and to bring them to the breast with spirit if expansion of mind or any thing similar is to be pointed out then both arms should be cast different ways in a parallel line and the chest thrown open folding arms with a drooping of the head describe contemplation erection of the head speaks dignity or with suitable features contempt there are some few other instances of action which may be graceful and serves for variation though not absolutely necessary but these must be left to the choice and discretion of the declaimer and to the unconstrained operation of judicious feeling only thus much it may be necessary to observe that the left hand should seldom or never be used by itself and that all action should move between the tip of the shoulder and the seat of the heart all above is what shakespeare justly styles sawing the air all below both unmeaning and ungraceful upon the whole every motion should be the natural attendant of what is spoken if an extreme cannot be avoided i would rather recommend no action than too much or than such as must offend judicious eyes  attitudes or positions of the body when happily struck off and well applied are not only picturesque but striking all description of them with a pen must be faint and confused wherefore we refer to the pencil of some able painter  to what has been already offered we shall subjoin some useful remarks from an ingenious treatise on the art of speaking  if nature unassisted could form the eminent speaker where were the use of art and culture which no one pretends to question art is but nature improved upon and refined and before improvement is applied genius is but a mass of ore in the mine without luster and without value because unknown and unthought of the ancients used to procure masters for pronunciation from the theaters and had youth taught gesture and attitude by the palaestritae who taught much the same among them as dancingmasters do among us  it is well when a youth has no natural impediment or defect in his specch and i should by no means advise that he who has be brought up to any profession requiring elocution yet there are instances of natural defects surmounted and eminent speakers formed by indefatigable diligence in spite of them demosthenes when he began to study rhetoric could not pronounce the first letter of the name of that art and cicero was longnecked and narrow chested but diligent labor in what we are earnest upon surmounts all difficulties that are not too deeply rooted in nature for want of proper application we are frequently disgusted by public speakers lisping stammering and speaking through the nose pronouncing the letter k with the throat instead of the tongue s like th and screaming above or croaking below all natural pitch of human voice  some unexperienced attempters at oratory mumble as if they were conjuring up spirits others bawl as loud as street hawkers some so precipitate in expression that no ear can distinguish others drag words like the heavy pauses of a great clock striking some have got a disagreeable habit of shrugging up their shoulders others of seesawing their bodies backwards and forwards or from side to side some open their mouths frightfully others keep their teeth so close as if the jaws were set all which with many other bad disgraceful habits should either be got the better of in early life or the young persons put into some other path than that of public speaking neglect of this occasions such confirmation of deficiency that not one speaker in twenty knows what to do with his hands voice or eyes  some actors who should most particularly apply to feeling and attention who should most strictly regard decorum are guilty of monstrous improprieties as to management of the eyes in particular to look full at the audience when speaking a soliloquy or a speech aside is intolerable a performer should not in theatrical station seem conscious of an audience or that there is a spectator looking on and one peculiar fault in performers is that they dont in general keep a fixed eye on those they speak to even in impassioned dialogue from whatever cause we may derive this disgraceful enfeebling inattention it is severely censurable    it being far beyond the limits of our design to enter upon the general minutiae of our subject we refer our readers for a circumstantial description of the effects which various affections and passions have upon the human features to the studious treatise we have just now quoted from published by longman and buckland paternoster row though we think great part of it more curious than useful for where the mind by nature or representation properly feels the features will operate consonantly if words and looks are contrary no sympathy can be gained in which case the main point is lost
