poetical calendar april an ode to woo green april lo the sun that very form which jove put on to bear europa from her native land assumes to win the queen of showers a newblown primrose decks her hand her taper waist a zone of flowers like a young widow she appears shining through shades and beautiful in tears now genial nature every seed opens to grace the vernal mead the lark now ventures up the sapphire skies though zephyr shakes his madid wing yet warmth awakes the embryo flies to creep and meet parental spring when lo a shower of drizzling rain or drowns or drives them to their nests again prolific mists over every rill preside and shade the distant hill a tepid moisture gladdens every root the husbandmen now pole and bind the hops and bid the tendrils shoot thus guarded from the southern wind while every vegetative power imbibes young aprils soft balsamic shower mark how each months unwearied toil successive clothes or strips the soil from heat to cold they traverse through the sky and yet unerring is the plan and regular from hot to dry the calendar of social man in no one track the steps appear yet all to one united center steer w  an ode stern winter now by spring repressed forbears the longcontinued strife and nature on her naked breast delights to catch the gales of life now over the rural kingdom roves soft pleasure with her laughing train love warbles in the vocal groves and vegetation paints the plain unhappy whom to beds of pain arthritic tyranny consigns whom smiling nature courts in vain though rapture sings and beauty shines yet though my limbs disease invades her wings imagination tries and bears me to the peaceful shades where  s humble turrets rise here stop my soul thy rapid flight nor from the pleasing groves depart where first great nature charmed my sight where wisdom first informed my heart here let me through the vales pursue a guide a father and a friend once more great natures works review once more on wisdoms voice attend from false caresses causeless strife wild hope vain fear alike removed here let me learn the use of life then best enjoyed when most improved teach me thou venerable bower cool meditations quiet seat the generous scorn of venal power the silent grandeur of retreat when pride by guilt to greatness climbs or raging factions rush to war here let me learn to shun the crimes i cannot prevent and will not share but lest i fall by subtler foes bright wisdom teach me curios art the swelling passions to compose and quell the rebels of the heart spring an ode by w woty redeunt jam gramina campis arboribusque comae hor a gain the blossomed hedge is seen the turf again is dressed in smiling green again the lark ascends the sky winnows the air and lessens on the eye the swallow that the meads forsook revisits now and skims along the brook the daw to steepletop upsprings and the rook spreads his ventilating wings the feathered tribe on every spray chant lively carols to the vernal day each lengthening morns diurnal light beams fresher beauties on the raptured sight the leaves hang clustering on the trees and health comes riding on the tepid breeze wherever the goddess fans her way creation feels her universal sway the garden moist with april showers teems with a family of laughing flowers not even a ray or drop of rain but what impregnates or that shines in vain yet though the bounteous hand of heaven all good this liberality has given beyond our wishes amply kind ingratitude still stains the human mind man sees around celestial power and thankless tastes the blessings of

sunny glade where sage contentment builds her seat and peace attends the calm retreat my soul responsive hails the scene attund to joy and peace within but musing on the liberal hand that scatters blessings over the land that gives for man with power divine the earth to teem the sun to shine my grateful mind with rapture burns and pleasure to devotion turns the african prince now in england to zara at his fathers court wrote in the year mdccxlix princes my fair unfortunately great born to the pompous vassalage of state whenever the public calls are doomed to fly domestic bliss and break the private tie fame pays with empty breath the toils they bear and loves soft joys are changed for glorious care yet conscious virtue in the silent hour rewards the hero with a nobler dower for this alone i dared the roaring sea yet more for this i dared to part with thee but while my bosom feels the nobler flame still unreprovd it owns thy gentler claim though virtues awful form my soul approves it is thine thine only zara that it loves a private lot had made the claim but one the prince alone must love for virtue shun ah why distinguished from the happier crowd to me the bliss of millions disallowed why was i singled for imperial sway since love and duty point a different way fixed the dread voyage and the day decreed when dutys victim love was doomed to bleed too well my memory can those scenes renew we met to sigh to weep our last adieu that conscious palm beneath whose towering shade so often our vows of mutual love were made where hope so often anticipated joy and planned of future years the blessed employ that palm was witness to the tears we shed when that fond hope and all those joys were fled thy trembling lips with trembling lips i pressed and held thee panting to my panting breast our sorrow grown too mighty to sustain now snatched us fainting from the sense of pain together sinking in the trance divine i caught thy fleeting soul and gave thee mine o blessed oblivion of tormenting care o why recalled to life and to despair the dreadful summons came to part  and why why not the kinder summons but to die to die together were to part no more to land in safety on some peaceful shore where loves the business of immortal life and happy spirits only guess at strife  if in some distant land my prince should find  some nymph more fair you cried as zara kind  mysterious doubt which could at once impart relief to mine and anguish to thy heart still let me triumph in the fear expressed the voice of love that whispered in thy breast nor call me cruel for my truth shall prove twas but the vain anxiety of love torn from thy fond embrace the strand i gain where mourning friends inflict superfluous pain my father there his struggling sighs suppressed and in dumb anguish clasped me to his breast then sought concealed the conflict of his mind to give the fortitude he could not find each lifetaught precept kindly he renewed  thy countrys good said he be still pursued  if when the gods shall here my son restore  these eyes shall sleep in death to wake no more  if then these limbs that now in age decay  shall mouldering mix with earths parental clay  round my green tomb perform the sacred rite  assume my throne and let thy yoke be light  from lands of freedom glorious precepts bring  and reign at once a father and a king how vainly proud the arrogantly great presume to boast a monarchs godlike state subject alike the peasant and the king to lifes dark ills and cares corroding sting from guilt and fraud that strikes in silence sure no shield can guard us and no arms secure by these my fair subdued thy prince was lost a naked captive on a barbarous coast nurtured in ease a thousand servants round my wants prevented and my wishes crowned no painful labors stretched the tedious day on downy feet my moments danced away wherever i looked officious courtiers bowed wherever i passed a shouting people crowd no fears intruded on the joys i knew each man my friend my lovely mistress you what dreadful change abandoned and alone the shouted prince is now a slave unknown to watch his eye no bending courtiers wait no hailing crowds proclaim his regal state a slave condemned with unrewarded toil to turn from morn to eve a burning soil fainting beneath the suns meridian heat roused by the scourge the taunting jest i meet thanks to thy friends they cry whose care recalls a prince to life in whom a nation falls unwholesome scraps my strength but half sustained from corners gleaned and even by dogs disdained at night i mingled with a wretched crew who by long use with woe familiar grew of manners brutish merciless and rude they mocked my sufferings and my pangs renewed in groans not sleep i passed the weary night and rose to labor with the morning light yet thus of dignity and ease beguiled thus scorned and scourged insulted and reviled if heaven with thee my faithful arms had blessed and filled with love my intervals of rest short though they were my soul had never known one secret wish to glitter on a throne the toilsome day had heard no sigh of mine nor stripes nor scorn had urged me to repine a monarch still beyond a monarch blessed thy love my diadem my throne thy breast my courtiers watchful of my looks thy eyes should shine persuade and flatter and advise thy voice my music and thy arms should be  ah not the prison of a slave in me could i with infamy content remain and wish thy lovely form to share my chain could this bring ease forgive the unworthy thought and let the love that sinned atone the fault could i a slave and hopeless to be free crawl tamely recent from the scourge to thee thy blooming beauties could these arms embrace my guilty joys enslave an infant race no rather blast me lightnings whirlwind tear and drive these limbs in atoms through the air rather than this o curse me still with life and let my zara smile a rivals wife be mine alone the accumulated woe nor let me propagate my curse below but from this dreadful scene with joy i turn to trust in heaven of me let zara learn the wretch the sordid hypocrite that sold his charge an unsuspecting prince for gold that justice marked whose eyes can never sleep and death commissioned smote him on the deep the generous crew their port in safety gain and tell my mournful tale nor tell in vain the king with horror of the atrocious deed in haste commanded and the slave was freed no more britannias cheek the blush of shame burns for my wrongs her king restores her fame propitious gales to freedoms happy shore waft me triumphant and the prince restore whatever is great and gay around me shine and all the splendour of a court is mine and knowledge here by piety refined sheds a blessed radiance over my brightening mind from earth i travel upward to the sky i learn to live to reign yet more to die o i have tales to tell of love divine  such blissful tidings they shall soon be thine i long to tell thee what amazed i see what habits buildings trades and polity how art and nature vie to entertain in public shows and mix delight with pain o zara here a story like my own with mimic skill in borrowed names was shown an indian chief like me by fraud betrayed and partner in his woes an indian maid i cannot recall the scenes it is pain too great and if recalled should shudder to relate to write the wonders here i strive in vain each word would ask a thousand to explain the time shall come o speed the lingering hour when zaras charms shall lend description power when placed beside thee in the cool alcove or through the green savannahs as we rove the frequent kiss shall interrupt the tale and looks shall speak my sense though language fail then shall the prodigies that round me rise fill thy dear bosom with a sweet surprise then all my knowledge to thy faithful heart with danger gained securely i will impart methinks i see thy changing looks express the alternate sense of pleasure and distress as all the windings of my fate i trace and wing thy fancy swift from place to place yet where alas has flattering thought conveyed the ravished lover with his darling maid between us still unmeasured oceans roll which hostile barks infest and storms control be calm my bosom since the unmeasured main and hostile barks and storms are gods domain he rules resistless and his power shall guide my life in safety over the roaring tide shall bless the love that is built on virtues base and spare me to evangelize my race farewell thy prince still lives and still is free farewell hope all things and remember me zara at the court of anamaboe to the african prince now in england should i the language of my heart conceal nor warmly paint the passion that i feel my rising wish should groundless fears confine and doubts ungenerous chill the glowing line would not my prince with nobler warmth disdain that love as languid which could stoop to feign let guilt dissemble  in my faithful breast love reigns unblamd and be that love confessed i give my bosom naked to thy view for what has shame with innocence to do in fancy now i clasp thee to my heart exchange my vows and all my joys impart i catch new transport from thy speaking eye  but whence this sad involuntary sigh why pants my bosom with intruding fears why from my eyes distill unbidden tears why do my hands thus tremble as i write why fades thy loved idea from my sight o art thou safe on britains happy shore from winds that bellow and from seas that roar and has my prince  oh more than mortal pain betrayed by ruffians felt the captives chain bound were those limbs ordained alone to prove the toils of empire and the sweets of love hold hold barbarians of the fiercest kind fear heavens red lightning  it is a prince ye bind a prince whom no indignities could hide they knew presumptuous and the gods defied wherever he moves let lovejoind reverence rise and all mankind behold with zaras eyes thy breast alone when bounding over the waves to freedoms climes from slavery and slaves thy breast alone the pleasing thought could frame of what i felt when thy dear letters came a thousand times i held them to my breast a thousand times my lips the paper pressed my full heart panted with a joy too strong and oh my prince died faltering on my tongue fainting i sunk unequal to the strife and milder joys sustained returning life hope sweet enchantress round my lovesick head delightful scenes of blessed delusion spread  come come my prince my charmer haste away  come come i cried thy zara blames thy stay  for thee the shrubs their richest sweets retain  for thee new colors wait to paint the plain  for thee cool breezes linger in the grove  the birds expect thee in the green alcove  till thy return the rills forget to fall  till thy return the sun the soul of all   he comes my maids in his meridian charms  he comes refulgent to his zaras arms  with jocund songs proclaim my loves return  with jocund hearts his nuptial bed adorn  bright as the sun yet gentle as the dove  he comes uniting majesty and love  too soon alas the blessed delusion flies care swells my breast and sorrow fills my eyes ah why do thy fond words suggest a fear  too vast too numerous those already here ah why with doubts torment my bleeding breast of seas that storms control and foes infest my heart in all this tedious absence knows no thoughts but those of seas and storms and foes each joyless morning with the rising sun quick to the strand my feet spontaneous run  where where is my prince what tidings have ye brought of each i met with pleading tears i sought in vain i sought  some conscious of my pain with horrid silence pointed to the main some with a sneer the brutal thought expressed and plunged the dagger of a barbarous jest day followed day and still i wished the next new hopes still flattered and new doubts perplexed day followed day the wished tomorrow came my hopes doubts fears anxieties the same at length  o power supreme whoever thou art  thy shrine the sky the sea the earth or heart  since every clime and all the unbounded main  and hostile barks and storms are thy domain  if faithful passion can thy bounty move  and goodness sure must be the friend of love  safe to these arms my lovely prince restore  safe to his zaras arms to part no more  o grant to virtue thy protecting care  and grant thy love to loves availing prayer  together then and emulous to praise  a flowery altar to thy name well raise  there first and last on each returning day  to thee our vows of gratitude well pay fool that i was to all my comfort blind why when thou went did zara stay behind how could i fondly hope one joy to prove midst all the wild anxieties of love had fate in other mold thy zara formed and my bold breast in manly friendship warmed how had i glowed exulting at thy side how all the shafts of adverse fate defied or yet a woman and not nervd for toil oh that with thee i would turned a burning soil in the cold prison had i lain with thee in love still happy we had still been free then fortune braved had owned superior might and pined with envy while we forced delight why should thou bid thy love remember thee thine all my thoughts have been and still shall be each night the cool savannahs have i sought and breathed the fondness of enamored thought the curling breezes murmured as i sighed and hoarse at distance roared my foe the tide my breast still haunted by a motley train now doubts now hopes prevailed now joy now pain now fixed i stand my spirit fled to thine nor note the time nor see the sun decline now roused i start and winged with fear i run in vain alas for it is myself i shun when kindly sleep its lenient balm supplied and gave that comfort waking thought denied last night  but why ah zara why impart the fond fond fancies of a lovesick heart yet true delights on fancys wings are brought and loves soft raptures realizd in thought  last night i saw methinks i see it now  heavens awful concave round thy zara bow when sudden thence a flaming chariot flew which earth received and fix white coursers drew then  quick transition  did thy zara ride borne to the chariot  wondrous  by thy side all glorious both from clime to clime we flew each happy clime with sweet surprise we view a thousand voices sung  all bliss betide  the prince of lybia and his faithful bride  it is done it is done resounded through the skies and quick aloft the car began to rise ten thousand beauties crowded on my sight ten thousand glories beamed a dazzling light my thoughts could bear no more the vision fled and wretched zara viewed her lonely bed  come sweet interpreter and ease my soul come to my bosom and explain the whole alas my prince  yet hold my struggling breast sure we shall meet again again be blessed  hope all thou say i live and still am free oh then prevent those hopes and haste to me ease all the doubts thy zaras bosom knows and kindly stop the torrent of her woes  but that i know too well thy generous heart one doubt than all more torment would impart it is this in britains happy courts to shine amidst a thousand blooming maids is thine  but thou a thousand blooming maids among art still thyself incapable of wrong no outward charm can captivate thy mind thy love is friendship heightened and refined it is what my soul and not my form inspires and burns with spotless and immortal fires thy joys like mine from conscious truth arise and known these joys what others can thou prize be jealous doubts the curse of sordid minds hence jealous doubts i give ye to the winds  once more o come and snatch me to thy arms come shield my beating heart from vain alarms come let me hang enamored on thy breast weep pleasing tears and be with joy distressed let me still hear and still demand thy tale and often renewed still let my suit prevail much still remains to tell and to enquire my hand still writes and writing prompts desire my pen denies my last farewell to write still still return my wishful thoughts indite oh hear my prince thy love thy mistress call think over each tender name and hear by all oh pleasing intercourse of soul with soul thus while i write i see i clasp thee whole and these kind letters trembling zara drew in every line shall bring her to thy view return return in love and truth excel return i write i cannot add farewell abelard to eloisa the editor of poems by eminent ladies in two vol   mo printed for r baldwin in      have ascribed this poem to mrs madan and paid her handsome compliments upon it whereas mr pattison late of sidney coll camb is undoubtedly the author it being printed among his poems which were published ad      in the memoirs of his life prefixed to his poems page    there is likewise a letter dated york oct  0      wherein this poem is mentioned as pattisons and much commended  by mr william pattison in my dark cell low prostrate on the ground mourning my crimes thy letter entrance found too soon my soul the wellknown name confessed my beating heart sprung fiercely in my breast through my whole frame a guilty transport glowed and streaming torrents from my eyes fast flowed o eloisa art thou still the same do thou still nourish this destructive flame have not the gentle rules of peace and heaven from thy soft soul this fatal passion driven alas i thought thee disengaged and free and can thou still still sigh and weep for me what powerful deity what hallowed shrine can save me from a love and faith like thine where shall i fly when not this awful cave whose rugged feet the surging billows lave when not these gloomy cloisters solemn walls over whose rough sides the languid ivy crawls when my dread vows in vain their force oppose opposed to love  alas how vain are vows in fruitless penitence i wear away each tedious night each sad revolving day i fast i pray and with deceitful art veil thy dear image from my tortured heart my tortured heart conflicting passions move i hope despair repent  yet still i love a thousand jarring thoughts my bosom tear for thou not god o eloise art there to the false worlds deluding pleasures dead nor longer by its wandering fires misled in learned disputes harsh precepts i infuse and give that counsel i want power to use the rigid maxims of the grave and wise have quenched each milder sparkle of my eyes each lovely feature of this wellknown face by grief reversed assumes a sterner grace o eloisa should the fates once more indulgent to my view thy charms restore how would thou from my arms with horror start to miss the form familiar to thy heart naught could thy quick thy piercing judgment see to speak thy abelard  but love of thee lean abstinence pale grief and haggard care the dire attendants of forlorn despair have abelard the young the gay removed and in the hermit sunk the man you loved wrapped in the gloom these holy mansions shed the thorny paths of penitence i tread lost to the world from all its interests free and torn from all my soul held dear in thee ambition with its train of frailties gone all love all forms forgot but thine alone amid the blaze of day the dusk of night my eloisa rises to my sight veiled as in paracletes secluded towers the wretched mourner counts the lagging hours i hear her sighs see the swiftfalling tears weep all her griefs and pine with all her cares o vows o convents your stern force impart and frown the melting phantom from my heart let other sighs a worthier sorrow show let other tears for sin repentant flow low to the earth my guilty eyes i roll and humble to the dust my contrite soul forgiving power thy gracious call i meet who first empowered this rebel heart to beat who through this trembling this offending frame for nobler ends diffused lifes active flame o change the temper of this laboring breast and form anew each beating pulse to rest let springing grace fair faith and hope remove the fatal traces of destructive love destructive love from its warm mansion tear and leave no tracks of eloisa there are these the wishes of my inmost soul would i its softest tenderest sense control would i this touched this glowing heart refine to the cold substance of that marble shrine transformed like these pale swarms that round me move of blessed insensibles  who know not love ah rather let me keep this hapless flame adieu false honor unavailing fame not your harsh rules but tender love supplies the streams that gush from my despairing eyes i feel the traitor melt around my heart and through my veins with treacherous influence dart inspire me heaven assist me grace divine aid me ye saints unknown to crimes like mine you who on earth serene all griefs could prove all but the torturing pangs of hopeless love a holier rage in your pure bosoms dwelt nor can you pity what you never felt a sympathizing grief alone can cure the hand that heals must feel what i endure thou eloise alone can give me ease and bid my struggling soul subside to peace restore me to my longlost heaven of rest and take thyself from my reluctant breast if crimes like mine could an allay receive that blessed allay thy wondrous charms must give thy form that first to love my heart inclined still wanders in my lost my guilty mind i saw thee as the newblown blossoms fair sprightly as light and soft as summers air bright as their beams thy eyes a mind disclose while on thy lips gay blushed the fragrant rose wit youth and beauty in each feature shone pressed by my fate i gazed  and was undone there died the generous fire whose vigorous flame enlarged my soul and urged me on to fame nor fame nor wealth my softened heart could move my heart insensible to all but love snatched from myself my learning tasteless grew vain my philosophy opposed to you a train of woes succeed nor should we mourn the hours which cannot ought not to return as once to love i swayed thy yielding mind too fond alas  too fatally inclined to virtue now let me thy breast inspire and fan with zeal divine the holy fire teach thee to injured heaven allchangd to turn and bid thy soul with sacred raptures burn o that my own example could impart this noble warmth to thy soft trembling heart that mine with pious undissembled care might aid the latent virtue struggling there alas i rave nor grace nor zeal divine burns in a breast overwhelmed with crimes like mine too sure i find while i the tortures prove of feeble piety conflicting love on black despair my forced devotion built absence to me has sharper pangs than guilt ah yet my eloise your charms i view yet breathe my sighs my tears yet pour for you each weak resistance stronger knits my chain i sigh weep love despair repent  in vain haste eloisa haste your lover free amidst your warmer prayers o think of me wing with your rising zeal my grovelling mind and let me mine from your repentance find ah labor strive your love yourself control the change will sure affect my kindred soul in blessed consent our purer sighs shall grieve and heaven assisting shall our crimes forgive but if unhappy wretched lost in vain faintly the unequal combat you sustain if not to heaven you feel your bosom rise nor tears refined fall contrite from your eyes if still your heart its wonted passions move if still to speak all pains in one  you love deaf to the weak essays of living breath attend the stronger eloquence of death when that kind power this captive soul shall free which only then can cease to dote on thee when gently sunk to my eternal sleep the paraclete my peaceful urn shall keep then eloisa then your lover view see his quenched eyes no longer fixed on you from their dead orbs that tender utterance flown which first to yours my hearts soft tale made known this breast no more at length to ease consigned pant like the waving aspin in the wind see all my wild tumultuous passions over and you amazing change beloved no more behold the destined end of human love  but let the sight your zeal alone improve let not your conscious soul to sorrow moved recall how much how tenderly i loved with pious care your fruitless grief restrain nor let a tear your sacred veil profane nor even a sigh on my cold urn bestow but let your breast with newborn raptures glow let love divine frail mortal love dethrone and to your mind immortal joys make known let heaven relenting strike your ravished view and still the bright the blessed pursuit renew so with your crimes shall your misfortunes cease and your racked soul be calmly hushed to peace rosamond to henry an epistle by the same qualis populea moerens philomela sub umbra flet noctem ramoque sedens miserabile carmen integrat et moestis late loca questibus implet virg georg from these lone shades and evergloomy bowers once the dear scenes of henrys softer hours what tender strains of passion can impart the pangs of absence to an amorous heart far far too faint the powers of language prove language that slow interpreter of love souls paired like ours like ours to union wrought converse by silent sympathy of thought o then by that mysterious art divine the wild impatience of my breast by thine and to conceive what i would say to thee conceive my love what thou would say to me as in the tenderness of soul i sigh methinks i hear thy tender soul reply and as in thought over heaps of heroes slain i trace thy progress on the fatal plain perhaps thy thought explores me through the grove and softening steals an interval of love in the deep covert of a bowering shade describes my posture  languishingly laid now sadly solacd with the murmuring springs now melting into tears the softest things and how the feigned ideas all agree so bowers the shade so melt my tears for thee here as in eden once we blissful lay how often night stole unheeded on the day our softbreathd raptures charmed the listening grove and all was harmony for all was love but hark the trumpet sounds see discords rise it is honor calls from me my henry flies honor to him more bright than rosamondas eyes not thus my honor with his passion strove his sighs i pitied and indulged his love he then cried honor was an empty name  and love a sweeter recompense than fame oh had i lived in some obscure retreat securely fair and innocently sweet how had i blessed some humble shepherds arms how kept my fame as spotless as my charms then had thou never beheld these eyes of mine nor they bewailed the fatal power of thine dear fatal power to me for ever dear  fixed in my tender breast and rooted there for ever in my tender breast remain  and be for ever a delightful pain with what surprise those glories first i viewed that in one moment my whole heart subdued with such resistless beams so fierce they shone not such the dazzling radiance of thy crown sent from thy crown i never felt a dart the lover not the monarch won my heart nor ever the monarch with such charms appears as when the lovers softened dress he wears as when he silent deigns my breast to seek and looks such language as no tongue can speak whenever my crimes if love a crime can be if it is a crime to live and die for thee in hideous forms arise and cloud my soul one thought of henry can that gloom control no more my breast alternate passions move the frosts of honor melt before the fires of love again i must repeat that fatal hour which snatched my henry from his woodstock bower when mad bellona with tumultuous cries the hero roused and drowned the lovers sighs stretched on my downy couch at ease i lay and sought by reading to beguile the day with amorous strains i soothed a grateful fire and all the woman glowed with soft desire till as i wished i heard the vocal breeze proclaim my henry rustling through the trees oerjoyd i ran to meet thy longing arms and taste a dear remembrance of thy charms but soon i saw some sad concealed surprise fade on thy cheeks and languish on thine eyes through each dissembled smile a sorrow stole and whispered out the secret of thy soul what this could mean uncertain to divine no fault i knew yet feared some fault was mine but soon thy love dispelled those airy fears dispelled alas  but brought too solid cares for as with hands entwined in hands we walked of love and hapless lovers still thou talked thy tears of pity answered each sad moan and in their seeming miseries wept thy own  i cannot leave her  i oerheard thee say  pierced to the soul i sunk and died away what art restored me thou alone can tell for thy kind arms embraced me as i fell my opening eyes fixed on thy beauties hung and my ears drank the cordial of thy tongue again my thoughts return with killing pain within thy arms i sink and swoon again again thou do my sweet physician prove from death to life alternately i move now dead by anguish now revived by love but when without disguise the truth i found my agonizing sorrows knew no bound my locks i tore then allintrancd i lay till by degrees my grief to words gave way and soft i cried  oh stay my henry stay  one moment more  add yet  and yet a kiss   oh give me thine and take my soul in this  farewell  perhaps farewell for ever  oh  who can sustain so dire a weight of woe ah wretched maid  alas a maid no more no herbs that spotless title can restore ah who shall now protect thy injured fame who shield thy weakness from the assaults of shame who lull thy anxious soul to balmy rest if henry dearest henry flies thy breast yet though he flies your wings ye angels spread and hover guardians over my henrys head who knows but this kind prayer is poured too late and he already struggles with his fate already wounded pants and gasps in death and rosamonda is his latest breath propitious heaven vouchsafe a gracious ear grant these be only phantoms of my fear heaven still is gracious if true suppliants pray and lo  the foul chimeras fleet away transporting prospects to my wishes rise beam on my soul and brighten in my eyes he lives he lives i see his banner spread and laurels wreathed round the gay victors head ye winds convey the news to albions floods ye floods resound it to the joyous woods ye joyous woods your tuneful choirs prepare to hail my hero from the toils of war delusive scenes too beautiful to stay they fade in visionary streaks away alas no lovely henry now is nigh his genius took his form to sooth my eye no more i seem his melting voice to hear peace babbling fountains nor abuse my ear ye flowers ye streams ye gales no longer move for ah how strong is fancy joined with love o frail inconstancy of mortal state one hour dejected and the next elate raised by false hopes or by false fears deprest how different passions sway the human breast now smiling pleasures with fair charms invite now frowning horrors with black trains affright future distrusts the present joys control and fancy triumphs over the reasoning soul as mid the trees i solitary rove the trees awake some image of my love wherever their arms in amorous foldings join my longing arms i spread to fold in thine the beauteous flowers thy face reflected bear if flowers in beauty may with thee compare their wafted fragrancies thy breath inspire and my soul kindles with ideal fire the thickweavd shades and grove in circling grove are emblems of the eternity of love my blushing guilt the crimson roses paint and i like roses unsupported faint like theirs my youthful charms if charms consume for love a closer canker eats my bloom how blessed might other nymphs survey these scenes fountains and shades and hills and flowery greens prospects on prospects might detain the sight and still variety give new delight but i with thee should find in deserts ease without thee not even paradise could please wilds by thy presence gardens would appear gardens are wilds since henry is not here let grottos sink or porticos arise heedless i view them with unpleasurd eyes their mantling umbrage cools the noonday fire but what can cool a lovers fierce desire in the deep bosom of a darksome shade by baleful yew and mournful cypress made a widowturtle weeps her ravished love and sorrowfully solaces the grove sometimes my passion i aloud disclose the widowed turtle answering cooes her woes bred by my hand my sorrows sad relief a little linnet learns to sigh my grief taught by my voice and by obedience tame the pretty lisper whistles henrys name perched on my head the sylvan siren sings and tunes the harsher notes of gurgling springs embosomd in a vale thou know the shade fast by the murmurs of a soft cascade there while one night full beams of cynthia play warm was the night with wanderings tired i lay till by degrees the falling waters closed my eyelids and my wearied limbs reposed sudden the fairy monarch i behold near he approached and thus my fate foretold it was the same oberon that once we saw circle the green and give his dancers law  unhappy nymph thy beauty is thy crime   and must such beauty perish in its prime  no more great henry shall enjoy those charms  nor thou illfated fair adorn his arms  cropped like an opening rose thy fall i fear  but rise and supplicate the vengeance near then as methought i waked with threatened woes emerging from thick shades a phantom rose one hand sustained a short but naked sword  and one a golden bowl with poison stored the jealous queen the frowning form expressed it spoke and aimed the dagger at my breast  arise nor ask thy crime  but choose thy fate  know prayers are vain  repentance is too late  vengeance is mine  here drink this poisoned bowl  or this keen dagger drinks thy guilty soul it ceased convulsions in my bosom strove my curdling blood scarce in stiff tides could move thrice i cried henry with a feeble sound and thrice i started at the sad rebound even echo now grew frightful with surprise trembling i lay nor dared unveil my eyes till warbling birds proclaimed the morning light and told me twas a vision of the night yet not the morn could chase my gloomy care but winds and trees alarmed my soul with fear while waving boughs that in the sunbeams played seemed to show daggers in each pointed shade why was i formed with such a coward mind the sport of shadows or a rustling wind nerves better strung did manly spirits warm glad would i part with every female charm then cased in steel the front of battle dare and with great henry rouse the soul of war this arm should guard the hero from the foe repel the storm or intercept the blow and should my weakness in the warrior fail the softbeseeching woman should prevail for thee i would sooth each proud insulting foe and melt him with petitionary woe with thee in every hardy hazard join in dangers save thy life to make it mine by night compose thy harrassd head to rest and hush it on the pillow of my breast with patient eyes eternal vigils keep and court good angels to protect thy sleep alas in vain i urge my frustrate will i find myself a feeble woman still the feeble woman to my breast returns for henrys gone and rosamonda mourns o see my eyes their streaming anguish pour o hear my sighs increase the swelling shower what can i more than shed my tears and sighs poor womans strength alone in weakness lies but whither is ungoverned fancy flown thoughts of impossibilities be gone guilt claims no miracles nor heaven conspires to aid my crimes and fan my lawless fires life irksome grows detested is the light and my soul dreads the visions of the night swift let me to some hallowed convent go  can i for ever henry leave  ah no  but o lost innocence  i lost a name  o honor  broken is the bubble fame are my sins monstrous do invented crimes alike unknown to past or present times demand red vengeance some peculiar curse  crowds stand recorded for the same  or worse have i unpitying heard the poor complain or seen the wretched weep and weep in vain have i my flame feigned for a sordid end ever wronged a foe or ever betrayed a friend not to my charge such crimes has malice brought love only love is my unbounded fault a fault that sure may heaven to pity move since half of heaven it is said consists in love ah foolish nymph  here view the queen the laws  but there view henry as the enchanting cause by such a cause the priestess would retire and quit the vestal for a nobler fire i will again the immortal powers implore brave henry for britannias sake restore in him she lives to him her joys are due and only sends her earliest thanks to you but o my lord my darling lord beware tempt not too bold the dangers of the war think when thou see the fateimpelling dart o think it aimed at rosamondas heart were but each breast as soft as mine no more should tumults rise or martial thunders roar heroes should scorn the glories of the field and the famed laurel to the myrtle yield for sweeter passions sweeter strifes inspire and love alone should set the soul on fire may then these eyes in tears no longer mourn but cheerful hail their henrys wished return o swift victorious hush the wars alarms swift if thy rosamonda boasts some charms fly on the wings of love and conquest to her arms henry to rosamond an epistle by the same shall then his beauteous rosamonda mourn nor henrys soul the soft complaint return o cease my fair i deeply feel thy smart and all thy sorrows double in my heart far from my breast ye scenes of war remove far from my breast be every scene but love soft rising thoughts as when in woodstockbowers joyful we loved away the laughing hours now midnight rest relieves the soldiers care hushed are the drums and every voice of war faint gleam the fires along the dewy field and faint the noise that sleeping coursers yield yet love the lordly tyrant of my breast alarms my soul and interrupts my rest in vain a nations cares the monarch move for ah far greater is the monarch love warm from my lips thy tender letter lies and every word is magic to my eyes weeping i read and hear thy softbreathd woes and all the warrior in the lover lose then i by fancy vanished joys restore feast on false love and act part pleasures over fancy can sooth my soul with pleasing dreams while tented gallia bowery woodstock seems led by delusive steps in thought i rove through well known greens and every winding grove there happily on some flowery bank reclined my sweetreposing rosamonda find when thou for then thy secret thoughts i see in pious slumbers breathe thy soul to me dissolved with joy and feasting on thy charms i clasp thee in imaginary arms and then  ah then  i seem sincerely blessed  then only rosamonda knows the rest  o glories empires crowns how weak ye prove if thus outrivalld by a dream of love o love what joys thy real sweets bestow when even their shadows can transport me so o bliss extatic blessed relief from cares thus let me lose my soul in softer wars be loves transporting sighs my sweet alarms nor worlds but rosamonda crown my arms in her alone my full desires agree her charms are empires glories all to me abelard to eloisa by the late mr cawthorne master of tunbridgeschool argument abelard and eloisa flourished in the twelfth century they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion after a long course of calamities they retired each to a several convent and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion it was many years after this separation that a letter of abelards to a friend which contained the history of his misfortunes fell into the hands of eloisa this occasioned those celebrated letters out of which the following is partly extracted which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature virtue and passion  mr pope  ah why this boding start this sudden pain that wings my pulse and shoots from vein to vein what mean regardless of yon midnight bell these earthborn visions saddening over my cell what strange disorder prompts these thoughts to glow these sighs to murmur and these tears to flow it is she it is eloisas form restored once a pure saint and more than saints adored she comes in all her killing charms confessed glares through the gloom and pours upon my breast bid heavens bright guard from paraclete remove and drags me back to misery and love enjoy thy triumphs dear illusion see this sad apostate from his god to thee see at thy call my guilty warmths return flame through my blood and steal me from my urn yet yet frail abelard one effort try ere the last lingering spark of virtue die the deadly charming sorceress control and spite of nature tear her from thy soul long has that soul in these unsocial woods where anguish muses and where horror broods from loves wild visionary wishes strayed and sought to lose thy beauties in the shade faith dropped a smile devotion lent her fire woke the keen pang and sanctified desire led me enraptured to the blessed abode and taught my heart to glow with all its god but oh how weak fair faith and virtue prove when eloisa melts away in love when her fond soul impassioned rapt unveiled no joy forgotten and no wish concealed flows through her pen as infant softness free and fiercely springs in ecstasies to me ye heavens as walking in yon sacred fane with every seraph warm in every vein just as remorse had roused an aching sigh and my torn soul hung trembling in my eye in that kind hour thy fatal letter came i saw i gazed i shivered at the name the conscious lamps at once forgot to shine prophetic tremors shook the hallowed shrine priests censers altars from thy genius fled and heaven itself shut on me while i read dear smiling mischief art thou still the same the still pale victim of too soft a flame warm as when first with more than mortal shine each melting eyeball mixed thy soul with mine have not thy tears for ever taught to flow the glooms of absence and the pangs of woe the pomp of sacrifice the whispered tale the dreadful vow yet hovering over thy veil drove this bewitching fondness from thy breast curbed the loose wish and formed each pulse to rest and can thou still still bend the suppliant knee to loves dead shrine and weep and sigh for me then take me take me lock me in thy arms spring to my lips and give me all thy charms no fly me fly me spread the impatient sail steal the larks wing and mount the swiftest gale skim the last ocean freeze beneath the pole renounce me curse me root thee from thy soul fly fly for justice bares the arm of god and the grasped vengeance only waits his nod are these my wishes can they thus aspire does phrenzy form them or does grace inspire can abelard in hurricanes of zeal betray his heart and teach thee not to feel teach thy enamored spirit to disown each human warmth and chill thee into stone ah rather let my tenderest accents move the last wild tumults of unholy love on that dear bosom trembling let me lie pour out my soul and in fierce raptures die rouse all my passions act my joys anew farewell ye cells ye martyred saints adieu sleep conscience sleep each awful thought be drowned and sevenfold darkness veil the scene around what means this pause this agonizing start this glimpse of heaven quickrushing through my heart methinks i see a radiant cross displayed a wounded savior bleeds along the shade around the expiring god bright angels fly swell the loud hymn and open all the sky o save me save me ere the thunders roll and hells black caverns swallow up my soul return ye hours when guiltless of a stain my strongplumd genius throbd in every vein when warmed with all the egyptian fanes inspired all athens boasted and all rome admired my merit in its full meridian shone each rival blushing and each heart my own return ye scenes ah no from fancy fly on times stretched wing till each idea die eternal fly since all that learning gave too weak to conquer and too fond to save to loves soft empire every wish betrayed and left my laurels withering in the shade let me forget that while deceitful fame grasped her shrill trump and filled it with my name thy stronger charms empowered by heaven to move each saint each blessed insensible to love at once my soul from bright ambition won i hugged the dart i wished to be undone no more pale science durst my thoughts engage insipid dullness hung on every page the midnight lamp no more enjoyed its blaze no more my spirit flew from maze to maze thy glances bade philosophy resign her throne to thee and every sense was thine but what could all the frosts of wisdom do opposed to beauty when it melts in you since these dark cheerless solitary caves deathbreathing woods and dailyopening graves misshapen rocks wild images of woe for ever howling to the deeps below ungenial deserts where no vernal shower wakes the green herb or paints the unfolding flower the imbrowning glooms these holy mansions shed the nightborn horrors brooding over my bed the dismal scenes black melancholy pours over the sad visions of enanguishd hours lean abstinence wan grief lowthoughted care distracting guilt and hells worst fiend despair conspire in vain with all the aids of art to blot thy dear idea from my heart delusive sightless god of warm desire why would thou wish to set a wretch on fire why lives thy soft divinity where woe heaves the pale sigh and anguish loves to glow fly to the mead the daisypainted vale breathe in its sweets and melt along the gale fly where gay scenes luxurious youths employ where every moment steals the wing of joy there may thou see low prostrate at thy throne devoted slaves and victims all thy own each villageswain the turfbuilt shrine shall raise and kings command whole hecatombs to blaze o memory ingenious to revive each fleeting hour and teach the past to live witness what conflicts this frail bosom tore what griefs i suffered and what pangs i bore how long i struggled labored strove to save an heart that panted to be still a slave when youth warmth rapture spirit love and flame seized every sense and burnt through all my frame from youth warmth rapture to these wilds i fled my food the herbage and the rock my bed there while these venerable cloisters rise over the bleak surge and gain upon the skies my wounded soul indulged the tear to flow over all her sad vicissitudes of woe profuse of life and yet afraid to die guilt in my heart and horror in my eye with ceaseless prayers the whole artillery given to win the mercies of offended heaven each hill made vocal echoed all around while my torn breast knocked bleeding on the ground yet yet alas though all my moments fly stained by a tear and darkened in a sigh though meagre fasts have on my cheek displayed the dusk of death and sunk me to a shade spite of myself the stillimpoisoning dart shoots through my blood and drinks up all my heart my vows and wishes wildly disagree and grace itself mistakes my god for thee athwart the glooms that wrap the midnight sky my eloisa steals upon my eye for ever rises in the solar ray a phantom brighter than the blaze of day wherever i go the visionary guest pants on my lip or sinks upon my breast unfolds her sweets and throbbing to destroy winds round my heart in luxury of joy while loud hosannas shake the shrines around i hear her softer accents in the sound her idolbeauties on each altar glare and heaven muchinjurd has but half my prayer no tears can drive her hence no pangs control for every object brings her to my soul last night reclining on yon airy steep my busy eyes hung brooding over the deep the breathless whirlwinds slept in every cave and the soft moonbeam danced from wave to wave each former bliss in this bright mirror seen with all my glories dawned upon the scene recalled the dear auspicious hour anew when my fond soul to eloisa flew when with keen speechless ecstasies oppressed thy frantic lover snatched thee to his breast gazed on thy blushes armed with every grace and saw the goddess beaming in thy face saw thy wild trembling ardent wishes move each pulse to rapture and each glance to love but lo the winds descend the billows roar foam to the clouds and burst upon the shore vast peals of thunder over the ocean roll the flamewingd lightning gleams from pole to pole at once the pleasing images withdrew and more than horrors crowded on my view thy uncles form in all his ire arrayed serenely dreadful stalked along the shade pierced by his sword i sunk upon the ground the spectre ghastly smiled upon the wound a group of black infernals round me hung and tossed my infamy from tongue to tongue detested wretch how impotent thy age how weak thy malice and how kind thy rage spite of thyself inhuman as thou art thy murdering hand has left me all my heart left me each tender fond affection warm a nerve to tremble and an eye to charm no cruel cruel exquisite in ill thou thought it dull barbarity to kill my death had robbed lost vengeance of her toil and scarcely warmed a scythian to a smile sublimer furies taught thy soul to glow with all their savage mysteries of woe taught thy unfeeling poniard to destroy the powers of nature and the source of joy to stretch me on the racks of vain desire each passion throbbing and each wish on fire mad to enjoy unable to be blessed fiends in my veins and hell within my breast aid me fair faith assist me grace divine ye martyrs bless me and ye saints refine ye sacred groves ye heavendevoted walls where folly sickens and where virtue calls ye vows ye altars from this bosom tear voluptuous love and leave no anguish there oblivion be thy blackest plume displayed over all my griefs and hide me in the shade and thou too fondly idolized attend while awful reason whispers in the friend friend did i say immortals what a name can dull cold friendship own so wild a flame no let thy lover whose enkindling eye shot all his soul between thee and the sky whose warmths bewitched thee whose unhallowed song called thy rapt ear to die upon his tongue now strongly rouse while heaven his zeal inspires diviner transports and more holy fires calm all thy passions all thy peace restore and teach that snowy breast to heave no more torn from the world within dark cells immured by angels guarded and by vows secured to all that once awoke thy fondness dead and hope pale sorrows last sad refuge fled why will thou weep and sigh and melt in vain brood over false joys and hug the ideal chain say can thou wish that madly wild to fly from yon bright portal opening in the sky thy abelard should bid his god adieu pant at thy feet and taste thy charms anew ye heavens if to this tender bosom wooed thy mere idea harrows up my blood if one faint glimpse of eloise can move the fiercest wildest agonies of love what shall i be when dazzling as the light thy whole effulgence flows upon my fight look on thyself consider who thou art and learn to be an abbess in thy heart see while devotions evermelting strain pours the loud organ through the trembling fane yon pious maids each earthly wish disown kiss the dread cross and crowd upon the throne o let thy soul the sacred charge attend their warmths inspirit and their virtues mend teach every breast from every hymn to steal the seraphs meekness and the seraphs zeal to rise to rapture to dissolve away in dreams of heaven and lead thyself the way till all the glories of the blessed abode blaze on the scene and every thought is god while thus thy exemplary cares prevail and make each vestal spotless as her veil the eternal spirit over thy cell shall move in the soft image of the mystic dove the longlost gleams of heavenly comfort bring peace in his smile and healing on his wing at once remove affliction from thy breast melt over thy soul and hush her pangs to rest o that my soul from loves cursed bondage free could catch the transports that i urge to thee o that some angels more than magic art would kindly tear the hermit from his heart extinguish every guilty sense and leave no pulse to riot and no sigh to heave vain fruitless wish still still the vigorous flame bursts like an earthquake through my shattered frame spite of the joys that truth and virtue prove i feel but thee and breath not but to love repent in vain scarce wish to be forgiven thy form my idol and thy charms my heaven yet yet my fair thy nobler efforts try lift me from earth and give me to the sky let my lost soul thy brighter virtues feel warmed with thy hopes and winged with all thy zeal and when lowbending at the hallowed shrine thy contrite heart shall abelard resign when pitying heaven impatient to forgive unbars the gates of light and bids thee live seize on the auspicious moment ere it flee and ask the same immortal boon for me then when these black terrific scenes are over and rebel nature chills the soul no more when on thy cheek the expiring roses fade and thy last lustres darken in the shade when armed with quick varieties of pain or creeping dully slow from vein to vein pale death shall set my kindred spirit free and these dead orbs forget to dote on thee some pious friend whose wild affections glow like ours in sad similitude of woe shall drop one tender sympathizing tear prepare the garland and adorn the bier our lifeless relics in one tomb enshrine and teach thy genial dust to mix with mine mean while divinely purged from every stain our active souls shall climb the etherial plain to each bright cherubs purity aspire catch all his zeal and pant with all his fire there where no face the glooms of anguish wears no uncle murders and no passion tears enjoy with heaven eternity of rest for ever blessing and for ever blessed the origin of doubt when jove at first from nothing called forth all and various beings filled this pendant ball in rank superior to our boasted race subaltern gods now seldom seen had place immortal these but of a doubtful birth and all with man joint sojourners on earth sacred to some bright nymph was every tree to naiads brooks to nereids all the sea by jove in mercy to her care consigned reason bright empress claimed the human mind not the pure radiance that resides above and guides the councils of immortal jove but humbler far though honored with the

fair fast by the foot of proud parnassus stood remote from vulgar view a sacred wood here contemplation keeps her hallowed court and young ideas on the breezes sport celestial truths in holy dreams are taught and busy silence plumes the wings of thought here knowledge sheltered from the noontide ray frequent was wont with chaste delight to stray yet none not deities if born below the fates exempt from violence and woe for here as once she sat in thought profound her mind in heaven her eyes upon the ground and mused on mans free will joves fixed decrees on choice on prescience which all future sees on acts impelled by motives strong as fate rewarded punished in an endless state on chance necessity effect and cause great natures end and truths eternal laws lo the huge form of ignorance appeared whom known by instinct she by instinct feared with terror winged the virgin flies the place the monster follows with unequal pace though fired with brutal rage he perseveres the widening distance half dispelled her fears when now too much elated with her speed her lifted eyes no more her footsteps heed she stumbles falls the ravisher is nigh it is vain to plead impossible to fly his idiot form compressed the trembling maid and his rude joys profaned the conscious shade but from the loathed embrace the pregnant dame conceived a son and doubt when born his name fond of his mothers virtues to partake who shuns and hates him for his fathers sake some lines occasioned by a series of theological enquiries shall man who blindly wanders nature through dark and impervious to his nearest view shall he to god his eye presumptuous turn and hope from whence and what he is to learn o first and last o greatest wisest best to thee be still my prayers and praise addressed nor let me boast that i to ask am free how he now is who never began to be how love immense that formed creations plan could unexerted lie till time began or if all natures works and all their laws are coeternal with their parentcause spontaneous beaming with dependent ray as from the sun the light that gives the day if all the vast immensity of space is filled with beings of an endless race or if some narrower bounds the work confine and why thus bounded love and power divine whence the deep shades of sin and sorrow came and evil mingled with the general frame why spread the dark dominions of the grave or why i wish more virtue than i have these secret things to none but thee are known veiled in the darkness that surrounds thy throne o let my soul be still content to know thy love thy

neighbors thou alone my friend to sir humphry mackworh on the mines late of sir carbery price by the late mr yalden what spacious veins enrich the british soil the various ores and skilful miners toil how ripening metals lie concealed in earth and teeming nature forms the wondrous birth my useful verse the first transmits to fame in numbers tuned and no unhallowed flame o generous mackworth could the muse impart a labor worthy thy auspicious art like thee succeed in paths untrod before and secret treasures of the land explore apollos self should on the labor smile and delphos quit for britains fruitful isle where fair sabrina flows around the coast and aged dovey in the oceans lost her lofty brows unconquered britain rears and fenced with rocks impregnable appears which like the wellfixd bars of nature show to guard the treasures she conceals below for earth distorted with her pregnant womb heaves up to give the forming embryo room hence vast excrescencies of hills arise and mountains swell to a portentous size louring and black the rugged coast appears the sullen earth a gloomy surface wears yet all beneath deep as the center shines with native wealth and more than indias mines thus erring nature her defects supplies indulgent often to what her sons despise often in a rude unfinished form we find the noblest treasure of a generous mind thrice happy land from whose indulgent womb such unexhausted stores of riches come by heaven beloved formed by auspicious fate to be above thy neighboring nations great its golden sands no more shall tagus boast in doveys flood his rivalld empires lost whose waters now a nobler fund maintain to humble france and check the pride of spain like egypts nile the bounteous current shows dispersing blessings wheresoeer it flows whose native treasures able to repair the long expenses of our gallic war the ancient britons are a hardy race averse to luxury and slothful ease their necks beneath a foreign yoke never bowed in war unconquered and of freedom proud with minds resolved they lasting toils endure unmixed their language and their manners pure wisely does nature such an offspring choose brave to defend her wealth and slow to use where thirst of empire never inflames their veins nor avarice nor wild ambition reigns but low in mines they constant toils renew and through the earth their branching veins pursue as when some navy on the iberian coast chased by the winds is in the ocean lost to neptunes realms a new supply it brings the strength designed of european kings contending diverse would the wreck regain and make reprisals on the grasping main wild in pursuit they are endangered more than when they combated the storms before the miner thus through perils digs his way equal to theirs and deeper than the sea drawing in pestilential steams his breath resolved to conquer though he combats death nights gloomy realms his pointed steel invades the courts of pluto and infernal shades he cuts through mountains subterraneous lakes plying his work each nervous stroke he takes loosens the earth and the whole cavern shakes thus with his brawny arms the cyclops stands to form joves lightning with uplifted hands the ponderous hammer with a force descends loud as the thunder which his art intends and as he strikes with each resistless blow the anvil yields and aetna groans below thy famed inventions mackworth most adorn the miners art and make the best return thy speedy sails and useful engines show a genius richer than the mines below thousands of slaves unskilled peru maintains the hands that labor still exhaust the gains the winds thy slaves their useful succor join convey thy ore and labor at thy mine instructed by thy arts a power they find to vanquish realms where once they lay confined downward my muse direct thy steepy flight where smiling shades and bounteous realms invite i first of british bards invoke thee down and first with wealth thy graceful temples crown through dark retreats pursue the winding ore search natures depths and view her boundless store the secret cause in tuneful measures sing how metals first are framed and whence they spring whether the active sun with chymic flames through porous earth transmits his genial beams with heat impregnating the womb of night the offspring shines with its paternal light on britains isle propitiously he shines with joy descends and labors in her mines or whether urged by subterraneous flames the earth ferments and flows in liquid streams purged from their dross the nobler parts refine receive new forms and with fresh beauties shine thus fluid parts unknowing how to burn with cold congealed to solid metals turn for metals only from devouring flame preserve their beauty and return the same both art and force the wellwrought mass disdains and midst the fire its native form retains or whether by creation first they sprung when yet unpoisd the worlds great fabric hung metals the basis of the earth were made the bars on which its fixed foundations laid all second causes they disdain to own and from the almightys fiat sprung alone nature in specious beds preserves her store and keeps unmixed the wellcompacted ore the spreading root a numerous race maintains of branching limbs and farextended veins thus from its watery store a spring supplies the lesser streams that round its fountain rise which bounding out in fair meanders play and over the meads in different currents stray methinks i see the rounded metal spread to be ennobled with our monarchs head about the globe the admired coin shall run and make the circle of its parent sun how are thy realms triumphant britain blessed enriched with more than all the distant west thy sons no more betrayed with hopes of gain shall tempt the dangers of a faithless main traffic no more abroad for foreign spoil supplied with richer from their native soil to doveys flood shall numerous traders come employed to fetch the british bullion home to pay their tributes to its bounteous shore returning laden with the cambrian ore her absent fleet potosis race shall mourn and wish in vain to see our sails return like misers heaping up their useless store starved with their wealth amidst their riches poor wherever the british banners are displayed the suppliant nations shall implore our aid till thus compelled the greater worlds confess themselves obliged and succored by the less how cambrias mines were to her offspring known thus sacred verse transmits the story down merlin a bard of the inspired train with mystic numbers charmed the british plain beloved by phoebus and the tuneful nine his song was sacred and his art divine as on sabrinas fruitful banks he stood his wondrous verse restrained the listening flood the streams bright goddess raised her awful head and to her cave the artful shepherd led her swiftdescending steps the youth pursues and rich in ore the spacious mountain views in beds distinct the wellrangd metals lay dispersing rays and counterfeiting day the silver shedding beams of orient light struck with too fierce a glare his aching sight like rising flames the ruddy copper showed and spread its blushes over the dark abode profuse of rays and with unrivaled beams the liquid silver flowed in restless streams nor indias sparkling gems are half so bright nor waves above that shine with heavenly light when thus the goddess spoke harmonious youth revered for numbers fraught with sacred truth beloved by heaven attend while i relate the fixed decree and dark events of fate concealed these treasures lie in natures womb for future times and ages yet to come when many long revolving years are run a hero shall ascend the british throne whose numerous triumphs shall augusta grace in arms renowned adored for plenteous peace beneath his sway a generous youth shall rise with virtues blessed in happy councils wise rich with the spoils of learnings various store commanding arts yet still acquiring more he with success shall enter this abode and nature trace in paths before untrod the smiling offspring from her womb remove and with her entrails glad the realms above o youth reserved by more auspicious fate with famed improvements to oblige the state by wars impoverished albion mourns no more thy wellwrought mines forbid her to be poor the earth thy great exchequer ready lies which all defect of failing funds supplies thou shall a nations pressing wants relieve not war can lavish more than thou can give this mackworth fixes thy immortal name the muses darling and the boast of fame no greater virtues on record shall stand than thus with arts to grace with wealth enrich the land a poem sacred to the memory of a dearly beloved and only daughter who died in the eleventh year of her age wrote by her mourning father a common theme a flattering muse may fire to raise our passions though she sung for hire and may our praises or our pity steal by feigning transports which she does not feel but when the song from native love proceeds and paints the anguish of a heart that bleeds the mourning muse exerts superior skill and dips in tears the inconsolable quill our bosoms then with rising sorrows glow and grief spontaneous will from nature flow ah what is life that thoughtless wish of all a drop of honey in a draught of gall a half existence or a waking dream a bitter fountain with a muddy stream a tale a shadow a delusive sound that is lost with mourning and with sorrow found a fading landscape painted upon clay the source of care and idol of a day the sweet deluder of a restless mind which if twas lost how few would wish to find untimely thus the infantbudding rose by some rude hand is cropped before it blows away the little soul of fragrance flies and blooming beauty unregarded dies snatched from the parent stem where once it grew embalmed in odours and the morning dew can i be dumb when love and nature cries and i have lost the darling of my eyes though it is in vain to wish for her return yet all the ties of nature bid me mourn if thou can still the unrelenting sea and make the jarring elements agree or cause the tide to cease to ebb and flow or hinder the descent of hail and snow if thou can stop the thunders dreadful roar or cause the billows not to lash the shore if thou can lull a hurricane to sleep then may thy words persuade me not to weep o give me leave but to lament her fall as david mourned for jonathan and saul when on mount gilboa o unhappy day they to philistia fell a shameful prey or if it may with innocence be done as he lamented absalom his son when in the anguish of his soul he cried  would god my son i in thy place had died then lend your aid if any such there be that loved a child or mourn for one like me let your kind sighs with me in concert join and add your sympathizing tears to mine that may in streams to swelling rivers flow until those rivers to a deluge grow but if there is none commiserates my case and in no breast compassion finds a place let not your censures add to my concern nor slight the cause that moves me thus to mourn if you are void of trouble free from pain add not to mine nor wonder i complain i know the stroke is from the hand divine to whom i may complain though not repine though i deplore my loss and wish it less yet i will kiss the rod and acquiesce a saviors blood shall supersede my fears and love paternal justify my tears when death at first besieged this little fort the feeble outworks were the tyrants sport a fever made the first attack in form and then convulsions took it soon by storm succors without were weak like those within the guards were sickly and the walls were thin in bad repair the gates and citadel and then no wonder that so soon it fell deaths icy hands the lovely fabric spoiled he got a victim but i lost my child  five mournful days with trembling hand and heart i played the whole artillery of art five nights i past in sorrow like the day and almost mourned my own sad life away but when the most that art could do was tried her lease of life was cancelled and she died   she died  the conscious whispering winds reply and i unhappy father saw her die i saw her die  can i the deed forgive how can i bear to say i did  and live though long her reason suffered an eclipse no sinful word proceeded from her lips though sore oppressed with agonizing pain she uttered nothing indiscreet or vain which gives me hopes her soul was washed from sin and grace abounding was at work within whilst nature yet maintained a doubtful strife and death sat brooding on the verge of life even then  when all the hopes of life were fled i and the angels waiting round her bed they to conduct her to the realms of day and i to weep to sigh to mourn to pray i kissed her lips i wiped her dying face and took the fathers and the nurses place with bleeding heart i heard her dying groans and met with equal agony her moans each sigh was as a dagger in my heart we knew we must but oh were loath to part i mourned i wept i gave a loose to grief and had recourse to all things for relief but all in vain  the last effort i make i gave  but oh she had not strength to take her fluttering pulse with intermission played and then her heart its palpitation stayed and thus through all the forms of death she past till with a sigh she gently breathed her last but who can paint the horror or the power of natures conflict in so dark an hour the wound was such that time can never heal no balm can cure it and no art conceal may that sad day be banished from the year or clothed in sable if it must appear or may the sun withdraw his beams at noon and solid darkness veil the stars and moon may all the sands be stagnant in the glass and as that hour returns refuse to pass all clocks be dumb and time forget to fly and may all nature be as sad as i let mourning in its blackest dress appear and she be never named without a tear oh where are now those dear obedient hands so pleased to execute my whole commands where are those feet so early taught to run as lightning swift unwearied as the sun where now those arms that with such passion strove to clasp my neck and stifle me with love where now those lips where mine were fond to dwell or where that breath that ravished with the smell where is that tongue whose prattle charmed mine ears where fled the hopes of my declining years where is that face so pleasant when she smiled or where is the woman acting in the child where those dear eyes that with such sweetness shone or rather where are all my comforts gone where is that heart so near to truth allied that never disobeyed  but when she died where is that breast where virtue once did grow as roses sweet and white as falling snow they are buried all in the voracious grave where kings are levelled with the meanest slave the wise and great when there they make their bed are equaled with the wretch that begs his bread but there the wicked can no more oppress and there the weary find a calm recess and this does all my expectations crown that i to her shall there go quickly down till then this hope shall mitigate my woe and dry those tears that now profusely flow that when by heavens command i quit the stage bowed down by time and quite fatigued with age my bones shall rest in quiet by her side like a fond bridegroom sleeping by his bride till the last day shall both to life restore when death shall die and time shall be no more this distant view does equal pleasure give as now my soul is conscious that i live and thou that once wast my delight and pride in whom i hoped to have a nurse and guide when feeble age should bow my hoary head and pain or sickness fix me to my bed if i may guiltless call upon thy name and ask a boon without incurring blame though thou art happy now amongst the blessed indulge thy mourning fathers last request when some kind angel from this world below shall bring the news for sure the angels know and shall to thee and kindred spirits tell that mine has orders to forsake her shell and be transplanted to the realms of light where faith and hope are swallowed up in sight do thou with heavenly raptures meet my ghost on the utmost limits of that happy coast and thence attend me to the throne of grace to view my saviors reconciled face and taste of joys ineffable and new till then my little saint adieu adieu on the physical cause of the death of king george the second through grief to death men often have stole and baffled all the physic art dissection seldom found the hole or showed before a broken heart that this of royal george the case with men can never gain belief more like the opposite it was since joy can kill as well as grief with length of years and glory crowned as blithe he viewed his valiant bands death dealing secretly the wound from future conquests stopped his hands  enough of years enough of fame  while thou did wield the conquering sword cries death leave something to proclaim  the worth and praise of george the third  his be the glorious task to end  and bid wars cruel horrors cease  the freedom of mankind

though sorrow may blemish the verse yet let the sad tribute be paid they called him the pride of the plain in sooth he was gentle and kind he marked in his elegant strain the graces that glowed in his mind on purpose he planted yon trees that birds in the covert might dwell he cultured his thyme for the bees but never once rifled their cell ye lambkins that played at his feet go bleat  and your master bemoan his music was artless and sweet his manners as mild as your own no verdure shall cover the vale no bloom on the blossoms appear the sweets of the forest shall fail and winter encompass the year no birds in our hedges shall sing our hedges so vocal before since he that should welcome the spring can greet the gay season no more his phillis was proud of his praise and poets came round in a throng they listened  and envied his lays but which of them equaled the song ye shepherds henceforward be mute for lost is the pastoral strain so give me my corydons flute and thus  let me break
