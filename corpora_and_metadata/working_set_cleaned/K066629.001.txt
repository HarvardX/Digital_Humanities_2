lectures on the catechism of the church of england  lectures on the catechism of the church of england  by william gilpin m a vicar of boldre near lymington  vol i  london printed for r blamire in the strand sold by r faulder new bondstreet and b law ave marylane  mdcclxxix  to the young gentlemen who have been educated at cheam school gentlemen the following lectures upon the catechism of the church of england have little pretense to expect attention from the generality of readers who are furnished with many better helps but as they were composed for your use and as several of you at different times have desired copies of them they may aided by your partiality perhaps meet with a more favorable reception among you they accost you with the familiarity of an old acquaintance and hope to get admittance and whisper a few serious truths when wiser instructors are neglected  i have endeavored in some degree to give them a better form than that plain one in which you knew them i have abridged them also as i would not trespass too much upon your hours of leisure or business and should be sorry to fatigue your patience as a friend though i have been sometimes perhaps obliged to do it as a master  on the evidences of our religion and the great doctrines of christianity it has been my chief endeavor to engage your attention if the mind be deeply impressed with these leading truths it requires only a slighter lesson on morals faith we know was the great point in preaching the gospel and he who seriously believes it cannot well fail of being a good christian  i have endeavored in the course of these lectures to show you that scarce any of the great truths of the gospel were so wholly new but that some notices of them or at least resemblances maybe traced even among the heathen nations  among those which were more polished especially and perhaps among all if we were more intimately acquainted with them and as this shows either a great harmony between reason and revelation or that these preparatory notices originated immediately from the deity it always appeared to me an argument that carried great conviction if we even suppose these notices to have been wholly of jewish origin still the unforced adoption of them shows strongly their agreement with reason and therefore opposes strongly the endeavors of those who labor to set reason and revelation at variance  in this light a late very ingenious and distinguished writer seems to build a part of his theory upon false ground when he tells us that from the new testament may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines of it and totally unlike every thing which had ever before entered into the mind of man see mr jenynss inter evid p      in pressing moral rules i have sometimes rather chosen a quotation from horace than a text from scripture in one sense he is better authority than an apostle if his uninlightened mind had such just and noble sentiments what may be expected from a christian  it was some inducement to me gentlemen in publishing there papers to leave in your memory a testimony of that earnestness with which i always wished to press upon you the great truths of religion and virtue these without any disparagement to human literature ought certainly to be the first objects of education where one miscarries for want of learning numbers miscarry for want of principles  i have with great satisfaction seen many of you as you came forward in life filling your several stations with propriety and credit and it is one of the greatest pleasures of my retirement to think i shall daily see many more a few mortifications too i have had but there is some ground at least to hope that where good principles have been early inculcated they may sooner or later revive and should these lectures contribute in any degree to that purpose they will have answered one of my principal ends  that these or any other means may enable you to see your real and most important interests in life and to pursue them steadily is with great affection and earnestness the constant wish of  your very sincere friend and most obedient servant will gilpin vicars hill near lymington jan        lecture i history of the catechism  general contents of it  baptismal vow  use of sponsors  name given in baptism  substance of the vow  renunciation of sin  faith  obedience  connection between them  st pauls doctrine with regard to faith explained  promises made on gods part upon our keeping the vow  divine assistance necessary  it was among the earliest cares of the first promoters of the reformation to provide a catechism for the instruction of youth but the same caution with regard to the prejudices of men was necessarily to be used in this matter as had been used in all the other religious transactions of those times at first it was thought sufficient to begin with such common things as were acknowledged both by papists and protestants the first catechism therefore consisted simply of the creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer and it was no easy matter to bring even these into general use they were received by the people in the midst of that profound ignorance which then reigned as a species of incantation and it was long before the grossness of vulgar conception was even enlightened enough to apprehend that the creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer meant simply to direct their faith their practice and their devotion  this was all the progress that was made in catechetical instruction from the beginning of the reformation till so late a period as the year      about that time a farther attempt was made by archbishop cranmer as it is commonly supposed he ventured to add a few cautious explanatory passages which was all the prejudices of men would yet bear the great prudence indeed of that wise and good man appeared in nothing more than in the easy movements with which he introduced every change  in the year      a farther attempt was hazarded a catechism was published by authority in which not only the creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer were more fully expounded but a brief explanation also of the sacraments was added this bold work however was not ventured in the english tongue but was published in latin for the use of schools archbishop wake see the dedication to his commentary on the church catechism whose authority i chiefly follow supposes this catechism to be the first model of that which is now in use  thus the matter rested till the reign of elizabeth in the mean time the violent measures of her predecessor had tended greatly to open an inquisitive temper in the age and to abolish its prejudices men began to have some notion of thinking for themselves and it was no longer necessary to observe that extreme caution which had hitherto been observed in addressing them on religious subjects the catechism therefore was now improved on a more liberal plan and having undergone several reviews was at length published by authority nearly in its present form in the year      it ought to be mentioned that the person principally concerned in this work was nowel dean of st pauls  from this short history of the catechism the various forms it underwent and the care and caution employed in composing it we need not wonder at finding it what it really appears to be a very accurate judicious and comprehensive summary of the principles and doctrines of the christian religion  it begins with a recital of our baptismal vow as a kind of preface to the whole it then lays down the great christian principle of faith and leaving all mysterious inquiries in which this subject is involved it passes on to the rules of practice having briefly recited these it concludes with a simple and very intelligible explanation of baptism and the lords supper  the catechism then begins very properly with a recital of our baptismal vow as the best preface to that belief and those rules of practice in which that vow engaged us  but before we examine the vow itself two appendages of it require explanation  the use of sponsors  and the addition of a name  with regard to the sponsor the church probably imitates the appointment of the legal guardian making the best provision it can for the pious education of orphans and deserted children the temporal and the spiritual guardian may equally betray their trust both are culpable both accountable but surely the latter breaks the more sacred engagement  as to promising and vowing in the name of another which seems to carry so harsh a sound the sponsor only engages for the child as any one would engage for another in a matter which is manifestly for his advantage and on a supposition that the child hereafter will see it to be so  that is he promises as he takes it for granted the child itself would have promised if it had been able  with regard to the name it is no part of the sacrament nor pretends to scriptural authority it rests merely on ancient usage a custom had generally obtained of giving a new name upon adopting a new member into a family we find it common among the greeks the romans and the jews nay we read that even god himself when he received abraham into covenant giving an early sanction to this usage changed his name to abraham in imitation of this common practice the old christians gave baptismal names to their children which were intended to point out their heavenly adoption as their surnames distinguished their temporal alliance  from considering the use of sponsors and of the name in baptism we proceed next to the vow itself which is thus expressed my godfathers did promise three things in my name  st that i should renounce the devil and all his works the pomps and vanities of this wicked world and all the sinful lusts of the flesh  dly that i should believe all the articles of the christian faith and  dly that i should keep gods holy will and commandments and walk in the same all the days of my life  first then we promise to renounce the devil and all his works the pomps and vanities of this wicked world and all the sinful lusts of the flesh the devil the world and the flesh is a comprehensive mode of expressing every species of sin however distinguished and from whatever source derived all which we not only engage to renounce as far as we are able but also to take pains in tracing the labyrinths of our own hearts and in removing the glosses of selfdeceit without this all renunciation of sin is pretense  being thus injoined to renounce our gross habitual sins and those bad inclinations which lead us into them we are required next to believe all the articles of the christian faith this is a natural progression when we are thoroughly convinced of the malignity of sin we in course wish to avoid the ill consequences of it and are prepared to give a fair hearing to the evidence of religion there is a close connection between vice and infidelity they mutually support each other the same connection subsists between a well disposed mind and the truths of religion and faith perhaps is not so involuntary an act as many of our modern philosophers would persuade us  after believing the articles of the christian faith we are lastly injoined to keep gods holy will and commandments here too is the same natural progression as the renunciation of sin prepares the way for faith so does faith lead directly to obedience they seem related to each other as the mean and the end the end of the commandment says the apostle is charity out of a pure heart and good conscience and faith unfeigned faith which is the act of believing upon rational evidence is the great fountain from which all christian virtues spring no man will obey a law till he has informed himself whether it be properly authorized or in other words till he believe in the jurisdiction that enacted it  if our faith in christ does not lead us to obey him it is what the scriptures call a dead faith in opposition to a saving one  to this inseparable connection between faith and obedience st pauls doctrine may be objected where he seems to lay the whole stress on faith in opposition to works see romans iii    and indeed great part of the epistle   but it is plain that st pauls argument requires him to mean by faith the whole system of the christian religion which is indeed the meaning of the word in many other parts of scripture and by works which he sets in opposition to it the moral law so that in fact the apostles argument relates not to the present question but tends only to establish the superiority of christianity the moral law argues the apostle which claimed on the righteousness of works makes no provision for the deficiences of man christianity alone by opening a door of mercy gave him hopes of that salvation which the other could not pretend to give  upon renouncing sin believing the articles of the christian faith and keeping gods holy commandments as far as sinful man can keep them we are entitled by promise to all the privileges of the gospel we become members of christ children of god and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven we are redeemed through the merits of christ pardoned through the mercies of god and rewarded with a blessed immortality  this account of our baptismal vow concludes with a question leading us to acknowledge the necessity of observing this vow and to declare our belief that our only hope of keeping it rests upon the assistance of god  having considered our baptismal vow or the prefatorial part we come now to the body itself of the catechism which naturally divides into the two great branches of the vow faith and obedience  the first as contained in the creed the second in the commandments  lecture ii history of creeds  three creeds established in our church  the apostles creed  analysis of it  authenticity of scripture proved  from a chain of the earliest writers mentioning and quoting them  from the enemies of christianity acknowledging their existence  from the rejection of forged gospels and epistles  from their various translations  from reading them in public assemblies  from their internal evidence  argument against their adulteration from the jealousies of different sects  objections answered  when the purity of the christian religion became mingled with human inventions and sectaries instead of judging from the whole tenor of the gospel built their narrow systems upon detached parts  then it was that different churches thought it necessary to frame creeds with an intention to distinguish articles of faith from matters of opinion and the primary idea of a creed was merely to bring these articles together from various parts of scripture into one point of view  but as corruption advanced and different churches began to found different systems on the same articles then each church thought it necessary to proceed a step further and to enlarge its creed by explanations with a view to show in what sense it received each article or in other words to draw a line between itself and such churches as it thought held unscriptural tenets  hence we may easily suppose that many of these creeds were as absurd as the various opinions which gave them birth and hence the creeds even of the purest churches became clogged with explanatory clauses which if they had their use in some cases produced mischief in others  this is the short history of creeds  in our church three of these ancient creeds are retained  that authenticated by the council of nice  the athenasian  and that which is commonly tho improperly called the apostlescreed as to the athenasian creed it has given great offense to many wellmeaning persons by the damnatory clauses with which it is guarded though in fact these make no part of the creed itself but rest solely with the author of it the apostles creed however is chargeable with nothing of this kind it has stood the test of ages and unless in one or two obscure passages has been ever thought unexceptionable  this creed was composed before any of the subtilties of the doctrine of the trinity were introduced which tend more to create animosity amongst men than to amend their hearts in it we simply declare our belief in the father the son and the holy ghost  in the scripture account of the life and sufferings of christ  in the redemption of the world from sin  in the resurrection of the dead  and in the eternity of a future state  but before we enter upon the examination of these points as we shall have frequent occasion in the course of it to appeal to the new testament it seems natural first to prove the authenticity of the several books of which it is composed i shall just therefore touch the heads of argument made use of in this proof  a series of christian writers irenaeus justin martyr tertullian clement origin the reader will find these proofs at large in whitbys general introduction to the gospels and epistles and in jenkinss reasonab of christianity vol ii c   he will find likewise proofs in favor of st matthews gospel the epistles to the hebrews and some other parts of scripture which were not at first so universally received   and others who lived in the ages succeeding those of the apostles and whose writings are still extant agree in declaring those books which compose the canon of scripture as now settled to have descended regularly from the apostolic times  the very originals indeed of some of them appear to have been preserved till the third century for tertullian who dyed at the close of the second seems to appeal to them as then existing percurre ecclesias apostolicas apud quas ipsae authenticae literae eorum recitantur sonantes vocem and repraesentantes faciem uniuscujusq  de praescrip c      in those early ages the authenticity of scripture was universally acknowledged both by friends and enemies celsus julian and all the eminent antichristians of those days no more disputed the authenticity of scripture than we do that of the koran their objections to the one and our objections to the other run in a different channel on this head no disputes were ever heard of nor any interruption in the regular chain of evidence  when indeed could a forgery have been introduced in whatever age we suppose it to have been attempted we cannot imagine the christians of that age would have been supine in examining a matter of such consequence and as the scriptures still hold their credit we may fairly conclude that either no such attempt was ever made or that if it was made it was wholly inefficacious  besides many gospels and epistles appeared in different ages of the church and tho some of them had a very evangelical cast and were writings of intrinsic value yet they were rejected by all christians only because they could not produce proofs of their authenticity  but besides these common marks of authenticity the scripture has others peculiar to itself it was translated into all languages it was every where dispersed it was carefully preserved in churches and other public places it was read not only in private but universally in the assemblies of the people its friends had the highest veneration for it as it contained the charter of all their hopes and its enemies held it in the utmost aversion as it combated all their worldly schemes and pretensions nay to such a degree of rancour were its adversaries animated that they often endeavored to destroy it utterly which it is not probable they would have attempted if they could have shown it to have been spurious this would certainly have been a more liberal as well as a more effectual mode of rejection  to the external evidence in proof of the authenticity of scripture may be added no little degree of strength from its internal evidence the simplicity of the writers and of the writings correspond there is the same agreement between the several parts of each book and the general scheme of christianity  an appeal also is often made to extraordinary gifts which in those early times were exercised in the church and surely no impostor would have been forward in making such an appeal if no such gifts had been known  different persons likewise who were then alive are mentioned which afforded a very unnecessary hint for a detection if no such persons had existed  in many of st pauls epistles also a variety of rites and customs are alluded to as then in use which in the next age after the destruction of jerusalem are known to have been totally abolished  but tho the scripture could not be forged might it not have been adulterated  this seems impossible from the variety of sects which sprang up in the earliest times of christianity as these in general persecuted each other they would undoubtedly have joined in clamor against any one sect which had ventured to receive a portion of scripture as genuine which was not universally acknowledged  objections though of no great force have been made to scripture from the disagreement found among the ancient copies of the new testament  but this disagreement consists in general of mere grammatical niceties in one copy a particle is added which is omitted in another of this sort are the greater part of the various readings of the new testament and it could not well be otherwise inaccuracies of this kind are unavoidable and may indeed argue inattention in the transcriber but are surely no argument against the authenticity of the book  the objector argues with more weight when he alleges what he calls the contradictions of scripture one of the sacred writers tells us that our savior ordered his disciples when they preached to take staves another that he ordered them to take none this affirms that at the resurrection two angels were seen that mentions only one and he who will be at the pains of comparing attentively all the evangelical accounts must be obliged to acknowledge they are far from being perfectly harmonious  now where we find such manifest contradictions what are we to say is there any dependence upon books in which they are found  in answer to this objection it might perhaps be no difficult matter to show that these contradictions do not really exist and that the passages which are imagined to contain them may be reconciled but giving the objection its force it has no tendency to overthrow the veracity of the sacred writings it rather indeed concludes in favor of them inasmuch as it shows there was no collusion among the writers such little variations affect neither the doctrine nor the history the doctrine is clearly consistent throughout and the history is evidently in all its material circumstances the same  but where is your inspiration then if the spirit of god directs it will direct even the minutest truth  if it only preserve from error in matters of importance it is surely sufficient to suppose more would be to conceive very grossly of inspiration  having thus endeavored to establish the authenticity of scripture we might rest the proof of the several articles of our creed on its sole authority but as it is one of the various pleas of skepticism to set reason and scripture at variance it will perhaps be more satisfactory to carry our reason along with us in the discussion of these proofs and rest them as we may do in all cases except where our reason is incapable on rational evidence as well as on scriptural authority both reason and scripture have their origin from the same great being and therefore there must be at least so much harmony between them as that one can never contradict the other  lecture iii being of a god proved  from the creation of the world implying design in the whole and all its parts  from the uniformity observed in the preservation of it  from the universal consent of mankind whether we suppose it founded on tradition or consider it as the result of mens own reasoning  atheistical objections from individuals professing atheism  from the apparent injustice of gods government  these objections answered  for just notions of the deity recourse must be had to scripture  the creed begins with a profession of our belief in god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth  the being of a god is one of those truths which scarce require proof a proof seems rather an injury as it supposes doubt however as young minds though not skeptical are uninformed it may not be improper to select out of the variety of arguments which evince this great truth two or three of the most simple  the existence of a deity we prove from the light of nature for his attributes at least in any perfection we must look into scripture  a few plain and simple arguments drawn from the creation of the world  the preservation of it  and the general consent of mankind strike us with more conviction than all the subtilties of metaphysical deduction  we prove the being of a god first from the creation of the world  the world must have been produced either by design or by chance no other mode of origin can be supposed let us see then with which of these characters it is impressed  the characteristic of the works of design is a relation of parts in order to produce an end  the characteristic of the works of chance is just the reverse  when we see stones answering each other laid in the form of a regular building we immediately say they were put together by design but when we see them thrown about in a disorderly heap we say as confidently they have been thrown so by chance  now in the world and all its appendages there is plainly this appearance of design one part relates to another and the whole together produces an end the sun for instance is connected with the earth by warming it into a proper heat for the production of its fruits and furnishing it with rain and dew the earth again is connected with all the vegetables which it produces by providing them with proper soils and juices for their nourishment these again are connected with animals by supplying them with food and the whole together produces the great end of sustaining the lives of innumerable creatures  nor is design shown only in the grand fabric of the world and all its relative appendages it is equally shown in every part it is seen in every animal adapted in all its peculiarities to its proper mode of life it is seen in every vegetable furnished with parts exactly suited to its situation in the least as well as in the greatest of natures productions it is every where apparent the little creeper upon the wall extending its tenacious fibers draws nourishment from the crannies of the stones and flourishes where no other plant could live  if then the world and every part of it are thus marked with the characters of design there can be no difficulty in acknowledging the author of such design  of such amazing contrivance and variety to be a being of infinite wisdom and power we call a man ingenious who makes even a common globe with all the parts of the earth delineated upon it what shall we say then of the author of the great original itself in all its grandeur and furnished with all its various inhabitants  the argument drawn from the preservation of the world is indeed rather the last argument advanced a step farther  if chance could be supposed to produce a regular form yet it is certainly beyond the highest degree of credulity to suppose it could continue this regularity for any time but we find it has been continued we find that near  000 years have made no change in the order and harmony of the world the suns action upon the earth has ever been regular the production of trees plants and herbs has ever been uniform every seed produces now the same fruit it ever did every species of animal life is still the same could chance continue this regular arrangement could any thing continue it but the hand of an omnipotent god  lastly we see this great truth the being of a god witnessed by the general consent of mankind this general consent must arise either from tradition or it must be the result of mens own reasoning upon either supposition it is an argument equally strong if the first supposition be allowed it will be difficult to assign any source of this tradition but god himself if the second it can scarce be supposed that all mankind in different parts of the world should agree in the belief of a thing which never existed for tho doubts have arisen concerning this general belief yet it is now pretty well ascertained from the accounts of travelers that no nation has yet been discovered among whom some traces of religious worship have not been found  be it so says the objector yet still we find single persons even in civilized countries and some of them men of enlarged capacities who have not only had their doubts on this subject but have proclaimed aloud their disbelief of a divine being  we answer that it is more than probable no mans infidelity on this head was ever thoroughly settled bad men rather endeavor to convince themselves than are really convinced  but even on a supposition that a few such persons could be found one of the most remarkable anecdotes of atheism is related of a person at rome who it is said was condemned for his infidelity but had his life repeatedly offered if he would acknowledge a deity he refused and suffered death with constancy mandeville and voltaire both glory in this hero as destroying the whole testimony of martyrs if the fact be true though i know not on what evidence it rests one would suspect his understanding was injured as the whole history of mankind perhaps affords not another such instance   what is their testimony against so great a majority as the rest of mankind the light of the sun is universally acknowledged though it happens that now and then a man may be born blind  but since it seems there are difficulties in supposing a divine creator and preserver of the world what system of things does the atheist suppose attended with fewer he sees the world produced before him he sees it has been created and is preserved some account of this matter must be given if ours displease him let us have his  the experiment has been tried we have had many atheistical creeds none of which has stood the test of being handed down with any degree of credit into future times  the atheists great argument indeed against a deity is levelled at the apparent injustice of his government it was an objection of ancient date and might have had its weight in heathen times but it is one of the blessings which attends christianity that it satisfies all our doubts on this head and gives us a rational and easy solution of this poignant objection what if we observe an inaccurate distribution of the things of this world what if virtue be depressed and vice triumphant it is nothing says the voice of religion to him who believes this life to be an inconsiderable part of his being a point only in the expanse of eternity who believes he is sent into this world merely to prepare himself for a better this world he knows is intended neither for reward nor punishment happiness unquestionably attends virtue even here and misery vice but it is not the happiness of a splendid station but of a peaceful mind nor is it the misery of low circumstances but of a guilty conscience the things of this world are not in their own nature connected either with happiness or misery attended sometimes by one and sometimes by the other they are merely the means of trial one man is tempted with riches and another with poverty but god intends neither an elevated nor a depressed situation as the ultimate completion of his will  besides if worldly prosperity even was the indication of gods favor yet good men may have failings and imprudencies enough about them to deserve misfortune and bad men virtues which may deserve success why should imprudence tho joined with virtue partake of its reward or the generous purpose share in the punishment tho connected with vice  thus then we see the being of a god is the universal creed of nature but tho nature could investigate the simple truth she could not preserve it from error nature merely takes her notions from what she sees and what she hears and has ever molded her gods in the likeness of things in heaven and things on earth hence every part of the creation animate and inanimate has by turns been an object of worship and even the most refined nations we know had gross conceptions on this head the wisest of them indeed by observing the wonders of creation could cloth the deity with wisdom and power but they could go no farther the virtues of their heroes afforded them the highest ideas of perfection and with these they arrayed their gods mixing also with their virtues such vices as are found in the characters of the best of men  for just notions of the deity we must have recourse then to revelation alone revelation removes all these absurdities it dispels the clouds of ignorance and unveils the divine majesty as far as it can be the object of human contemplation the lax notions of libertinism on one hand which make the deity an inobservant governor and the glooming ideas of superstition on the other which suppose him to be a dark malignant being are equally exposed here we are informed of the omniscience and omnipresence of god here we learn that his wisdom and power are equalled by his goodness and that his mercy is over all his works in short we learn from revelation that we are in the hands of a being whose knowledge we cannot evade and whose power we cannot resist who is merciful and good to all his creatures and will be ever ready to assist and reward those who endeavor to conform themselves to his will but whose justice at the same time accompanying his mercy will punish the bold and careless sinner in proportion to his guilt  lecture iv belief in jesus christ  that such a person lived and was the author of a new religion proved from suetonius tacitus and pliny  that this person was the messiah proved from miracles and prophecies  after professing our belief in god the creed proceeds with a profession of our belief in jesus christ his son our lord  a person celebrated as jesus christ was we may suppose would naturally find a place in the profane history of his times it may not be amiss therefore to introduce the evidence we are about to collect with the testimony of some of the more eminent of the heathen writers who have mentioned him they will at least inform us that such a person lived at the time we assert and that he was the author of a new religion  i shall quote only suetonius tacitus and pliny  suetonius in vita claud caes tell us that the emperor claudius drove all the jews from rome who at the instigation of one christ were continually making disturbances  tacitus lib    speaking of the persecution of christians tells us that the author of that name was christ who was put to death by pontius pilate in the reign of tiberius  plinys lib  0 testimony is more large it is contained in a letter written to the emperor trajan desiring his instructions with regard to christians he blames their obstinacy in refusing to sacrifice to the roman deities  but from their own confession can draw nothing but that they assemble on a certain day before sun rise  that they pay divine honors to christ as a god  that they bind themselves by a sacrament not to steal nor to commit adultery nor to deceive  and that after the performance of these rites they join in one common meal nay he examined he says two of them by torture yet still he finds nothing obnoxious in their behavior except their absurd superstitions he thinks however the matter should be inquired into for christianity had brought religion into great disuse the markets were crowded with victims and scarce a purchaser came near them  these writers afford us sufficient testimony that jesus christ lived at the time we assert and that he was the author of a new religion they had opportunities of being well informed could have no interest in falsifying were no converts to the new sect but talk of christ only as they would of any singular person whom they had occasion to mention their testimony therefore is beyond cavil  let us now proceed a step farther and examine the scripture evidence of christ which proves not only his existence but that he is our lord or the messiah  and not only that he was the author of a new religion but that this religion is true  upon examining the grand scripture evidence on this head we find the greatest stress laid upon miracles and prophecies both of which are direct appeals to god by a claim to supernatural power the heathen had the same idea of a miracle and ascribed every thing he saw which was contrary to the common order of nature to some miraculous power thunder issuing from a stormy sky was in the usual course of things but when  de part serena intonuit  it was beyond nature and immediately became a miracle    and though both these modes of evidence are calculated as well for us who live in remoter times as for those who lived in the earliest yet the evidence from miracles seems more particularly addressed to them as that from prophecy is to us they were the eyewitnesses of the miracles of the gospel of which we have only the evidence at second hand whereas prophecy is a mode of evidence which increases through every age the early christians had it in part but to us this amazing web is still more unfolded and more of its wonderful texture displayed  let us examine each in its order  among the eyewitnesses of the gospel miracles were many learned men as well as unlearned the former had opportunity and abilities to examine the works before them to trace out fraud if any such were latent and did unquestionably receive them with all that circumspection which was due to such wonderful exhibitions before they embraced the christian faith while the most ignorant spectator was a competent judge of matter of fact and many of our saviors miracles were such as could not possibly from the nature of the facts themselves be colored with fraud  it had a strange sound to the prejudices of mankind that a crucified malefactor was the savior of the world and we cannot suppose that any man much less that a multitude of men would embrace such a belief without clear conviction especially as no worldly advantage lay on the side of this belief and the convert even renounced the world and embraced a life of persecution  let us consider the single miracle of christs resurrection jesus had frequently mentioned it before his death and the thing was so far in general credited that the sepulcher was sealed and an armed guard appointed to watch it we may well suppose therefore that his favorers would naturally upon this occasion reason thus jesus has now put his pretensions upon a fair issue he has told us he will arise from the dead on the third day  here then let us suspend our judgment and wait the result three days will determine whether he be an impostor or the real messiah  it is very natural to suppose that the favorers of jesus would reason after his death in a manner like this and it is beyond credibility that any of them would have continued his disciples had they found him falsifying in this point but we know they did continue his disciples after this we know also that many proselytes convinced by this very event embraced the christian religion  we have all the reason in the world therefore to believe that they were fully satisfied his miracles were to them a sufficient proof of his pretensions all candid men would have acquiesced as they did and in their belief we have a very strong foundation for our own  again with regard to prophecy we observe that the writers of the old testament seem in various parts to characterize some extraordinary person who was in process of time to make his appearance in the world the marks are peculiar and can neither be mistaken nor misapplied he was to be born of a virgin  he was to turn the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just  though dignifyed with the characters of a prince he was to be a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  tho described to be without sin he was to be numbered with transgressors  his hands and his feet were to be pierced  he was to be made an offering for sin  and was never to see corruption  these prophecies were published many hundred years before the birth of christ and had been all along in the hands not only of the jews but of all men of letters the old testament had been early translated into the greek language and received into the politest libraries of those times  with these ideas let us open the new testament and it is obvious that no picture can be more like its original than these prophecies of christ in one testament are to his history in the other here we see that extraordinary virginbirth unravelled  here we see a life spent in turning the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just  here we find the prince of his people a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  here we see the lord of righteousness numbered with transgressors  we see his hands and his feet pierced  we see him made an offering for sin  and we see realized that extraordinary idea of death without corruption  it were an easy matter to carry this comparison through a more minute detail of circumstances but i mean only to trace the outlines of this great resemblance to complete the picture would be a copious work  besides these predictions which related immediately to the life and death of christ there were many others which deserve notice among these the two great leading prophecies were those of the calling of the gentiles and of the dispersion of the jews  the calling of the gentiles was one of the earliest prophecies of the old testament the jews were distinguished in appearance as the favorite people of god and they were sufficiently elated upon that distinction but if they had attended closely to their prophets they might have discovered that all the prophecies which described the happy state of the church had evidently a more distant prospect than to them those early promises in particular which were repeated to the patriarchs were not merely confined to their posterity but included all the nations of the earth see genesis    iii    xviii    xviii    iv  and when the later prophets as the great event approached spoke a plainer and a more intelligible language the whole nation might have understood as simeon and some of the wisest and most intelligible of them did understand that a light was sprung up to lighten the gentiles  the prophecy of the dispersion of the jewish nation is also very ancient being attributed by moses to the patriarch jacob the scepter shall not depart from judah until shiloh come whatever may be the precise meaning of the word scepter in the original and though it may not perhaps properly signify that idea of regal power which it conveys to our ears yet it certainly means some badge of authority that implies a formed and settled government and as to the word shiloh all commentators jewish as well as christian explain it to mean the messiah  the sense therefore of the prophecy is plainly this  that the jews should continue in the form of a society till the time of the messiah accordingly we find that soon after christs death the scepter did depart from judah the jews lost all form of a political society and are a singular instance of a people scattered over the whole earth preserved to this day separate from all other people and yet without a settlement any where  our saviors prophecy of the growth of his church is likewise among the more remarkable predictions he told his disciples that his religion was like a grain of mustard seed which was the least of all seeds but when it grew up it should become a great tree and the fowls of the air should lodge in the branches of it he told them also that the gates of hell should never prevail against it  the jewish religion was continually enforced by the idea of a jealous god watching over it and threatening judgments from heaven upon every transgression the divine authority was stamped openly upon it the people trembled and worshipped  when the impostor mahomet set up for a reformer he could not indeed enforce his religion by divine judgments but he did it by temporal he drew his sword and held it to the breasts of his opposers while he promised to the obedient a full gratification of their passions  but in the christian religion nothing of this kind appeared no temporal judgments threatened on one hand no sensual indulgences allured on the other a few desponding ignorant mechanics the disciples of a person crucified as a common malefactor were all the parade with which this religion was ushered into the world and all the human assistance which it had to boast  and yet this religion which opposed the strongest prejudices and was opposed by the greatest princes made its way in a few years from a remote corner through the whole roman empire  thus was our saviors prophecy in opposition to all human calculation exactly fulfilled the least of all seeds became a spreading tree and a church was established which could not be destroyed by all the powers of hell  but although the church of christ could not be destroyed it was corrupted and in a course of years fell from its genuine purity this corrupt state of it  the delusions of popery  the efforts of reformation and various other circumstances relating to it are not unreasonably supposed to be held forth in the prophetic parts of the new testament  but i forbear to dwell upon prophephecies which are not obvious enough to carry general conviction tho many of them have been well explained by those see bp newtons dissertations and bp hurds sermons on prophecy who are versed in the histories to which they allude future times will in all probability reflect a stronger light upon them some of the great prophecies which we have just considered shone but with a feeble ray during the times they were fulfilling though they now strike us in so forcible a manner  lecture v objections to miracles and prophecies  marks of distinction between true and false miracles  between true and false prophecies  the truth of religion founded upon the combined force of its whole evidence  against the evidence arising from miracles and prophecy we are well aware of what the deist objects  that false miracles have been wrought by impostors and fallacious prophecies given out by oracles  and that we cannot suppose the miracles and prophecies of the bible to be better founded or in any degree a more respectable criterion of truth  we answer that a very palpable distinction may be established  first the true miracle must fall under the examination of mens natural senses see lesleys short method with deists  when a priest displays a phial full of blood which sometimes congeals and sometimes liquifies he has no right to our credit unless he submit his phial to our examination but when a man is raised from the dead when a man is cured of blindness when two or three thousand people are fed by a pittance there can be no deception our senses which are the only competent judges have the means of judging  secondly the true miracle must be performed before credible witnesses a business huddled up in a cloister before a few interested monks is not properly attested but when an action is performed before the public eye as most of the miracles of christ were or before witnesses who have totally exculpated themselves of having any end but that of truth we have all the attestation we could wish  thirdly the true miracle must have an elevated end in view when we hear of a miracle abetting the interest of some little corrupt society we cannot suppose the almighty concerned in such an event but the miracles of the gospel had other ends they were employed to usher in an event on which depended the salvation of mankind  fourthly the true miracle must be handed down by authentic records which take their rise at the time when the miracle was performed see lesleys short method with deists a vague tradition or an undated legendary tale is no record but the christian may with great propriety appeal to the scriptures which he first proves were written at the time when the events they relate were performed  lastly the torture of question tends greatly to authenticate the real miracle the false one abhors inquiry at the reformation detections were abundant but after the most rigorous question the gospelmiracles have maintained their credit through the space of seventeen hundred years  having thus pointed out a few topics of distinction between true and false miracles it is as easy to point them out between true and false prophecies  the true prophecy like the true miracle has a more elevated end and a more enlarged plan  when we meet with a prophecy the avowed end of which is to satisfy some trivial curiosity or abet the designs of some ambitious leader suspicion must needs take the alarm this was evidently the character of the ancient oracles however directed whether by bad men or bad spirits they certainly spoke as they were paid or intimidated but in the prophecies of the bible we find a different style marked neither by interested views nor by servile compliances they advance uniformly the same great end which its miracles also proposed the salvation of a ruined world  secondly neither men nor evil spirits ever gave an instance of the power of foretelling future events upon any enlarged plan what were the decisions of oracles but quibling answers to some present question or opinions to which human foresight was equal or at best the predictions of events confined to some short span of time when did any oracle foretell an event a thousand years before its completion or from which of them do we find a series of prophecy issuing through different ages the whole concurring in one point and yet in every particular exactly fulfilled  thus much in answer to the particular objections of the deist but let me farther add as a caution against his arts that we mean not to ground the truth of our religion upon detached parts even upon miracles and prophecies considered alone but upon the whole scheme and combined force of its evidence in this way we judge of every thing else and when we judge otherwise we shall probably make a false estimate who would judge of a building from a column or of a country from a field and yet in this partial view the deist chiefly forms his cavils and imagines he has gained a complete victory when he tells us that the miracles of the gospel are marked with the same characters as the sorceries of evil spirits and its prophecies are just as incredible as the divinations of oracles we should recommend it to him therefore to enlarge his views and examine the whole chain of evidence from the earliest accounts of time  let him first consider that remarkable promise of bruising the serpents head which was given as soon as the transgression was committed this was the first dawn of hope which god vouchsafed to a guilty world and though the figurative language under which it is couched was dubious and obscure yet its meaning though not fully understood was easily conceived to contain some promise of victory over the adversary of mankind  in a few ages after its meaning was more opened and the hopes of an infantworld thus raised were increased by a very remarkable promise that in the issue of one of the patriarchs all the nations of the earth should be blessed and what is still more remarkable the promise was repeated three several times  here not only a victory over an enemy was announced but a state of happiness in some shape was declared  let him next trace these hopes still increasing and opening more and more through every age in the patriarchal history the sacrifice of isaac the deliverance from egypt the promised land and a variety of other incidents have much more dignity and meaning when we consider them not barely as history but as typical events leading the mind forward in the contemplation of some great scheme  still more will he find these hopes excited by the types and ceremonies of the jewish law which seem to have had little meaning if they had no concealed one and by the sacrifices which prevailed over the greatest part of the known world  all pointing strongly at a particular mode of salvation through a mediator an atonement and an offering for sin  when he has examined these silent notices let him next survey the prophetic writers of the old testament here he will find the same ideas  only expressed in bolder language and a savior now pointed out as we have see page    just seen by very peculiar characteristics  he will find too among the heathen philosophers historians and poets plato who lived about  00 years before christ is one of the earliest writers in whom we have any traits of this kind he tells us that it is necessary a divine instructor should teach us to pray alcib  d that as every creature is governed by a nature superior to its own as beasts are by men so it is necessary that this divine instructor who teaches man what he could not know himself must be of a nature superior to man that is divine de leg l    that he must come recommended to us by none of the advantages of this world but by virtue alone that the wickedness of men would not bear his instructions and reproof and that within   or   years after he began to preach he should be persecuted imprisoned scourged and put to death de repub   one would imagine plato had made a transcript from the   d chapter of isaiah it is remarkable that he uses the word  which may signify either to be crucified or to be cut in pieces like a sacrifice  suctonius in the life of vespatian has this remarkable expression percrebuerat orient toto vetus and constans opinio esse in fatis ut eo tempore judaea profecti rerum potirentur  tacitus lib   speaks almost the same language pluribus persuasio inerat antiquis socerdotum literis contineri ipso tempore fore ut valesceret oriens prosectiq judaea rerum potirentar  suetonius also in the life of augustus cap    alluding to the same opinion  st tells us that a child in such a year should be brought forth and should be a king of the romans upon which says he senatum exterritum censuisse ne quis illo anno genitus educaretur eos autem qui gravidas uxores haberent quo ad se quisq spem traherat curasse ne senatus consultum ad ararium deferretur  it was an opinion also of this kind that spirited up lentulus to aid catilines conspiracy the sibylline oracles spoke of a king about to rise at that time which different people interpreted in different ways and lentulus as his interests led supposed the oracle had respect to the cornelian family this his enemies brought as a crime against him taxing him with certain vaunting speeches quos ille habere solitus erat ex libris sybyllinis regnum romae tribus corneliis portendi sal rell cat  all these notions tully as a philosopher ridicules quidvis potius ex illis libris quam regem proserant quem romae post haec nec dii nec homines esse patientur  among the more remarkable passages in antiquity on this subject is the pollio of virgil i shall not enter into any enquiry about the cumean sibyl whether virgil got the substance of these verses from some of her remains nor if he did how she came by them it is enough for my purpose that a strong intimation of an extraordinary personage to be born at this time is found in the works of a heathen poet some of the strongest passages i shall quote  magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo jam redit et virgo redeunt saturnia regna jam nova progenies coelo demittitur alto tu modo nascenti puero quo ferrea primum desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo casta fave lucina  te duce si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri irrita perpetua solvent formidine terras ille deum vitam accipiet  peccatumq reget patriis virtutibus orbem occidet and serpens  the following lines  flavescit campus arista incultisq rubens pendebit sentibus uva  nec magnos metuent armenta leones seem to be a transcript from the prophet isaiahs ideas expressing the tranquillity and happiness which should take possession of all nature upon the coming of the messiah instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the briar shall come up the myrtletree  the wolf shall dwell with the lamb the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the young lion and the fatling together  i shall conclude these passages from the ancient writers of greece and rome with one which is said to be exactly translated from confusius though for myself i rather doubt its authenticity how sublime are the ways of the holy one what a noble course is opening before us what laws rites and sacred solemnities but how shall men observe them if he does not set the example his coming alone can prepare us for them the paths of virtue will never be frequented till the holy one consecrate them by his own footsteps  see memoirs concerning the history etc of the chinese by the missionaries of pelin vol   paris        many very remarkable traits however they came by them of the expectation of some great instructor  thus prepared let him take up the new testament and compare all these notices and prophecies with the history of christ has he the candor to acknowledge any light reflected from one to the other can he account for all these remarkable resemblances remarkable they certainly are in any more consistent way or will he venture to allow that a chain of evidence descends thus far unbroken  if he has weighed all this with serious attention it will not perhaps now give him so much offense to examine the miracles of the gospel as the united parts of a regular plan they may probably appear to him now in a more advantageous light and though he may not be inclined to allow them that consequence for which we contend yet he must certainly allow they make another link in this chain of evidence to which they give and from which they receive additional strength  he may also consider that from the writers of the new testament issued a new series of prophecies which afterages have seen as exactly fulfilled as those of the old  having thus examined the external evidence of the christian religion let him consider farther its strong dr maclain and other able writers have shown in their remarks upon a late very ingenious and in many respects very valuable performance that to rest the cause of christianity merely upon its internal evidence is a very injurious mode of proof   internal evidence arising from many sources but particularly from the purity of its doctrine let him heartily ask himself if he does not think the christian religion bears all those marks of holiness and purity which he might expect from a revelation of gods will what religion was ever calculated to make man happy like the christian if it should even be denied that it makes individuals happier from the many restraints which it lays upon them although these restraints are in fact only the dictates of reason yet no one certainly can deny its direct tendency to promote the happiness of society all solicitude about the things of this world all ambitious desires every little sinister interest and with these every ground of contention and every source of unhappiness is removed while every motive to benevolence is inculcated in a word to make themselves as happy as this world can make them men need only become christians  nor let him end his enquiries here let him next consider that this religion was sealed by the blood of innumerable martyrs for although martyrdom in general is rather an evidence of the sincerity of the sufferer than of the truth of the opinion yet the case of the early martyrs was different they suffered not in support of opinions but in attestation either of matter of fact or of original information in which they could not be deceived  let his views open still farther and discover to him this religion agreeable to the predictions of its author taking possession of great part of the known world against all the opposition of its enemies and without any worldly assistance let him see the heathen deities in all places giving ground before it  their rites and ceremonies abolished  and the use of sacrifice every where ceasing upon the completion of its end  let him have recourse for these things to his profane history  there also let him be informed of the total dispersion of the jewish nation agreeable to the predictions he had read in his bible  a nation which having been a mere vehicle to introduce the christian religion immediately disperses and loses all form of a political society when that religion becomes established  let him seriously and attentively examine all this chain of evidence to which indeed many other links might be added and he must acknowledge that it is not a pert cavil against some particular miracle a quaint objection to some obscure text or an illiberal jest at the mysteries of religion that can break it it hangs so strong so firm and so connected from the very beginning of time to this present moment that he who examines it thoroughly link by link and the connection of the whole must either think it sufficiently strong to hang his faith upon it or must leave himself under the imputation of having a very bad head or a very bad heart  lecture vi conception and birth of christ  virgin mary  circumstances and reality of christs death  descent into hell  a passage in st peter explained  the resurrection of christ  not inconsistent with reason  the fact stated  the plea of the disciples  that of the chief priests refuted  acts of pilate  modern objections examined  that the whole was a pious fraud  that it was done only before a few chosen witnesses  bounds of evidence  christ did not lie three complete days and nights in the grave  we have now shown upon what foundation we believe the second article of our creed let us next consider the remaining articles  the history of christ as delivered in scripture and the benefits which he procured for us  the assistance of the holy spirit  the remission of our sins  and everlasting life  first then we believe that christ was conceived of the holy ghost and born of the virgin mary the manner of this miraculous conception we inquire not into it is a point not only beyond the limits of human inquiry but to us at least a point very unimportant we believe just the scripture account of it and assure ourselves that if it had concerned us it would have been more plainly revealed  one thing however we may observe on this head that nothing is said in scripture of paying divine honors to the virgin mary those rites are totally of popish origin  we farther believe that christ suffered under pontius pilate was crucified dead and buried and that he descended into hell  that is we declare our belief of the scriptureaccount of the circumstances and the reality of christs death  to make an action clear it is necessary first to establish its date this is usually done by ranging it under the magistrate who then presided the time of whose government is always registered in some public record  thus we believe that christs death happened when pontius pilate was governor of judea we believe also with regard to the manner of his death that he was crucified that he died as really as any mortal ever did and that he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea isaiah foretold he should make his grave with the rich and st matthew tells us that   matt xxvii    isaiah liii     the descent into hell is undoubtedly a more obscure expression than might be wished in a creed and was not indeed added till many ages after the creed was first composed see binghams antiquities vol iii c    but as creeds are human compositions we believe this and every other difficulty only as consistent with scripture now the sense which seems most agreeable to scripture is that his soul remained till his resurrection in that place whatever that place is where the spirits of the blessed rest and the expression seems to have been added only that we may the more strongly express our belief of the reality of his death this we do when we express our belief of the separation of his soul and body he was buried  and descended into hell the first expression relates to his body which was laid in the grave the second to his soul which passed into the place of departed spirits  we farther believe that on the third day he rose again from the dead the resurrection of christ from the dead is a point of the utmost importance to christians on the certainty of christs resurrection depend all hopes of our own on this article therefore we shall be more large  and in the first place what is there in it that need shock our reason it was a wonderful event but is not nature full of wonderful events when we seriously weigh the matter is it less strange that a grain of corn thrown into the ground should die and rise again with new vegetation than that a human body in the same circumstances should assume new life the commonness of the former makes it familiar to us but not in any degree less unaccountable are we at all more acquainted with the manner in which grain germinates than with the manner in which a body is raised from the dead and is it not obviously striking that the same power which can effect the one may effect the other also  but analogy though it tend to convince is no proof let us proceed then to matter of fact  that the body was dead and safely lodged in the tomb and afterward conveyed out of it was agreed on both by those who opposed and by those who favored the resurrection in the circumstances of the latter fact they differ widely  the disciples tell their story  a very plain and simple one  that scarce expecting the event notwithstanding their master had himself foretold it they were surprised with an account that the body was gone  that they found afterward to their great astonishment that their master was again alive  that they had been several times with him and appealed for the truth of what they said to great numbers who as well as themselves had seen him after his resurrection  the chief priests on the other side declared the whole to be a forgery asserting that the plain matter of fact was the disciples came by night and stole the body away while the soldiers slept  such a tale unsupported by evidence would be listened to in no court of justice it has not even the air of probability can it be supposed that the disciples who had fled with terror when they might have rescued their masters life would venture in the face of an armed guard to carry off his dead body  or is it more probable that they found the whole guard asleep when we know that the vigilance of sentinels is secured by the strictest discipline  besides what advantage could arise from such an attempt if they miscarried it was certain ruin both to them and their cause if they succeeded it is difficult to say what use they could make of their success unless they could have produced their dead body alive the second error would be worse than the first their masters prophecy of his own resurrection was an unhappy circumstance yet still it was wrapped in a veil of obscurity but if his disciples endeavored to prove its completion it was their business to look well to the event a detection would be such a comment upon their masters text as would never be forgotten  when a cause depends on falsehood every body knows the less it is moved the better  this was the case of the other side obscurity there was wanted if the chief priests had any proof why did they not produce it why were not the disciples taken up and examined upon the fact they never absconded why were they not judicially tried why was not the trial made public and why were not authentic memorials of the fraud handed down to posterity as authentic memorials were of the fact recorded at the very time and place where it happened christianity never wanted enemies to propagate its disparagement  but nothing of this kind was done no proof was attempted  except indeed the testimony of men asleep the disciples were never questioned upon the fact and the chief priests rested satisfied with spreading an inconsistent rumor among the people impressed merely by their own authority  whatever records of heathen origin remain evince the truth of the resurrection one is very remarkable pontius pilate sent the emperor tiberius a relation of the death and resurrection of christ which were recorded at rome as usual among other provincial matters this intelligence made so great an impression it seems upon the emperor that he referred it to the senate whether jesus christ of judea should not be taken into the number of the roman gods  our belief of this fact is chiefly founded upon the testimony of justin martyr and tertullian two learned heathens in the age succeeding christ who became christians from this very evidence among others in favor of christianity in their apologies just mart apol ad anton p  tertull apol cap    still extant one of which was made to the senate of rome the other to a roman governor they both appeal to these records of pontius pilate as then generally known which we cannot conceive such able apologists would have done if no such records had ever existed the acts of pilate as they are called are often treated with contempt for no reason that i know i never met with any thing against them of more authority than a sneer probable they certainly were and a bare probability when nothing opposes it has its weight but here the probability is strengthened by no small degree of positive evidence which if the reader wishes to see collected in one point of view i refer him to the article of christs suffering under pontius pilate in bishop pearsons exposition of the creed  among other authorities that of the learned commentator on eusebius is worth remarking fuere genuina pilati acta ad quae provocabant primi christiani tanquam ad certissima fidei monumenta     having seen what was of old objected to the resurrection of christ it may be proper also to see the objections of modern disbelievers  and first we have the stale objection that nothing is more common among the propagators of every new religion than to delude their ignorant proselytes with idle stories what a variety of inconsistent tales did the votaries of heathenism believe what absurdities are adopted into the mohammedan creed to what strange facts do the vulgar papists give credit and can we suppose better of the resurrection of christ than that it was one of those pious frauds intended merely to impose upon the people and advance the credit of the new sect  this is just as easily said as that his disciples stole him away while the guard slept both are assertions without proof but this objection i trust we have already answered when we endeavored to establish certain topics of distinction between true and false miracles see page      others have objected christs partial discovery of himself after his resurrection if he had boldly shown himself to the chief priests or publicly to all the people we might have had a more rational foundation for our belief but as he had only for his witnesses upon this occasion a few of his chosen companions the thing has certainly a more secret appearance than might be wished  this insinuation is founded upon a passage in the acts of the apostles in which it is said that god showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god the question is what is meant by witnesses chosen before of god certainly nothing more than persons expressly and by particular designation intended to be the witnesses of this event others might see him if they pleased but these were not the people to whom god showed him openly this particular designation was confined to the chosen witnesses  and is there any thing more in this than we see daily in all legal proceedings does not every body wish to have the fact about which he is concerned authenticated by indubitable records or by living testimony if it can be had do we not procure the hands of witnesses appointed to this purpose in all our deeds and writings  let us not however answer the objection by an arbitrary explanation of the text but let us compare this explanation with the matter of fact  on the morning of the resurrection the apostles who ran to the sepulcher to make themselves acquainted with what they had heard received a message from their master injoining them to meet him in galilee it does not appear that this message was conveyed with any secrecy it is rather probable it was not and that the disciples told it to as many as they met the women it is expressly said told it to the eleven and all the rest who the rest were does not appear but it is plain from the sequel that the thing was generally known and that as many as chose either to satisfy their faith or gratify their curiosity repaired for that purpose to galilee and thus we find st peter making a distinction between the voluntary and the chosen witness  between those who had companied with the apostles all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among them from his baptism till his ascension and those who were ordained to be the witnesses of his resurrection acts i      st paul goes farther and in express words tells us that christ was seen   cor xv after his resurrection of above five hundred brethren at once and it is probable from the expression at once that he was seen at different times by many more  if then christ thus appeared in galilee to as many as chose to see him or even if he appeared only to five hundred people of whom st paul tells us the greatest part were still alive when he wrote his epistle there can surely be no reasonable cause of offense at his appearing besides these to a few of his chosen companions who attended by express appointment as persons designed to record the event  in fact if the same method be pursued in this inquiry which is usual in all others the evidence of these chosen companions is all that is necessary here are twelve men produced in general three or four men are thought sufficient on whose evidence the fact depends are they competent witnesses have they those marks about them which characterise men of integrity can they be challenged on any one ground of rational exception if not their evidence is as strictly legal as full and as satisfactory as any reasonable man can require  but in this great cause we see the evidence is carried still farther here are five hundred persons waiting without ready to add their testimony if any one should require it to what has already been more than legally proved so that the argument even addresses itself to that absurd distinction which we often find in the cavils of infidelity between rem certam and rem certissimam  upon the whole then we may affirm boldly that this great event of the resurrection of christ is founded upon evidence equal to the importance of it if we expect still more our answer is upon record if ye believe not moses and the prophets gods ordinary means of salvation neither will ye be persuaded though one rose from the dead  there must be bounds in all human evidence and he who will believe noting unless he have every possible mode of proof must be an infidel in almost every transaction of life with such persons there is no reasoning they who are not satisfied because christ did not appear in open parade at jerusalem would farther have asked if he had appeared in the manner they expected why did he not appear to every nation upon earth or perhaps why he did not show himself to every individual  to these objections may be added a scruple taken from a passage of scripture in which it is said that christ should lie three days and three nights in the heart of the earth whereas in fact he only lay two nights one whole day and a part of two others  but no figure in speech is more common than that of putting a part for the whole in the hebrew language perhaps this license is more admissable than in any other a day and a night complete one whole day and as our savior lay in the ground a part of every one of these three portions of time he might be said by an easy liberty of speech to have lain the whole  lecture vii christs ascension into heaven  last judgment  fruitless inquiries relative to it  scripture representation of this great event  belief in the holy ghost  its operations  scripture doctrine of the assistance we receive from it  heathen opinions on this point  we believe farther that christ ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of god  christs ascension into heaven rests on the same kind of proof as his resurrection both of them are events which the apostles were ordained to witness but though their testimony in this case as well as in the resurrection is certainly the most legal and authentic proof and fully sufficient for any reasonable man yet this does not exclude the voluntary testimony of others it is evident that the apostles were not the sole eyewitnesses of this event for when st peter called together the first assembly of the church to choose a successor to judas iscariot he tells them they must necessarily choose one out of those men who had been witnesses of all that christ did from his baptism till his ascension and we find there were in that meeting an hundred and twenty persons see acts i    thus qualified  be it however as it will if this article should rest on a less formal proof than the resurrection it is of no great consequence for if the resurrection be fully proved nobody can well deny the ascension if the testimony of the evangelists be allowed to prove the one their word may be taken to establish the other  with regard to the right hand of god it is a scriptural expression used merely in conformity to our gross conceptions and is not intended to imply any distinction of parts but merely the idea of preeminence  we believe farther that christ shall come to judge the quick and the dead  this article contains the most serious truth that ever was revealed to mankind in part it was an article of the heathen creed to uninlightened nature it seemed probable that as we had reason given us for a guide we should hereafter be accountable for its abuse and the poets who were the prophets of early days and durst deliver those truths under the veil of fable which the philosopher kept more to himself give us many traits of the popular belief on this subject see particularly the  th book of virgils aen but the gospel alone threw a full light upon this awful truth  in examining this great article the curiosity of human nature ever delighting to explore unbeaten regions has often been tempted beyond its limits into fruitless inquiries scrutinizing the time of this event and settling with vain precision the circumstances of it all curiosity of this kind is idle at least if not presumptuous when the almighty has thrown a veil over any part of his dispensation it is the folly of man to endeavor to draw it aside  let us then leave all fruitless inquiries about this great event and employ our thoughts chiefly upon such circumstances of it as most concern us  let us animate our hopes with the soothing reflection that we have our sentence in a manner in our own power  that the same gracious gospel which directs our lives shall direct the judgment we receive  that the same gracious person shall be our judge who died for our sins  and that his goodness we are assured will still operate toward us and make the kindest allowances for all our infirmities  but lest our hopes should be too buoyant let us consider on the other hand what an awful detail against us will then appear the subject of that grand enquiry will be all our transgressions of known duty  all our omissions of knowing better  our secret intentions  our indulged evilthoughts  the bad motives which often accompany our most plausible actions  and we are told even our idle words  he that has ears to hear let him hear  then shall it be known whether we have answered the great ends of life  whether we have made this world subservient to a better  whether we have prepared ourselves for a state of happiness in heaven by endeavoring to communicate happiness to our fellow creatures upon earth whether we have restrained our appetites and passions and reduced them within the bounds of reason and religion or whether we have given ourselves up to pleasure gain or ambition and formed such attachments to this world as fit us for nothing else and leave us no hopes either of gaining or of enjoying a better it will be happy for us if on all these heads of inquiry we can answer without dismay  worldly distinctions we know will then be of no avail the proudest of them will be then confounded naked came we into the world and naked must we return we can carry nothing beyond the grave but our virtues and our vices  i shall conclude what has been said on the last judgment with a collection of passages on this head from scripture where only our ideas of it can be obtained and though most of these passages are figurative yet as figures are intended to illustrate realities and are indeed the only illustrations of which this subject is capable we may take it for granted that these figurative expressions are intended to convey a just idea of the truth  with a view to make the more impression upon you i shall place these passages in a regular series though collected from various parts  the lord himself shall descend from heaven with his holy angels  the trumpet shall sound and all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and come forth  then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and all nations shall be gathered before him  the books shall be opened and men shall be judged according to their works  they who have sinned without law shall perish that is be judged without law and they who have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law  unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required  then shall he say to them on his right hand come ye blessed inherit the kingdom prepared for you and to them on his left depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels  then shall the righteous shine forth in the presence of their father while the wicked shall go into everlasting punishment there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth  what manner of persons ought we then to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the day of our lord when the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat  wherefore beloved seeing that we look for such things let us be diligent that we may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless that each of us may receive that blessed sentence well done thou good and faithful servant thou have been faithful over a little enter thou into the joy of thy lord  we believe farther in the holy ghost that is we believe every thing which the scriptures tell us of the holy spirit of god  we inquire not into the nature of its union with the godhead we take it for granted that the father the son and the holy ghost have some kind of union and some kind of distinction because both this union and this distinction are plainly pointed out in scripture but how they exist we inquire not concluding here as in other points of difficulty that if a clearer information had been necessary it would have been afforded  with regard to the operations of the holy spirit of god besides which little more on this head is revealed we believe that it directed the apostles and enabled them to propagate the gospel  and that it will assist all good men in the conscientious discharge of a pious life  the scripturedoctrine with regard to the assistance we receive from the holy spirit of god which is the most essential part of this article is briefly this  our best endeavors are insufficient we are unprofitable servants after all and cannot please god unless sanctified and assisted by his holy spirit hence the life of a good man has been sometimes called a standing miracle something beyond the common course of nature to attain any degree of goodness we must be supernaturally assisted  at the same time we are assured of this assistance if we strive to obtain it by fervent prayer and a pious life if we trust in ourselves we shall fail if we trust in god without doing all we can ourselves we shall fail likewise and if we continue obstinate in our perverseness we may at length totally incapacitate ourselves from being the temples of the holy ghost  and indeed what is there in all this which common life does not daily illustrate is any thing more common than for the intellect of one man to assist that of another is not the whole scheme of education an infusion of knowledge and virtue not our own is it not evident too that nothing of this kind can be communicated without application on the part of the learner are not the efforts of the teacher in a manner necessarily proportioned to this application if the learner becomes languid in his pursuits are not the endeavors of the teacher of course discouraged and will they not at length wholly fail if it be found in the end they answer no purpose  in a manner analogous to this the holy spirit of god cooperates with the endeavors of man our endeavors are necessary to obtain gods assistance and the more earnestly these endeavors are exerted the measure of this grace will of course be greater but on the other hand if these endeavors languish the assistance of heaven will lessen in proportion and if we behave with obstinate perverseness it will by degrees wholly fail it will not always strive with man but will leave him a melancholy prey to his own vicious inclinations  as to the manner in which this spiritual assistance is conveyed we make no inquiry we can as little comprehend it as we can the action of our souls upon our bodies we are sensible that our souls do act upon our bodies and it is a belief equally consonant to reason that the divine influence may act upon our souls the advocate for natural religion need not be reminded that among the heathens a divine influence was a received opinion the priests of every oracle were supposed to be inspired by their gods and the heroes of antiquity were universally believed to act under the influence of a supernatural assistance by which it was conceived they performed actions beyond human power non haec humanis opibus non art magistra major agit deus atque opera ad majora remittit aen xii     nunquam vir magnus sine divino afflatu cic non comptae mansere comae sed pectus anhelum et rabie fera corda tument majorque videri nec mortale sonans afflata est numine quando jam propiore dei  aen vi    nay the great christian doctrine that the assistance of heaven was to be obtained by prayer is not certainly contrary to the dictates of reason thus the priestess of apollo cried out to aeneas who presented himself to beg the assistance of the god  cessas in vota precesque tros ait aeneas cessas neque enim ante dehiscent attonitae magna ora domus    immediately upon which  gelidus taneris per dura cucurrit ossa tremor

forgiveness of sins  scripturedoctrine of sin and guilt  satisfaction of christ analogous to nature  sacrifice considered  first in the light of a type  secondly as a deduction of human reason  useless inquiries into the manner of christs satisfaction  different kinds of sin  ignorance  negligence  surprise  habitual  presumptuous  we believe farther in the holy catholic church and the communion of saints  i believe in the holy catholic church is certainly a very obscure expression to a protestant as it is very capable of a popish construction implying our trust in the infallibility of the church whereas we attribute infallibility to no church upon earth the most obvious sense therefore in which it can be considered as a protestant article of belief is this that we call no particular society of christians a holy catholic church but believe that all true and sincere christians of whatever communion or particular opinion shall be the objects of gods mercy the patriarchal covenant was confined to a few the jewish church stood also on a very narrow basis but the christian church we believe is truly catholic its gracious offers are made to all mankind and god through christ will take out of every nation such as shall be saved  the communion of saints is an expression equally obscure and whatever might have been the original meaning of it it certainly does not resolve itself into a very obvious one to us if we say we mean by it that good christians living together on earth should exercise all offices of charity among themselves no one will contradict the article but many perhaps may ask why is it made an article of faith it relates not so much to faith as to practice and the ten commandments might just as well be introduced as articles of our belief  to this i can only suggest that it may have a place among the articles of our creed as a test of our enlarged ideas of christianity and as opposed to the narrowmindedness of some christians who harbor very uncharitable opinions against all who are not of their own church and scruple not to show their opinions by uncharitable actions the papists particularly deny salvation to any but those of their own communion and persecute those of other persuasions where they have the power  in opposition to this we profess our belief of the great christian law of charity we believe we ought to think charitably of good christians of all denominations and ought to practice a free and unrestrained communion of charitable offices toward them  in this light the second part of the article depends upon the first by the holy catholic church we mean all sincere christians of whatever church or peculiarity of opinion and by the communion of saints a kind and charitable behavior toward them  though it is probable this was not the original meaning of the article yet as the reformers of the liturgy did not think it proper to make an alteration we are led to seek such a sense as appears most consistent with scripture  we are assured that this article as well as the descent into hell is not of the same antiquity as the rest of the creed see binghams antiq vol iv chap     we profess our belief farther in the forgiveness of sins  the scripturedoctrine of sin and of the guilt which arises from it is this  man was originally created in a state of innocence yet liable to fall had he persevered in his obedience he might have enjoyed that happiness which is the consequence of perfect virtue but when this happy state was lost his passions and appetites became disordered and prone to evil since that time we have all been more or less involved in sin and are all therefore in the scripture language under the curse that is we are naturally in a state of unpardoned guilt  in this mournful exigence what was to be done in a state of nature it is true we might be sorry for our sins nature too might dictate repentance but sorrow and repentance though they may put us on our guard for the future can make no atonement for sins already committed a resolution to run no more into debt may make us cautious but can never discharge a debt already contracted thus mr jenyns expresses the same thing the punishment of vice is a debt due to justice which cannot be remitted without compensation repentance can be no compensation it may change a wicked mans dispositions and prevent his offending for the future but can lay no claim to pardon for what is past if any one by profligacy and extravagance contracts a debt repentance may make him wiser and hinder him from running into farther distresses but can never pay off his old bonds for which he must be ever accountable unless they are discharged by himself or some other in his stead view of the inter evid p         in this distress of nature jesus christ came into the world he threw a light upon the gloom that surrounded us  he showed us that in this world we were lost  that the law of nature could not save us  that the tenor of that law was perfect obedience with which we could not comply  but that god through his mediation offered us a method of regaining happiness  that he came to make that atonement for us which we could not make for ourselves  and to redeem us from that guilt which would otherwise overwhelm us  that faith and obedience were on our parts the conditions required in this gracious covenant  and that god promised us on his the pardon of our sins and everlasting life  that we were first therefore to be made holy through the gospel of christ and then we might expect salvation through his death us who were dead in trespasses and sins would he quicken christ would redeem us from the curse of the law by grace we should be saved through faith and that not of ourselves it was the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast  this doctrine is generally called the satisfaction or the atonement of christ and has given more offense to the deist than almost any part of the christian scheme could not god he cries forgive us freely and save us without an expedient which sounds so harshly in our ears the son of god comes down upon earth and suffers death  for what why to take upon himself the sins of man and in the scripture phrase to nail them to his cross  this is surely unbecoming language how can any one presume to assert that we may be forgiven freely unless he can perfectly scan and thoroughly understand gods whole scheme of moral government what do we know of the nature of unatoned sin and guilt or of the immutable laws of eternal justice can the deist give us any account of these things or can he reconcile sin and justice in so satisfactory a manner even to human reason as the scripture does in the account it gives us of the fall of man and of his restoration through christ nothing is more easy than to cavil nothing more difficult than to form a consistent plan in opposition to the truth  again how can the deist talk of the redemption of the world by christ as an expedient that sounds so harshly in our ears it is true it is an astonishing event and in all its greatness wholly new and unparallelled but yet when god has revealed it to us our reason totally closes with it we are reconciled to it by observing it analogous to gods whole scheme of moral government and to the use of sacrifices which every where prevailed in the world  what is the whole state of infancy and youth from one end to the other but a continued scene of preventing and of rescuing from evils at the expense of pains and care and suffering in the master the friend the parent or whoever acts the part of the kind mediator  how many again after they are advanced in life do we daily see brought into such circumstances that without the friendly mediation of their fellow creatures they would be totally ruined some through the means of others are relieved from painful disorders under which they might have languished to the end of life others again through their follies and excesses have brought their affairs into such a state of ruin as could never be redeemed unless their friends by an expensive mediation should interfere  these instances and many others that might be drawn from the circle and commerce of human life and many in which innocence suffers for guilt shows at least that the sufferings of christ for mankind and the redemption of the world through those sufferings are analogous to that stated order of things and ordinary course of moral government which god has established in the world if our reason be not shocked in one case why should it be so in the other  let us then take in the whole scheme of things and not garble it as we please let us boldly and atheistically call gods whole plan of moral government a scheme of folly and impotence and not with the inconsistency of a timid deist allow one part and question the rest  the deist may be farther asked what he thinks of the origin of sacrifices a sacrifice is a rite so apparently absurd that one would hardly imagine any one could prescribe it to himself and yet we know that all nations however remote and unconnected with each other joined in it with one consent  let us press the deist a little upon this head whence is it does he think that all the world has joined in so strange a rite as that of putting an innocent creature to death to appease the anger of an incensed god it would be endless to quote passages from heathen writers i shall just mention a few which first occur when horatius killed his sister livy tells us he was pardoned quibusdam piacularibus sacrificiis factis lib    dido proposing to appease jupiter orders one of her attendants  pecudes secum and monstrata piacula ducat aen iv      the idea of an atonement is thus strongly expressed by virgil unum pro multis dabitur caput  aen v      but still stronger is a passage in caesar where speaking of the human sacrifices of the germans he says pro vita hominis nisi vita hominis reddatur non posse aliter deorum immortalium numen placari arbitrantur publicaq ejusdem generis habent instituta sacrificia caes com lib vi   can he give any rational account of its origin and institution  or is he constrained to allow with us that the only rational account of this matter is that the use of sacrifices was instituted by god himself and injoined to our first parents immediately upon the fall and so continued as a type of that great sacrifice which was afterward to be offered for the sins of men  a type we know is intended as an introduction to the thing typified and men through all ages from father to son have acquiesced in a practice without knowing from whence they had it that they might silently fulfill though without intending it the secret purposes of heaven which meant by this rite to introduce gradually the idea of that great sacrifice which was to be made for the sins of the world and which however late it became visible was slain in effect from the foundation of the world and began unquestionably to operate for the good of man from the instant of the fall sacrifices might perhaps then be what the lords supper now is a sort partaking of the body and blood of christ and what is still more remarkable the type became universally abolished wherever it became fulfilled  does the unbeliever acquiesce in this account of the origin of sacrifice or will he rather resolve it into some general deduction of human reason and attribute it to the mere invention of man  be it so on this ground let us follow him and on this ground he must at least allow that the use of sacrifice proves all mankind to have had from nature an idea that they stood in need of other merits besides their own to redeem them from sin  that the light of reason pointed the necessity of some atonement to make up their own deficiences  and that offering the life of an innocent creature for their transgressions came the nearest of any thing they could conceive to the idea of such an atonement  thus this great article of our faith though so offensive to many of the advocates for reason appears both similar to gods moral government and agreeable to the general sense of mankind god is the same yesterday to day and for ever and a connection a uniformity and analogy run through all his works if it was in our power to trace them with accuracy and precision  if the unbeliever still inquires farther and cannot acquiesce without a plain account of the manner in which the death of christ satisfies god for the sins of the world we must here be constrained to leave him in such inquiries he will rarely meet with satisfaction but let him be consistent let him be an universal skeptic let him doubt a future state let him doubt the immortality of his soul let him doubt even his own existence for which of these things can he explain  if we think justly we should distinguish between what is and what is not capable of proof let us try the truth of scripture by every method that human reason can invent but let us not imagine that human reason can comprehend the whole system of the christian religion we enter freely into a rational proof of the being of a god but we do not presume to comprehend his attributes what relates to man in the scheme of our redemption is very clear gods part indeed is beyond our comprehension but with this we have little to do what is it to us in what manner god performs this gracious work our concern lies nearer home god has offered us the pardon of our sins and everlasting life through the merits of christ but if in the niceness of our casuistry we reject this offer  we may have reason to repent  if we reject it through negligence we certainly shall  that we may have a more complete view of the danger of sin the cause of our misery and of our saviors death i shall conclude this article with enumerating its several kinds  and first i shall mention the lightest in this catalogue sins of ignorance a man may commit a sin without knowing it he may have his doubts at the time of acting without the means of solving them his ignorance does not alter the nature of the action in itself though it mitigates the guilt in him such sins indeed one would hope are small offenses in the eyes of a merciful god  and yet st paul heavily bewails his having persecuted the church of christ notwithstanding he did it ignorantly but st paul had few sins to repent of but those of ignorance  sins of negligence are more involved in guilt not to use the opportunities we have argues great coolness in religion and great inattention to our duty  and on this head we should be much upon our guard for many sins which may perhaps appear to be those of ignorance only may in fact be charged upon our own negligence and want of attention to those means of knowing better which god has afforded us  next to these we may rank sins of surprise into which we are commonly betrayed by some sudden temptation sins of this kind should be sincerely repented of and manfully withstood  if through our indulgence we suffer them to get ground upon us they are no longer sins of surprise they change their name and must be classed under the head of habitual sins  habitual sins are stained with a very high degree of guilt when we thus become the slaves of vice our minds are tainted and the sense of religion is lost even smaller sins when their fibers are thus woven into our nature attain enormous growth of this also we may be assured that when we have thus lost the command of ourselves we may proceed any length  if a proper temptation arises what is there to check us  we may be carried to the last degree of wickedness to which the scriptures give the name of presumptuous sins  by presumptuous sins are meant those black crimes which have no want of knowledge to excuse  no sudden temptation to extenuate but are acted with deliberate contrivance in open defiance of law conscience and religion and attended with all those horrid circumstances which show the last depravity of human nature  from the guilt of every kind of sin let us guard with all our care in presumptuous sins none of us i should hope can well be involved the mind yet unhardened starts with horror at such black transgressions let us then always endeavor to keep alive this quick sensibility and preserve ourselves at least from habitual sins for these are what first corrupt us if we are not entangled in these we may hope that all our sins of negligence and surprise if we guard against them as well as human frailty will permit may find forgiveness through the merits of christ at the hands of that god who knowing the infirmities of his creatures is not extreme to mark what they have done amiss  lecture ix immortality of the soul  agreeable to reason  resurrection of the body  scripture doctrine on this head  application of it  future state of happiness  how described in scripture  future state of misery  the eternity of it a doctrine of reason  scripture account of it  application of the doctrine  we believe farther in the resurrection of the body  this article presumes our belief in the immortality of the soul  what that principle of life is which we call the soul how it is distinguished from mere animal life how it is connected with the body and in what state it subsists when its bodily functions cease are among those indissoluble questions with which nature every where abounds but notwithstanding the difficulties which attend the discussion of these questions the truth itself has in all ages of the world been the popular creed men believed their souls were immortal from their own feelings so impressed with an expectation of immortality  from observing the progressive state of the soul capable even after the body had attained its full strength of still higher improvements both in knowledge and in habits of virtue  from the analogy of all nature dying and reviving in every part  from their situation here so apparently incomplete in itself and from a variety of other topics which the reason of man was able to suggest  but though nature could obscurely suggest this great truth yet christianity alone threw a clear light upon it and impressed it with a full degree of conviction upon our minds  but the article before us proceeds a step farther it not only implies the immortality of the soul but asserts the resurrection of the body  nor was this doctrine wholly new to nature in its conceptions of a future life we always find the soul in an imbodied state it was airy indeed and bloodless but still it had the parts of a human body and could perform all its operations  in these particulars the scripture does not gratify our curiosity from various passages we are led to believe that the body shall certainly rise again but in what manner or of what substance we pretend not to examine we learn that it is sown in corruption and raised in incorruption that it is sown in dishonor and raised in glory that it is sown a natural body and raised a spiritual body from all which we gather that whatever sameness our bodies may have they will hereafter take a more spiritualized nature and will not be subject to those infirmities to which they were subject on earth farther on this head it behooves us not to inquire  instead therefore of entering into any metaphysical disquisitions of identity or any other curious points in which this deep subject might engage us all which as they are founded upon uncertainty must end in doubt it is better to draw this doctrine as well as all others into practical use and the use we ought to make of it is to pay that regard to our bodies which is due to them  not vainly to adorn  not luxuriously to pamper them but to keep them as much as possible from the pollutions of the world and to lay them down in the grave undefiled there to be sealed up in expectation of a blessed resurrection  lastly we believe in the life everlasting in which article we express our faith in the eternity of a future state of rewards and punishments  this article is nearly related to the last and is involved in the same obscurity in what the reward of the virtuous will consist after death our reason gives us no information conjecture indeed it will in a matter which so nearly concerns us and it has conjectured in all ages but information it has none except from the word of god and even there our limited capacities can receive it only in general and figurative expressions we are told there will then reign fullness of joy and pleasures for evermore  that the righteous shall have an inheritance incorruptible undefiled that fades not away  where they shall shine forth as the sun in the presence of their father  where error and sin and misery shall be no more  where shall be assembled an innumerable company of angels the general assembly of the church the spirits of just men made perfect  that they shall neither hunger nor thirst any more  that all tears shall be wiped from their eyes  that there shall be neither death nor sorrow nor pain  from these and such expressions as these though we cannot collect the entire nature of a future state of happiness yet we can easily gather a few circumstances which must of course attend it as that it will be very great  that it will last for ever  that it will be of a nature entirely different from the happiness of this world  that as in this world our passions and appetites prevail in the next reason and virtue will have the superiority  hunger and thirst tears and sorrow we read will be no more  that is all uneasy passions and appetites will then be annihilated  all vain fears will be then removed  all anxious and intruding cares  and we shall feel ourselves complete and perfect and our happiness not dependent as here upon a thousand precarious circumstances both within and without ourselves but consistent uniform and stable  on the other hand we pretend not to inquire in what the punishment of the wicked consists in the scripture we find many expressions from which we gather that it will be very great it is there called an everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels  where the worm dies not and the fire is never quenched  where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  where the wicked shall drink of the wrath of god poured without mixture into the cup of his indignation  where they shall have no rest neither by day nor night  though it becomes us certainly to put our interpretations with the greatest caution and humility upon such passages as these yet the worm that never dies and the fire that is never quenched are strong expressions and hardly to be evaded by any refinements of verbal criticism let the deist bravely argue down his fears by demonstrating the absurdity of consuming a spirit in material fire let him fully explain the nature of future punishment and convince us that where it cannot reform it must be unjust  but let us with more modesty lay our hands humbly upon our breasts confess our ignorance revere the appointments of god whatever they may be and prepare to meet them with holy hope and trembling joy and awful submission to his righteous will  to the unenlightened heathen the eternity of future punishments appeared no such unreasonable doctrine their state of the damned was of eternal duration a vulture for ever tore those entrails which were for ever renewed  rostroq immanis vultur obunco immortale jecur tundens foecundaq poenis viscera  aen vi      sedet aeternumq sedebit infelix theseus  ib       of one thing however we may be well assured which may set us entirely at rest in all our enquiries on this deep subject that every thing will in the end be right  that a just and merciful god must act agreeably to justice and mercy  and that the first of these attributes will most assuredly be tempered with the latter  from the doctrine of future rewards and punishments the great and most convincing practical truth which arises is that we cannot exert too much pains in qualifying ourselves for the happiness of a future world as this happiness will last for ever how beneficial will be the exchange  this world which is but for a moment for that everlasting weight of glory which fades not away  vice on the other hand receives the greatest discouragement from this doctrine as every sin we commit in this world may be considered as an addition to an everlasting account in the next  lecture x the ten commandments  not a complete rule of duty  division of them and short commentary upon them  our duty to god  belief  fear  love  objections to the goodness of god  measures of the love of god  having considered the articles of our faith we proceed to the rules of our practice these we know are of such importance that let our faith be what it will unless it influence our lives it is of no value at the same time if it be what it ought to be it will certainly have this influence  on this head the ten commandments are first placed before us from which the composers of the catechism as well as many other divines have drawn a complete system of christian duties but this is perhaps rather too much in the fourth volume of bishop warburtons commentary on popes works in the second satyr of dr done are these lines of whose strange crimes no cannonist can tell in which commandments large contents they dwell   the original says the bishop is more humurous  in which commandments large receipt they dwell as if the ten commandments were so wide as to stand ready to receive every thing which either the law of nature or the gospel commands a just ridicule on those practical commentators as they are called who include all moral and religious duties within them   both moses in the law and christ in the gospel seem to have enlarged greatly on morals and each of them especially the latter to have added many practical rules which do not obviously fall under any of the commandments  but though we cannot call the decalogue a complete rule of duty we accept it with the utmost reverence as the first great written law that ever god communicated to man we consider it as an eternal monument inscribed by the finger of god himself with a few strong indelible characters not defining the minutiae of morals but injoining those great duties only which have the most particular influence upon the happiness of society and prohibiting those enormous crimes which are the greatest sources of its distress  the ten commandments are divided into two parts from their being originally written upon two tables from hence one table is supposed to contain our duty to god the other our duty to man but this seems to be an unauthorized division and has a tendency to a verbal mistake as if some duties were owing to god and others to man whereas in fact we know that all duties are equally owing to god  however if we avoid this misconception the division into our duty to god and our duty to man may be a convenient one  the four first commandments are contained in the first table the remaining six in the second  at the head of them stands a prohibition to acknowledge more than one god  the second commandment bears a near relation to the first the former forbids polytheism the latter idolatry and with this belief and practice which generally accompanied each other all the nations of the earth were tainted when these commandments were given especially those nations by whom the jews were surrounded  the third commandment injoins reverence to gods name this is a strong religious restraint in private life and as a solemn oath is the strictest obligation among men nothing can be of greater service to society than to hold it in general respect  the fourth commands the observance of the sabbath as one of the best means of preserving a sense of god and of religion in the minds of men  the second table begins with injoining obedience to parents a duty in a peculiar manner adapted to the jewish state before any regular government was erected the temporal promise which guards it and which can relate only to the jews may either mean a promise of long life to each individual who observed the precept or of stability to the whole nation upon the general observance of it which is perhaps a better interpretation  the five next commandments are prohibitions of the most capital crimes which pollute the heart of man and injure the peace of society  the first of them forbids murder which is the greatest injury that one man can do another as of all crimes the damage in this is the most irreparable  the seventh commandment forbids adultery the black infidelity and injury which accompany this crime the confusion in families which often succeeds it and the general tendency it has to destroy all the domestic happiness of society stain it with a very high degree of guilt  the security of our property is the object of the eighth commandment  the security of our characters is the object of the ninth  the tenth restrains us not only from the actual commission of sin but from those bad inclinations which give it birth  after the commandments follows a commentary upon them entitled our duty to god and our duty to our neighbor the latter of which might more properly be entitled our duty to our neighbor and ourselves  these seem intended as an explanation of the commandments upon christian principles with the addition of other duties which do not properly fall under any of them on these we shall be more large  the first part of our duty to god is to believe in him which is the foundation of all religion and therefore offers itself first to our consideration but this great point has been already considered see page      the next branch of our duty to god is to fear him the fear of god is impressed equally upon the righteous man and the sinner but the fear of the sinner consists only in the dread of punishment it is the necessary consequence of guilt and is not that fear which we consider as a duty the fear of god here meant consists in that reverential awe that constant apprehension of his presence which secures us from offending him  when we are before our superiors we naturally feel a respect which prevents our doing any thing indecent in their sight such only in a higher degree should be our reverence of god in whose sight we know we always stand if a sense of the divine presence has such an influence over us as to check the bad tendency of our thoughts words and actions we may properly be said to be impressed with the fear of god  if not we neglect one of the best means of checking vice which the whole circle of religious restraint affords  some people go a step farther and say that as every degree of light behavior though short of an indecency is improper before our superiors so is it likewise in the presence of almighty god who is so much superior to every thing that can be called great on earth  but this is the language of superstition mirth within the bounds of innocence cannot be offensive to god he is offended only with vice vice in the lowest degree is hateful to him but a formal set behavior can be necessary only to preserve human distinctions  the next duty to god is that of love which is founded upon his goodness to his creatures even this world mixed as it is with evil exhibits various marks of the goodness of the deity most men indeed place their affections too much upon it and rate it at too high a value but in the opinion even of wise men it deserves some estimation the acquisition of knowledge in all its branches the intercourse of society the contemplation of the wonderful works of god and all the beauteous scenes of nature nay even the low inclnations of animal life when indulged with sobriety and moderation furnish various modes of pleasure and enjoyment  let this world however go for little in contemplating a future life the enjoyments of this are lost it is in the contemplation of futurity that the christian views the goodness of god in the fullest light when he sees the deity engaging himself by covenant to make our short abode here a preparation for our eternal happiness hereafter  when he is assured that this happiness is not only eternal but of the purest and most perfect kind  when he sees god as a father opening all his stores of love and kindness to bring back to himself a race of creatures fallen from their original perfection and totally lost through their own folly perverseness and wickedness then it is that the evils of life seem as atoms in the sunbeam the divine nature appears overflowing with goodness to mankind and calls forth every exertion of our gratitude and love  that the enjoyments of a future state in whatever those enjoyments consist are the gift of god is sufficiently obvious but with regard to the government of this world there is often among men a sort of infidelity which ascribes all events to their own prudence and industry things appear to run in a stated course and the finger of god which acts unseen is never supposed  and no doubt our own industry and prudence have a great share in procuring for us the blessings of life god has annexed them as the reward of such exertions but can we suppose that such exertions will be of any service to us unless the providence of god throw opportunities in our way all the means of worldly happiness are surely no other than the means of his government moses saw among the jews a kind of infidelity like this when he forbad the people to say in their hearts my power and the might of my hands has gotten me this wealth whereas he adds they ought to remember that it is the lord who gives power to get wealth  others again have objected to the goodness of god his permission of evil a good god say they would have prevented it and have placed his creatures in a situation beyond the distresses of life  with regard to man there seems to be no great difficulty in this matter it is enough surely that god has put the means of comfort in our power in the natural world he has given us remedies against hunger cold and disease and in the moral world against the mischief of sin even death itself the last great evil he has shown us how we may change into the most consummate blessing a state of trial see page    etc therefore and a future world seem easily to set things to rights on this head  the misery of the brute creation is indeed more unaccountable but have we not the modesty to suppose that this difficulty may be owing to our ignorance and that on the strength of what we know of the wisdom of god we may venture to trust him for those parts which we cannot comprehend  one truth after all is very apparent that if we should argue ourselves into atheism by the untractableness of these subjects we should be so far from getting rid of our difficulties that if we reason justly ten thousand greater would arise either from considering the world under no ruler or under one of our own imagining  there remains one farther consideration with regard to the love of god and that is the measure of it we are told we ought to love him with all our heart with all our soul and with all our strength these are strong expressions and seem to imply a greater warmth of affection than many people may perhaps find they can exert the affections of some are naturally cool and little excited by any objects the guilty person is he whose affections are warm in every thing but religion  the obvious meaning therefore of the expression is that whether our affections are cool or warm we should make god our chief good  that we should set our affections more upon him than upon any thing else  and that for his sake and for the sake of his laws we should be ready to resign every thing we have and even life itself so that the words seem nearly of the same import with those of the apostle set your affections on things above and not on things on the earth  lecture xi observance of the sabbath  jewish sabbath  difference between it and the christian sabbath  moral ends of the sabbath  public worship  on what reasons it is founded  sabbath a mean of instruction  trust in god  honor due to gods name  objections against the use of oaths answered  perjury  cursing  common swearing  our next duty to god is to worship him to give him thanks to put our whole trust in him and to call upon him  we have here the duty of prayer recommended to us but i shall have occasion in treating of the lords prayer to speak more fully hereafter on this subject what i shall say at present shall be confined to the observance of the sabbath  the jewish sabbath was instituted to commemorate the creation of the world and the redemption from egypt these great events which it held out impressed upon the people a strong sense of gods power their dependence upon him and the propriety of worship  the great event held out by the christian sabbath is the resurrection of christ and for this reason the christian has changed his sabbath from the seventh day of the week to the first  there is another distinction between the jewish and the christian sabbath the former was observed with that ceremonial strictness which ran through the whole jewish law the more liberal spirit of the gospel has freed the christian sabbath from these observances and retains only its moral ends public worship and instruction by these ends therefore our sabbath is regulated and nothing profanes it but what opposes them  on the head of public worship much might be said  it is a testimony of that reverence which is due to the supreme being the general sense of mankind considers it as such the heathen nations always approached their gods in public assemblies the respect of a public resort on solemn occasions is paid even to earthly princes  if it tends therefore in any degree to impress an idea of reverence it is certainly due on all occasions where the almighty is concerned  an attendance also on the public service of the church is giving a public testimony of our faith it is that test which society demands of all its members by the laws of the community it is exacted and it tends undoubtedly to create a confidence among men  these public assemblies are also a kind of connecting bond among christians every part of the service points out that love and union which should subsist among them it places them in the light of children of one common parent joining with one consent in begging blessings which concern them all  public worship also is particularly accommodated to deprecate national calamities and implore national blessings as closet devotion is more the vehicle of our private requests it is commonly also esteemed the most animated species of devotion as the zeal of one may be supposed to excite the zeal of another  in the generality indeed of our cold unanimated assemblies little of this is seen but if we were present at an assembly where every member was really in earnest we must be much unacquainted with the spirit of devotion if we did not in some degree catch the flame  we must also particularly remember that great stress is laid upon this species of devotion in scripture where we read frequently of assemblies meeting to praise god on the first day of the week  nor is it perhaps unreasonable to suppose that public devotion draws gods favor in a peculiar manner upon our prayers where two or three are gathered together says christ there am i in the midst of them  secondly the sabbath is the great mean of instruction if people of education in this enlightened age think instruction of less consequence to them yet at least they must think it of great use to the vulgar it is a common opinion and the better for being so that were it not for the sabbath religion itself would be lost and if people of superior stations do not give the observance of it their sanction it will not long have credit among the vulgar  since therefore the observance of the sabbath is founded upon so many wise and just reasons what have they to answer for who not only neglect this institution themselves but bring it by their example into contempt with others i speak not to those who make it a day of common diversion who laying aside all decency and breaking through all civil and religious regulations spend it in the most licentious amusements such people are past all reproof but i speak to those who in other things profess themselves to be serious people and one might hope would act right when they were convinced what was so  but our prayers whether in public or in private are only an idle parade unless we put our trust in god  by putting our trust in god is meant depending upon him as our happiness and our refuge  human nature is always endeavoring either to remove pain or if ease be obtained to acquire happiness and those things are certainly the most eligible which in these respects are the most effectual the world it is true makes us flattering promises but who can say that it will keep them we consist of two parts a body and a soul both of these want the means of happiness as well as the removal of evil but the world cannot even afford them to the body its means of happiness to those who depend upon them as such are in a thousand instances unsatisfying even at best they will fail us in in the end while pain diseases and death show us that the world can afford no refuge against bodily distress and if it cannot afford the means of happiness and of security to the body how much less can we suppose it able to afford them to the soul  nothing then we see in this world is a sufficient foundation for trust nor indeed can any thing be but almighty god who affords us the only means of happiness and is our only real refuge in distress on him the more we trust the greater we shall feel our security and that man who has on just religious motives confirmed in himself this trust wants nothing else to secure his happiness the world may wear what aspect it will it is not on it that he depends as far as prudence goes he endeavors to avoid the evils of life but when they fall to his share as sooner or later we must all share them he resigns himself into the hands of that god who made him and who knows best how to dispose of him on him he thoroughly depends and with him he has a constant intercourse by prayer trusting that whatever happens is agreeable to that just government which god has established and that of consequence it must be best  we are injoined next to honor gods holy name  the name of god is accompanied with such ideas of greatness and reverence that it should never pass our lips without suggesting those ideas indeed it should never be mentioned but with a kind of awful hesitation and on the most solemn occasions either in serious discourse or when we invoke god in prayer or when we swear by his name  in this last light we are here particularly injoined to honor the name of god a solemn oath is an appeal to god himself the poets rule in the drama is exactly what ought to be the christians in the use of oaths nec deus interfit nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit    and is entitled to our utmost respect were it only in a political light as in all human concerns it is the strongest test of veracity and has been approved as such by the wisdom of all nations  some religionists have disapproved the use of oaths under the idea of profaneness the language of the sacred writers conveys a different idea one of them says an oath for confirmation is an end of all strife another i take god for record upon my soul and a third god is my witness  to the use of oaths others have objected that they are nugatory the good man will speak the truth without an oath and the bad man cannot be held by one and this would be true if mankind were divided into good and bad but as they are generally of a mixed character we may well suppose that many would venture a simple falsehood who would yet be startled at the idea of perjury they who attend our courts of justice often see instances among the common people of their asserting roundly what they will either refuse to swear or when sworn will not assert     as an oath therefore taken in a solemn manner and on a proper occasion may be considered as one of the highest acts of religion so perjury or false swearing is certainly one of the highest acts of impiety and the greatest dishonor we can possibly show to the name of god it is in effect either denying our belief in a god or his power to punish other crimes wish to escape the notice of heaven this is daring the almighty to his face  after perjury the name of god is most dishonored by the horrid practice of cursing its effects in society it is true are not so mischievous as those of perjury nor is it so deliberate an act but yet it conveys a still more horrid idea indeed if there be one wicked practice more peculiarly diabolical than another it is this for no employment can be conceived more suitable to infernal spirits than that of spending their rage and impotence in curses and execrations if this shocking vice were not so dreadfully familiar to our ears it could not fail to strike us with the utmost horror  we next consider common swearing a sin so universally practiced that one would imagine some great advantage in the way either of pleasure or profit attended it the wages of iniquity afford some temptation but to commit sin without any wages is a strange species of infatuation  may we then ask the common swearer what the advantages are which arise from this practice  it will be difficult to point out one  perhaps it may be said that it adds strength to an affirmation but if a man commonly strengthen his affirmations in this way we may venture to assert that the practice will tend rather to lessen than confirm his credit it shows plainly what he himself thinks of his own veracity we never prop a building till it becomes ruinous  some forward youth may think that an oath adds an air and spirit to his discourse that it is manly and important and gives him consequence we may whisper one secret in his ear which he may be assured is a truth  these airs of manliness give him consequence with those only whose commendation is disgrace others he only convinces at how early an age he wishes to be thought profligate  perhaps he may imagine that an oath gives force and terror to his threatenings  in this he may be right and the more horribly wicked he grows the greater object of terror he may make himself on this plan the devil affords him a complete pattern for imitation  paltry as these apologies are i should suppose the practice of common swearing has little more to say for itself  those however who can argue in favor of this sin i should fear there is little chance to reclaim  but it is probable that the greater part of such as are addicted to it act rather from habit than principle to deter such persons from indulging so pernicious a habit and to show them that it is worth their while to be at some pains to conquer it let us now see what arguments may be produced on the other side  in the first place common swearing leads to perjury he who is addicted to swear on every trifling occasion cannot but often i had almost said unavoidably give the sanction of an oath to an untruth and though i should hope such perjury is not a sin of so heinous a nature as what in judicial matters is called wilful and corrupt yet it is certainly stained with a very great degree of guilt  but secondly common swearing is a large stride toward wilful and corrupt perjury in as much as it makes a solemn oath to be received with less reverence if nobody dared to take an oath but on proper occasions an oath would be received with respect but when we are accustomed to hear swearing the common language of our streets it is no wonder that people make light of oaths on every occasion and that judicial commercial qualifying and official oaths are all treated with so much indifference  thirdly common swearing may be considered as an act of great irreverence to god and as such implying also a great indifference to religion if it would disgrace a chief magistrate to suffer appeals on every trifling or ludicrous occasion we may at least think it as disrespectful to the almighty  if we lose our reverence for god it is impossible we can retain it for his laws you scarce remember a common swearer who was in other respects an exact christian  but above all we should be deterred from common swearing by the positive command of our savior which is founded unquestionably upon the wickedness of the practice you have heard says christ that it has been said by them of old time thou shall not forswear thyself but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne neither by the earth for it is his footstool but let your communication that is your ordinary conversation be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these comes of evil  st james also with great emphasis pressing his masters words says above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest you fall into condemnation  i shall just add before i conclude this subject that two things are to be avoided which are very nearly allied to swearing  the first is the use of light exclamations and invocations upon god on every trivial occasion we cannot have much reverence for god himself when we treat his name in so familiar a manner and may assure ourselves that we are indulging a practice which must weaken impressions that ought to be preserved as strong as possible  secondly such light expressions and wanton phrases as sound like swearing are to be avoided and are often therefore indulged by silly people for the sake of the sound who think if they think at all that they add to their discourse the spirit of swearing without the guilt of it such people had better lay aside together with swearing every appearance of it these appearances may both offend and mislead others and with regard to themselves may end in realities at least they show an inclination to swearing and an inclination to vice indulged is really vice  lecture xii honor due to gods word  books of scripture  patriarchal history  jewish history  prophetic writings  poetical and moral  new testament  history of christ and the early age of the church  epistles and revelations  use and application of scripture  what it is to serve god truly  what it is to serve him all the days of our life  as we are injoined to honor gods holy name so are we injoined also to honor his holy word  by gods holy word we mean both the old testament and the new the connection between them is so close that no man can pay a regard to the one without paying it also to the other the new testament is not only of the same texture with the old but the very same web as it were only more unfolded  the books of the old testament open with the earliest accounts of time earlier than any human records reach and yet in many instances they are strengthened by human records the heathen mythology is often grounded upon remnants of the sacred story and many of the bibleevents are recorded however imperfectly in profane history the very face of nature bears witness to the deluge  in the history of the patriarchs is exhibited a most beautiful picture of the simplicity of ancient manners and of genuine nature unadorned indeed by science but impressed strongly with a sense of religion this gives an air of greatness and dignity to all the sentiments and actions of these exalted characters  the patriarchal history is followed by the jewish here we have the principal events of that peculiar nation which lived under a theocracy and was set apart to preserve and propagate see the subject very learnedly treated in one of the first chapters of jenkinss reasonableness of christianity the knowledge of the true god through those ages of ignorance antecedent to christ here too we find those types and representations which the apostle to the hebrews calls the shadows of good things to come  to those books which contain the legislation and history of the jews succeed the prophetic writings as the time of the promise drew still nearer the notices of its approach became stronger the kingdom of the messiah which was but obscurely shadowed by the ceremonies of the jewish law was marked in stronger lines by the prophets and proclaimed in more intelligible language the office of the messiah his ministry his life his actions his death and his resurrection are all very distinctly held out it is true the jews explaining the warm figures of the prophetic language too literally and applying to a temporal dominion those expressions which were intended only as descriptive of a spiritual were offended at the meanness of christs appearance on earth and would not own him for that messiah whom their prophets had foretold though these very prophets when they used a less figurative language had described him as he really was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  to these books are added several others poetical and moral which administer much instruction and matter of meditation to devout minds  the new testament contains first the simple history of christ as recorded in the four gospels in this history also are delivered those excellent instructions which our savior occasionally gave his disciples the precepts and the example blended together  to the gospels succeeds an account of the lives and actions of some of the principal apostles together with the early state of the christian church  the epistles of several of the apostles particularly of st paul to some of the new established churches make another part our savior had promised to endow his disciples with power from on high to complete the great work of publishing the gospel and in the epistles that work is completed the truths and doctrines of the christian religion are here still more unfolded and enforced as the great scheme of our redemption was now finished by the death of christ  the sacred volume is concluded with the revelations of st john which are supposed to contain a prophetic description of the future state of the church some of these prophecies it is thought on very good grounds are already fulfilled and others which now as sublime descriptions only amuse the imagination will probably in the future ages of the church be the objects of the understanding also  such is the word of god which we are injoined to honor and this honor we may be assured is best shown by applying these holy writings to the uses for which god intended them we should take the bible into our hands as we should approach a divine instructor with a habit of mind  not to cavil  not to create objections  not to quote wantonly  not to apply to ludicrous purposes all which is certainly dishonouring it but with a pious inclination to improve our hearts by learning from it the duties of christianity  by learning from it how to live and how to die  this divine book furnishes a great variety of matter for our meditation it is profitable we are told for doctrine for reproof for correction and instruction when we find in it moral rules laid down for our conduct we should compare our actions with those rules and where motives are assigned we should try our hearts by these too and examine whether they are right in the sight of god when it instructs us to have our conversation in heaven and to set our affections on things above we ought to examine ourselves whether heaven or the world is more the object of our desires when the mercies of the gospel are recited they should raise our joy our love and thankfulness and when we read the denunciations of gods wrath against sin our minds should receive with reverence the awful impression when the good actions of holy men are recorded we should consider them as recorded for our example and when their frailties are recited these should teach us diffidence and humility in short our fears our hopes our faith our joy our love and gratitude have all sufficient objects to engage them it should be our great endeavor to transfuse the spirit of this holy book into our lives and he who can do this the best may be assured that he honors it the most  the last part of our duty to god is to serve him truly all the days of our life  to serve god truly all the days of our life implies two things first the mode of this service and secondly the term of it  first we must serve god truly we must not rest satisfied with the outward action but must take care that every action be founded on a proper motive it is the motive alone that makes an action acceptable to god the hypocrite may fast twice in the week and give alms of all that he possesses nay he may fast the whole week if he be able and give all he has in alms but if his fasts and his alms are intended as matter of ostentation only neither the one nor the other is that true service which god requires god requires the heart he requires that an earnest desire of acting agreeably to his will should be the general spring of our actions and this will give even an indifferent action a value in his sight  as we are injoined to serve god truly so are we injoined to serve him all the days of our life as far as human frailties will permit we should persevere in a constant tenor of obedience that lax behavior which instead of making a steady progress is continually relapsing into former errors and running the same round of sinning and repenting is rather the life of an irresolute sinner than of a pious christian human errors and frailties we know god will not treat with too severe an eye but he who in the general tenor of his life does not keep advancing toward christian perfection but suffers himself at intervals entirely to lose sight of his calling cannot be really serious in his profession he is at a great distance from serving god truly all the days of his life and has no scriptural ground to hope much from the mercy of god  that man whether placed in high estate or low has reached the summit of human happiness who is truly serious in the service of his great master the things of this world may engage but cannot engross his attention its sorrows and its joys may affect but cannot disconcert him no man he knows can faithfully serve two masters he has hired himself to one  that great master whose commands he reveres whose favor he seeks whose displeasure alone is the real object of his fears and whose rewards alone are the real objects of his hope every thing else is trivial in his sight the world may sooth or it may threaten him he perseveres steadily in the service of his god and in that perseverance feels his happiness every day the more established  lecture xiii duties to man divided into general and particular  general duties considered  loving our neighbor as ourselves  the phrase explained  the nature of christian benevolence  of private friendship and love to our country  doing to others as we would have them do to us  the rule properly guarded  the happiness derived to individuals and society from the observance of the two rules of loving our neighbor as ourselves and doing to others as we would have them do to us  having considered those duties which we owe immediately to god we next consider those which have a more immediate connection with man these as disposed in the summary before us may be divided into general and particular duties  such as concern to mankind in general and such as arise from particular relations  let us consider first such as are general we must love our neighbor as ourselves  and do to others as we would have them do to us these two rules may not improperly be called an appendix to the law upon every emergence a law in point may not be ready it may not indeed exist in many cases we must be more at liberty what law for instance can direct all those little nameless offices of friendly intercourse between man and man which preserve the peace of society and form the greatest part of its happiness what law again can direct our gratitude or can enter into all those minute distinctions which make the circumstances of one man different from those of another we are here therefore injoined to make appeals to our own feelings in many cases not taken notice of by law  the former of these great rules regards our affections the latter our actions  first we must love our neighbor as ourselves the meaning of the word neighbor our savior settled in the parable of the good samaritan from which it appears that all mankind are to be esteemed our neighbors  the mode also of this affection is defined we must love our neighbor as ourselves how then do we love ourselves selflove we know is a steady principle prompting us at all times to avoid pain and pursue happiness for though men are often the voluntary authors of their own misery yet they act under a blind belief that the present pleasure in a vicious action may overbalance the pernicious consequences their own happiness is always intended  if therefore the love we owe our neighbor must be measured by the love we bear ourselves it must be a steady principle prompting us at all times to relieve his distresses and promote his happiness  but it may be objected that love is involuntary  that we like and dislike from humor prejudice and caprice how then is an affection so little in our power prescribed as a duty  this is easily answered a general abstracted benevolence which is ready to do good to all and which delights in the good of all may exist without any of that particular attachment to the individual which is usually called love and this is the temper which christianity would encourage  an affection to the whole species and particularly a compassion to the distressed part of it the good samaritan would have relieved any man in the same circumstances in which he found the distressed traveller to that man he had no particular attachment he had never before seen him  here a question may arise about private friendship and love to our country on both which points the scripture is silent  it may be so it was our saviors design to enlarge our affections rather than contract them he who was so well acquainted with human nature certainly knew that if universal benevolence were attained all the inferior degrees of affection to relations friends and country would follow of course  besides religion seems to have no more business to recommed friendship or patriotism than it has to recommend marriage or celibacy a country life or a townlife they are modes of affection which circumstances may make suitable to one man and unsuitable to another and therefore cannot be of general moral obligation one may conceive a man to change his abode so frequently and so remotely as to have neither country nor friend  the regulation of our affections leads naturally to the regulation of our actions we must do to others as we would have them do to us  are we then to be the dupes of any extravagant claim that may be made upon us  by no means this is a perversion of the rule we are required only to do to others what we could reasonably expect they should do to us hence all unreasonable claims are excluded with this restriction the rule before us is truly admirable and should be ever in our minds when we have intercourse with others scarce any case can occur in which it will not direct us right our practice is not here confounded by nice distinctions or subtle points of morality we are referred at once to our own breasts our own feelings are the criterion we have only to ask ourselves whether the action in dispute be such as we should think might reasonably be done to ourselves an answer to this question will solve the most difficult case between us and our neighbor and indeed if we attend sufficiently to this rule we shall scarce need any other  from the exertion of universal benevolence inculcated in these two rules every happiness must arise of which men are capable either as individuals or as members of society the first which regulates our affections leads directly to our own happiness if we love others as we love ourselves we must of course divest our minds of all those vile affections which are the great sources of our misery and when envy malice revenge and other bad inclinations are rooted out the kind and friendly affections will of course take place at least the ground is well prepared for their reception  as the observance of the first rule leads directly to our own happiness the observance of the second leads directly to the happiness of others the mischiefs which distress society arise chiefly from violence and fraud both these will be driven out through the prevalence of this principle for who would himself wish to be the object of either  the signs which accompany this divine temper are a general obliging behavior in our ordinary conversation and a gentleness of manners to all men whether they are superiors equals or inferiors a generous candor toward their faults and a readiness to bear with their little infirmities prejudices and humors all this will be the natural overflowing of a benevolent heart and though we do not say that whoever possesses an obliging civility of manners must of course also have a benevolent heart for an obliging behavior is sometimes natural and sometimes assumed yet it may not be improper for those who wish to attain this great principle to begin with a gentleness of behavior as an excellent mean to soften the heart and render it susceptible of benign impressions such a behavior may perhaps be more assistant to us in attaining the principle itself than at sight appears
