  arctic zoology  vol i  introduction  class i quadrupeds    london printed by henry hughs mdcclxxxiv  advertisement this work was begun a great number of years past when the empire of great britain was entire and possessed the northern part of the new world with envied splendour at that period i formed a design of collecting materials for a partial history of its animals and with true pains by various correspondencies made far greater progress in my plan than my most sanguine expectations had framed above a century ago an illustrious predecessor in the line of natural history who as greatly exceeded me in abilities as he did in zeal meditated a voyage to the new world in pursuance of a similar design the gentleman alluded to was francis willughby esquire who died in      on the point of putting his design in execution emulous of so illustrious an example i took up the object of his pursuit but my many relative duties forbade me from carrying it to the length conceived by that great and good man what he would have performed from an actual inspection in the native country of the several subjects under consideration i must content myself to do in a less perfect manner from preserved specimens transmitted to me and offer to the world their natural history taken from gentlemen or writers who have paid no small attention to their manners  let me repeat that this work was designed as a sketch of the zoology of north america i thought i had a right to the attempt at a time i had the honor of calling myself a fellowsubject with that respectable part of our former great empire but when the fatal and humiliating hour arrived which deprived britain of power strength and glory i felt the mortification which must strike every feeling individual at losing his little share in the boast of ruling over half of the new world i could no longer support my clame of entitling myself its humble zoologist yet unwilling to fling away all my labors do now deliver them to the public under the title of the arctic zoology i added to them a description of the quadrupeds and birds of the north of europe and of asia from latitude  0 to the farthest known parts of the arctic world together with those of kamtschatka and the parts of america visited in the last voyage of the illustrious cook these additional parts i have flung into the form of an appendix to each genus and distinguished by a fleur de lis and the species by literal instead of numeral marks which distinguish those of north america these will in a great measure show the dilatation of quadrupeds and birds and the migrations of the feathered tribe within part of the northern hemisphere  i have whenever i could get information given their respective residences as well as migrations to far more northern parts to show to what very remote places the author of nature has impelled them to retire to breed in security this wise provision preserves the species entire and enables them to return by myriads to contribute to the food or luxuries of southern climates whatever is wanting in the american part i may foresee will in time be amply supplied the powers of literature will soon arise with the other strengths of the new empire and some native naturalist give perfection to that part of the undertaking by observations formed on the spot in the uses manners and migrations should at present no one be inclined to take the pen out of my hand remarks from the other side of the atlantic from any gentlemen of congenial studies will add peculiar pleasure to a favorite pursuit and be gratefully received  i must reckon among my most valued correspondents on the new continent doctor alexander garden now resident in london  who by his long residence in south carolina was enabled to communicate to me variety of curious remarks and subjects as will appear in the following pages  to the rich museum of american birds preserved by mrs anna blackburn of orford near warrington i am indebted for the opportunity of describing almost every one known in the provinces of jersey new york and connecticut they were sent over to that lady by her brother the late mr ashton blackburn who added to the skill and zeal of a sportsman the most pertinent remarks on the specimens he collected for his worthy and philosophical sister  in the foremost rank of the philosophers of the old continent from whose correspondence i have benefited i must place doctor peter sim pallas at present professor of natural history in the service of the illustrious empress of russia he not only favored me with the fullest remarks on the zoological part of that vast empire most of which he formed from actual travel and observation but collected for my use various other remarks from the manuscripts of his predecessors especially what related to kamtschatka from those of steller which have assisted me in the history of parts hitherto but very slightly understood  from the correspondency and labors of mr eberh aug william zimmerman professor of mathematics at brunswic i have collected most uncommon instruction his specimen zoologiae geographicae quadrupedum a quarto in latin containing     pages printed at leyden      sold in london by mr faden geographer st martins lane is a work which gives a full view of the class of quadrupeds and the progress they have made in spreading over the face of the earth according to climates and latitudes their limits are described in general with uncommon accuracy much is said of the climates themselves of the varieties of mankind of the effects of heat and cold on them and other animals a most curious map is joined to the work in which is given the name of every animal in its proper climate so that a view of the whole quadruped creation is placed before ones eyes in a manner perfectly new and instructive a new edition of the map has been lately published by the learned author the geographical part is corrected according to the late voyages of captain cook and great additions made to the zoological part an explanation is given in the third volume of the zoologia geographica lately published in german by the author   to the following foreigners distinguished for their literary knowledge i must pay my best acknowlegement for variety of most useful communications doctor anders sparman of stockholm doctor charles p thunberg of upsal mr and j retzius professor of natural history at lund mr martin thrane brunnich professor of natural history and mr otho muller author of the zoologia danica both of copenhagen and let me add my great obligations to the labors of the reverend mr otto fabricius for his most finished fauna of greenland  to many of my countrymen my best thanks are due for literary assistances sir joseph banks baronet will i hope accept my thanks for the free admittance to those parts of his cabinet which more immediately related to the subject of the following sheets  to sir ashton lever knight i am highly indebted for the more intimate and closer examination of his treasures than was allowed to the common visitors of his most magnificent museum  to mr samuel hearn the great explorer by land of the icy sea i cannot but send my most particular thanks for his liberal communication of many zoological remarks made by him on the bold and fatiguing adventure he undertook from hudsons bay to the ne plus ultra of the north on that side  mr andrew graham long a resident in hudsons bay obliged me with numbers of observations on the country and the use of multitudes of specimens of animals transmitted by him to the late museum of the royal society at the instance of that liberal patron of science my respected friend the honorable daines barrington  let me close the list with acknowleging the great assistance i have found in the synopsis of birds by mr john latham a work now brought almost to a conclusion and which contains a far greater number of descriptions than any which has gone before this is owing not only to the assiduity of the author but also to the peculiar spirit of the english nation which has in its voyages to the most remote and most opposite parts of the globe paid attention to every branch of science the advantages are pointed out by the able pen of the reverend doctor douglas in his introduction to the last voyage of our great navigator published under the auspices of the lords of the admiralty in a manner which reflects honor on our country in general and will prove a most lasting monument to the memory of the great officer who so unfortunately perished by savage hands and his two able consorts who at length sunk beneath the pressure of fatigue in carrying the glory of discovery far beyond the attempts of every preceding adventurer  downing february

world aknowlege of the geography climate and soil and a general view of the productions of the countries whose zoologic history is to be treated of are points so necessary that no apology need be made for introducing them into a prefatory discourse  it is worthy human curiosity to trace the gradual increase of the animal world from the scanty pittance given to the rocks of spitzbergen to the swarms of beings which enliven the vegetating plains of senegal to point out the causes of the local niggardness of certain places and the prodigious plenty in others the botanist should attend the fancied voyage i am about to take to explain the scanty herbage of the arctic regions or should i at any time hereafter descend into the lower latitudes to investigate the luxuriancy of plants in the warmer climates  the fossilist should join company and point the variations of primaeval creation from the solid rock of spitzbergen through all the degrees of terrestrial matter the steps it makes to perfection from the vilest earth to the precious diamond of golconda the changes in the face of the globe should be attended to the destructions by vulcanoes the ravages of the sea on some coasts and the recompense it may have made to others by the retreat of its waters  the pursuit of these enquiries will also have a farther and more important object history should be called in and a brief account given of the population of the more remote countries  the motives which induced mankind to seek retreats in climates seemingly destitute of incitements to migration particular attention should be paid to the means of peopling the new world and of stocking it with animals to contribute to the support of mankind after the first colonization  the increase of those animals and their cessation and giving place in a certain latitude to genera entirely different  here the fine study of geography should step in to our assistance the outline of the terrestrial globe should be traced the several approximations between part and part should be attended to the nature of the oceans observed the various islands pointed out as the steps the baitingplaces where mankind might have rested in its passage from an overcharged continent  the manners of the people ought not less to be attended to and their changes both mental and corporeal by comparison of the present state of remote people with nations with whom they had common ancestors and who may have been discovered still to retain their primaeval seats some leading customs may still have been preserved in both or some monuments of antiquity proofs of congenial habitudes possibly no longer extant in the savage than in the cultivated branches of the common stock  let me take my departure northward from the narrow streights of dover streights of doves the site of the isthmus of the once peninsulated britain no certain cause can be given for the mighty convulsion which tore us from the continent whether it was rent by an earthquake or whether it was worn through by the continual dashing of the waters no pythagoras is left to solve the fortuna locorum vidi ego quod suerat quondam solidissima tellus esse fretum but it is most probable that the great philosopher alluded to the partial destruction of the atlantica insula mentioned by plato as a distant tradition in his days plato died about the year     before christ aged    pythagoras about     aged  0  it was effected by an earthquake and a deluge which might have rent asunder the narrow isthmus in question and left britain large as it seems at present the mere wreck of its original size see this opinion farther discussed by mr somner ph trans abridg iv   0  the scilly isles the hebrides orknies schetlands and perhaps the feroe islands may possibly be no more than fragments of the once farextended region i have no quarrel about the word island the little isthmus compared to the whole might have been a junction never attended to in the limited navigations of very early times the peninsula had never been wholly explored and it passed with the ancients for a genuine island the correspondency of strata on part of the opposite shores of britain and france leaves no room to doubt but that they were once united chalky strata the chalky cliffs of blancnez between calais and bologne and those to the westward of dover exactly tally the last are vast and continued the former short and the termination of the immense bed between bologne and folkstone about six miles from the latter is another memorial of the junction of the two countries a narrow submarine hill called the ripraps ripraps about a quarter of a mile broad and ten miles long extending eastwards toward the goodwin sands its materials are boulderstones adventitious to many strata the depth of water on it in very low springtides is only fourteen feet the fishermen from folkstone have often touched it with a fifteen feet oar so that it is justly the dread of navigators many a tall ship has perished on it and sunk instantly into twentyone fathoms water in july      the belleisle of sixtyfour guns struck and lay on it during three hours but by starting her beer and water got clear off  these celebrated streights are only twentyone miles wide in the narrowest part width of the streights from the pier at dover to that at calais is twentyfour it is conjectured that their breadth lessens and that they are two miles narrower than they were in ancient times an accurate observer of fifty years remarks to me that the increased height of water from a decrease of breadth has been apparent even in that space the depth of the channel at a medium in highest springtides is about twentyfive fathoms the bottom either coarse sand or rugged scars which have for ages unknown resisted the attrition of the currents depth from the streights both eastward and westward is a gradual increase of depth thorough the channel to a hundred fathoms till soundings are totally lost or unattended to  the springtides in the streights rise on an average twentyfour feet the neaptides fifteen the tide flows from the german sea passes the streights and meets with a great rippling the western tide from the ocean between fairleigh near hastings and bologne all the intelligence respecting the tides etc in these parts i received from mr james hammond of the customhouse dover and mr william cowly a veteran pilot of the same place  a proof that if the separation of the land was effected by the seas it must have been by the overpowering weight of those of the north  it is most certain that britain was peopled from gaul similar customs britain whence peopled as far as can be collected evince this fact the period is beyond the reach of history beyond the measure vast of thought the works the wizard time has wrought the gaul it is held of antique story saw britain linked to his now adverse strand no sea between nor cliff sublime and hoary he passed with unwet feet through all our land to the blown baltic then they say the wild waves found another way etc collinss ode to liberty if after the event by which our island was torn from the continent the migration over so narrow a straight might in the earlier ages have been very readily effected in the vitilia navigia or coracles or the monoxyla or canoes in use in the remote periods but the numerous species of quadrupeds never could have swam into our island even over such a contracted water which at all times must have been possessed by tides so rapid as to baffle their utmost efforts their passage therefore must have been over the ancient isthmus for it is contrary to common sense to suppose that our ancestors would have been at the trouble of transporting such guests as wolves and bears and the numerous train of lesser rapacious animals even had it been practicable for them to have introduced the domestic and useful species would they on board or bears or lynxes take feed the sheadder and the brooding snake prior men and beasts found their way into great britain from the same quarter quadrupeds we have no quadrupeds but what are also found in france and among our lost animals may be reckoned the urus p   wolf no   bear no  0 wild boar and the beaver no  0 all which were once common to both countries the urus continued among us in a state of nature as late at lest as the year      six wild bulls were used at the installation feast of george nevil archbishop of york lelands collect vi    and i have seen some of their descendants scarcely to be called tame in confinement in the parks of drumlanrig and chillingham tours in scotland  the caledonian bears were exported to rome and esteemed for their fierceness martial plutarch  they continued in scotland till the year  0   they existed in wales perhaps till the same period for our ancient laws ranked them among the beasts of chase raii syn quad      wolves infested even the middle counties of england as late as the year      and continued their ravages in north britain in the reign of queen elizabeth nor were they wholly extirpated till the year    0 the wild boars were common in the neighborhood of london in the reign of henry ii and continued in our kingdom in a wild state till      they were then only to be found in the woods of lord latimer who we are informed by doctor moufet took great delight in their chase healths emprovement  let me add from the same authority that roebucks were found at the same period in wales and among the cheviot hills they are now confined to the highlands of scotland finally beavers inhabited wales in      when our historian giraldus made his progress through the principality every one of these animals are at this time to be found in france the urus excepted theodebert king of france perished in the chase of one about the year     ecole de la chasse clxi  but it is probable that the species must have existed in that vast kingdom long after that event  the

reached our island or if they did perished so early that even their very names in the british tongue have perished with them the ibex hist quad no    and the chamois hist quad no    inhabitants only of the remote gaulish alps and pyreneans probably never reached us france therefore possesses fortynine species of quadrupeds we only thirtynine i exclude two species of seals the common seal is common to the ocean and mediterranean sea possibly the mediterranean seal hist quad no     may be so likewise  this work is always intended when the name of the work referred to is not added to the numbers in both reckonings being animals which had at all times powers of making themselves inhabitants of the coasts of each kingdom  birds birds which have the ready means of wafting themselves from place to place have notwithstanding in numbers of instances their limits climate confines some within certain bounds and particular sorts of food induce others to remain within countries not very remote from us yet by wonderful instinct birds will follow cultivation and make themselves denizens of new regions the crossbill has followed the apple into england glenco in the highlands of scotland never knew the partridge till its farmers of late years introduced corn into their lands nor did sparrows ever appear in sibiria till after the russians had made arable the vast wastes of those parts of their dominions finally the rice buntings p   0 natives of cuba after the planting of rice in the carolinas annually quit the island in myriads and fly over sea and land to partake of a harvest introduced there from the distant india  france as it exceeds in variation of climate so it exceeds us in the number of species of birds we can boast of only one hundred and thirtyone kinds of landbirds and one hundred and twentyone of waterfowl france on the contrary has one hundred and fiftysix of the first and one hundred and thirteen of the last this computation may not be quite accurate for no one has as yet attempted its fauna which must be very numerous in a kingdom which extends from calais in about lat    to collioure in the south of roussillon on the mediterranean sea in about lat    the northern parts possess the birds in common with england and in all probability the provinces in the mediterranean annually are visited by various species from northern africa  coasts of britain stupendous and precipitous ranges of chalky cliffs attend the coast from dover eastward and from their color gave the name of albion to our island beneath one of them anchored caesar fiftyfive years before christ and so near as to be capable of being annoyed by the darts of the britons after weighing anchor he sailed up a bay now occupied by meadows and landed at rutupium richborough opposite to the present sandwich the walls of the former still evince its ancient strength and the vestiges of a quay now bounded by a ditch points out the anchorage of the roman commerce the adjacent thanet the thanatos of the ancients at present indistinguishable from the main land was in old times an island separated by a deep channel from a mile and a half to four miles in width the site of roman settlements and in     celebrated for having been the first landingplace of the invading saxons to whom it was assigned as a place of security by the imprudent vortigern but such a change has time effected that thanet no more exists as an island and the britanniarum portus in which rode the roman navies is now filled with marshy meads  after passing the lofty chalky promontory the north foreland opens the estuary of the thames bounded on each side by low shores and its channels divided by numerous sandbanks securely passed by reason of the perfection of navigation by thousands of ships frequenting annually london our emporium envied nearly to impending decline  on the projecting coasts of suffolk and norfolk suffolk and norfolk arise in certain intervals eminences of different matter loamy cliffs appear about leostoffe dunwich etc the cragpits about woodbridge are prodigious pits of seashells many of them perfect and quite solid an inexhaustible fund of manure for arable lands about yarmouth and from thence beyond wintertoness the coast is low flat and composed of shingle backed by sand from hapsburgh to cromer are a range of lofty clayey precipices rising from the height of forty to a hundred feet perpendicular a prey to the ocean which has effected great changes in these parts about sherringham and cley it rises into pretty and gentle hills sloping down into a rough shore of little rocks and stones at holkham wells and wareham the sandy shores terminate in little hillocks of sand kept together by the arundo arenaria or bent the great preservative against the inundations of sand which would otherwise destroy whole tracts of country and in particular soon render useless the range of saltmarshes which these are backed with hunstanton cliff rises a distinguished feature in this flat tract the surface is the usual vegetable mould about a foot deep beneath that are two feet of small broken pieces of chalk the solid stratum of the same after having been lost for numbers of miles here again makes its appearance and forms a solid bed thirty feet in thickness resting on a hard red stone four feet deep which is often ground and made into a red paint seven feet of loose friable dirty yellow stone succeeds placed on a base of ironcolored plumbpuddingstone projecting into the sea with vast fragments scattered over the beach this cliff is about eighty feet high lies on the entrance of the washes the metaris estuarium of ptolemy from hence all the coast by snettisham to lynn is low flat and shingly  from holm the northern promontory of norfolk the sea advances deeply westward and forms the great bay called the washes filled with vast sandbanks the summits of which are dry at low water but the intervening channels are the means of prodigious commerce to lynn in norfolk seated on the ouze which is circulated into the very inland parts of our island through the various rivers which fall into its long course lynn is mentioned in the doomsday book but became considerable for its commerce with norway as early as the year       the opposite shore is that of lincolnshire lincolnshire its great commercial town boston stands on the witham a few miles from the head of the bay springtides rise at the quay fourteen feet and convey there vessels of above a hundred tons but greater ships lie at the scap the opening of the estuary such is the case at lynn for the sluggish rivers of these tame tracts want force to form a depth of water  lincolnshire and part of six other counties are the paisbas the low countries of britain the former bounded on the western part by a range of elevated land which in this humble county overlooks as alps would the ocean the remaining part this very extensive tract from the scap to the northern headland opposite to hull presents to the sea a bowlike and almost unindented front and so low as to be visible from sea only at a small distance and churches instead of hills are the only landmarks to seamen the whole coast is fronted with saltmarshes or sandhills and secured by artificial banks against the fury of the sea old holinshead gives a long list of ports on this now inhospitable coast waynfleet once a noted haven is at present a mere creek skegness once a large walled town with a good harbor is now an inconsiderable place a mile from the sea and the port of grimesby which in the time of edward iii furnished him with eleven ships is now totally choked with sand  the great level which comprehends holland in this county with part of northamptonshire norfolk suffolk cambridge and huntingdon a tract of sixty computed miles in length and forty in breadth had been originally a wooded country whole forests of firs and oaks have been found in digging far beneath the moor on the solid ground oaks fifteen feet in girth and sixteen yards long mostly burnt at the bottoms the ancient method of falling them multitudes of others entirely rooted up as appears by the force of the sea bursting in and overwhelming this whole tract and covering it with silt or the mud which it carried with it from time to time ovids beautiful account of the deluge was here verified for under conington down in huntingdonshire was found the skeleton of a whale near twenty feet long which had once swam secure to this distance from its native residence  et modo qua graciles gramen carpsere capellae nunc ibi deformes ponunt sua corpora phocae  sylvasque tenent delphines et altis incursant ramis agitataque robora pulsant in process of time this tract underwent another revolution the silt or mud gained so considerably as to leave vast spaces dry and other parts so shallow as to encourage the romans to regain these fertilized countries from the sea those sensible and indefatigable people first taught us the art of embanking and recovered the valuable lands we now possess it was the complaint of galgacus that they exhausted the strength of the britons in sylvis et paludibus emuniendis vita agricolae  in clearing woods and draining marshes after the romans deserted our island another change took place neglect of their labors succeeded the drains were neglected and the whole became fen and shallow lake resembling the present east fen the haunt of myriads of waterfowl or the retreat of banditti ely and many little tracts which had the advantage of elevation were at that period literally islands several of these in early times became the retreat of religious ely thorney ramsey spiney and others rose into celebrated abbeys and by the industry of their inhabitants first began to restore the works of the romans the country above thorney is represented by an old historian malmsbury lib iv     as a paradise constant visitations founded on wholesome laws preserved this vast recovered country but on the rapid and rapacious dissolution the removal of numbers of the inhabitants and the neglect of the laws of the sewers the drains were filled the cultivated land overflowed and the country again reduced to a useless morass compare sir w dugdales maps of this tract in its morassy and drained state hist embank p          in the twentieth of elizabeth the state of the country was taken into consideration same p      no great matters were done till the time of francis and william his son earls of bedford who attempted this herculean work and reclamed this vast tract of more than three hundred thousand acres and the last received under sanction of parliament the just reward of ninety thousand acres i speak not of the relics of the ancient banks which i have seen in holland lincolnshire now remote from the sea nor yet of the roman tumuli the coins and other evidences of the residence of that nation in these parts they would swell a mere preface to too great a length and it is to be hoped will be undertaken by the pen of some native who will perform it from his actual survey  the vast fenny tracts of these counties were in old times the haunts of multitudes of waterfowl but the happy change by attention to draining has substituted in their place thousands of sheep or instead of reeds made those tracts laugh with corn the crane which once abounded in these parts has even deserted our island the common wild duck still breeds in multitudes in the unreclamed parts and thousands are sent annually to the london markets from the numerous decoys the gray lag goose br zool ii no     the origin of the tame breeds here and is resident the whole year a few others of the duck kind breed here ruffs redshanks lapwings redbreasted godwits and whimbrels are found here during summer but with their young in autumn disperse about the island the shorteared owl migrates here with the woodcock and is a welcome guest to the farmer by clearing the fields of mice knots swarm on the coasts in winter are taken in numbers in nets yet none are seen during summer see tour in scotland      lincolnshire where the fen birds are enumerated  the most distant north is probably the retreat of the multitude of waterfowl of each order which stock our shores driven southward by the extreme cold most of them regularly others whose nature enables them to brave the usual winters of the frigid zone are with us only accidental guests and in seasons when the frost rages in their native land with unusual severity  from clea ness the land retires westward and with the opposite shore of yorkshire bounds the great estuary of the humber which winding deep into the country is the receptacle of the trent and all the considerable rivers of that vast province some of which arise in its most remote parts all these coasts of lincolnshire are flat and have been gained from the sea barton and barrow have not at present the least appearance of ports yet by holinshed were styled good ones descr britain  0   similar accidents have befallen the upper part of the low tract of holderness which faces the congruent shores hedon a few miles below hull several hundred years ago a port of great commerce is now a mile and a half from the water and has long given way to the rising fortune of the latter a creation of edward i in      on account of the excellency of its port but in return the sea has made most ample reprisals on the lands of this hundred the site and even the very names of several places once towns of note upon the humber are now only recorded in history and ravensper was at one time a rival to hull madox ant exch i      and a port so very considerable in      that edward baliol and the confederated english barons sailed from hence with a great fleet to invade scotland and henry iv in      made choice of this port to land at to effect the deposal of richard ii yet the whole of it has long since been devoured by the merciless ocean extensive sands dry at low water are to be seen in their stead except sunk island which till about the year      appeared among them like an elevated shoal at which period it was regained by embankments from the sea and now forms a considerable estate probably restored to its pristine condition  spurn head spurn head the ocelum promontorium of ptolemy terminates this side of the humber at present in form of a sickle near which the windbound ships anchor securely the place on which the lighthouses stand is a vast beach near two miles long mixed with sandhills flung up by the sea within the last seventy years  the land from hence for some miles is composed of very lofty cliffs of brown clay perpetually preyed on by the fury of the german sea which devours whole acres at a time and exposes on the shores considerable quantities of beautiful amber fine wheat grows on the clay even to the edge of the cliffs a country of the same fertility reaches from kilnsey near this place as far as the village of sprottly extending in a waved form for numbers of miles and when i saw it richly clothed with wheat and beans  from near kilnsey the land bends very gently inward as far as the great promontory of flamborough and is a continuance of high clayey cliff till about the village of hornsey near it is a mere noted for its eels and pikes at present separated from the sea by so small a space as to render its speedy destruction very probable a street called hornsey beck has long since been swallowed and of hide a neighboring town only the tradition is left  the country grows considerably lower and near the base of the promontory retires so far in as to form bridlington bay bridlington bay anciently called gabrantovicorum sinus to which the geographer adds  on account of the excellency and safety of its port where vessels ride in full security under the shelter of the lofty headland smithie sand the only one between flamborough and spurn head stretches across the entrance into bridlington bay and in hard gales from the north and northeast adds to the security of that noble asylum for the coasting vessels sureby an adjacent village seems no more than a translation from the old appellation the romans in all probability had a naval station here for here ends the road visible in many places between this place and york and named from its founders the roman ridge  the head is formed of limestone of a snowy whiteness soft near the top and of a crumbling quality when exposed long to the frost at the foot of the cliff it is hard solid and smooth boats are employed every summer in carrying great quantities to sunderland where it is burnt into excellent lime most of the limestone used at scarborough is made from stones flung up by the sea it may be remarked that whatsoever degree of hardness any limestone possesses in the quarry the mortar made from it by proper management may be made as hard but by no means harder most of the houses in and about london are built with lime made of chalk hence the many miserable casualties there by the fall of houses the workmen sensible of the weakness of that kind of mortar endeavor to keep the walls together by lodging frames of timber in them which being consumed in cases of fire the whole building tumbles suddenly and renders all attempts to extinguish the fire very

portus felix the saxons styled the cape fleamburg perhaps from the lights which directed the great ida founder of the northumberland kingdom to land here in     with a great body of their countrymen  the vast height of the precipices and the amazing grandeur of the caverns which open on the north side giving wide and solemn admission through most exalted arches into the body of the mountain together with the gradual decline of light the deep silence of the place unless interrupted by the striking of the oar the collision of a swelling wave against the sides or the loud flutter of the pigeons affrighted from their nests in the distant roof afford pleasures of scenery which such formations as this alone can yield these also are wonderfully diversified in some parts the caverns penetrate far and end in darkness in others are pervious and give a romantic passage by another opening equally superb many of the rocks are insulated of a pyramidal form and soar to a great height

sharp voice of the gulls the frequent chatter of the guillemots the loud notes of the auks the scream of the herons together with the deep periodical croak of the corvorants which serves as a bass to

shores are rocky and the haunts of lobsters and other crustaceous animals from these strata a tract of fine sand from one to five miles in breadth extends sloping eastward and from its edge to that of the doggerbank is a deep bottom rugged rocky and cavernous and in most parts overgrown with corallines and submarine plants  this disposition of shore gives to the inhabitants of this coast the advantageous fishery which they possess for the shore on one hand and the edges of the doggerbank on the other like the sides of a decoy give a direction to the immense shoals of the cod genus which annually migrate from the northern ocean to visit reside and spawn in the parts adjacent to our coasts they find plenty of food from the plants of the rocks and the worms of the sand and secure shelter for their spawn in the cavernous part of the scarry bottom it is in the channel between the banks and the shores in which the cod are taken or in the hollows between the doggers and wellbank for they do not like the agitation of the water on the shallows on the contrary the skates the holibuts flounders and other flat fish bury themselves in the sand and secure themselves from the

oceanus britannicus forming part of that vast expanse which surrounds our islands pliny confined that title to the space between the mouth of the rhine and that of the seine and bestowed on this sea the name of septentrionalis plin lib iv c     and ptolemy called it germanicus both which it still retains its northern extremity lies between dungsbyhead in lat       north and the same latitude in the south of norway before the separation of britain from gaul it could only be considered as a vast bay tides their direction but that period is beyond the commencement of record the tides flow into it from the northeast to the southwest according to the direction of the coast but in midsea the reflux sets to the north to discharge itself through the great channel between the schetland isles and norway mr william ferguson  the depth of water depths at highest springtides in the streights of dover is twentyfive fathoms it deepens to thirtyone between lowstoff and the mouth of the maes between the wellsbank and doggersbank gains in one place only a few fathoms beyond the dogger it deepens from fortyeight to seventytwo between buchanness and schutness in norway within the buchan deeps it has from eightysix to a hundred fathoms then decreases toward the orkney and schetland isles from seventyfive to forty but between the schetlands and bergen the northern end of this sea the depth is from a hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty fathoms the coasts from dungsbyhead to flamboroughhead are bold and high navigation and may be seen at sea from seven to fourteen leagues from the last to spurnhead is also a clear coast but the rest of the coast of norfolk and suffolk is low visible at small distance and rendered dangerous by the number of sandbanks projecting far to sea after passing the spurnhead navigators steer between the inner and outer dousings for the floating light kept on board a small vessel constructed for that purpose always anchored at the inner edge of a sand called dogshons shoal about eight leagues from the coast of lincolnshire in about fifteen fathom water from thence they make for cromer in norfolk and from that point till they arrive at the nore their track is all the way through a number of narrow channels near the most dangerous sands to which if we add foggy weather dark nights storms contrary winds and very near adjacent leeshores it may be very fairly reckoned the most dangerous of the muchfrequented navigations in the world  but fortunately to the north of these sandbanks this sea is much more remarkable for sandbanks of utility than of danger and would never have been observed but for the multitudes of fishes which at different seasons according to their species resort to their sides from the great northern deeps either for the sake of variety of food which they yield or to depose their spawn in security the first to be taken notice of does not come within the description yet should not be passed over in silence as it comes within the natural history of the north sea an anonymous sand runs across the channel between buchanness and the north end of jutsriff the left depth of water over it is forty fathoms so that it would scarcely be thought of did not the water suddenly deepen again and form that place which is styled the buchan deeps  the long bank or the long fortys long fortys bears e s e from buchanness about fortyfive miles distant and extends southward as far as opposite to newcastle is about fifty leagues in length and seven in breadth and has on it from thirtytwo to fortyfive fathoms of water the

about twentysix fathom of water and round it about forty  the bank called montrose pits lies a little to the east of the middle of the long fortys it is about fifty miles long montrose pits and most remarkable for five great pits or hollows from three to four miles in diameter on their edges is only forty fathom water yet they suddenly deepen to seventy and even a hundred fathom on a soft muddy bottom the margins on the contrary are gravelly i enquired whether the surface of this wonderful bank appeared in any way agitated as i had suspicion that the pits might have been productive of whirlpools but was informed that the sea there exhibited no uncommon appearance  the noted doggers bank next succeeds doggers bank it commences at the distance of twelve leagues from flamborough head and extends across the sea nearly east above seventytwo leagues joining hornriff a very narrow strip of sand which ends on the coast of jutland the greatest breadth is twenty leagues and in parts it

elaborate account of the submarine plants of our northern sea  i will now pursue my voyage from the extreme shores of north britain through a new ocean caledonian ocean here commences the oceanus caledonius or deucaledonius of ptolemy a vast expanse extending to the west as far as greenland and northward to the extreme north this i should call the northern ocean distinguishing its parts by other names suitable to the coasts from dungsby head the orkney islands appear spreading along the horizon and yield a most charming prospect orkney islands some of them are so near as distinctly to exhibit the rocky fronts of those bold promontories which sustain the weight of the vast currents from the atlantic others show more faint their distances finely expressed as they retire from the eye until the mountains of the more remote have scarcely a deeper azure than the sky and are hardly discernible rising over the surface of the ocean mr cordiners elegant description p      between these and the main land about two miles from the cathness shore lies stroma stroma the ocetis of ptolemy a little island an appertenance to that county fertile by the manual labor of about thirty families pleasant and lofty enough for the resort of the auk tribe the noted mummies are now lost occasioned by the doors of the caverns in which they were deposited being broken down and admission given to cattle which have trampled them to pieces this catacomb stands on a neck of land bounded by the sea on three sides the salt air and spray expels all insects and is the only preservation the bodies have some of which had been lodged here a great number of years in many of the isles the inhabitants use no other method for preserving their meat from putrefaction than hanging it in caves of the sea and the method is vindicated by the success  this island lies in the pentland firth noted for the violence of the tides tides tremendous to the sight but dangerous only when passed at improper times they set in from the northwest the flood on the contrary on the coasts of lewis pours in from the south mackensies charts of the orknies p      the tide of flood upon stroma and other islands similarly situated in midstream divides or splits before it reaches it a current runs with great violence on both sides then unites at some distance from the opposite end and forms a single current running at springtides at the rate of nine knots an hour at neap at that of three only the space between the dividing tides at different ends of an island is quite stagnant and is called the eddy some of them are a mile or two long and give room for a ship to tack to and fro till the tides are so far spent as to permit it to pursue its voyage  the most boisterous parts of the streams are at the extremities of the island the swelchie of stroma and a little beyond the top of the eddy where they unite the collision of these opposite streamsexcite a circular motion and when the tide is very strong occasion whirlpools in form of an inverted bell the largest diameter of which may be about three feet in springtides they have force enough to turn a vessel round but not to do any damage but there have been instances of small boats being swallowed up these whirlpools are largest when first formed are carried away with the stream and disappear but are quickly followed by others the spiral motion or suction does not extend far beyond the cavity a boat may pass within twenty yards of these whirlpools with safety fishermen who happen to find themselves within a dangerous distance fling in an oar or any bulky body which breaks the continuity of the surface and interrupts the vertiginous motion and forces the water to rush suddenly in on all sides and fill up the cavity in stormy weather the waves themselves destroy this phenomenon a sunk rock near the concourse of these rapid tides occasions a most dreadful appearance the stream meeting with an interruption falls over with great violence reaches the bottom and brings up with it sand shells fishes or whatsoever else it meets with which with boats or whatsoever it happens to meet is whirled from the center of the eruption toward the circumference with amazing velocity and the troubled surface boils and bubbles like a great cauldron then darts off with a succession of whirlpools from successive ebullitions these are called rousts rousts and are attended with the utmost danger to small boats which are agitated to such a degree that even should they not be overset the men are flung out of them to perish without any chance of redemption it is during the ebb that they are tremendous and most so in that of a springtide with a west wind and that in the calmest weather for during flood they are passed with the greatest safety vessels in a calm are never in danger of touching on an island or visible rock when they get into a current but are always carried safe from all danger  swona swona a little island the most southern of the orknies is about four miles beyond stroma and is noted for its tremendous streams and in particular the whirlpools called the wells of swona which in a higher degree exhibit all the appearances of the former what contributes to increase the rage of the tides besides their confinement between so many islands is the irregular position of the sounds and their little depth of water depth of water the same shallowness extends to every side of the orknies an evidence that they had once been part of the mother isle rent from it by some mighty convulsion the middle of the channel between stroma and the main land has only ten fathom water the greatest depth around that island is only eighteen the sounds are from three to fortysix fathom deep the greater depths are between south ronaldsha and south wales for in general the other sounds are only from three to thirteen and the circumambient depth of the whole group very rarely exceeds twentyfive  tides about these islands commences a decrease of the tides they lie in a great ocean in which the waters have room to expand therefore never experience that height of flood which is constant in the contracted seas here ordinary springtides do not exceed eight feet and very extraordinary springtides fourteen even when acted on by the violence of the winds murdoch mackens   the time of the discovery and

sides and preserving the same distance from the lesser area as the two other sides of the outward fence do terminates at the latter near an artificial well that this was roman i greatly suspect the

than a temple of worship analogous probably to that of the druids  the next step is to the feroe islands feroe isles a group about two hundred and ten miles to the northwest of the northern schetland between lat       and     0 there are seventeen which are habitable each of which is a lofty mountain arising out of the waves divided from the others by deep and rapid currents some of them are deeply indented with secure harbors providence seeming to have favored mankind with the safest retreats in the most boisterous seas all are very steep and most of them faced with most tremendous precipices the surface of the mountains consists of a shallow soil of remarkable fertility for barley the only corn sown here yields above twenty for one and the grass affords abundant pasturage for sheep the exports are salted mutton and tallow goose quils feathers and eider down and by the industry of the inhabitants knit woollen waistcoats caps and stockings no trees beyond the size of juniper or stunted willows will grow here nor are any wild quadrupeds to be met with except rats and mice originally escaped from the shipping  the list of land birds is very small land birds  the cinereous eagle p     b the lanner p     k the sparrow hawk p     n these on the authority of mr debes who wrote the history of these isles in    0  a species of owl the raven no     and hooded crow p     b are the pernicious species ravens were so destructive to the lambs and sheep that in old times every boatman was obliged to bring into the sessions house on st olauss day the beak of one of those birds or pay one skin which was called the ravenfine in case of neglect the remaining land fowl are wild pigeons and stares white wagtails wrens and sometimes the swallow the snow bunting only rests here in spring on its passage northward the heron is sometimes met with the spoonbill is common brunnich p     the sea pie water rail and lapwing are seen here the birds of the rocks such as puffins razor bills and little auks foolish and black guillemots swarm here and the geyirfugl or great auk at certain periods visits these islands the last by reason of its short wing incapable of flight nestles at the foot of the cliffs the skua arctic blackbacked and herring gulls fulmars manks stormy petrels imber and northern diverse wild swans and geese the swans only vernal passengers toward the north eider ducks havelda or longtailed ducks corvorants and the sula gannet form the sum of the palmated fowl of these inhospitable spots  fowling the manner of fowling is so very strange and hazardous that the description should by no means be omitted necessity compels mankind to wonderful attempts the cliffs which contain the objects of their search are often two hundred fathoms in height from above and are attempted from above and below in the first case the fowlers provide themselves with a rope eighty or a hundred fathoms in length the fowler fastens one end about his waist and between his legs recommends himself to the protection of the almighty and is lowered down by six others who place a piece of timber on the margin of the rock to preserve the rope from wearing against the sharp edge they have besides a small line fastened to the body of the adventurer by which he gives signals that they may lower or raise him or shift him from place to place the last operation is attended with great danger by the loosening of the stones which often fall on his head and would infallibly destroy him was it not protected by a strong thick cap but even that is found unequal to save him against the weight of the larger fragments of rock the dexterity of the fowlers is amazing they will place their feet against the front of the precipice and dart themselves some fathoms from it with a cool eye survey the places where the birds nestle and again shoot into their haunts in some places the birds lodge in deep recesses the fowler will alight there disengage himself from the rope fix it to a stone and at his leisure collect the booty fasten it to his girdle and resume his pendulous seat at times he will again spring from the rock and in that attitude with a fowling net placed at the end of a staff catch the old birds which are flying to and from their retreats when he has finished his dreadful employ he gives a signal to his friends above who pull him up and share the hardearned profit the feathers are preserved for exportation the flesh is partly eaten fresh but the greater portion dried for winters provision  the fowling from below has its share of danger from below the party goes on the expedition in a boat and when it has attained the base of the precipice one of the most daring having fastened a rope about his waist and furnished himself with a long pole with an iron hook at one end either climbs or is thrust up by his companions who place a pole under his breech to the next footing spot he can reach in pontoppidans hist norway ii    is a plate expressive of this manner of fowling  he by means of the rope brings up one of the boats crew the rest are drawn up in the same manner and each is furnished with his rope and fowlingstaff they then continue their progress upwards in the same manner till they arrive at the region of birds and wander about the face of the cliff in search of them they then act in pairs one fastens himself to the end of his associates rope and in places where birds have nestled beneath his footing he permits himself to be lowered down depending for his security to the strength of his companion who is to haul him up again but it sometimes happens that the person above is overpowered by the weight and both inevitably perish they fling the fowl down to the boat which attends their motions and receives the booty they often pass seven or eight days in this tremendous employ and lodge in the crannies which they find in the face of the precipice  the sea which surrounds these islands is extremely turbulent the tides vary greatly on the western and eastern sides on the first where is received the uninterrupted flood of the ocean from the remote greenland the tide rises seven fathoms on the eastern side it rises only three dreadful whirlwinds called by the danes oes agitate the sea to a strange degree catch up a vast quantity of water so as to leave a great temporary chasm in the spot on which it falls and carries away with it to an amazing distance any fishes which may happen to be within reach of its fury thus great shoals of herrings have been found on the highest mountains of feroe it is equally resistless on land tearing up trees stones and animals and carrying them to very distant places we must no longer laugh at the good archbishop olaus magnus archb of upsal  who gravely tells us that at times the rats called lemming are poured down from the clouds in great showers on the alps of norway we assent to the fact but must solve the phoenomenon by ascribing it to a whirlwind as he does in one place yet immediately supposes they may be bred in the upper regions out of feculent matter  among the numerous whirlpools of these seas that of suderoe near the island of the same name is the most noted it is occasioned by a crater sixtyone fathoms in depth in the center and from fifty to fiftyfive on the sides the water forms four fierce circumgirations the point they begin at is on the side of a large basin where commences a range of rocks running spirally and terminating at the verge of the crater this range is extremely rugged and covered with water from the depth of twelve to eight fathoms only it forms four equidistant wreaths with a channel from thirtyfive to twenty fathoms in depth between each on the outside beyond that depth the sea suddenly sinks to eighty and ninety on the south border of the basin is a lofty rock called sumboe munk noted for the multitude of birds which frequent it on one side the water is only three or four fathoms deep on the other fifteen the danger at most times especially in storms is very great ships are irresistibly drawn in the rudder loses its power and the waves beat as high as the masts so that an escape is almost miraculous yet at the reflux and in very still weather the inhabitants will venture in boats for the sake of fishing mr debes omits the times of greatest danger it is to be hoped that attention will be paid to the various periodical appearances of a phoenomenon the cause of which is very satisfactorily explained by the worthy pastor see his plan p      mankind found their way to these islands some time before the discovery of iceland naddodd a norwegian pirate had retired here as the only place of security he could find islands landnamabok    about this time harold harfagre possessed himself of norway and flung off the danish yoke a party was formed against him but it was soon subdued and the malcontents quitting the kingdom retired to the hebrides orknies schetland and feroe and gave rise to the norwegian reign in all those islands  iceland from the feroe islands the hardy scandinavians made the next step in their northern migrations to iceland i must premise that there is the highest probability that this island was discovered in an age most remote to theirs and that it was the thule of pytheas an illustrious marseillian at lest cotemporary with aristotle the works of pytheas had been read by dicaearchus a disciple of aristotles see strabo lib ii p      and who pushed his discoveries toward the north as his countryman euthymenes did beyond the line pytheas arrived at thule an island says he six days sailing northward from britain where he informs us was continual day and night for six months alternately plin lib ii c     he does not exactly hit on the length of day and night but he could have been at no other at that distance from britain but iceland in which there was a most remarkable absence of light as to naddodd in     he was accidentally driven by a tempest to the eastern side of iceland to a place now called reidarfiall he found the country covered with snow and therefore named it snoeland yet he returned home full of its praises soon after gardar a swede experienced the same fortune on a voyage to the hebrides he was tempestdriven to the same island on which by the advice of his mother who was a sort of diviner he landed at horn at this period iceland was clothed with wood from the shore to the very tops of the mountains he wintered there and likewise returned full of its praises same p     floke a celebrated pirate was the next adventurer he took with him three ravens and like another noah made them the augury of the land before he sailed he performed a great sacrifice for the success upon a vast pile of stones which he raised for the purpose this points out another origin of the vast tumuli we so frequently see he made the schetland and the feroe isles his first steps and loosed from the last for iceland the nearest point of which is about five hundred and forty miles distant his first raven returned to feroe the second flew back to the ship the third directed him to the wishedfor land same p   torfoeus hist norveg ii     he wintered there the cattle he brought with him perished through want the spring proved unusually cold and the sea appeared full of ice for which reason he bestowed on the island the name it at present bears floke was sick of his voyage returned full of dispraises of the country this did not discourage other adventurers all of them scandinavians thrust out of the exuberant northern hive the rest of the world which their countrymen ravaged was assuredly too small for them otherwise they never would have colonized almost the most wretched spot in the northern hemisphere ambition possibly actuated the leaders who might think it better to reign in hell than serve in heaven colony after colony arrived they confederated and formed a republic which existed near four hundred years but with as many feuds and slaughters as could happen in a climate where luxury might pamper and corrupt the inhabitants in      wearied with their dissensions they voluntarily reunited themselves to their mother country norway under the reign of its monarch haquin it is remarkable that the poetic genius of their aboriginal country flourished with equal sublimity in every climate the scalds or bards retained their fire in the inhospitable climate of iceland as vigorously as when they attended on their chieftains to the mild air of spain or sicily and sung their valiant deeds  every thing which furnished topics to the poets of other countries was in the most remote period wanting here groves verdant meadows purling streams and gentle zephyrs were totally unknown and in their stead stunted shrubs a thin herbage rude torrents and fierce gales reign in every part we admit the apology of the learned torfoeus for the present state of his country hist norweg i     violent tempests might cover whole tracts with the unstable sand eruptions of water from the mountains desolate some parts earthquakes bury vast extents of fertile land with fragments of rocks and inundations of the sea change the face of others but soft scenery was not requisite to inspire poets who were to sing only the preparations for warlike exploits the slaughter of a battle the deeds of their heroes and the magic solemnities of superstitions  the island at present exhibits to the traveller amazing slopes of lava which once streamed from the vulcanoes and terminated in the sea such is the appearance about three miles from hafnaifoird in lat      of vast masses of lava piled to a montanous height upon each other broken vitrified sharp rude and black in parts sandy tracts intervene in others a soil peculiar to the place a tufa originated from the violent eruptions of impure water which rush from the mountains attendant on the fiery eruptions valleys composed of a very thin soil afford grass for a numerous breed of cattle and sheep here is found variety of species of the best grasses of the aira poa festuca and carex part is harvested against winter but not in such plenty but that the farmer is obliged often to feed his stock with the wolffish or the heads of codfish beaten small and mixed with a quarter part of hay to what food will not necessity compel both man and beast to recur  woods long lost the woods of iceland have long since vanished unless we except a few stunted birch scarcely ten feet high and four inches in diameter and a few species of willow driftwood so small and so rare as scarcely to be of use to the inhabitants but they are abundantly supplied with driftwood from europe and america as appears by the species found on the shores especially on all the northern coast as langaness on the northeast and hornstrandt on the northwest that woods were found here in very remote periods is very evident from the quantity of suturbrand met with in several parts which still retains traces of its vegetable origin the marks of branches and circles of the annual growth of the wood some pieces are even capable of being planed it is found in the fissures of the rocks much compressed by their weight and in pieces sometimes big enough to make a middlesized table this is sometimes used as fuel but the want of it is supplied in some measure by the driftwood by peat and by several strange substitutes the effect of necessity smiths prefer the suturbrand to seacoal in their business the beds of this fossil strongly refute the notion of iceland having been entirely formed by vulcanic violence since the original creation and raised out of the sea in later times as others have been known to have done delos and rhodos in very remote ages thera the modern santorini and therasia in the    th olympiad thia in the time of pliny hist not lib ii c     and in the beginning of this century another sprung from the sea by the force of subterraneous fires near to santorini most admirably described in the ph trans abridg v     etc  and while i am now writing an island is forming by the same cause not remote from the reickenes part of the very island in question but these sutur or sort brands are certainly the remains of ancient forests overturned and buried by earthquakes after the golden age of the island let me add to this another proof from the number of its vegetables plants

the west part of the island is far the highest see olaffen i tab xvii  out of these at different periods have been tremendous eruptions of fire and water the burst of which is attended with a most terrific noise flames and balls of fire issue out with the smoke and showers of stones are vomited up of which there has been an instance of one weighing near three hundred pounds being flung to the distance of four miles the heights of the mountains have not been taken but that of the heclafiall is not far short of seventeen hundred yards of this species of mountain hecla has been most celebrated the records of iceland enumerate ten of its eruptions since the arrival of the norwegians it was the hell of the northern nations but they seem divided in their opinions whether the pains of the damned arose from fire or what was more tremendous to the natives of these countries from the cold bartholinus de contemptu mortis       to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice hecla has been known to have had only ten eruptions between the years   0  and      from the last to      when it burst out in flames and lava it emitted flames in      and

general sandy and sterile fiery eruptions are not confined to the mountains last year they burst out of the fulphureous soil of the low parts of skaftafield syssel or province and the lava has overflown the country for the space of thirty miles and has at last reached the sea destroying every thing in its progress it dries up the rivers and fills their beds with lava moors in some places

are of a most extraordinary nature are called huers and form at times jets deaux of scalding water ninetyfour feet high and thirty in diameter creating the most magnificent gerbes in nature especially when backed by the setting sun they arise out of cylindrical tubes of unknown depths near the surface they expand into apertures of a funnel shape and the mouths spread into large extent of stalactitical matter formed of successive scaly concentric undulations the playing of these stupendous spouts is foretold by noises roaring like the cataract of niagara the cylinder begins to fill it rises gradually to the surface and gradually increases its height smoking amazingly and flinging up great stones after attaining its greatest height it gradually sinks till it totally disappears boiling jets deaux and boiling springs are frequent in most parts of the island in many parts they are applied to the culinary uses of the natives the most capital is that which is called geyer in a plain rising into small hills and in the midst of an amphitheatre bounded by the most magnificent and variousshaped icy mountains among which the threeheaded hecla soars preeminent  these huers are not confined to the land they rise in the very sea in the sea and form scalding fountains amidst the waves their distance from the land is unknown but the new vulcanic isle twelvemiles off the point of reickenes emitting fire and smoke proves that the subterraneous fires and waters extend to that space for those aweful effects arise from the united fury of these two elements see mr whitebursts theory  the depth of water between this new creation and the geirfugl skier is fortyfour fathoms ten leagues to the west two hundred and five and the bottom composed of black sand sable noir comme la poudre a canon voyage au nord par m de kerguelin     doubtless no other than the pumex arenaceus the frequent evomition of vulcanoes how much past human comprehension must the powers have been that could force up materials for an island even from the medium depth i have given and how deep beneath the bottom of the ocean must have been the causes which could supply stone or pumice or lava to fill the space which this island occupies many miles in circumference and possibly above a hundred fathoms in depth  if some islands spring out of these seas others are swallowed by the force of earthquakes their foundations are undermined by the fury of the subterraneous elements which carries off the materials of their basis and discharges it in lava or different forms through the vulcanic spiracula the earthquakes shatter the crust on which they stand and they tumble into the great abyss such was the fate of the nine isles of gouberman which lay about four leagues from sandaness between patrixfiord and cape nort all which suddenly disappeared their names still exist in several maps but their place is only distinguishable by the superior depth of water in the spot on which they stood the same         the number of inhabitants in iceland is computed not to exceed sixty thousand people number of considering the ungenial surface of this vast island probably the number is equal to the means of support writers apologize for the fewness of inhabitants by attributing it to the almost depopulation of the place by the sort diod pestilence or black death a pestilence which commenced in cathay or china in      spread over all asia and africa reached the south of europe in      and in      spread itself over britain germany and northern europe even to the extremity of the inhabited north the smallpox and other epidemics are mentioned as contributing to thin the island during the time of the plague tradition relates in terms most graphically horrid that the persons who escaped to the mountains saw the whole low country covered with a thick pestiferous fog a guess may be made at the number of inhabitants in the eleventh century for a bishop of schalholt caused in  0

much of the labor in the northern world falls to the female part of the family and in those patriarchal times the sons also shared the toil i cannot therefore underrate the number of commonalty or untaxable people heads of families at ten thousand which by the same rule will give fifty thousand of the lower rank besides the dearth of food in this rude island other causes contribute to prevent the increase of inhabitants necessity forces the men to seek from the sea subsistence denied by their niggardly land constant wet cold and hard labor abridge the days of thousands and that labor is increased tenfold to supply the rapacity of their masters incredible as it may seem a late king of denmark sold the whole island and its inhabitants to a company of merchants for the annual rent of one thousand pounds this company enslave the poor natives who are bound to sell their fish the staple of the island at a low price to these monopolizers who dreading resistance even have taken from them the use of firearms here is given a stronger cause of depopulation perhaps than the others for hymen can have but faint votaries in the land from whence liberty is banished but for these causes here ought to be found the genuine species of the norman race unmixed with foreign blood as must be the case with every place remote from the rest of the world here are to be sought the ancient customs and diet of their original stock which are now probably worn out in the land of their distant ancestors the luxury of food has so little crept in among them that their meat and drink in general is peculiar to themselves and much of the former composed of herbs neglected in other places  dress the dress of the natives seems unchanged for a very considerable time that of the men is simple not unlike that of the norwegian peasants see olaffen i tab iii ponroppidan ii tab p      that of the females is graceful elegant and peculiar to them and perhaps some very oldfashioned norwegian lady they ornament themselves with silver chains and rich plates of silver beautifully wrought on their head is a lofty slender dress not unlike a phrygian bonnet i cannot compare this to

north of scotland voy hebrides  others seem to me the various scandinavian antiquities admirably exemplified in baron dahlbergs suecia antiqua et moderna  the species of quadrupeds of this island are very few domestic quadrupeds small horses of a hardy kind cows in great abundance and mostly hornless the flesh and hides of which are considerable articles of exportation sheep are met with in great flocks in every farm the wool is manufactured at home the meat salted and with the skins much of it is sold to the company at the twentytwo ports allotted for the purposes of traffic it is remarkable that the climate disposes their horns to grow very large and even to exceed the number of those of the sheep of other countries examples of three four and five being extremely frequent goats and swine are very scarce the first for want of shrubs to brouze the last through deficiency of their usual food and the supply which the farmyards of other countries afford  the dogs are sharpnosed have short and sharp upright ears bushy tails and are full of hair here are domestic cats but numbers are grown wild and multiply among the rocks so as to become noxious the reader need not be reminded that these and every species of domestic animals were originally introduced into iceland by the norwegians  an attempt has been made to introduce the rein deer arct zool no   those which survived the

cross rivers to make their distant forages in their return with the booty to their magazines they are obliged to repass the stream of which mr olaffen gives the following account  the party which consists of from six to ten select a flat piece of dried cow dung on which they place the berries in a heap in the middle then by their united force bring it to the waters edge and after launching it embark and place themselves round the heap with their heads joined over it and their backs to the water their tails pendent in the stream serving the purpose of rudders olaffen as related to him  when

spread and pursuit made till it is destroyed the icelanders are very intrepid in their attack on this animal and a single man armed only with a spear frequently enters the lists with this tremendous beast and never fails of victory a person who lived near langeness the extreme northern point where the bears most frequently land is still celebrated for having slain not fewer than twenty in single combat there is a reward for every skin which must be delivered to the next magistrate  the common bat p     a is sometimes found in this island and finishes the list of the landanimals of the country  the amphibious quadrupeds or seals are very numerous iceland being blessed with domestic animals has less use of this race than other arctic countries yet they are of considerable advantage the skins are used for clothing a good one is equal in value to the skin of a sheep or the hide of a cow and the fat supplies the lamps in the long nights with oil the common during winter is excessively fat and will yield sixty pounds  seals the icelanders have two species of native seals the common no    called by them land saelur because it keeps near the coast the other the great no    or utsaelur they are taken in nets placed in the creeks and narrow bays which they pass through to get on shore when it begins to grow dark the hunters make a fire and fling into it the shavings of horns or any thing that smells strong this allures the seals who strike into the nets and are taken at other times a koder or lure is tied to a rope and placed before the nets to which the seals supposing it to be some strange animal will eagerly swim and strike into the nets paying with their lives for their curiosity this carries them sometimes so far that they will stray to a considerable distance inland attracted by a candle or the fire in a smiths forge if they are taken young they are capable of being tamed they will follow their master and come to him like a dog when called by the name which is given them the icelanders have a strange superstition about these animals they believe they resemble the human species more than any other and that they are the offspring of pharaoh and his host who were converted into seals when they were overwhelmed in the red sea  other species of seals are migratory among them is the harp no    or vadeselur these quit the seas of iceland in march and swim

sarmatae hippopodae we may add that the hippopodae and panoti might be the inhabitants of the northern part of the bothnian gulf the first fabled to have hoofs like horses the last ears so large as to serve instead of cloaks the hippopodae were certainly the same sort of people as the finni lignipedes of olaus and the skride finnus of ohthere they wore snowshoes which might fairly give the idea of their being like horses hoofed and shod as to the panoti they baffle my imagination  the bothnian and finland gulphs seem to me to have been in the time of tacitus part of his mare pigrum ac immotum

the welsh mor sea and marw dead the other from the irish muircroinn the coagulated i e congealed sea tacitus adds to his account that it was believed to encircle the whole globe and that the last light of the setting sun continued so very vivid as to obscure the stars themselves there is not a single circumstance of exaggeration in all this every winter the gulf is frozen and becomes motionless many instances may be adduced even of the baltic itself being frozen forsters obs  0  the stars are frequently lost in the amazing splendour and various colors of the aurora borealis the hilleviones an ancient people of sweden styled scandinavia alterum orbem terrarum and their descendants long carolled the junction of the bothnian gulf with the northern ocean traditionally rehearsed in old swedish songs tacitus uses the two last words to express the world surrounded by this sea in the days of the geographer mela there certainly was a strong tide in this upper part of the baltic for speaking of the islands off finland he says quae sarmatis adversa sunt ob alternos accessus recursusque pelagi et quod spatia queis distant modo operiuntur undis modo nuda sunt alias insulae videntur alias una et continens terra with propriety therefore in another place does he compare it to a straight par freto notwithstanding he was ignorant of its other entrance ancient streights between doctor pallas most justly ascribes the formation of not only the baltic but its former communication with the white sea to the effects of a deluge the whole intermediate country is a proof the foundation being what is called the old rock and that covered with variety of matter such as beds of pebble and gravel and fragments of granite torn from the great mass the baltic and white sea parts of the channel which formed the insulation of scandinavia are the chain of lakes from that of ladoga to the white sea such as onega and others often connected by rivers and lying in a low country filled with the proofs abovementioned this was the straight through which the tide poured itself from the hyperborean ocean and covered at its flux the islands described by mela this like the other northern seas was annually frozen over and could be no obstacle to the stocking of scandinavia with quadrupeds there is no fixing the period in which this passage was obstructed an influx of sand or

parts voy hebrides  we must have recourse to a cause very remote from this place gulphstream their vehicle is the gulphstream from the gulf of mexico the tradewinds force the great body of the ocean from the westward through the antilles into that gulf when it is forced backward along the shore from the mouth of the mississipi to cape florida doubles that cape in the narrow sea between it and cuba and from cape florida to cape cannaveral runs nearly north at the distance of from five to seven leagues from shore and extends in breadth from fifteen to eighteen leagues there are regular soundings from the land to the edge of the stream where the depth is generally seventy fathoms after that no bottom can be found the soundings off cape cannaveral are very steep and uncertain as the water shallows so quick that from forty fathoms it will immediately lessen to fifteen and from that to four or less so that without great care a ship may be in a few minutes on shore it must be observed that notwithstanding the gulphstream in general is said to begin where soundings end yet its influence extends several leagues within the soundings and vessels often find a considerable current setting to the northward all along the coast till they get into eight or ten fathom water even where the soundings stretch to twenty leagues from the shore but their current is generally augmented or lessened by the prevaling winds the force of which however can but little affect the grand unfathomable stream from cape cannaveral to cape hatteras the soundings begin to widen in the extent of their run from the shore to the inner edge of the stream the distance being generally near twenty leagues and the soundings very regular to about seventy fathoms near the edge of the stream where no bottom can be afterward found abreast of savannah river the current sets nearly north after which as if from a bay it stretches northeast to cape hatteras and from thence it sets eastnortheast till it has lost its force as cape hatteras runs a great way into the sea the edge of the stream is only from five to seven leagues distant from the cape and the force and rapidity of the main stream has such influence within that distance over ships bound to the southward that in very high foul winds or in calms they have frequently been hurried back to the northward which has often occasioned great disappointment both to merchant ships and to men of war as was often experienced in the late war in december      an exceeding good sailing ship bound from philadelphia to charlestown got abreast of cape hatteras every day during thirteen days sometimes even with the tide and in a middle distance between the cape and the inner edge of the stream yet the ship was forced back regularly and could only recover its lost way with the morning breeze till the fourteenth day when a brisk gale helped it to stem the current and get to the southward of the cape this shows the impossibility of any thing which has fallen into the stream returning or stopping in its course  on the outside of the stream is a strong eddy or contrary current toward the ocean and on the inside next to america a strong tide sets against it when it sets off from cape hatteras it takes a current nearly northeast but in its course meets a great current that sets from the north and probably comes from hudsons bay along the coast of labrador till the island of newfoundland divides it part setting along the coast through the streights of belleisle and sweeping past cape breton runs obliquely against the gulphstream and gives it a more eastern direction the other part of the northern current is thought to join it on the eastern side of newfoundland the influence of these joint currents must be far felt yet possibly its force is not so great nor contracted in such a pointed and circumscribed direction as before they encountered the prevaling winds all over this part of the ocean are the west and northwest and consequently the whole body of the western ocean seems from their influence to have what the mariners call a set to the eastward or to the northeast by east thus the productions of jamaica and other places bordering on the gulf of mexico may be first brought by the stream out of the gulf inveloped in the sargasso or alga of the gulf round cape florida and hurried by the current either along the american shore or sent into the ocean in the course along the stream and then by the set of the stream and the prevaling winds which generally blow twothirds of the year wafted to the shores of europe where they are found for this curious account i am indebted to doctor garden who by his long residence in charlestown is extremely well acquainted with the subject   the mast of the tilbury man of war burnt at jamaica was thus conveyed to the western side of scotland and among the amazing quantity of driftwood or timber annually flung on the coasts of

impatiently waiting for the cetaceous fish the harbingers of the others they look for them at the moon torre or the first new one after christmas and the moon gio which immediately follows  these herrings frequent the great sandbanks where they deposit their spawn they are followed by the spring herrings a lesser fish which approach much nearer to the shore after which arrive the summer herring which almost literally fill every creek the whole fishery is of immense profit from january to october      were exported from bergen alone eleven thousand and thirteen lasts and it was expected that as many more would be shipped off before the expiration of the year the herrings which visit this coast are only part of the vast northern army which annually quits the great deeps and gives wealth and food to numbers of european nations  the cod yields another fishery of great profit cod they first arrive immediately after the earliest herrings and grow so pampered with their fry that they reject a bait and are taken in vast nets which are set down in fifty or seventy fathom water and taken up every twentyfour hours with four or five hundred great fish entangled in them as the herrings retire the cod grows hungry and after that is taken with hook and line baited with herring in more advanced season other varieties of cod arrive and are taken in common with turbot and other fish with long lines to which two hundred short lines with hooks are fastened the whole is sunk to the bottom its place is marked by a buoy fastened to it by another line of fit length the extent of the codfishery may be judged of on hearing that  0000 tonder of four bushels each of french and spanish salt are annually imported into bergen for that purpose only  the ling is taken on the great

their former seats and make the shores of the frozen ocean as clear as the equatorial seas a farther discovery on this side was denied to the noble navigator his misfortune will for ever redound to his honor as it proved his spirit his perseverance and a soul fertile in expedients among the greatest difficulties  that navigators have gone into higher latitudes i cannot deny the authenticated instances only show their accidental good fortune in having the ice driven toward the pole and in making a retreat before they were enveloped in the returning ice the russians under vice admiral

the tschutskinoss arrived near the river olutora south of the river anadyr where he suffered shipwreck but escaped to enjoy the honor of his discovery many other attempts were made but the most which the adventurers have done was to get from the mouth of one great river to another in the course of a summer i find very few names except of rivers in a tract so vast as it is on account of its being

and getting entangled among the ice between the medviedkie ostrova or bear islands was obliged to lay up his vessel in one of the mouths of the kolyma during winter where he subsisted on reindeer which frequented those parts in great herds during the severe season and on various species of salmon and trout which were pushing their way up the river before it was frozen after this he made two other attempts in the year      he passed the peszcanoinoss and got into a deep bay called tschaoun skaja gouba with the isle of sabedei at its mouth the great schalatskoinoss to the east and at its bottom the little river tschaoun which discharges itself here out of the land of the tschutski some of whom he saw on the shore but they fled on his appearance he found no means of subsisting in this bay therefore was obliged to return to the lena and was greatly assisted in his passage by the strength of the current which uniformly set from the east in      he made his last attempt and was as is conjectured slain by the tschutski but whether he doubled the famous cape of that name is left uncertain a ms map which doctor pallas favored me with places the montanous isle before mentioned in lat

the voyage  the russians have often gained dearbought victories over this brave people but never were able to effect their conquest they retained an high sense of liberty and constantly refused to pay tribute and the ambitious european miscalled them rebels they will not on any consideration part with their weapons possibly a tschutski may think a disarmed man dishonored captain cook in his three hours visit to them found their attachment to their arms notwithstanding they willingly parted with any thing else and even without the prospect of exchange they treated him with great civility but prudent caution saluted him by bowing and pulling off their caps possibly a piece of politeness they learned from the russians they treated him with a song and dance and parted friends but not without a most remarkable and consequential event  a year after the interview between captain cook and the tschutski a party of those people came to the frontier post of the russians and voluntarily offered friendship and tribute these generous people whom fear could not influence were overcome by the civility and good conduct of our illustrious commander they mistook him and his people for russians and imagining that a change of behavior had taken place tendered to their invaders a lasting league voy iii      possibly the munificent empress may blush at the obligation conferred by means of british

tchaoun by the icy sea the streights of bering and the gulf and river of anadir which open into the sea of kamtschatka it is a mountanous tract totally destitute of wood and consequently of animals which require the shelter of forests the promontory schalotskoi before mentioned is the most westerly part whether it extends so far north as lat    as the russians place it is very doubtful there is the opinion of our great navigator against it from his own reasonings he supposed that the tract from the indigirska eastward corrections in geography by capt cook is laid down in the maps two degrees to the northward of its true position voyage iii      from a map he had in his possession and from information he received from the russians he places the mouth of the kowyma in lat    instead of lat     0 as the petersburg map makes it it is therefore probable that no part of asia in this neighborhood extends further than lat  0 in which we must place the schalotskoi noss and after the example of mr campbell who formed his map of this country chiefly from the papers of captain bering in harriss voy ii  0    give the land which lies to the east of that promontory a very southern trend as captain cook had cause to imagine that the former charts erred in longitude as well as latitude it is probable that he reached within sixty miles of the schalotskoi noss voyage iii   0  there we find

could with prudence burneys isle toward the southeast and found it retain the same appearance in lat       he discovered a small isle about three leagues from the main with steep and rocky shores on

voyage he was in the service of peter the great who by the strength of an extensive genius conceiving an opinion of the vicinity of america to his asiatic dominions laid down a plan of discovery worthy of so extraordinary a monarch but died before the attempt was begun but his spirit survived in his successor bering after a tedious and fatiguing journey through the wilds of sibiria arrived in kamtschatka attended with the scanty materials for his voyage the greatest part of which he was obliged to bring with him through a thousand difficulties several of the circumstances of his adventures

the saranne saranne or lilium kamtschatcense is among the principal its roots are gathered by the women in august dried in the sun and laid up for use they are the best bread of the country and after being baked are reduced to powder and serve instead of flour in soups and several dishes they are sometimes washed and eaten as potatoes are extremely nourishing and have a pleasant bitter taste our navigators boiled and eat them with their meat the natives often parboil and beat it up with several sorts of berries so as to form of it a very agreeable confection providentially it is an universal plant here and all the grounds bloom with its flower during the season desc kamtsch      another happiness remarked here is that while fish are scarce the saranne is plentiful and when there is a dearth of this the rivers pour in their provisions in redoubled profusion it is not to the labors of the females alone that the kamtschatkans are indebted for these roots the oeconomic mouse p     a

have the instinct of bringing them out in sunny weather to dry them least they should decay pallas nov sp mur   0  the natives search for their hoards but with prudent tenderness leave part for the owners being unwilling to suffer such useful caterers to perish  let me add that steller enumerates other species of the lilly genus which i believe are edible every species of fruit except berries is denied to this unkind climate but the inhabitants use various sorts of them as wholesome substitutes which they eat fresh or make into palatable jams or dress with their fish either fresh or when preserved for winter use such are those of the lonicera xylosteum or gimolost a sort of honeysuckle the rubus chamaemorus morochka or cloudberries the vaccinium myrtillus uliginosum vitis idaea and oxycoccos or bilberries marsh bilberries red bilberries and cranberries the empetrum nigrum or heathberries the prunus padus or bird cherry crataegus oxyacantha or white thorn with red and with black

common and useful in medicine as well as food both russians and natives gather it in great quantities for winter service they steep it in water then mix it with cabbage onions and other ingredients

pinus cembra trees or pine with edible kernels it grows in great quantities on both the mountains and plains covered with moss it never grows upright but creeps on the ground and is therefore called by the russians slanetz the natives eat the kernels with even the cones which brings on a tenesmus but the chief use of the tree is as a sovereign medicine in the scurvy bering taught the kamtschatkans to make a decoction of it but they have neglected his instructions notwithstanding they saw numbers of his people restored to health in a short time and snatched as it were from the jaws

mechanical services of the country with it they build their houses their fortifications and boats they make use of the populus alba or white poplar for the same purposes of the betula alba or common birch a tree so useful to these northern nations they make their sledges and canoes and cut the fresh bark into small slices like vermicelli and eat it with their dried caviar they also tap the trees and drink the liquor without any preparation with the bark of the alder they dye their leather but that and every tree they have near the coast is stunted so that they are obliged to go far inland for timber of proper size  i must add as a vegetable of use in oeconomics the triticum gm sib i     no    which grows in great quantities along the shores which they mow and work into mats which serve for bed clothes and curtains into mantles smooth on one side and with a pile on the other which is waterproof they also make with it sacks and very elegant baskets these as well as the mats they ornament

dry on their huts they tear it to pieces beat and clean it then spin it between their hands and twist the thread round a spindle it is the only material they have to make their nets which for want of skill in the preparation will rot and last no longer than one season same       quadrupeds in respect to the quadrupeds of this country i have reason to think from the great assistance i have received from the russian academists or their labors that my account of them in my zoological part of this work can receive little addition i request that the brown bear no  0 may be substituted instead of the black no    as the native of kamtschatka i was led into the mistake by the suspicions of a most able naturalist i am since informed by the best authority that of captain king see voy iii  0  to  0

carnivorous into animal  and prey at times on the argali or wild sheep but do not attack man except urged by extreme hunger or provoked by wounds or by the slaughter of their young when nothing but their death can secure the safety of the persons who fall in their way in the first case they will hunt mankind by the scent and sacrifice them to their want of food which usually is fish or berries  the kamtschatkans never read pope but observe his advice learn from the beasts the physic of the field the bear is their great master and they owe all their knowledge in medicine and surgery and the polite arts to this animal they observe the herbs to which he has recourse when he is ill or when he is wounded and the same simples prove equally restorative to the twolegged ursine race the last even acknowledge the bear as their dancing master and are most apt scholars in mimicking his attitudes and graces voy iii  0   i was informed by one of the gentlemen who was on the voyage that the sea otter no    was seen on the first arrival on the american coast but as it is not mentioned in that excellent and magnificent work till the arrival of the ships in nootka sound i will not insist on the accuracy of its latitude  the argali yields a dish of most excellent flavor argali the natives work the horns into spoons small cups and platters and have frequently a small one hanging at their belts by way of a drinking horn in their hunting expeditions same       the dogs are like the pomeranian but vastly larger the hair rather coarser dogs and the usual color light dun or dirty cremecolor bitches are never used for the draught but dogs alone which are trained to it from their puppyhood by being tied with thongs to stakes with their food placed at a small distance beyond their reach so that by constant laboring and straining they acquire both strength of limb and habit of drawing same       the leonine and ursine seals and the manati seals must have been on their migrations during the time the navigators visited this peninsula for they saw not one of those curious animals the common seals being stationary were met with in great numbers the bottlenosed seal or sealion of lord anson is totally unknown in these seas i refer the reader for a view of the quadrupeds and birds of kamtschatka to the catalogue which captain king honored with a place in the third volume of the voyage by some typographical mistake the greater part of the webbedfooted birds are in the first edition placed under the division of clovenfooted the naturalist reader will easily see that the birds from crane p     to pied oystercatcher ought to be placed in the division of clovenfooted and from great tern p     to redfaced corvorant p     should be put after redthroated diver p     the webbed

natives who believe them to be spies sent by the infernal gods to examine their actions and predict their deaths if they catch one they cut it into small pieces to prevent it from giving any account of its mission if it escapes out of their hands they abandon themselves to melancholy and expect every moment their dissolution which often happens through fear and serves to confirm the superstition

who for the greater part must for ever be deprived of support derived from grain and cattle the vegetables they have are sufficient to correct the putrescent quality of the dried fish and often form an ingredient in the dishes which are prepared different ways the joukola is made of the salmon kind cut into six pieces and dried either in the open air or smoked the roes are another dish in high esteem with them either dried in the air or rolled in the leaves of different plants and dried before the fire they can live along time on a small quantity of this food and eat with it the bark of birch or willow trees to assist them in swallowing a food so very viscid but their ambrosial repast is the huigul or fish flung into a pit till it is quite rotten when it is served up in the state of

sticklebacks  but the fish of the first importance to the kamtschatkans salmon and on which they depend for subsistence are the anadromous kinds or those which at stated seasons ascend the rivers and lakes out of the sea these are entirely of the salmon genus with exception to the common herring which in autumn quits the salt water it is said that every species of salmon is found here i may with certainty adjoin that several of the sibirian species with variety peculiar to this country ascend the kamtschatkan rivers in multitudes incredible the inhabitants dignify some of their months by the names of the fish one is called kouiche or the month of red fishes another ajaba or that of little white fish a third kaiko or of the fish kaiko and a fourth kijou or the month of the great white fish hist kamtsch      it is observable that each shoal keeps apart from others of different species and frequently prefers a separate river notwithstanding the mouths may be almost contiguous they often come up in such numbers as to force the water before them and even to dam up the rivers and make them overflow their banks insomuch that on the fall of the water such multitudes are left on dry ground as to make a stench capable of causing a pestilence was it not fortunately dispersed by the violence of the winds besides the bears and dogs assist by preying on them to lessen the ill effects  every species of salmon dies in the same river or lake in which it is born and to which it returns to spawn in the third year male and female consort together and the latter deposits its spawn in a hole formed with its tail and fins in the sand after which both sexes pine away and cease to live a fish of a years growth continues near the place guards the spawn and returns to the sea with the newborn fry in november descr kamtsch      the salmons of this country spawn but once in their lives those of sibiria and europe the rivers of which are deep and abound with insect food are enabled to continue the first great command of nature during the period of their existence in kamtschatka the rivers are chilly shallow rapid full of rocks and destitute of nourishment for such multitudes such therefore which cannot force their way to the neighborhood of the tepid streams or get back to the sea in time universally perish but providence has given such resources in the spawners that no difference in numbers is ever observed between the returning seasons it is singular that neither the lakes or rivers have any species of fish but what come from the sea all the lakes for this country abounds with them communicate with the sea but their entrance as well as that of many of the rivers is entirely barred up with sand brought by the tempestuous winds which confine the fish most part of the winter till they are released by the storms taking another direction  the species which appears first is the tshawytscha tshawytscha this is by much the largest it weighs sometimes between fifty and sixty pounds and its depth is very great in proportion to the length the jaws are equal and never hooked the teeth large and in several rows the scales are larger than those of the common salmon p

in fresh waters it is confined on the eastern side of the peninsula to the river of kamtschatka and awatcha and on the western to the bolchaiareka and a few others nor is it ever seen beyond lat    it enters the mouths of the rivers about the middle of may with such impetuosity as to raise the water before it in waves it goes in far less numbers than the other species is infinitely more esteemed and is not used as a common food but reserved for great entertainments the natives watch its arrival which is announced by the rippling of the water take it in strong nets and always eat the first they take under a notion that the omission would be a great crime numbers of rays in the dorsal pectoral ventral and anal fins   the naerka is another species called by the russians krasnaya ryba naerka from the intense purplish redness of the flesh it is of the form of the common salmon p d    p    v  0 a    but never exceeds sixteen pounds in weight when it first enters the rivers it is of a silvery brightness with a bluish back and fins when it leaves the sea the teeth are small and jaws strait but after it has been some time in the fresh water the jaws grow crooked especially in the male and the teeth large it begins to ascend the rivers in vast numbers in june penetrates to their very sources and returns in september to the sea first resting for some time in the deep parts of the intervening lakes it is taken in nets either in the bays as it approaches the rivers or in the rivers after it has quitted the sea this species is described  voyage iii     under the name of red fish the preceding in p   0 under that of tchavitsi   the kysutch kysutch or bjelaya ryba or white fish of the russians ascends the rivers in july particularly such as are discharged from the inland

the flesh white after it has been some time in the fresh water it changes its shape the male especially in a most surprising manner the jaws and teeth grow prodigiously long especially the upper which at first is shortest but soon shoots beyond the under and grows crooked downwards the body becomes emaciated and the meat bad but what is most characteristic an enormous bunch rises just before the first dorsal fin to which it owes its name its flesh is bad so that this fish falls to the share of the dogs  the malma malma or golet of the russians grows to the weight of twenty pounds and to the length of about twentyeight inches p d    p    v   a  0 it is the most slender and cylindrical of all the genus the head resembles that of a trout the scales are very small the back and sides bluish

water and snatch at both leaves and berries which hang over the banks same      in shape it resembles a common salmon seldom grows above two feet long has large scales blunt nose and numerous teeth the back is dusky marked with black spots and on each side is a broad band of bright red the belly white it is a species of excellent flavor but is scarcer than the other kinds its time of arrival is not known m steller therefore suspects that it ascends the rivers beneath the ice same       the kunsha kunsha mentioned in page civ frequents the bays of this country but never advances inland and grows to the length of two feet the nose is short and pointed the back and sides dusky marked with great yellowish spots some round others oblong the belly white the lower fins and tail blue the flesh white and excellent it is a scarce fish in these parts but near ochotsk ascends the rivers in great shoals  i conclude this division of the tribe with the common salmon which is frequent here and like the others ascends the rivers equally to the advantage of the natives of the country  of the salmon which linnaeus distinguished by the title of coregoni is the inghaghitsh inghaghitsh p d     p    v

it does not exceed five inches in length it arrives in spring and autumn and in both seasons is full of spawn and smells like a smelt  the innyagha is another small kind innyagha about five inches long and not unlike the s albula of linnaeus it is a rare species and found but in few rivers p d   p    v   a     the most singular is the ouiki ouiki or salmo catervarius of steller it belongs to the osmeri of linnaeus swims in immense shoals on the eastern coast of kamtschatka and the newdiscovered islands where it is often thrown up by the sea to the height of some feet upon a large extent of shore is excessively unwholesome as a food and causes fluxes even in dogs it never exceeds seven inches in length just above the sideline is a rough fascia beset with minute pyramidal scales standing upright so as to appear like the pile of shag their use is most curious  while they are swimming and even when they are flung on shore two three or even as many as ten will adhere as if glued together by means of this pile insomuch that if one is taken up all the rest are taken up at the same time  to conclude this list of kamtschatkan salmon i must add the salmo thymallus or grayling the s cylindraceus before described the salmo albula lin syst     and the salmo eperlanus or common smelt to those which ascend the rivers  for this account i am indebted to doctor pallas who extracted it from the papers of steller for the use of this work  the herring herring both the common and the variety found in the gulf of bothnia called the membras and by the suedes stroeming faun suec p     visit these coasts in shoals perhaps equal to those of europe there are two seasons the first about the end of may the second in october the first species are remarkably fine and large voyage iii   0  they ascend the rivers and enter the lakes the autumnal migrants are closed up in them by the shifting of the sand at the mouths of the entrance and remain confined the whole winter the natives catch them in summer in nets and in winter in most amazing numbers by breaking holes in the ice into which they drop their nets then cover the opening with mats and leave a small hole for one of their companions to peep through and observe the coming of the fish when they draw up their booty and string part on packthread for drying and from the remainder they press an oil white as the butter of finland descr kamtsch       the sea sea on which these people depend for their very existence is finely adapted for the retreat and preservation of fish it does not consist of a level uniform bottom liable to be ruffled with storms but of deep valleys and lofty mountains such as yield security and tranquillity to the finned inhabitants we find the soundings to be most unequal in some places only twentytwo fathoms in others the lead has not found a bottom with a hundred and sixty fathoms of line on such places the fish might rest undisturbed during the rage of the tempestuous winters i do not find the least notice of shells being met with in these seas either there are none or they are pelagic and escape the eyes of the navigators but nature probably has made ample provision for the inhabitants of the sea in the quantity of seaplants which it yields steller the great explorer of this region enumerates the following many of which are of uncommon elegance fucus peucedanifolius gm

harbors of sts peter and paul the greatest rise of the tides was five feet eight inches at full and change of the moon at thirtysix minutes past four and they were very regular every twelve hours voyage iii      the russian philosophers observed here a singular phenomenon in the flux and reflux of the sea twice in the twentyfour hours in which is one great flood and one small flood the last of which is called manikha at certain times nothing but the water of the river is seen within its proper channel at other times in the time of ebb the waters are observed to overflow their banks in the manikha after an ebb of six hours the water sinks about three feet and the tide returns for three hours but does not rise above a foot a sevenhours ebb succeeds which carries off the seawater and leaves the bay dry thus it happens three days before and after the full moon after which the great tide diminishes and the manikha or little tide increases descr kamtsch   0   the rivers of the country rise in the midst of the great chain of mountains and flow on each side into the seas of ochotsk or that of kamtsckatka they furnish a ready passage in boats or canoes with the intervention of carryingplaces quite across the peninsula as has been mentioned the waters yield no fish of their own but are the retreat of myriads of migrants from the neighboring seas  this peninsula and the country to the west natives are inhabited by two nations the northern parts by the koriacs who are divided into the reindeer or wandering and the fixed koriacs koriacs and the southern part by the kamtschatkans properly so called the first lead an erratic life wandering in the tract bounded by the penschinska sea to the southeast the river kowyma to the west and the river anadir to the north hist kamtsch      they wander from place to place with their reindeer in search of the moss the food of those animals their only wealth see p    of this work  they are squalid cruel and warlike the terror of the fixed koriacs as much as the tschutski are of them they never frequent the sea nor live on fish their habitations are jourts or places half sunk in the earth they never use balagans or summerhouses elevated on posts like the kamtschatkans are in their persons lean and very short have small heads and black hair which they shave frequently their faces are oval nose short their eyes small mouth large beard black and pointed but often eradicated  the fixed koriacs are likewise short but rather taller than the others fixed and strongly made they inhabit the north of the peninsula the anadir is also their boundary to the north the ocean to the east and the kamtschatkans to the south they have few reindeer which they use in their sledges but neither of the tribes of koriacs are civilized enough to apply them to the purposes of the dairy each speak a different dialect of the same language but the fixed in most things resemble the kamtschatkans and like them live almost entirely on fish they are timid to a high degree and behave to their wandering brethren with the utmost submission who call them by a name which signifies their slaves these poor people seem to have no alternative for by reason of the scarcity of reindeer they depend on these tyrants for the essential article of clothing i cannot trace the origin of these two nations but from the features may pronounce them offspring of tartars which have spread to the east and degenerated in size and strength by the rigor of the climate and often by scarcity of food  kamtschatkans the true kamtschatkans the most proper word for the natives of this country is kamtschadales but as i have on many occasions used this i wish to continue it posseses the country from the river ukoi to the southern extremity the cape lopatka they are supposed by m steller to have been derived from the mongalian chinese not only from a similarity in the termination of many of their words but in the resemblance of their persons which are short their complexion is swarthy their beard small their hair black face broad and flat eyes small and sunk eyebrows thin belly pendent legs small  circumstances common to them and the mongalians it is conjectured that in some very remote age they fled hither to escape the yoke of the eastern conquerors notwithstanding they believe themselves to be aboriginal created and placed on the spot by their god koutkou  religion in respect to their deity they are perfect minute philosophers they find fault with his dispensations blaspheme and reproach him with having made too many mountains precipices breakers shoals and cataracts with forming storms and rains and when they are descending in the winter from their barren rocks they load him with imprecations for the fatigue they undergo in their morals they likewise bear a great similitude to numbers among the most polished rank in the european nations  they think nothing vicious that may be accomplished without danger and give full loose to every crime provided it comes within the pale of security  genii they have also their lesser deities or genii each of them have their peculiar charge to these they pay considerable veneration and make offerings to them to divert their anger or ensure their protection the kamouli preside over the mountains particularly the vulcanic the ouchakthou over the woods mitg over the sea gaetch over the subterraneous world and fouila is the author of earthquakes they believe that the world is eternal that the soul is immortal that in the world below it will be reunited to the body and experience all the pains usual in its former state but that it never will suffer hunger but have every thing in great abundance that the rich will become poor and the poor rich a sort of just dispensation and balance of former good and evil hist kamtsch        but almost all these superstitions are vanished by the attention of the russians to their conversion there are few who have not embraced the christian religion churches have been built and schools erected in which they are successfully taught the language of their conquerors which has already almost worn out that of the native people  numbers of people the country was very populous at the arrival of the russians but after a dreadful visitation of the smallpox which in      swept away twenty thousand souls voyage iii      at present there are not above three thousand who pay tribute the inhabitants of the kuril isles included here are about four hundred of the military russians and cossacks besides a number of russian

remarked that the breed is far more active than the pure russian or cossack sunk in lordly indolence they leave all the work to the kamtschatkans or to their women and suffer the penalty of their laziness by the scurvy in its most frightful forms  the kamtschatkans seem to retain the ancient form of their dress dress but during summer it is composed of foreign materials in the warm season both sexes use nankeen linen and silk in winter the skins of animals well dressed the dress of men and women resembles a carters frock with long sleeves furred at the wrists the bottom and about the neck on their head is a hood of fur sometimes of the shaggy skin of a dog and often of the elegant skin of the earless marmot trousers boots and furred mittens compose the rest the habit of ceremony of a toion or chieftain is very magnificent and will cost a hundred and twenty rubels in ancient times it was hung over with the tails of animals and his furred hood flowed over each shoulder with the respectability of a fullbottomed perriwig in the days of charles ii the figure given in the history of kamtschatka translated into french exhibits a great man in all his pride of dress see hist kamtschatka tab vi  it differs much from the habit of ceremony described by captain king iii      but so rapidly has the present race of natives copied the russians that possibly in so short a space as half a century this habit as well as numbers of other articles and customs may be ranked among the antiquities of the country  bows and arrows are now quite disused arms formerly they used bows made of larchwood covered with the bark of the birch the arrows were headed with stone or bone and their lances with the same materials their armor was either mats or formed of thongs cut out of the skins of seals and sewed together so as to make a pliable cuirass which they fixed on their left side a board defended their breast and a high one on their back defended both that and the head  their savage and beastly hospitality is among the obsolete customs hospitality formerly as a mark of respect to a guest the host set before him as much food as would serve ten people both were stripped naked the host politely touched nothing but compelled his friend to devour what was set before him till he was quite gorged and at the same time heated the place by incessantly pouring water on hot stones till it became unsupportable when the guest was crammed up to the throat the generous landlord on his knees stuffed into his mouth a great slice of whales fat cut off what hung out and cried in a surly tone tana or there by which he fully discharged his duty and between heat and cramming obliged the poor guest to cry for mercy and a release from the heat and the danger of being choked with the noble welcome oftentimes he was obliged to purchase his dismission with most costly presents but was sure to retaliate on the first opportunity hist kamitsch  0  to  0    dwellings from the birds

wattled and the whole covered with turf in this they live gregariously to the number of six families in each in a state intolerable to an european by reason of smoke heat and stench from their store of dried or putrid fish and from their laziness in never going out to perform their offerings to cloacina elliss nar ii       instigated by avarice the russians made a conquest of this savage country and found their account in it from the great value of its furry productions they have added to their dominions this extremity of asia distant at least four thousand miles from their capital roads to kamtschatka the journey to it is still attended with great difficulties through wild and barren regions over dreadful mountains and possibly impracticable but for the multitude of sibirian rivers which with short intervals of land facilitate the passage travelers usually take their departure out of sibiria from jakutz on the river lena in lat    they go either by water along the river to its conflux with the aldun along the aldun to the may and from that river up the judoma and from near the head of that river to ochotsk the port from whence they embark and cross the sea of ochotsk to bolschaiareka the port of the western side of kamtschatka the whole journey usually takes up the short summer that over the hills to ochotsk and which is most convenient was performed by steller in thirtyfour days excluding seven of rest descr kamtsch  0    the kuril or kurilski isles kuril isles which probably once lengthened the peninsula of kamtschatka before they were convulsed from it are a series of islands running south from the low promontory lopatka in lat    between which and shoomska the most northerly is only the distance of one league on the lofty paramouser the second in the

notes  japan abounds with vulcanoes kaempfer hist japan i  0   so that there is a series of spiracles from kamtschatka to japan the last great link of this extensive chain time may have been when the whole was a continuation of continent rent asunder before the laboring earth gave vent to its inward struggles through the mouths of the frequent vulcanoes even with these discharges japan has suffered considerably by earthquakes same  0   vulcanoes are local evils but extensive benefits  the russians soon annexed these islands to their conquests the sea abounded with sea otters and the land with bears and foxes and some of them sheltered the sable temptations sufficient for the russians to invade these islands but the rage after the furs of the sea otters has been so great that they are become extremely scarce both here and in kamtschatka  the islands which lie to the east of that peninsula and form a chain between it and america must now engage our attention they lie in the form of a crescent and are divided into three groupes the aleutian the andreanoffskie and the fox isles but mention must first be made of berings isle and that of mednoi and one or two small and of little note these lie about two hundred and fifty versts to the east of the mouth of kamtschatka river berings isle berings is in lat    where that great seaman was shipwrecked in november      on his return from his american discoveries and after enduring great hardships perished miserably numbers of his people died of the scurvy with all the dreadful symptoms attendant on those who perished by the same disease in lord ansons voyage book i chapter x and decouvertes etc ii      the survivors among whom was the philosopher steller reached kamtschatka in august      in a vessel constructed out of the wreck of their ship the isle is about seventy or eighty versts long consists of high granitical mountains craggy with rocks and peaks changing into freestone toward the promontories all the valleys run from north to south hills of sand formed by inundations of the sea floated wood and skeletons of marine animals are found at great distances from the shore at thirty fathoms perpendicular height above the high water level which serve as a monument of the violent inundations that the vulcanoes before mentioned produce in these seas farther the effect of the meteoric waters and of the frosts causes the rocks very sensibly to shiver and fall down and precipitates every year some great mass into the sea and changes the form of the island the others are in the same case so nothing is more probable than their gradual diminution and by consequence the more easy communication formerly from one continent to the other before the injuries of time the effects of vulcanoes and other catastrophes had insensibly diminished the size and perhaps the number of these isles which form the chain and had eaten in the coasts of asia which every where exhibit traces of the ravages they have undergone i am indebted to doctor pallas for the whole account of this chain of islands except where i make other references  my extracts are made from a french memoir drawn up by my learned friend and communicated to me   the island swarmed with sea otters which disappeared in march the ursine seal succeeded them in vast numbers and quitted the coast the latter end of may the leonine seal the lachtach or great seal and the manati abounded and proved the support of the wrecked during their stay arctic foxes were seen in great multitudes and completed the list of quadrupeds the same species of waterfowl haunt the rocks and the same species of fish ascend the rivers as do in kamtschatka the tides rise here seven or eight feet the bottom of the sea is rocky correspondent with the island  the few plants of this island which have not been discovered in kamtschatka are as follow campanula gm sib iii   0    leontodon taraxacum a e virg hieracium murorum b e tanacetum vulgar e gnaphalium dioicum a senecio gm sib ii     no     arnica montana chrysanthemum leucanthemum a virg these with a few creeping willows added to those in the kamtschatkan flora form the sum of those observed in berings island  mednoi mednoi or the copper island lies a little to the southeast a great quantity of native copper is found at the foot of a ridge of calcareous mountains on the eastern side and may be gathered on the shores in vast masses which seems originally to have been melted by subterraneous fires this island is full of hillocks bearing all the appearance of vulcanic spiracles which makes it probable that these islands were rent from the continent by the violence of an earthquake among the floatwood off this island is camphor and another sweet wood driven by the currents from the isle of japan  the aleutian group lies in the bend of the crescent aleutian isles the nearest nearly in midchannel between asia and america lat     0 and about two hundred versts distant from mednoi it consists of attok schemija and semitchi the first seems to surpass in size berings isle but resembles it in its component parts as do the other two attok seems to be the island which bering called mount st john these are inhabited by a people who speak a language different from the northern asiatics they seem emigrants or colonists from america using a dialect of the neighboring continent they were discovered in      by michael nevodtsikoff a native of tobolski who made a voyage at the expense of certain merchants in search of furs the great object of these navigations and the leading cause of discoveries in this sea this voyage was marked with horrid barbarities on the poor natives the marine animals must have swarmed about this period and for some time after mention is made of adventurers who brought from hence to kamtschatka the skins of      sea otters   0 females and     cubs another on a small adjacent isle killed  00 old and   0 cub sea otters   00 blue foxes   00 black ursine seals and    0 of their cubs coxes russ disc  the blue foxes abound in these islands brought here on floating ice and multiply greatly the blue variety is ten times more numerous here than the white but the reverse is observed in sibiria they feed on fish or any carrion left by the tide the natives bore their under lips and insert in them teeth cut out of the bones of the walrus and they use boats covered with the skins of sea animals  at a great distance from the first group is the second or farthest aleutian isles aleutian isles the farthest of those we know no more than that the natives resemble those of the first by the vast space of sea which doctor pallas allows between the two groups captain cook is fully vindicated for omitting in his chart the multitude of islands which in the russian maps form almost a complete chain from berings isle to america dr pallass information must have been of the best kind and he and our illustrious navigator coincide in opinion that they have been needlessly multiplied by the mistake of the russian adventurers in the reckoning or on seeing the same island in different points of view putting it down as a new discovery and imposing on it a new name the andreanoffskie andrean isles so called from their discoverer in      andrean tolstyk succeed on two of them are vulcanoes eastly are the fox islands so called from the number of black gray fox isles and red foxes found on them the skins of which are so coarse as to be of little value the natives bore their noses and under lips and insert bones in them by way of ornament among the last in this group is oonolascha which was visited by captain cook this lies so near to the coast of america as to clame a right to be considered as an appurtenance to it i shall therefore quit these detached paths for the present and in pursuance of my plan trace the coasts of the northern division of the great continent from the place at which it is divided from south america  california after traversing obliquely the pacific ocean appears california the most southerly part of my plan on this side of the new world this greatest of peninsulas extends from cape

with numbers of streams and the country abounds with trees and variety of fruits the natives the most innocent of people are in a state of paradisaical nature or at lest were so before the arrival of the european colonists among them the men went nearly naked without the consciousness of being so the head is the only part they pay any attention to and that is surrounded with a chaplet of network ornamented with feathers fruits or mother of pearl the women have a neat matted apron falling to their knees they fling over their shoulders the skin of some beast or of some large bird and wear a headdress like the other sex the weapons of the country are bows arrows javelins and bearded darts calculated either for war or the chase in the art of navigation they have not got beyond the barklog made of a few bodies of trees bound parallel together and in these they dare the turbulent element they have no houses during summer they shelter themselves from the sun under the shade of trees and during nights sleep under a roof of branches spread over them in winter they burrow under ground and lodge as simply as the beasts themselves such however was their condition in      i have not been able to learn the effect of european refinement on their manners numbers of settlements have since that time been formed there under the auspices of the jesuits the order was of late years supported by the marquis de valero a patriotic and munificent nobleman this is the nobleman whom the writer of lord ansons voyage stigmatizes with the epithet of munificent bigot it was not by a reverend author as is generally supposed but by a person whose principles were unhappily in the extreme of another tincture  having from my youth been honored with the friendship of the anson family i can give a little history of the compilation of the voyage  a mr paman first undertook the work it was afterward taken out of his hands and placed in those of the reverend mr walters chaplain of the centurion but he had no share in it farther than collecting the materials from the several journals those were delivered to mr benjamin robins a most able mathematician and the most elegant writer of his time he was son of a quakertaylor at bath whom i have often seen a most venerable and respectable old man mr robins unfortunately forgot that he was writing in the character of a divine and it was not thought proper to affront mr walters by omitting his name in the title page as he had taken in subscriptions this therefore will account for the constant omission of the word providence in a voyage which abounded with such signal deliverances  who favored their attempts in order to extend the power and wealth of the spanish dominions and i believe with success the land and climate particularly monterey in lat    is adapted for every vegetable production and a good wine is made from the vines introduced by the colonists  the natives are a fine race of men tall brawny and well made natives with black hair hanging over their shoulders and with coppercolored skins we have a most imperfect account of the animals of this peninsula it certainly possesses two woolbearing quadrupeds as to birds i doubt not but the jesuits are right when they say that it has all that are found in new mexico and new spain the capes of florida and cape st lucas lie nearly under the same latitudes and form the southern extremities of north america but our ignorance of the productions of the vast provinces of new mexico will leave ample subject to a future naturalist to supply my deficiencies  this country was discovered under the auspices of the great cortez and don antonio de mendoca cotemporary viceroy of the new conquests each actuated by a glorious spirit of emulation sent out commanders to advance the welfare of their country to the utmost and francisco ulloa in      and fernando alarchon in    0 soon discovered this peninsula and other adjacent regions sources of immense wealth to their country a full account of these voyages may be seen in hackluyt iii     etc  the spanish adventurers of these early times sailed as high as lat    and named in honor of the viceroy the farthest point of their discovery cabo di mendoca  our celebrated navigator sir francis drake sir francis drake on june  th      touched on this coast first in lat    but was induced from the severity of the cold to sail to lat    where he anchored in a fine bay he found the natives to be a fine race of men naked as the californians with the same kind of headdresses and the females habited like their southern neighbors he was treated like a deity the chief of the country by the resignation of his crown or chaplet his scepter i e calumet and other insignia of royalty vested in sir francis the whole land which he named new albion from its white cliffs and took formal possession of in the name of his royal mistress we may be thankful that we never clamed the cession it forms at present part of new

the picturesque view of suecg owner cove tab     vegetation in these parts seemed to lessen the principal trees were the canadian and spruce firs and some of them moderately large  besides the quadrupeds found at nootka quadrupeds there is a variety of bear of a white color i will not call it the polar as that animal inhabits only the severest climates where it can find dens of snow and isles of ice an animal of the ermine kind varied with brown but the tail scarcely tipped with black wolverenes were here of a very brilliant color and the earless marmot no    was very common none of these were seen living but their skins were brought in abundance as articles of commerce the skin of the head of the male leonine seal was also offered to sale in the voyage it is called the ursine but from the great shagginess of the hair i presume i am not wrong in my conjecture this is the only place in the northern hemisphere in which it was found by the navigators voy ii       birds among the birds were the black sea pies with red bills observed before in van diemens land and new zealand a duck equal in size to our mallard with a white bill tinged with red near the point and marked with a black spot on each side near the base on the forehead a large white triangular spot and a larger on the hind part of the neck the rest of the plumage dusky the tail short and pointed the legs red the female was of duller colors and the bill was far less gay another species resembled the small one found at kerguellens land a diver grebe of the size of a partridge with a black compressed bill head and neck black upper part of the body deep brown obscurely waved with black the lower part dusky speckled minutely with white honeysuckers probably migratory in this high latitude frequently flew round the ships same       to give all the additions i am able to my zoologic part i shall here mention certain species of petrels observed on the western coast of north america such as numberless brown petrels near the entrance of cooks river flying round a remarkable sugar loaf hill elliss narrative i      a species seen near nootka sound about eleven inches long with the nostrils scarcely tubular bill and plumage above dusky beneath white legs back this is common to turtle isle lat       south long       west and christmas isle lat i    north long  0   0 east another about thirteen inches long with the forehead space between the eyes and bill the chin and throat of a greyish white varied with specks of dusky crown and upper part of the body dusky under parts hoary leadcolor legs pallid this and the preceding in the leverian museum  i may add a fourth seen off the coast of kamtschatka which mr ellis mentions as being small and of a bluish color narrative ii       men mankind here show a variation from the last described the natives are generally above the common stature but many below it squarebuilt or strongchested their heads most disproportionably large their faces flat and very broad their necks short and thick their eyes small in comparison to the vast breadth of their faces their noses had full round points turned up at the end their hair long thick black and strong their beards either very thin or extirpated for several of the old men had large thick but strait beards their countenances generally full of vivacity goodnature and frankness not unlike the cristinaux a people who live far inland between the little and the great lakes ouinepique on the contrary the inhabitants of nootka in their dullness resemble the assinibouels who live on the western side dobbs     and these two nations may have been derived from a common stock with the maritime tribes whom we have had occasion to mention the skins of the natives of this sound were swarthy possibly from going often naked for the skins of many of the women and the children were white but pallid many of the women were distinguishable from the men by the delicacy of their features which was far from the case with those of nootka  in these parts within the distance of ten degrees is a change of both dress and manners the cloak and mantle are here changed for a close habit made of the skins of different beasts usually with the hair outward or of the skins of birds with only the down remaining some with a cape others with a hood over which in rainy weather is worn a garment like a carters frock with large sleeves and tight round the neck made of the intestines probably of the whale and as fine as goldbeaters leaf on the hands are always worn mittens made of the paws of a bear and the legs are covered with hose reaching to midway the thigh the head is generally bare but those who wear any thing use the high truncated conic bonnet like the people of nootka voyage ii          in this place only was observed the calumet a stick about three feet long with large feathers or the wings of birds tied to it this was held up as a sign of peace  i leave the reader to amuse himself in the voyage by the account of the strange custom of the natives in cutting through their under lip and giving themselves the monstrous appearance of two mouths same     tab        in the orifice they place a bit of bone or shell by way of ornament this custom extends to the distant mosquitos and even to the brasilians dampier i    de bry brasil      but seems unknown in other parts of america  i endeavor to confine myself to passages which may lead to trace the origin of the people these paint their faces and puncture or tattow their chins they are most remarkably clean in their food and in their manner of eating it and even in the keeping of their bowls and vessels in their persons they are equally neat and decent and free from grease or dirt voyage ii      in this they seem an exception to all other savages  they have two kinds of boats one large open boats and capable of containing above twenty people it is made of the skins of marine animals distended on ribs of wood like the vitilia navigia of the britons at the time in which they were on a level with these poor americans or like the womans boat of the greenlanders and eskimaux the canoes are exactly of the same construction with those of the latter and the difference of both is very trivial the canoes of these americans are broader than those of the eastern side of the continent and some have two circular apertures in order to admit two men voyage ii      every weapon which these people have for the chase of quadrupeds or fish is the same with those used by the greenlanders there is not one wanting  from prince williams found the land trends northwest and terminates in two headlands called cape elizabeth and cape bid capt bid these with cape banks on the opposite shore form the entrance into the vast estuary of cooks river in the midst of which are the naked isles distinguished by the name of the barren within to the west is a lofty twoheaded mountain called cape douglas which is part of a chain of a vast height in which was a vulcano at the time this place was visited emitting white smoke and in the bottom of a bay opposite to it is an island formed of a lofty mountain on which was bestowed the name of mount st augustine see the chart ii tab     mount st augustine the estuary is here of a great breadth owing to a bay running opposite to mount augustine deeply to the east  cooks river the estuary of cooks river is of great length and extent the river begins between anchor point and the opposite shore where it is thirty miles wide the depth very considerable and the ebb very rapid far within the channel contracts to four leagues through which rushes a prodigious tide agitated like breakers against rocks the rise of the tide in this confined part was twentyone feet it was examined seventy leagues from the entrance as far as lat     0 long   0 and its boundaries were found to be flat swampy and poorly wooded till they reached the foot of the great mountains toward the north it divides into two great branches or perhaps distinct rivers that to the east is distinguished by the name of turnagain river the first is a league wide and navigable as far as was tried for the largest ships and continued very brackish there is therefore the greatest probability of its having a very long course and being in after times of considerable use in inland navigation that it is of some even at present is very certain for here as well as in prince williams sound the indians were possessed of glass beads and great knives of english manufacture which the hudsons bay company annually send in great quantities and exchange for furs with the natives who travel to our settlements very far from the west the company also send copper and brass vessels but neither copper or iron in bars there does not seem to be any direct dealings with the indians of this coast the traffic is carried on by intermediate tribes who never think of bringing furs to a people so amply supplied as the indians are who deal with our factories nations who use the most precious furs merely as a defense from the cold make no distinction of kinds if they could get more beads or more knives for the skins of sea otters than any other they would instantly become articles of commerce and find their way across the continent to the european settlements  from turnagain river to the nearest part of hudsons bay is fiftyfive degrees or about sixteen hundred miles but from the most western part of arapathescow lake which is intermediate is only twentysix degrees or about seven hundred and fifty miles there is no discharge out of that vast water but what runs into hudsons bay we have some obscure accounts of rivers particularly from one joseph de la france who in      made a very long journey to the west and was a very observant man see dobbs hudsons bay          which take a western course from the countries east of this coast some of which may be those which have been seen by our navigators and which by means of lakes or other rivers falling into them may prove a channel of intercourse between these indians and the hudsons bay company as soon as our friendly indians become acquainted with the value of these maritime furs  the inhabitants of cooks river differed very little from those of prince williams found they had dogs which were the first seen on the coasts sea otters dogs martins and white hares and they were plentifully supplied with salmon and holibut  after leaving the entrance into the river appears cape st hermogenes cape st hermogenes discovered first by bering it proved a naked lofty island about six leagues in circuit and divided from the coast by a channel a league broad this lies in lat       off the vast peninsula alaschka alaschka continent of america which begins between the estuary of cooks river and bristol bay which bound its isthmus it points southwest and continues the crescent formed by the islands which cross the sea from kamtschatka alaschka is the only name given by the natives to the continent of america the land to the west of cooks river rises into mountains with conoid tops thickly set together the coast is frequently bold and the rocks break into pinnacles of picturesque forms the whole is fronted by groups of isles and clusters of small rocks in a word the country and shores are the most rugged and disjointed imaginable and bear evident marks of having undergone some extraordinary change  among the isles those of schoumagin are the most important which received their name from having been the place of interment of one of berings crew the first which he lost in these seas the principal lies the farthest to the west and is called kadjak it is about a hundred versts long kadjak and from twenty to thirty broad and from the account of demetrius bragin who visited it from oonalashka in      is very populous the inhabitants spoke a language different from those of that island it seemed a dialect of the greenlanders they called their wooden shields kuyaky probably because they resemble a kaiak or a little canoe a greenland word for that species of boat and themselves kanagist as the others style themselves karalit they have likewise the womans boat like the people of prince williams sound in fact they seem to be the same people but more refined they were armed with pikes bows and arrows and wooden shields their shirts were made of the skins of birds also of the earless marmot arct zool i no    foxes and sea bears and some of fishes skins dogs bears common otters and ermines were observed here their dwellings were made with timber and were from fifteen to twenty fathoms long covered with a thatch and dried grass within they were divided into compartments for every family and every compartment lined neatly with mats the entrance was on the top covered with frames on which were stretched the membranes of dried intestines instead of glass from a ms communicated to me by

was made to kadjak by stephen glottoff  see coxes disc  0   these people seemed to have made far greater progress in the arts than their neighbors they worked their carpets in a very curious manner on one side close set with beaver wool the sea otters skins which they brought for sale were in some parts shorn quite close with sharp stones so that they glistened and appeared like velvet they showed strong proofs of genius in their invention to preserve themselves from the effects of the russian firearms they had the spirit to make an attack and formed skreens with three parallel perpendicular rows of stakes bound with seaweeds and osiers their length was twelve feet and thickness three under the shelter of these they marched but their success was not correspondent to their plan coxes russ

the isles between asia and america all under the care of private adventurers the voyage from ochotsk or kamtschatka lasts three or four years and is solely undertaken for the sake of the skins of sea

with the hudsons bay company use them but from the figures given by de brie they do not seem ever to have reached the people of virginia and florida they inhabit jourts or subterraneous dwellings each

honorably sunk at the age of thirtyeight under a disorder contracted by a continued scene of hardships endured from his earliest youth in the services of his country see the particulars of his services voyage iii   0   to such characters as these we are indebted for the little we know and probably all that can be known of the icy sea of the icy sea the ancients had some obscure notion of its coasts and have given it the name of scythicum mare a cape jutting into it was styled scythicum promontorium and an island at the bottom of a deep bay to the west of it scythica insula it is following the conjectures of the ingenious to say that the first may be the cape jalmal and the last nova zemlja which some will make the insula tazata of pliny as it resembles in name the river tas which flows almost opposite to it into the gulf of ob strahlenberg hist russia      the knowledge which the ancients had of these parts must have been from traffic the old ladoga was in very early times a place of great commerce by assistance of rivers and seas even from the farthest parts of the mediterranean the coins of syria arabia greece and rome having been found in the burialplaces adjoining to that ancient city same   0  another channel of knowledge was formed from the great traffic carried on by the merchants from even the remote india up the volga and the kama and from thence to tscherdyn an emporium on the river kolva seated in the ancient permia or biormia and not far south of the river peczora from thence the biormas who seem to have been the factors embarked with the merchandise on that river went down with it to the coasts of the frozen sea and after obtaining furs in exchange they returned and delivered them at tscherdyn to the foreign merchants nicholss russian nations i      and from them the ancients might pick up accounts  the icy sea extends from nova zemlja to the coast of america we have seen how unable even the russians have been to survey its coasts except by interrupted detail notwithstanding it formed part of their own vast empire to our navigators was given the honor not only of settling parts of its geography with precision but of exploring the whole space between the most northern promontory of asia and the farthest accessible part of america this was a tract of one hundred leagues voyage iii      the traversing it was a work of infinite difficulty and danger depth the sea shallow and the change from the greatest depth which did not exceed thirty fathoms to the lest which was only eight was sudden the bottom muddy caused by the quantity of earth brought down from the vast rivers which pour into it from the asiatic side we suspect that it receives but few from the american their general tendency being east and west the icy sea is shallow not only because its tides and currents are very inconsiderable but its outlet through the streights of bering very narrow and even obstructed in the middle by the islands of st diomedes both which circumstances impede the carrying away of the mud the current small as it is comes chiefly from the southwest and is another impediment the land of each continent is very low near the shores and high at a small distance from them the former is one instance of a correspondent shallowness of water the soundings off each continent at the same distances from the shore were exactly the same  ice the ice of this sea differs greatly from that of spitzbergen it probably is entirely generated from the seawater the icy sea seems to be in no part bounded by lofty land in the valleys of which might have been formed the stupendous icebergs which tumbling down form those lofty islands we had before occasion to mention the ice here is moveable except about the great headlands which are beset with a rugged mountanous ice it is notorious that a strong gale from the north in twentyfour hours covers the whole coast for numbers of miles in breadth will fill the streights of bering and even the kamtschatkan seas and in smaller pieces extend to its islands in the icy sea it consists chiefly of field ice some fields very large and surrounded with lesser from forty to fifty yards in extent to four or five the thickness of the larger pieces was about thirty feet under water and the greatest height of others above about sixteen or eighteen it was transparent except on the surface which was a little porous and often very rugged the rest compact as a wall at times it must pack for the mountanous ice which the cossack morkoff ascended see p c must have been of that nature the destruction of the ice is not effected by the sun in a climate where fogs reign in far greater proportion than the solar beams neither will the streights of bering permit the escape of quantity sufficient to clear the sea of its vast load it must in a little time become wholly filled with it was it not for the rage of the winds which dashes the pieces together breaks and grinds them into minute parts which soon melt and resolve into their original element  the animals of this sea are very few and may be reduced to the polar bear animals no    the walrus no    and seals the first does not differ from those of other arctic countries it is beautifully engraven in tab lxxiii of the voyage amidst the extraordinary scenery in tab lii is given the only accurate figure of the walrus i have ever seen i cannot but suspect it to be a variety of the species found in the spitzbergen seas the tusks are more slender and have a slight distinguishing flexure the whole animal is also much less the length of one not indeed the largest was only nine feet four inches its greatest circumference seven feet ten weight exclusive of the entrails about eleven hundred pounds they lay on the ice by thousands and in the foggy weather cautioned our navigators by their roaring from running foul of it they are usually seen sleeping but never without some sentinels to give notice of approaching danger these awakened the next to them they their neighbors till the whole herd was roused these animals are the objects of chase with the tschutski who eat the flesh and cover their boats and hovels with the skins whales abound in this sea fish fish the food of seals and partly of the polar bears must be found here notwithstanding they escaped the notice of the navigators shells and seaplants the food of the walrus cannot be wanting  many species of birds which will occur in their place were seen traversing this sea geese and ducks were observed migrating southward in august birds whether from their breedingplace in a circumpolar land or whether from the probably farextending land of america is not to be determined driftwood was very seldom seen here two trees about three feet in girth with their roots were once observed but without bark or branches a proof that they had been brought from afar and left naked by their contest with the ice and elements  the sea from the south of berings streights to the crescent of isles between asia and america is very shallow it deepens from these streights as the british seas do from those of dover till soundings are lost in the pacific ocean but that does not take place but to the south of the isles between them and the streights is an increase from twelve to fiftyfour fathom except only off st thaddeus noss where there is a channel of greater depth from the vulcanic disposition i am led to believe not only that there was a separation of the continents at the streights of bering but that the whole space from the isles to that small opening had once been occupied by land and that the fury of the watery element actuated by that of fire had in most remote times subverted and overwhelmed the tract and left the islands monumental fragments  whether that great event took place before or after the population of america is as impossible as it is of little moment for us to know we are indebted to our navigators for settling the long dispute about the point from which it was effected they by their discoveries prove that in one place the distance between continent and continent is only thirtynine miles not as a celebrated cavilist the author of recherches philosophiques sur les americains i     would have it eight hundred leagues this narrow straight has also in the middle two islands which would greatly facilitate the migration of the asiatics into the new world supposing that it took place in canoes after the convulsion which rent the two continents asunder besides it may be added that these streights are even in the summer often filled with ice in winter often frozen in either case mankind might find an easy passage in the last the way was extremely ready for quadrupeds to cross and stock the continent of america i may fairly call in the machinery of vulcanoes to tear away the other means of transit farther to the south and bring in to my assistance the former supposition of solid land between kamtschatka and oonalascha instead of the crescent of islands and which prior to the great catastrophe would have greatly enlarged the means of migration but the case is not of that difficulty to require the solution one means of passage is indisputably established  but where from the vast expanse of the northeastern world to fix on the first tribes who contributed to people the new continent now inhabited almost from end to end is a matter that baffles human reason the learned may make bold and ingenious conjectures but plain good sense cannot always accede to them as mankind increased in numbers they naturally protruded one another forward wars might be another cause of migrations i know no reason why the asiatic north might not be an officina virorum as well as the european the overteeming country to the east of the riphaean mountains must find it necessary to discharge its inhabitants the first great wave of people was forced forward by the next to at more tumid and more powerful than itself successive and new impulses continually arriving short rest was given to that which spread over a more eastern tract disturbed again and again it covered fresh regions at length reaching the farthest limits of the old world found a new one with ample space to occupy unmolested for ages till columbus cursed them by a discovery which brought again new sins and new deaths to both worlds  the inhabitants of the new do not consist of the offspring of a single nation different people at several periods arrived there and it is impossible to say that any one is now to be found on the original spot of its colonization it is impossible with the lights which we have so recently received to admit that america could receive its inhabitants at lest the bulk of them from any other place than eastern asia a few proofs may be added taken from customs or dresses common to the inhabitants of both worlds some have been long extinct in the old others remain in both in full force  the custom of scalping was a barbarism in use with the scythians customs common to america and the north of asia who carried about them at all times this savage mark of triumph they cut a circle round the neck and stripped off the skin as they would that of an ox herodotus lib iv  compare the account given by the historian with the tartarian iunculus in dr pallas s travels i tab x a  a little image found among the kalmues of a tartarian deity mounted on a horse and sitting on a human skin with scalps pendent from the breast fully illustrates the custom of the scythian progenitors as described by the greek historian this usage as the europeans know by horrid experience is continued to this day in america the ferocity of the scythians to their prisoners extended to the remotest part of asia the kamtschatkans even at the time of their discovery by the russians hist kamtschatka     put their prisoners to death by the most lingering and excruciating inventions a practice in fell force to this very day among the aboriginal americans a race of the scythians were styled anthropophagi mela lib ii c    from their feeding on human flesh the people of nootka sound still make a repast on their fellow creatures voyage ii  but what is more wonderful the savage allies of the british army have been known to throw the mangled limbs of the french prisoners into the horrible cauldron and devour them with the same relish as those of a quadruped coldens five indian nations i       the scythians were said for a certain time annually to transform themselves into wolves and again to resume the human shape herodotus lib iv  the newdiscovered americans about nootka sound at this time disguise themselves in dresses made of the skins of wolves and other wild beasts and wear even the heads fitted to their own voyage ii          a very curious head of a wolf fitted for this use is preserved in the leverian museum  these habits they use in the chase to circumvent the animals of the field but would not ignorance or superstition ascribe to a supernatural metamorphosis these temporary expedients to deceive the brute creation  in their marches the kamtschatkans never went abreast but followed one another in the same track hist kamtsch     the same custom is exactly observed by the americans  the tungusi the most numerous nation resident in sibiria prick their faces with small punctures with a needle in various shapes then rub into them charcoal so that the marks become indelible bells travels oct ed i   0  this custom is still observed in several parts of america the indians on the back of hudsons bay to this day perform the operation exactly in the same manner and puncture the skin into various figures as the natives of new zealand do at present and as the ancient britons did with the herb glastum or woad herodian in vita severi lib iii  and the virginians on the first discovery of that country by the english de bry virginia tab iii       the tungusi use canoes made of birchbark distended over ribs of wood and nicely sewed together ysbrandt ides in harriss coll ii      the canadian and many other american nations use no other sort of boats the paddles of the tungusi are broad at each end those of the people near cooks river and of oonalascha are of the same form  in burying of the dead many of the american nations place the corpse at full length after preparing it according to their customs others place it in a sitting posture and lay by it the most valuable clothing wampum and other matters the tartars did the same and both people agree in covering the whole with earth so as to form a tumulus barrow or carnedd compare colden i    lafitau i     and archaeologia ii     tab xiv   some of the american nations hang their dead in trees certain of the tungusi observe a similar custom  i can draw some analogy from dress convenience in that article must have been consulted on both continents and originally the materials must have been the same the skins of birds and beasts it is singular that the conic bonnet of the chinese should be found among the people of nootka i cannot give into the notion that the chinese contributed to the population of the new world but i can readily admit that a shipwreck might furnish those americans with a pattern for that part of the dress  similar features in respect to the features and form of the human body almost every tribe found along the western coast has some similitude to the tartar nations and still retain the little eyes small noses high cheeks and broad faces they vary in size from the lusty calmucs to the little nogaians the internal americans such as the five indian nations who are tall of body robust in make and of oblong faces are derived from a variety among the tartars themselves the fine race of tschutski seem to be the stock from which those americans are derived the tschutski again from that fine race of tartars the kabardinski or inhabitants of kabarda  but about prince williams sound begins a race eskimaux chiefly distinguished by their dress their canoes and their instruments of the chase from the tribes to the south of them here commences the eskimaux people or the race known by that name in the high latitudes of the eastern side of the continent they may be divided into two varieties at this place they are of the largest size as they advance northward they decrease in height till they dwindle into the dwarfish tribes which occupy some of the coasts of the icy sea see mr hearnes discoveries  and the maritime parts of hudsons bay of greenland and terra de labrador the famous japanese map given by kaempfer to sir hans sloane and now preserved in the british museum places some islands seemingly within the streights of bering on which is bestowed the title of ya zue or the kingdom of the dwarfs does not this in some manner authenticate the chart and give us reason to suppose that america was not unknown to the japanese and that they had as is mentioned by kaempfer and charlevoix hist japan i     charlevoix fastes chronologiques ann      made voyages of discovery and according to the last actually wintered on the continent that they might have met with the eskimaux is very probable whom in comparison of themselves they might justly distinguish by the name of dwarfs the reason of their low stature is very obvious these dwell in a most severe climate amidst penury of food the former in one much more favorable abundant in provisions circumstances that tend to prevent the degeneracy of the human frame at the island of oonalascha a dialect of the eskimaux is in use which was continued along the whole coast from thence northward i have before mentioned the similarity in the instruments between the americans of this side of the coast and the eskimaux which is continued even to greenland  i cannot think the accounts well supported welsh that america received any part of its first inhabitants from europe prior to the fifteenth century the welsh fondly imagine that our country contributed in    0 to people the new world by the adventure of madoc son of owen gwynedd who on the death of his father sailed there and colonized part of the country all that is advanced in proof is a quotation from one of our poets which proves no more than that he had distinguished himself by sea and land it is pretended that he made two voyages that sailing west he left ireland so far to the north that he came to a land unknown where he saw many strange things that he returned home and making a report of the fruitfulness of the newdiscovered country prevaled on numbers of the welsh of each sex to accompany him on a second voyage from which he never returned the favorers of this opinion assert that several welsh words such as gwrando to hearken or listen the isle of croeso or welcome cape breton from the name of our own island gwynndwr or the white water and pengwin or the bird with a white head are to be found in the american language powels hist wales          i can lay little stress on this argument because likeness of sound in a few words will not be deemed sufficient to establish the fact especially if the meaning has been evidently perverted for example the whole pinguin tribe have unfortunately not only black heads but are not inhabitants of the northern hemisphere the name was also bestowed on them by the dutch a pinguedine from their excessive fatness clus exot  0   but the inventor of this thinking to do honor to our country inconsiderately caught at a word of european origin and unheard of in the new world it may be added that the welsh were never a naval people that the age in which madoc lived was peculiarly ignorant in navigation and the most which they could have attempted must have been a mere coasting voyage  norwegians the norwegians put in for share of the glory on grounds rather better than the welsh by their settlements in iceland and in greenland they had arrived within so small a distance of the new world that there is at lest a possibility of its having been touched at by a people so versed in maritime affairs and so adventurous as the ancient nortmans were the proofs are much more numerous than those produced by the british historians for the discovery is mentioned in several of the icelandic manuscripts the period was about the year  00  when it was visited by one biorn and the discovery pursued to greater effect by leif the son of eric the discoverer of greenland it does not appear that they reached farther than labrador on which coast they met with eskimaux on whom they bestowed the name of skraelingue or dwarfish people from their small stature they were armed with bows and arrows and had leathern canoes such as they have at present all this is probable nor should the tale of the german called turkil one of the crew invalidate the account he was one day missing but soon returned leaping and singing with all the extravagant marks of joy a bon vivant could show on discovering the inebriating fruit of his country the grape mallets northern antiq engl ed i      torfaeus even says that he returned in a state of intoxication hist vinlandiae antiq per thorm torfaeum p    to convince his commander he brought several bunches who from that circumstance named the country vinland i do not deny that north america produces the true vine glovers account of virginia phil trans abr iii   0  but it is found in far lower latitudes than our adventurers could reach in the time employed in their voyage which was comprehended in a very small space i have no doubt of the discovery but as the land was never colonized nor any advantages made of it it may be fairly conjectured that they reached no farther than the barren country of labrador  the continent which stocked america with the human race poured in the brute creation through the same passage very few quadrupeds continued in the peninsula of kamtschatka i can enumerate only twentyfive which are inhabitants of land for i must omit the marine animals which had at all times power of changing their situation all the rest persisted in their migration and fixed their residence in the new world seventeen of the kamtschatkan quadrupeds are found in america others are common only to sibiria or tartary having for unknown causes entirely evacuated kamtschatka and divided themselves between america and the parts of asia above cited multitudes again have deserted the old world even to an individual and fixed their seats at distances most remote from the spot from which they took their departure from mount ararat the resting place of the ark in a central part of the old world and excellently adapted for the dispersion of the animal creation to all its parts we need not be startled at the vast journies many of the quadrupeds took to arrive at their present seats might not numbers of species have found a convenient abode in the vast alps of asia instead of wandering to the cordilleras of chili or might not others have been contented with the boundless plains of tartary instead of traveling thousands of miles to the extensive flats of pampas  to endeavor to elucidate common difficulties is certainly a trouble worthy of the philosopher and of the divine not to attempt it would be a criminal indolence a neglect to vindicate the ways of god to man but there are multitudes of points beyond the human ability to explain and yet are truths undeniable the facts are indisputable notwithstanding the causes are concealed in such cases faith must be called in to our relief it would certainly be the height of folly to deny to that being who broke open the great fountains of the deep to effect the deluge  and afterward to compel the dispersion of mankind to people the globe directed the confusion of languages  powers inferior in their nature to these after these wondrous proofs of omnipotency it will be absurd to deny the possibility of infusing instinct into the brute creation deus est anima brutorum god himself is the soul of brutes his pleasure must have determined their will and directed several species and even whole genera by impulse irresistible to move by slow progression to their destined regions but for that the llama and the pacos might still have inhabited the heights of armenia and some more neighboring alps instead of laboring to gain the distant peruvian andes the whole genus of armadillos slow of foot would never have absolutely quitted the torrid zone of the old world for that of the new and the whole tribe of monkies would have gambolled together in the forests of india instead of dividing their residence between the shades of indostan and the deep forests of the brasils lions and tigers might have infested the hot parts of the new world as the first do the deserts of africa and the last the provinces of asia or the pantherine animals of south america might have remained additional scourges with the savage beasts of those ancient continents the old world would have been overstocked with animals the new remained an unanimated waste or both have contained an equal portion of every beast of the earth let it not be objected that animals bred in a southern climate after the descent of their parents from the ark would be unable to bear the frost and snow of the rigorous north before they reached south america the place of their final destination it must be considered that the migration must have been the work of ages that in the course of their progress each generation grew hardened to the climate it had reached and that after their arrival in america they would again be gradually accustomed to warmer and warmer climates in their removal from north to south as they had in the reverse or from south to north part of the tigers still inhabit the eternal snows of ararat and multitudes of the very same species live but with exalted rage beneath the line in the burning soil of borneo or sumatra but neither lions or tigers ever migrated into the new world a few of the first are found in india and persia but they are found in numbers only in africa the tiger extends as far north as western tartary in lat  0  0 but never has reached africa i shall close this account with observing that it could be from no other part of the globe except asia from whence the new world could receive the animal creation  the late voyage of the illustrious cook has reduced the probable conjectures of philosophers into certainty he has proved that the limits of the old and new world approach within thirteen leagues of each other we know that the intervening streights are frequently frozen up and we have great reason to suppose that the two continents might have been once united even as low as the aleutian islands or lat     0 thus are discovered two means of passage from asia to america the last in a climate not more rigorous than that which several animals might very well endure and yet afterward proceed gradually to the extreme of heat  in fact every other system of the population of the new world is now overthrown the conjectures of the learned respecting the vicinity of the old and new are now by the discoveries of our great navigator lost in conviction the strained systems of divines laudably indeed exerted in elucidating sacred writ appear to have been illfounded but in the place of imaginary hypotheses the real place of migration is uncontrovertibly pointed out some from a passage in plato have extended over the atlantic from the streights of gibraltar to the coast of north and south america an island equal in size to the continents of asia and africa over which had passed as over a bridge from the latter men and animals woolheaded negroes and lions and tigers catcott on the deluge edit  d p        etc  none of which ever existed in the new world a mighty sea arose and in one day and night engulphed this stupendous tract and with it every being which had not completed its migration into america the whole negro race and almost every quadruped now inhabitants of africa perished in this critical day five only are to be found at present in america and of these only one the bear on the reasoning of mr zimmerman  zool geogr     and the opinion of mr erxleben  syst regn an  0  i give up my notion of the panther  hist quad no     being a native of south america it is most probable that the skin which i saw at a surriers shop which was said to have been brought from the brasils had originally been carried there from the western coast of africa where the portuguese have considerable settlements and a great slave trade for their american colonies and where those animals abound  in south america not a single custom common to the natives of africa and america to evince a common origin of the quadrupeds the bear stag wolf fox and weesel are the only animals which we can pronounce with certainty to be found on each continent the stag shaws travels     quere whether exactly the same with the european  fox and weesel have made also no farther progress in africa than the north but on the same continent the wolf is spread over every part yet is unknown in south america as are the fox and weesel i suspect besides that the stag has not advanced farther south than mexico in africa and south america the bear is very local being met with only in the north of the first and on the andes in the last some cause unknown arrested its progress in africa and impelled the migration of a few into the chilian alps and induced them to leave unoccupied the vast tract from north america to the lofty cordilleras  my promised table of quadrupeds will at once give a view of those which inhabit north america and are either peculiar to it or are met with in other countries it certainly will point out the course they have taken in their migration and in case misnomers are avoided will reduce to the single continent of asia the original country from whence they sprung men of the first abilities and first in learning who have neglected the study of natural history will give lions and tigers to america misled by

the icy sea not very remote from the place where captain cook was obliged to desist from his northern voyage mr samuel hearne in the service of the hudsons bay company by direction of the governors began a journey on december  th    0 toward the northern limits of america he went attended only by indians with whom he had been long acquainted he set out from prince of wales fort     0 north lat he for a long space took a northwestern course crossed menischtic lake in lat    a water thirtyfive miles in breadth full of fine islands and joining with the river namassy he passed over wiethen and cassed lakes and from the last kept due west in april he reached thleweyaza yeth a small lake in long    west from churchil fort lat     0 near which he made some stay to build canoes now requisite against the breaking up of the frost from that lake he began a course due north and crossed a chain of lakes of which titumeg is one in lat    he went over peshew lake after that the great lake cogeed out of which issues a river pointing northeast which is supposed to fall into bffins bay about the middle of june he crossed the great river congecathawhachaga in lat       and from churchil river west long      about those parts are the stoney mountains extending in longitude from     to     from london craggy and of a tremendous aspect on july  th he arrived at buffalo lake in lat     0 here he first saw the musk buffalo no   near the north end is grizzle bearhill in about lat  0 so called from its being the haunt of numbers of those animals on july   th he reached the banks of copper river copper river which runs due north into the icy sea about the south end is much wood and very high hills its current is very rapid and its channel choked with shoals and crossed with stoney ridges which form three great cataracts its banks are high the breadth about a hundred and eighty yards but in some places it expands into the form of a lake in an island of the river unfortunately happened to be a summer encampment of five tents of eskimaux eskimaux the indians attendant on mr hearne grew furious at the sight of them it is their firm opinion that these savages are magicians and that all the evils they experience result from their incantations mr hearne in vain solicited his indians to forbear injuring these poor people they with their usual cowardice deferred the attack till night when they surprised and murdered every one to the number of between twenty and thirty a young woman made her escape and embraced mr hearnes feet but she was pursued by a barbarian and transfixed to the ground he observed in their tents which were made of deerskins with the hair on copper vessels and whalebone and the skins of seals wooden troughs and kettles made of a soft stone by his description a lapis ollaris and dishes and spoons formed from the thick horns of the buffalo their arms are spears darts and bows and arrows the last pointed with stone or copper but most rudely made for want of proper tools in their dress they much resemble the eskimaux of hudsons bay but the tails of their jackets are shorter neither do the women like them stiffen out the tops of their boots their canoes differ in not having long projecting prows but in other respects are of the same construction in most circumstances these people resemble those of the bay and differ materially only in one for the men in these pull out by the roots all the hair of their heads  mr hearne first saw the sea on july    at the distance of eight miles he went to the mouth of the river in lat    west long from london     which he found full of shoals and falls and inaccessible to the tide which seemed to flow twelve or fourteen feet the sea was at this time full of ice and on many pieces he saw seals the land trended both to the east and to the west and the sea was full of islands the land about copper river for the space of nine or ten miles to the sea consisted of fine marshes filled in many places with tall willow but no sort of berrybearing shrubs there are no woods within thirty miles of the mouth of copper river and those which then appear consist of illshaped and stunted pines  the people who live nearest to this river are the coppermine indians and the platcotes de chiens or dogribbed indians these have no direct commerce with hudsons bay but sell their furs to the more southern indians who come for them and bring them down to the settlements the dogribbed indian still make their knives of stones and bones and head their arrows with slate the copper indians have abundance of native copper in their country they make with it icechissels and arrowheads the mine is not known but i find that an indian chief who had many years ago communication with a mr frost one of the companys servants says that the copper was struck off a rock with sharp stones and that it lay in certain islands far to the northward where was no night during summer dobbss account of hudsons bay etc      mr hearne set out on his return the   d of july he took in some places a route different from what he did in going and got to the settlements in june      i have perused the journal and had frequent conversation with mr hearne the last year i took the liberty to question him about the waters he had crossed during winter upon the ice and whether they might not have been at that time obstructed streights a passage to the pacific ocean he assured me that he could make no mistake that he passed over many of them in canoes during the summer and that the others had large rivers running out of them almost every one to the west that the indians who crossed them annually in their way to the north to trade for furs were exceedingly well acquainted with them and knew them to be fresh water lakes and in particular used to fish in them for pikes fish notoriously known never to frequent salt water  i must now take a blind unguided course along the icy sea greenland the charts give the land a turn to the south in lat    long    from london this is the most northern extremity of the country called greenland if it reaches so far but beyond the discovery by mr hearne in lat

whalefishers but those animals have now left the neighboring sea the north end rises into a prodigious mountain called beerenberg or the bears from its being the haunt of numbers but it is so steep as

mountains of a stupendous height called blaaserk and huitserk cased in perpetual ice the whole country to the southern end consists of similar mountains a few exhibit a stoney surface but the greater part are genuine glacieres peopled by norwegians shooting into lofty peaks or rugged summits yet such a country as this became the settlement of numbers of norwegians during several centuries the

fathom water at the entrance but within could not touch ground with three hundred and thirty he had hopes of having found the longsoughtfor passage the tides rose six or seven fathoms but as is frequent among islands the flood came from such variety of places that he could not trace its principal origin hackluyt iii  0    baffins bay at lat     0 i must take as my pilot that great seaman william baffin who gave name to the great bay i now enter on his first voyage was in      his second in which he made the most effectual trial for the northwest passage was in      he passed through daviss streights in lat  0  0 on the london coast he found the tides rise only eight or nine feet in horn sound lat       he met with several people same      to the north of that in     0 was a large and open bay cape dudley digges forms its northern point within is westenholme sound beyond that whale sound and in the extreme north or bottom of this great bay is that named by baffin after sir thomas smith lying in    degrees in those three sounds were abundance of whales but in the last the largest in all this bay it is highly probable that there are one or more communications from hence to the icy sea through which the whales pass at certain seasons and this if i may collect from their numbers might be that of their migration southward the distance into the icy sea can be but very small but probably blocked up with ice or if not from the sudden shifting of the ice in that sea by the change of wind the passage must be attended with too great hazard to be attempted the ice prevented our great seaman from making trial of the tides in this bay which would have brought the matter to greater certainty he saw multitudes of walruses and seals in these parts but no signs of inhabitants from hence the land trended westerly to a sound he called by the name of alderman jones in lat     0 here the land ran due south to a great sound in lat     0 which he called sir james

seaman to make discoveries in these parts but notwithstanding any surmises of his having reached this famous bay he got no farther than hudsons bay to which in honor of his master he gave the name of christian sea he passed a miserable winter in churchill river and returned home the next year after losing during his stay on shore every man but two clerk of the californias voy i  0   for a further account of this unfortunate voyage see churchills collection ii       before i quit these frozen regions i must once more return to spitzbergen to relate what has but very lately been communicated to me that the russians have of late attempted to colonize these dreadful islands they have for a few years past sent parties to continue there the whole year who have established settlements on the isle of spitzbergen at croon bay kings bay magdalena bay smeerenburgh and green harbor where they have built huts each of which is occupied by about two boats crews or twentysix men they bring with them salted fish ryeflour and the serum or whey of sour milk the whey is their chief beverage and is also used in baking their bread each hut has an oven which serves also as a stove and their fuel is wood which they bring with them from archangel the huts are above ground and most surprizingly warm placed also in situations which may guard them as much as possible from the keenness of the northern wind  mr erskine tonnach surgeon of dunbar who by the friendship of the worthy mr george paton of edinburgh favored me with this account gives me the following particulars from his own knowledge  during our slay on the island my curiosity prompted me to go on shore that i might see the economy of these arctic settlers and had an opportunity of seeing them dine and though their fare appeared coarse the dispatch they use said a great deal for their health and appetite they boil their fish with water and ryemeal and this constitutes their diet during winter in the summer they live chiefly on fowls or their eggs but in general they forbear flesh as the fasts prescribed by their religion are so numerous they are dressed in the skins of the animals they kill which they use with the fur side next to their bodies their bedding is likewise composed of skins chiefly of those of the bear or rein deer the skin of the fox is the most valuable but these are preserved as articles of commerce in their own country they catch the beluga or white whale in nets being conversant in this species of fishery but are ignorant of that of the great whale they were very solicitous to get information on that subject which i endeavored to instruct them in in return for the information they so readily gave me they are most excellent marksmen but what is peculiar in presenting their piece they do not raise it to their shoulder but place the buttend between their arm and their side fixing their eye on the object toward which they direct the barrel i saw a bear receive a considerable shot it astonished me greatly to see the animal apply great quantities of snow to the part which was bleeding freely as if conscious of its styptic powers it retreated with much slowness but at short intervals looked behind and with much art threw abundance of snow with its hindpaws into the wound few of the russians die from the severity of the cold but are often frostbitten so as to lose their toes or fingers for they are so hardy as to hunt in all weathers i naturally asked them had they a surgeon they replied no no christ is our doctor they quit the island in september and are privileged to leave the place by the   d of that month whether they are relieved by a fresh party from russia or not  let me remark that the great exercise used by these volunteer adventurers their quantity of vegetable food their freshening their salt provision by boiling it in water and mixing it with flour their beverage of whey and their total abstinence from spirituous liquors  are the happy preservatives from the scurvy which brought all the preceding adventurers who perished to their miserable end see this subject amply treated by doctor aikin in a treatise on the success with respect to the health of some attempts to pass the winter in high northern latitudes   hudsons bay we now proceed through a nameless straight between the main land and the two great islands on the east and after doubling cape southampton enter into hudsons bay in the gulf called the welcome this bay was discovered in    0 by that able seaman henry hudson from whom it takes its name his view in the voyage he made was the discovery of a passage to the east indies the trial has been vigorously pursued since his days but without success in      an attempt was made as low as the bottom of the welcome by captain middleton and from the check he met with he called that part repulse bay in subsequent trials wagers water was suspected to be the passage into the western ocean but in      its end was discovered and found to terminate in two navigable rivers the romantic scenery which the adventurers met with in the way is most admirably described by the elegant pen of mr henry ellis  chesterfield or bowdens inlet chesterfield inlet was likewise suspected to have been the desired straight but in      messrs norton and christopher in a sloop and cutter belonging to the company went to the remotest end at the distance of a hundred and twentyeight miles from the mouth was scarcely any tide thirty miles further it quite died away the land here grew contracted into a very narrow passage here the adventurers entered with the cutter and discovered that the end was in a magnificent fresh water lake to which was given the name of bakers the land was quite level rich in grass and abounding with deer they found the end quite innavigable and to terminate in a small stream with many shoals at its mouth and three falls across it after finding the water decrease to the depth of two feet they returned fully

frequent there the company have attempted to establish a fishery and for that purpose procured experienced people from the spitzbergen ships and made considerable trials between lat    and    but after expending twenty thousand pounds and taking only three fish were in      obliged to desist the ice prevented the vessels from getting to a proper station in due time and the hard gales and quick return of winter always deprived them of an opportunity of making a fair trial the fishery of the beluga or white whale is attended with more success it haunts the mouths of rivers in june as soon as they have discharged the ice and are taken in great numbers there are two varieties one with a blue cast the other of a pure white these animals probably superfete a foetus of six inches in length

      the isle of newfoundland is of a triangular form and lies between lat     0 and     0 visited occasionally but not inhabited by savages from the continent  the boasted mine of this island lies on the southern and western sides on the great bank which stretches from northeast to southwest about two hundred leagues the water on the bank is from twentytwo to fifty fathoms on the outside from sixty to eighty on the lesser banks much the same a great swell and thick fog generally mark the place of the greater the subject of the fishery has been often treated of but the following short though clear account of so interesting a subject cannot fail being acceptable to the british reader  newfoundland fishery the boats or shallops are forty feet in the keel rigged with a mainmast and foremast and lugsails furnished with four oars three of which row on one side and the other which is twice as large belays the other three by being rowed sideways over the stern by a man who stands up for that purpose with his face toward the rowers counteracting them and steering at the same time as he gives way to the boat  each of the men in this boat is furnished with two lines one at each side of the boat each furnished with two hooks so here are sixteen hooks constantly employed which are thought to make a tolerable good days work of it if they bring in from five to ten quintals of fish though they have stowage for and sometimes bring in thirty two hundred quintals is called a saving voyage but not under the bait is small fish of all kinds herring capelin lance tom cod or young cod the first of which they salt and keep for some time in case of scarcity of the rest but these are not near so eagerly taken by the fish when salted in case small fish cannot be got they use seafowl which are easily taken in vast numbers by laying nets over the holes in the rocks where they come to roost in the night if neither small fish nor birds are to be got they are forced to use the maws of fish they catch which is the worst bait of any  when the fish are taken they are carried to the stage which is built with one end over the water for the convenience of throwing the offals into the sea and for their boats being able to come close to discharge their fish as soon as they come on the stage a boy hands them to the header who stands at the side of a table next the water end whose business it is to gut the fish and cut off the head which he does by pressing the back of the head against the side of the table which is made sharp for that purpose when both head and guts fall through a hole in the floor into the water he then shoves the fish to the splitter who stands opposite to him his business is to split the fish beginning at the head and opening it down to the tail at the next cut he takes out the larger part of the backbone which falls through the floor into the water he then shoves the fish off the table which drops into a kind of handbarrow which as soon as filled is carried off to the saltpile the header also flings the liver into a separate basket for the making of trainoil used by the curriers which bears a higher price than whaleoil  in the salt pile the fish are spread upon one another with a layer of salt between thus they remain till they have taken salt and then are carried and the salt is washed from them by throwing them off from shore in a kind of float called a pound as soon as this is completed they are carried to the last operation of drying them which is done on standing flakes made by a slight wattle just strong enough to support the men who lay on the fish supported by poles in some places as high as twenty feet from the ground here they are exposed with the open side to the sun and every night when it is bad weather piled up five or six on a heap with a large one his back or skinny part uppermost to be a shelter to the rest from rain which hardly damages him through his skin as he rests slanting each way to shoot it off when they are tolerably dry which in good weather is in a weeks time they are put in round piles of eight or ten quintals each covering them on the top with bark in these piles they remain three or four days to sweat after which they are again spread and when dry put into larger heaps covered with canvas and left till they are put on board  thus prepared they are sent to the mediterranean where they fetch a good price but are not esteemed in england for which place another kind of fish is prepared called by them mud fish which instead of being split quite open like their dry fish are only opened down to the navel they are salted and lie in salt which is washed out of them in the same manner with the others but instead of being laid out to dry are barrelled up in a pickle of salt boiled in water  the trainoil is made from the livers it is called so to distinguish it from whale or seal oil which they call fat oil and is sold at a lower price being only used for lighting of lamps than the trainoil which is used by the curriers it is thus made  they take a half tub and boring a hole through the bottom press hard down into it a layer of spruce boughs upon which they place the livers and expose the whole apparatus to as sunny a place as possible as the livers corrupt the oil runs from them and straining itself clear through the spruce boughs is caught in a vessel set under the hole in the tubs bottom  cape breton the barren island of cape breton forms one side of the great entrance into the gulf of st laurence it is high rocky and dreary rich in thick beds of coal and may prove the newcastle of america this isle was first discovered by sir humphry gilbert in his fatal voyage it was soon after frequented on account of the walruses and the fishery of whales among the earliest adventurers were the industrious biscayeners who seem to have been our masters in the art till of late years it had been important by being the seat of the french fishery but the strong fortress of louisbourg is now demolished and the place deserted  nova scotia the great peninsula of nova scotia is separated from cape breton by a narrow straight it was in      possessed by the french who attempted to colonize it from their new settlement in canada but they were soon expelled by the english who deemed it part of north virginia the whole continent at that time going under the name of virginia so called originally in honor of our virgin queen the french had given it the name of acadie james i made a grant of the country to sir william alexander in      on condition that he would form there a settlement it then received the title of nova scotia in order to encourage sir william he planned the order of baronets which is called after the country to every knight who would engage to colonize any part a grant was to be made of certain portions of land the order was not instituted till      when a number were created and they held their lands from the crown of scotland as a free barony with great privileges to all who would settle in the country collinss baronets iv   0  the design almost instantly failed and the french were permitted to repossess themselves of the province its value became known and since that period it has frequently changed masters it never was effectually settled till the year      when a large colony was sent there under the auspices of the earl of halifax  climate the climate of this province is during the long winter extremely severe and the country covered with snow many months the summer misty and damp the face of it is in general hilly but can scarcely be called mountanous being the lowered continuation of the great chain which pervades the whole continent the ground is not favorable to agriculture but may prove excellent for pasturage due attention to the breeding of cattle will not only repay the industry of the farmer by the home consumption but be an extensive benefit to our islands the country cannot boast amidst its vast forests timber fit for large masts nor yet for the building of large ships yet it will prove an inexhaustible magazine for that species of timber called lumber so essential to our sugar plantations  its situation in respect to the fisheries its fisheries is scarcely inferior to that of newfoundland the vast banks called sable islands browns and st georges with many others are frequented by myriads of codfish it is the duty of the parent state to encourage with all diligence this branch of commerce and in a manner so expeditious and so frugal as may anticipate and undersell foreign adventurers without that our remnants of the new world will be but of little use the fisheries the staples of nova scotia and newfoundland are open to other nations and if they are permitted to excel us in the articles expedition and frugality our labors are truly vain it is to the ancient hardy colonists we must look up for the support of the toils of the sea and the advantages we may expect to gain from them they should have their encouragement but there is another set of men who of late a public calamity have made hither an involuntary migration who with sad hearts recollect their exiled land nos patriae fines nos dulcia linquimus arva nos patriam fugimus these sufferers are in general unused to the fatigues of a maritime life and ought to be fostered for their filial piety at first with a parental care to be encouraged in the pastoral life or in such arts as may supply the sailor and the fisherman with food and with materials for their professions if the climate is fit for corn for flax and hemp let due rewards be given for the successful efforts of their industry the succeeding generation hardened to the climate and early habituated to another kind of life may join the maritime adventurers and give importance to themselves and strength to the island from which they sprung  the harbors of this province are frequent and excellent harbors the tides are in many places most uncommonly high those of the bay of fundy are the most remarkable for they force themselves into the great creeks with a bore or head from fifty to seventytwo feet high and with most amazing rapidity hogs which feed along the shores are much more sensible of its approach than mankind they are observed to listen to prick up their ears for some time and then suddenly to run off at full speed  magnificent views the coasts are in general rude and rocky with some variations but in many places exhibit most picturesque scenery all the northern side is high red and rocky the isles of

the entrance into it are the grand and petit passage the sides of the last are either covered with hanging woods sloping to the wateredge or broke into short precipices the entrance into the fine harbor of annapolis is most august a narrow gut bounded by enormous precipices with lofty hills soaring above the tops of which are even and clothed with woods the approach to the basin of minas is not less magnificent the columnar rocks of cape split are very singular the isle of haute is lofty and steep on every side the whole neighborhood abounds with views of the most sublime and romantic cast this peninsula joins the great continent by a very narrow isthmus beyond which we retain a wretched barren remnant of near half of the new world the sad reverse of the short space of twenty years  my eyes withdraw themselves from the mortifying sight britain which sat by the wisdom of one man as the queen of nations now deplores her folly and ought to confess that those things which were for her wealth proved to her an occasion of falling she sunk under the delusion of prosperity by false security and the pride of victories if she makes a proper use of adversity she still may rise into

ancient haunts and in asia asia among the vast mountains of caucasus  it is difficult to say in what manner these animals migrated originally from the old to the new world it is most likely it was from the north of asia which in very ancient times might have been stocked with them to its most extreme parts notwithstanding they are now extinct at that period there is a probability that the old and the new continents might have been united in the narrow channel between tchutki noss and the opposite headlands of america and the many islands off of that promontory with the aleutian or new fox islands somewhat more distant stretching very near to america may with great reason be supposed to be fragments of land which joined the two continents and formed into their insular state by the mighty convulsion which divided asia from america spain was probably thus disjoined from africa britain from france iceland from greenland spitzbergen from lapland  but that they passed from asia to america is far the more probable than that they stocked the new world from the side of europe not only on account of the present narrowness of the straight between the two continents which gives a greater cause to suppose them to have been once joined but that we are now arrived at a certainty that these animals in ancient days were natives of sibiria the sculls with the horns affixed of a size far superior to any known at this time have been found fossil not only on the banks of the ilga which falls into the lena but even in those of the anadyr the most eastern of the sibirian rivers and

upper louisiana du pratz ii  0 i          there they are seen feeding in herds innumerable promiscuously with multitudes of stags and deer during morning and evening retiring in the sultry heats into the shade of tall reeds which border the rivers of america  timid they are exceedingly shy and very fearful of man unless they are wounded when they pursue their enemy and become very dangerous  chase the chase of these animals is a favorite diversion of the indians it is effected in two ways first by shooting when the marksman must take great care to go against the wind for their smell is so exquisite that the moment they get scent of him they instantly retire with the utmost precipitation du pratz i    ii      he aims at their shoulders that they may drop at once and not be irritated by an ineffectual wound provided the wind does not favor the beasts they may be approached very near another method being blinded by the hair which covers their eyes the other method is performed by a great number of men who divide and form a vast square each band sets fire to the dry grass of the savanna where the herds are feeding these animals have a great dread of fire which they see approach on all sides they retire from it to the center of the square charlevoix n france v      the bands close and kill them pressed together in heaps without the lest hazard it is pretended that on every expedition of this nature they kill fifteen hundred or two thousand beeves  the huntinggrounds are prescribed with great form least the different bands should meet and interfere in the diversion penalties are enacted on such who infringe the regulations as well as on those who quit their posts and suffer the beasts to escape from the hollow squares the punishments are the stripping the delinquents the taking away their arms which is the greatest disgrace a savage can undergo or lastly the demolition of their cabins charlevoix v       the uses of these animals are various uses powderflasks are made of their horns the skins are very valuable in old times the indians made of them the best targets purchase iv    0  when dressed skin they form an excellent buff the indians dress them with the hair on and cloth themselves with them the europeans of louisiana use them for blankets and find them light warm and soft the flesh is a considerable article of food and the bunch on the back is esteemed a very great delicacy the bulls become excessively fat and yield great quantity of tallow tallow a hundred and fifty pounds weight has been got from a single beast du pratz  which forms a considerable matter of commerce these overfed animals usually become the prey of wolves for by reason of their great unwieldiness they cannot keep up with the herd  the indians by a very bad policy prefer the flesh of the cows which in time will destroy the species they complain of the rankness of that of the bulls but du pratz thinks the last much more tender and that the rankness might be prevented by cutting off the testicles as soon as the beast is killed  the hair or wool is spun into cloth gloves stockings hair and garters which are very strong and look as well as those made of the best sheeps wool governor pownall assures us that the most luxurious fabric might be made of it topeg descr n am    the fleece of one of these animals has been found to weigh eight pounds  their sagacity in defending themselves against the attacks of wolves is admirable defense against wolves when they scent the approach of a drove of those ravenous creatures the herd flings itself into the form of a circle the weakest keep in the middle the strongest are ranged on the outside presenting to the enemy an impenetrable front of horns should they be taken by surprise and have recourse to flight numbers of the fattest or the weakest are sure to perish du pratz i       hard to be tamed attempts have been made to tame and domesticate the wild by catching the calves and bringing them up with the common kind in hopes of improving the breed it has not yet been found to answer notwithstanding they had the appearance for a time of having lost their savage nature yet they always grew impatient of restraint and by reason of their great strength would break down the strongest enclosure and entice the tame cattle into the cornfieldsd they have been known to engender together and to breed but i cannot learn whether the species was meliorated kalm i  0  by the intercourse probably perseverance in continuing the crosses is only wanted to effect their thorough domestication as it is notorious that the bisons of the old world were the original stock of all our tame cattle  these were the only animals which had any affinity to the european cattle on the first discovery of the new world before that period it was in possession of neither horse nor ass cow nor sheep hog goat nor yet that faithful animal the dog mankind were here in a state of nature their own passions unsubdued they never thought of conquering those of the brute creation and rendering them subservient to their will the few animals which they had congenerous to those mentioned might possibly by industry have been reclamed this animal might have been brought to all the uses of the european cow the pecari might have been substituted for the hog the fox or wolf for the dog but the natives living wholly by chase were at war with the animal creation and neglected the cultivation of any part except the last which was imperfectly tamed  such is the case even to the present hour for neither the example of the europeans nor the visible advantages which result from an attention to that useful animal the cow can induce the indian to pay any respect to it he contemns every species of domestic labor except what is necessary for forming a provision of bread every wigwam or village has its plantation of mayz or indian corn and on that is his great dependence should the chase prove unsuccessful  domesticated cattle are capable of enduring very rigorous climates cows are kept at quickjock in lecha lapmark lapmark not far from the arctic circle but they do not breed there the succession being preserved by importation yet in iceland iceland a small portion of which is within the circle cattle abound and breed as in more southern latitudes they are generally fed with hay as in other places

what is wonderful yield a considerable quantity of milk it need not be said that the milk is bad  kamtschatka kamtschatka like america was in equal want of every domestic animal except a wolflike dog

hoofs very long and of a pure white hoofs short broad and black the false hoofs large in proportion tail only three inches long a mere stump covered with very long hairs so as to be undistinguishable

service in keeping off the musquetoes which would otherwise be intolerable elliss voy       space between the horns nine inches horns the horns are placed exactly on the sides of the head are whitish thirteen inches and a half long eight inches and a half round at the base of the same sort of curvature with those of the bull the ears are three inches long ears quite erect sharppointed but dilate

hairs in that space shorter than any of the rest not exceeding three inches in length and of a pale brown toward their roots  the hairs are of two kinds the longest measure seventeen inches hair are very fine and glossy and when examined appear quite flat this is the black part which clothes most part of the animal  the bed of hair between the horns and that which runs along the top of the neck is far finer and softer than any human hair and appears quite round the white bed is still finer and approaches to the nature of wool  beneath every part of the hair grows in great plenty wool and often in flocks an ashcolored wool most exquisitely fine superior i think to any i have seen and which might be very useful in manufactures if sufficient could be procured i give full credit to m

amidst the rude mountains fearless of the dreadful precipices or of the avelenches which often overwhelm the eager sportsmen  these animals are shot with guns or with arrows sometimes with crossbows which are placed in the paths and discharged by means of a string whenever the argali happens to tread on it they are often chased with dogs not that they are overtaken by them but when they are driven to the lofty summits they will often stand and look as if it were with contempt on the dogs below which gives the hunter an opportunity of creeping within reach while they are so engaged for they are the shyest of animals  the mongols and tungusi use a nobler species of chase in mongolia they collect together a vast multitude of horses and dogs attempting to surround them on a sudden for such is their swiftness and cunning that if they perceive either by sight or smell the approach of the chasseurs they instantly take to flight and secure themselves on the lofty and inaccessible

for the convenience of brousing the boughs of trees because they are prevented from grazing with any kind of ease by reason of the shortness of their necks and length of their legs they often have recourse to waterplants which they can readily get at by wading m sarrasin says that they are very fond of the anagyris foetida or stinking bean trefoil and will uncover the snow with their feet in

seeking the female by swimming from isle to isle young they bring two young at a birth in the month of april which follow the dam a whole year during the summer they keep in families in deep snows they collect in numbers in the forests of pines for protection from the inclemency of the weather under the shelter of those evergreens  they are very inoffensive except in the ruttingseason or except they are wounded when they will turn on the assailant and attack him with their horns or trample him to death beneath their great hoofs  their flesh is extremely sweet and nourishing the indians say flesh that they can travel three times as far after a meal of moose as after any other animal food the tongues are excellent but the nose is perfect marrow and esteemed the greatest delicacy in all canada  the skin makes excellent buff is strong soft and light skin the indians dress the hide and after soaking it for some time stretch and render it supple by a lather of the brains in hot water

the palmated parts of the horns are farther excavated by the savages and converted into ladles which will hold a pint horns   it is not strange that so useful an animal should be a principal object of chase the savages perform it in different ways the first chase and the more simple is before the lakes or rivers are frozen multitudes assemble in their canoes and form with them a vast crescent each horn touching the shore another party perform their share of the chase among the woods they surround an extensive tract let loose their dogs and press toward the water with loud cries the animals alarmed with the noise fly before the hunters and plunge into the lake where they are killed by the persons in the canoes prepared for their reception with lances or clubs charlevoix v       the other method is more artful the savages enclose a large space with stakes hedged with branches of trees forming two sides of a triangle the bottom opens into a second enclosure completely triangular at the opening are hung numbers of snares made of slips of raw hides the indians as before assemble in great troops and with all kinds of noises drive into the first enclosure not only the mooses but the other species of deer which abound in that country some in forcing their way into the farthest triangle are caught in the snares by the neck or horns and those which escape the snares and pass the little opening find their fate from the arrows of the hunters directed at them from all quarters charlevoix and la hontan i      they are often killed with the gun when they are first unharboured they squat with their hind parts and make water at which instant the sportsman fires if he misses the moose sets off in a most rapid trot making like the reindeer a prodigious rattling with its hoofs and will run for twenty or thirty miles before it comes to bay or takes the water but the usual time for this diversion is the winter the hunters avoid entering on the chase till the sun is strong enough to melt the frozen crust with which the snow is covered otherwise the animal can run over the firm surface they wait till it becomes soft enough to impede the flight of the moose which sinks up to the shoulders flounders and gets on with great difficulty the sportsman pursues at his ease on his broad rackets or snowshoes and makes a ready prey of the distressed animals as weak against the mountain

moose the opinion of this animals being subject to the epilepsy seems to have been universal as well as the cure it finds by scratching its ear with the hind hoof till it draws blood that hoof has been used in indian medicine for the falling sickness they apply it to the heart of the afflicted make him hold it in his left hand and rub his ear with it they use it also in the colic pleurisy vertigo and purple fever pulverising the hoof and drinking it in water the algonkins pretend that the flesh imparts the disease but it is notorious that the huers in a manner live on it with impunity  the savages esteem the moose a beast of good omen and are persuaded that those who dream often of it may flatter themselves with long life charlevoix v       their wild superstition has figured to them a moose of enormous size which can wade with ease through eight feet depth of snow which is invulnerable and has an arm growing out of its shoulder subservient to the purposes of the human that

to this american species as they do to the wolf itself they never meet with them but they show all possible signs of dislike and will fall on and worry them while the wolfish breed with every mark of timidity puts its tail between its legs and runs from the rage of the others this aversion to the wolf is natural to all genuine dogs for it is well known that a whelp which has never seen a wolf will at first sight tremble and run to its master for protection an old dog will instantly attack it  i shall conclude this article with an abstract of a letter from dr pallas dated october  th      in

conceal their retreat  the naturalists poet with great truth and beauty describes the retreat of this animal in the frozen climate of the north there through the piny forest half absorpt rough tenant of those shades the shapeless bear with dangling ice all horrid stalks forlorn slow paced and sourer as the storms increase he makes his bed beneath the inclement drift and with stern patience scorning weak complaint hardens his heart against assailing want those of the southern parts dwell in the hollows of ancient trees the hunter discovers them by striking with an ax the tree he suspects they are lodged in then suddenly conceals himself the bear is immediately rouzed looks out of the hollow to learn the cause of the alarm seeing none sinks again into repose du pratz ii     the hunter then forces him out by flinging in fired reeds and shoots him while he descends the body of the tree which notwithstanding his awkward appearance he does with great agility nor is he less nimble in ascending the tops of the highest trees in search of berries and fruits  the long time which these animals subsist without food is amazing they will continue in their retreat for six weeks without the lest provision remaining either asleep or totally inactive it is pretended that they live by sucking their paws but that is a vulgar error the fact is they retire immediately after autumn when they have fattened themselves to an excessive degree by the abundance of the fruits which they find at that season this enables animals which perspire very little in a state of rest to endure an abstinence of uncommon length but when this internal support is exhausted and they begin to feel the call of hunger on the approach of the severe season they quit their dens in search of food multitudes then migrate into the lower parts of louisiana they arrive very lean but soon fatten with the vegetables of that milder climate du pratz ii  0  they never wander far from the banks of the missisipi and in

ever killed a bear with young in one winter were killed in virginia five hundred bears and among them only two females and those not pregnant the cause is that the male has the same unnatural dislike to its offspring as some other animals have they will kill and devour the cubs the females therefore retire before the time of parturition into the depth of woods and rocks to elude the search of their savage mates it is said that they do not make their appearance with their young till march josselyns voy      all who have tasted the flesh of this animal say that it is most delicious eating a

conclude the ceremony charlevoix nouv fr v       chase the chase of these animals is a matter of the first importance and never undertaken without abundance of ceremony a principal warrior first gives a general invitation to all the hunters this is followed by a most serious fast of eight days a total abstinence from all kinds of food notwithstanding which they pass the day in continual song this they do to invoke the spirits of the woods to direct them to the place where there are abundance of bears they even cut the flesh in diverse parts of their bodies to render the spirits more propitious they also address themselves to the manes of the beasts slain in preceding chases as if it were to direct them in their dreams to plenty of game one dreamer alone cannot determine the place of chase numbers must concur but as they tell each other their dreams they never fail to agree whether that may arise from complaisance or by a real agreement in the dreams from their thoughts being perpetually turned on the same thing  the chief of the hunt now gives a great feast at which no one dares to appear without first bathing at this entertainment they eat with great moderation contrary to their usual custom the master of the feast alone touches nothing but is employed in relating to the guests ancient tales of the wonderful feats in former chases and fresh invocations to the manes of the deceased bears conclude the whole they then sally forth amidst the acclamations of the village equipped as if for war and painted black every able hunter is on a level with a great warrior but he must have killed his dozen great beasts before his character is established after which his alliance is as much courted as that of the most valiant captain  they now proceed on their way in a direct line neither rivers marshes or any other impediments stop their course driving before them all the beasts which they find in their way when they arrive in the huntingground they surround as large a space as their company will admit and then contract their circle searching as they contract every hollow tree and every place fit for the retreat of the bear and continue the same practice till the time of the chase is expired  as soon as a bear is killed a hunter puts into its mouth a lighted pipe of tobacco and blowing into it fills the throat with the smoke conjuring the spirit of the animal not to resent what they are going to do to its body nor to render their future chases unsuccessful as the beast makes no reply they cut out the string of the tongue and throw it into the fire if it crackles and runs in which it is almost sure to do they accept it as a good omen if not they consider that the spirit of the beast is not appeased and that the chase of the next year will be unfortunate  the hunters live well during the chase on provisions which they bring with them they return home with great pride and selfsufficiency for to kill a bear forms the character of a complete man they again give a great entertainment and now make a point to leave nothing the feast is dedicated to a certain genius perhaps that of gluttony whose resentment they dread if they do not eat every morsel and even sup up the very melted grease in which the meat was dressed they sometimes eat till they burst or bring on themselves some violent disorders the first course is the greatest

and marine animals not to overturn their boats they never call the two former by their proper name but by that of sipang or illluck  at present the kamtschatkans kill the bear and other wild beasts

piece of heroism by the kamtschatkans as it is with the americans the victor makes a feast on the occasion and feasts his neighbors with the beast then hangs the head and thighs about his tent by way of trophies  these people use the skins to lie on and for coverlets for bonnets gloves collars for their dogs soles for their shoes to prevent them from slipping on the ice of the shoulderblades they

reckoned as great an exploit in lapland as it was in america and the hero was held in the highest esteem by both sexes and by a singular custom was forbid all commerce with his wife for three days the laplanders bring home the slain beasts in great triumph they erect a new tent near their former dwelling but never enter it till they have flung off the dress of the chase they continue in it three entire days and the women keep at home the same space the men dress the flesh of the bear in the new tent and make their repast giving part to the females but take great care never to bestow on them a bit of the rump neither will they deliver to them the meat through the common entrance of the hut but through a hole in another part in sign of victory the men sprinkle themselves with the blood of the beast  after they have finished eating the flesh they bury the bones with great solemnity and place every bone in its proper place from a firm persuasion that the bear will be restored and

luxury it was not till the later ages that the furs of beasts became an article of luxury the more refined nations of ancient times never made use of them those alone whom the former stigmatized as

them civilization may take place and those spoils of animals which are at present essential for clothing become the mere objects of ornament and luxury  i cannot find that the greeks or old romans ever made use of furs it originated in those regions where they most abounded and where the severity of the climate required that species of clothing at first it consisted of the skins only almost in the state in which they were torn from the body of the beast but as soon as civilization took place and manufactures were introduced furs became the lining of the dress and often the elegant facing of the robes it is probable that the northern conquerors introduced the fashion into europe we find that about the year     when totila king of the visigoths reigned in italy that the suethons a people

norway and sweden  these are the most sagacious and industrious of animals sagacity they live in society and unite in their labors for the good of the commonwealth they form they erect edifices superior in contrivance to the human beings they usually live near and show a dexterity in their economy unequalled by the fourfooted race  in order to form a habitation they select a level piece of ground dwellings with a small rivulet running in the midst to effect their works a community of two or three hundred assembles every individual bears his share in the laborious preparation labors some fall trees of great size by gnawing them asunder with their teeth in order to form beams or piles others are employed in rolling the pieces to the water others dive and scrape holes with their feet in order to fix them and another set exert their efforts to rear them in their proper places a fifth party is busied in collecting twigs to wattle the piles a sixth in collecting earth stones and clay others carry it on their broad tails to proper places and with their feet beat and temper the earth into mortar or ram it between the piles or plaster the inside of the houses  all these preparations are to form their dwellings within an artificial piece of water or pond dams which they make by raising a dam across the level spot they had pitched on this is done first by driving into the ground stakes five or six feet long placed in rows and securing each row by wattling it with twigs and filling the interstices with clay ramming it down close the side next to the water is sloped the other perpendicular the bottom is from ten to twelve feet thick the thickness gradually diminishes to the top which is about two or three the center of the dam forms a segment of a circle from which extends on each side a strait wing in the midst of the center is usually a gutter left for the waste water to discharge itself these dams are often a hundred feet long and nicely covered with turf  houses the houses these wise animals make are placed in the water collected by means of the dam and are seated near the shore they are built upon piles and are sometimes round sometimes oval the tops are vaulted so that their inside resembles an oven their outside a dome the walls are made of earth stones and sticks and usually two feet thick they are commonly about eight feet high above the surface of the water clerk i      and are very neatly and closely plaistered on the inside the floor is a foot higher than the water the house sometimes has only one floor which is strewed with leaves or moss on which each beaver lies in its proper place at other times there are three apartments one to lodge another to eat in and a third to dung in mr graham catesby app xxx  for they are very cleanly and instantly cause the filth to be carried off by the inferior beavers  m du pratz i     says that those of louisiana form numbers of cells and that each animal or more probably each pair possess one he

cinereous down which is covered with long silvery hairs  in each house are two openings one toward the land the other is within and communicates with the water for the convenience of getting to their magazine of provision in frosty weather magazines this orifice is formed so as to be beyond the thickness of the ice for they lodge their provisions under the water and dive and bring it into their house according as they want it  their food is laid in before winter by the tenants of each house food it consists of the bark and boughs of trees lawson says that they are fondest of the sassafras ash and sweet gum in summer they live on leaves fruits and sometimes crabs and crayfish but they are not fond of fish  the number of houses in each pond is from ten to twentyfive number of houses the number of animals in each from two to thirty they are supposed to associate in pairs are therefore monogamous another proof of their advances toward civilization  i think i have heard that every family consists of an even number of inhabitants sometimes the community within the precinct of a dam consists of four hundred but i presume this must be in places little frequented by mankind  they begin to build their houses when they form a new settlement in the summer and it costs them a whole season to finish their work and lay in their provisions  they are very attentive to their safety and on any noise take to the water for their further security they form vaults or burrows in the banks of the creek formed by the dam into which they retreat in case of imminent danger  they seem to be among quadrupeds what bees are among insects they have a chief or superintendant in their works overseers who directs the whole the utmost attention is paid to him by the whole community every individual has his task allotted which they undertake with the utmost alacrity the overseer gives a signal by a certain number of smart slaps with his tail expressive of his orders the moment the artificers hear it they hasten to the place thus pointed out and perform the allotted labor whether it is to carry wood or draw the clay or repair any accidental breach  sentinels they have also their sentinels who by the same kind of signal give notice of any apprehended danger  slaves they are said to have a sort of slavish beaver among them analogous to the drone which they employ in servile works and the domestic drudgery mr graham   i have mentioned before their sagacity in laying in the winter provision their wood how cut they cut the wood they prefer into certain lengths pile them in heaps beneath the water to keep them moist and when they want food bite the wood into small pieces and bring it into their houses the indians observe the quantity which the beavers lay in their magazine at approach of winter it is the almanac of the savages who judge from the greater or less stock of the mildness or severity of the approaching season charlevoix v       the expedition with

dwellings which are liable to be overthrown by every flood this induces them to undertake their mighty and mavelous labors they therefore select places where no such inconveniences can be felt they form a dam to support a reservoir fed only by a small rill and provide for the overflow of the waste water by a suitable channel in the middle of their bank they have nothing to fear but from land floods or the sudden melting of the snows these sometimes make breaches or damage their houses but the defects are instantly repaired  during the winter they never stir out except to their magazines of provision and in that season grow excessively fat  they are strongly attached to certain haunts there being places winch they will not quit notwithstanding they are frequently disturbed there is says charlevoix a strong instance on the road between montreal and lake huron which travelers through wantonness annually molest yet is always repaired by the industrious inhabitants  in violent inundations they are sometimes overpowered in their attempts to divert the fury of the water in those cases they fly into the woods the females return as soon as the water abates the males continue absent till july when they come back to repair the ravages made in their houses charlevoix v       bearvers breed once a year and bring forth the latter end of winter and have two or three young at a birth  there is a variety of the beaver kind terrier beavers which wants either the sagacity or the industry of the others in forming dams and houses these are called terriers they burrow in the banks of rivers and make their holes beneath the freezing depth of the water and work upwards for a great number of feet these also form their winter magazines of provision beavers which escape the

the survivor instantly felt the loss began to moan and abstained from food till it died drages voy i       how taken they are taken several ways sometimes in logtraps baited with poplar sticks laid in a path near the water the indians always wash their hands before they bait the traps otherwise the sagacious animal is sure to shun the snare  sometimes they are shot either while they are at work or at food or in swimming across the rivers but these methods are used only in summer and not much practiced for the skins in that season are far less valuable than in the winter at that time they are taken in nets placed above and below their houses across the creeks on stakes if the water is frozen the ice is cut from shore to shore in order to put down the stakes when the net is set the indians send their women to the beaverhouses to disturb the animals who dart into the water and are usually taken in the net which is instantly hauled up and put down again with all expedition if the beaver misses the net it sometimes returns to its house but oftener into the vaults on the sides of the banks but the poor creature seldom escapes being pursued into all his retreats the houses being broke open and the vaults searched by digging along the shores  the value of the fur of these animals in the manufacture of hats is well known it began to be in use in england in the reign of charles i rymers faedera xx   0  when the manufacture was regulated in      by proclamation in which is an express prohibition of using any materials except beaver stuff or beaver wool and the hats called demicastors were forbidden to be made unless for exportation  this caused a vast increase of demand for the skins of the beavers the indians on the discovery of america seem to have paid very little attention to them amidst the vast variety of beasts they at that time possessed both for food and clothing but about the period of the fashion of hats they became an article of commerce and object of chase the southern colonies soon became exhausted of their beavers and of later years the traffic has been much confined to canada and hudsons bay the importance of this trade and the ravages made among the animal creation in those parts will appear by the following state of the imports into the ports of london and rochelle in      i take that year as i have no other comparative state  hudsons

advantageous situation of canada for the fur trade they had both sides of the river st lawrence the country round the five great lakes and the countries bordering on the rivers flowing into them and finally the fine fur countries bordering on the hudsons bay company many of whose waters falling into the st lawrence gave an easy conveyance of those commodities to montreal where a fair is annually

solitude unless in the amorous season when the females are found in the same burrows with the males but they bring forth in their own burrows and by that means prevent the males from destroying the young as they cannot enter by reason of the narrowness of the pipes the males being superior in size to their mates they sleep all night but in the morning quit their holes especially in fine weather and feed and sport till approach of night if the males approach one another they fight sharply the females often set up a very sharp whistle the males are for the most part silent at the sight of a

these and the other species of squirrels are the greatest pests to the farmers of north america they swarm in several of the provinces and often descend in troops from the back settlements and join the rest in their ravages on the plantations of mayz and the various nuts and mast which that fertile country produces  those which migrate from the mountains generally arrive in autumn instantly clear the ground of the fallen acorns nuts and mast and form with them magazines for their winter provisions in holes which they dig under ground for that purpose they are often robbed of their hoards for the colonists take great pains to find them out and ofttimes the hogs which rove about the woods root up and devour their magazines it is from these that they supply themselves from time to time with provisions quitting their nests and returning with a sufficient stock to last them for some space it being observed that during winter they do not care to quit their warm retreat unless on a visit to their storehouses therefore whenever they are observed to run about the woods in greater numbers than usual it is a certain sign of the near approach of severe cold for instinct directs them to lay in a greater stock than usual least the inclemency of the weather should deprive them of access to their subterraneous magazines  the damage which they do to the poor planters by destroying the mayz is incredible they come by hundreds into the fields climb up the stalks and eat the sweet corn wrapped up in the heads and will destroy a whole plantation in a night for this reason they were proscribed in some places the inhabitants were each obliged annually to bring in four squirrels heads in others a sum was given about three pence for every one that was killed this proved such an encouragement as to set all the idle people in the province in pursuit of them pensylvania paid from january      to january    0  000l currency but on complaint being made by the deputies that their treasuries were exhausted by these rewards they were reduced to one half how improved must the state of the americans then be in thirtyfive years to wage an expensive and successful war against its parent country which before could not bear the charges of clearing the provinces from the ravages of these insignificant animals  it has been observed that the squirrels are greatly multiplied within

are esteemed very delicate their skins in america are used for ladies shoes and are often imported into england for lining or facing for cloaks  they make their nests in hollow trees with moss straw wool and other warm materials they chiefly inhabit trees of the deciduous kind but sometimes in pines whose cones are an article of their provision they keep their nests for several days together seldom stirring out except for a fresh supply of food should a deep snow prevent them from getting to their storehouses multitudes perish with hunger  when they are sitting on a bough and perceive a man they instantly move their tails backward and forward and gnash their teeth with a very considerable noise this makes them detested by the sportsmen who lose their game by the alarm they give the gray squirrel is a difficult animal to kill it sits on the highest trees and often between the boughs and changes its place with such expedition that the quickest marksman can scarcely find time to

species poisonous to mankind they gather them in summer harvest them and even at times bring them out of the cells to give them a more thorough drying in the sun the chief labor rests on the females

summit a very large number of these animals here they are suffered to come on shore and amuse themselves for a considerable time till they acquire a degree of boldness being at their first landing so exceedingly timid as to make it impossible for any person to approach them  in a few weeks they assemble in great multitudes formerly when undisturbed by the americans to the amount of seven or eight thousand the form of the echouerie not allowing them to remain contiguous to the water the foremost are insensibly pushed above the slope when they are arrived at a convenient distance the hunters being provided with a spear sharp on one side like a knife with which they cut their throats take advantage of a side wind or a breeze blowing obliquely upon the shore to prevent the animals from smelling them because they have that sense in great perfection having landed the hunters with the assistance of good dogs trained for that purpose in the nightime endeavor to separate those which are most advanced from the others driving them different ways this they call making a cut it is generally looked upon to be a most dangerous process it being impossible to drive them in any particular direction and difficult to avoid them but as the walruses which are advanced above the slope of the echouerie are deprived by the darkness of the night from every direction to the water they are left

they travel and seek their provision they must also cut their thongs or straps out of them make the bladders for their harpoons and cover their tents with them without which they could not subsist in summer  therefore no man can pass for a right greenlander who cannot catch seals this is the ultimate end they aspire at in all their device and labor from their childhood up it is the only art and in truth a difficult and dangerous one it is to which they are trained from their infancy by which they maintain themselves make themselves agreeable to others and become beneficial members of the community hist greenl i   0   the greenlanders have three ways of catching seals manner of taking either singly with the bladder or in company by the clapperhunt or in the winter on the ice whereto may be added the shooting them with a gun  the principal and most common way is the taking them with the bladder when the greenlander sets out equipped according to the  th section and spies a seal he tries to surprise it unawares with the wind and sun in his back that he may not be heard or seen by it he tries to conceal himself behind a wave and makes hastily but softly up to it till he comes within four five or six fathom of it mean while he takes the utmost care that the harpoon line and bladder lie in proper order then he takes hold of the oar with his left hand and the harpoon with his right by the handboard and so away he throws it at the seal in such a manner that the whole dart flies from the handboard and leaves that in his hand if the harpoon hits the mark and buries itself deeper than the barbs it will directly disengage itself from the bonejoint and that from the shaft and also unwind the string from its lodge on the kajak the moment the seal is pierced the greenlander must throw the bladder tied to the end of the string into the water on the same side as the seal runs and dives for that he does instantly like a dart then the greenlander goes and takes up the shaft swimming on the water and lays it in its place the seal often drags the bladder with it under water though it is a considerable impediment on account of its great bigness but it so wearies itself out with it that it must come up again in about a quarter of an hour to take breath the greenlander hastens to the spot where he sees the bladder rise up and smites the seal as soon as it appears with the great lance described in the  th section see the sections referred to and tab v  this lance always comes out of its body again but he throws it at the creature afresh every time it comes up till it is quite spent then he runs the little lance into it and kills it outright but stops up the wound directly to preserve the blood and lastly he blows it up like a bladder betwixt skin and flesh to put it into a better capacity of swimming after him for which purpose he fastens it to the leftside of his kajak or boat see vol i   0 tab viii   in this exercise the greenlander is exposed to the most and greatest danger of his life which is probably the reason that they call this hunt or fishery kamavock i e the extinction viz of life for if the line should entangle itself as it easily may in its sudden and violent motion or if it should catch hold of the kajak or should wind itself round the oar or the hand or even the neck as it sometimes does in windy weather or if the seal should turn suddenly to the other side of the boat it cannot be otherwise than that the kajak must be overturned by the string and drawn down under water on such desperate occasions the poor greenlander stands in need of all the arts described in the former section to disentangle himself from the string and to raise himself up from under the water several times successively for he will continually be overturning till he has quite disengaged himself from the line nay when he imagines himself to be out of all danger and comes too near the dying seal it may still bite him in the face or hand and a female seal that has young instead of flying the field will sometimes fly at the greenlander in the most vehement rage and do him a mischief or bite a hole in his kajak that he must sink  in this way singly they can kill none but the careless stupid seal called attarsoak see no    of this work  several in company must pursue the cautious kassigiak ditto no    by the clapperhunt in the same manner they also surround and kill the attarsoit ditto a variety of no    in great numbers at certain seasons of the year for in autumn they retire into the creeks or inlets in stormy weather as in the nepiset sound in balls river between the main land and the island kangek which is full two leagues long but very narrow there the greenlanders cut off their retreat and frighten them under water by shouting clapping and throwing stones but as they must come up again continually to draw breath then they persecute them again till they are tired and at last are obliged to stay so long above water that they surround them and kill them with the fourth kind of dart described in the  th section during this hunt we have a fine opportunity to see the agility of the greenlanders or if i may call it so their hussarlike maneuvers when the seal rises out of the water they all fly upon it as if they had wings with a desperate noise the poor creature is forced to dive again directly and the moment he does they disperse again as fast as they came and every one gives heed to his post to see where it will start up again which is an uncertain thing and is commonly three quarters of a mile from the former spot if a seal has a good broad water three or four leagues each way it can keep the sportsmen in play for a couple of hours before it is so spent that they can surround and kill it if the seal in its fright betakes itself to the land for a retreat it is welcomed with sticks and stones by the women and children and presently pierced by the men in the rear this is a very lively and a very profitable diversion for the greenlanders for many times one man will have eight or ten seals for his share  the third method of killing seals upon the ice is mostly practiced in disko where the bays are frozen over in the winter there are several ways of proceeding the seals themselves make sometimes holes in the ice where they come and draw breath near such a hole a greenlander seats himself on a stool putting his feet on a lower one to keep them from the cold now when the seal comes and puts its nose to the hole he pierces it instantly with his harpoon then breaks the hole larger and draws it out and kills it quite or a greenlander lays himself upon his belly on a kind of a sledge near other holes where the seal come out upon the ice to bask themselves in the sun near this great hole they make a little one and another greenlander puts a harpoon into it with a very long shaft or pole he that lies upon the ice looks into the great hole till he sees a seal coming under the harpoon then he gives the other the signal who runs the seal through with all his might  if the greenlander sees a seal lying near its hole upon the ice he slides along upon his belly toward it wags his head and grunts like a seal and the poor seal thinking it is one of its innocent companions lets him come near enough to pierce it with his long dart  when the current wears a great hole in the ice in the spring the greenlanders plant themselves all round it till the seals come in droves to the brim to fetch breath and then they kill them with their harpoons many also are killed on the ice while they lie sleeping and snoring in the sun pp               nature has been so niggardly in providing variety of provision for the greenlanders that they are necessitated to have recourse to such which is offered to them with a liberal hand uses in kamtschatka the kamtschatkan nations which enjoy several animals as well as a great and abundant choice of fish are so enamoured with the taste of the fat of seals that they can make no feast without making it one of the dishes of that both russians and kamtschatkans make their candles the latter eat the flesh boiled or else dried in the sun if they have a great quantity they preserve it in the following manner  they dig a pit of a requisite depth and pave it with stones then fill it with wood and set it on fire so as to heat the pit to the warmth of a stove they then collect all the cinders into a heap they strew the bottom with the green wood of alder on which they place separately the flesh and the fat and put between every layer branches of the same tree when the pit is filled they cover it with sods so that the vapor cannot escape after some hours they take out both fat and flesh and keep it for winters provisions and they may be preserved a whole year without spoiling  the kamtschatkans have a most singular ceremony superstitious custom after they take the flesh from the heads of the seals they bring a vessel in form of a canoe and fling into it all the sculls crowned with certain herbs and place them on the ground a certain person enters the habitation with a sack filled with tonchitche sweet herbs and a little of the bark of willow two of the natives then roll a great stone toward the door and cover it with pebbles two others take the sweet herbs and dispose them tied in little packets the great stone is to signify the seashore the pebbles the waves and the packets seals they then bring three dishes of a hash called tolkoucha of this they make little balls in the middle of which they stick the packets of herbs of the willowbark they make a little canoe and fill it with tolkoucha and cover it with the sack after some time the two kamtschatkans who had put the mimic seals into the tolkoucha take the balls and a vessel resembling a canoe and draw it along the sand as if it was on the sea to convince the real seals how agreeable it would be to them to come among the kamtschatkans who have a sea in their very jurts or dwellings and this they imagine will induce the seals to suffer themselves to be taken in great numbers various other ceremonies equally ridiculous are practiced in one of which they invoke the winds which drive the seals on their shores to be propitious descr kamtschatka       besides the uses which are made of the flesh and fat of seals the skins of the largest are cut into soles for shoes the women make their summer boots of the undressed skins and wear them with the hair outmost in a country which abounds so greatly in furs very little more use is made of the skins of seals in the article of dress than what has been mentioned the same            but the koriaks the oloutores and tchutschi form with the skins canoes and vessels of different sizes some large enough to carry thirty people  seals swarm on all the coasts of kamtschatka and will go up the rivers eighty versts in pursuit of fish they couple on the ice in april and sometimes on the rocks and even in the sea in calm weather the tungusi give the milk of these animals to their children instead of physic  capture the seals in this country are killed by harpooning by shooting by watching the holes in the ice and knocking them on the head as they rise or by placing two or three strong nets across one of the rivers which these animals frequent fifty or more people assemble in canoes on each side of the nets while others row up and down and with great cries frighten the seals into them as soon as any are entangled the people kill them with pikes or clubs and drag them on shore and divide them equally among the hunters sometimes a hundred are taken at a time in this manner  the navigators observed abundance of seals about berings island but that they decreased in numbers as they advanced toward the straits for where the walruses abounded the seals grew more and more scarce  i did not observe any sealskin garments among those brought over by the navigators such as one might have expected among the esquimaux of the high latitudes they visited and which are so much in use with those of hudsons bay and labrador that species of dress doubtlessly was worn in the earliest times these people wanted their historians massagetae clothed in sealskins but we are assured that the massagetae strabo lib xi     clothed themselves in the skins of seals they according to danville inhabited the country to the east of the caspian sea and the lake aral both of which waters abound with seals  seals are now become a great article of commerce the oil from the vast whales is no

their young and equal tyranny toward the females the former are fierce in the protection of their offspring and should any one attempt to take their cub will stand on the defensive while the female carries it away in her mouth should she happen to drop it the male instantly quits its enemy falls on her and beats her against the stones till he leaves her for dead as soon as she recovers she crawls to his feet in the most suppliant manner and washes them with her tears he at the same time brutally insults her misery stalking about in the most insolent manner but if the young is entirely

side of the peninsula they abound in the months of june july august and september on berings island which they inhabit for the sake of quiet parturition and suckling their young steller also saw them

rocky shores or lofty rocks in the sea which seem to have been torn away from the land by the violence of some earthquake mullers voy  0  these they climb and by their dreadful roaring are of use in foggy weather to warn navigators to avoid destruction  they copulate in the months of august and september go ten months and bring only one at a time the parents show them little affection often tread them to death through carelessness and will suffer them to be killed before them without concern or resentment the cubs are not sportive like other young animals but are almost always asleep both male and female take them to sea to learn them to swim when wearied they will climb on the back of their dam but the male often pushes them off to habituate them to the exercise the russians were wont to fling the cubs into the water and they always swam back to shore  the males treat the females with great respect and are very fond of their caresses they are polygamous but content themselves with fewer wives than the former having only from two to four apiece  fear mankind the males have a terrible aspect yet they take to flight on the first appearance of a human creature and if they are disturbed from their sleep seem seized with great horrors sigh deeply in their attempts to go away fall into vast confusion tumble down and tremble in such a manner as scarcely to be able to use their limbs but if they are reduced to a strait so as not possibly to effect an escape they grow desperate turn on their enemy with great fury and noise and even put the most valiant to flight  unless habituated by use they lose their fear of men steller once lived for six days in a hovel amidst their chief quarters and found them soon reconciled to the sight of him they would observe what he was doing with great calmness lie down opposite to him and suffer him to seize on their cubs he had an opportunity of seeing their conflicts about their females and once saw a duel between two males which lasted three days and one of them received above a hundred wounds the ursine seals never interfered but got out of the way as fast as possible they even suffered the cubs of the former to sport with them without offering them the lest injury  this species has many of the same actions with the former in swimming walking lying and scratching itself the old bellow like bulls notes the young bleat like sheep steller says that from their notes he seemed like a rustic amidst his herds the males had a strong smell but were not near so fetid as the ursine sort  food their food is fish the lesser seals sea otters and other marine animals during the months of june and july the old males almost entirely abstain from eating indulge in indolence and sleep and become excessively emaciated  the voyagers made use of them to subsist on uses and thought the flesh of the young very savoury the feet turned into jelly on being dressed and in their situation were esteemed great delicacies the fat was not oily that of the young resembled the suet of mutton and was as delicious as marrow the skin was useful for straps shoes and boots  the kamtschatkans esteem the chase of these animals a generous diversion and hold the man in highest honor chase in proportion to the number he has killed even these heroes are very cautious when they attack one of the animals on shore they watch an opportunity when they find it asleep approach it against the wind strike their harpoon fastened to a long thong into its breast while their comrades fasten one end to a stake and that done he takes to his heels with the utmost precipitation they effect his destruction at a distance by shooting him with arrows or flinging their lances into him and when exhausted they venture to come near enough to knock him on the head with clubs  when they discover one on the lonely rocks in the sea they shoot it with poisoned arrows unable to endure the pain of the wound heightened by the salt water which it plunges into on the first receiving it it swims on shore in the greatest agony if they find a good opportunity they transfix it with their weapons if not they leave it to die of the poison which it infallibly does in twentyfour hours and in the most dreadful agony descr kamtschatka       they esteem it a great disgrace to leave any of their game behind and this point of honor they often observe even to their own destruction for it happens that when they go in search of these animals to the isle of alait which lies some miles southwest of lapatka promontory they observe this principle so religiously as to overload their boats so much as to send them and their booty to the bottom for they scorn to save themselves at the expense of throwing overboard any part nov com petrop ii  0

rugged and knotty like the bark of an aged oak without any hair an inch thick and so hard as scarcely to be cut with an ax and when cut appears in the inside like ebony from the nape to the tail it is marked with circular wrinkles rising into knots and sharp points on the side this skin covers the whole body like a crust and is of singular use to the animal during winter in protecting it against the ice under which it often feeds or against the sharppointed rocks against which it is often dashed by the wintry storms it is also an equal guard against the summer heats for this animal does not like most other marine creatures feed at the bottom but with part of the body exposed as well to the rays of the sun as to the piercing cold of the frost in fact this integument is so essential to its preservation that steller has observed several dead on the shore which he believes were killed by the accidental privation of it the color of this skin when wet is dusky when dried quite black  the tail is horizontally flat tail black and ending in a stiff fin composed of laminae like whalebone terminating with fibers near nine inches long it is slightly forked but both ends are of equal lengths

herds the old keep behind and drive their young before them and some keep on their sides by way of protection on the rising of the tide they approach the shores and are so tame as to suffer themselves to be stroked if they are roughly treated they move toward the sea but soon forget the injury and return  they live in families near one another each consists of a male and female a halfgrown young and a newborn one the families often unite so as to form vast droves they are monogamous they bring forth a single young but have no particular time of parturition but chiefly as steller imagines about autumn  they are most innocent and harmless in their manners and most strongly attached to one another when one is hooked the whole herd will attempt its rescue some will strive to overset the boat by going beneath it others will fling themselves on the rope of the hook and press it down in order to break it and others again will make the utmost efforts to force the instrument out of its wounded companion  their conjugal affection is most exemplary a male after using all its endeavors to release its mate which had been struck pursued it to the very edge of the water no blows could force it away as long as the deceased female continued in the water he persisted in his attendance and even for three days after she was drawn on shore and even cut up and carried away was observed to remain as if in expectation of her return  they are most voracious creatures and feed with their head under water quite inattentive of the boats or any thing that passes about them moving and swimming gently after one another with much of their back above water a species of louse harbors in the roughness of their coats which the gulls pick out sitting on them as crows do on hogs and sheep every now and then they lift their nose out of the water to take breath and make a noise like the snorting of horses when the tide retires they swim away along with it but sometimes the young are left ashore till the return of the water otherwise they never quit that element so that in nature as well as form they approach the cetaceous animals and are the link between seals and them  they were taken on berings isle by a great hook fastened to a long rope four or five people took it with them in a boat capture and rowed amidst a herd the strongest man took the instrument struck it into the nearest animal which done thirty people on shore seized the rope and with great difficulty drew it on shore the poor creature makes the strongest resistance assisted by its faithful companions it will cling with its feet to the rocks till it leaves the skin behind and often great fragments of the crusty integument fly off before it can be landed it is an animal full of blood so that it spouts in amazing quantities from the orifice of the wound  they have no voice only when wounded emit a deep sigh  they have the senses of sight and hearing very imperfect or at lest neglect the use of them  they are not migratory for they were seen about berings island the whole of the sad ten months which mr steller passed there after his shipwreck  in the summer they were very fat in the winter so lean that the
