an essay on the nature and method of treating the gout  london printed for the author mdccxlvi  an essay on the nature and method of treating the gout it is certain that many treatises have been published on this important subject and considerable discoveries and improvements made to the science of physic yet it is manifest the assiduity of the learned and the most inquisitive have hitherto failed to find out a specific in this distemper which is too conspicuous in the practice therefore i hope this short tract will be acceptable and not deemed a superficial performance  the basis of the design is reason and experience adapted to every constitution and age and i do not apprehend but will answer the grand intention not only alleviating the symptoms but effectually the cause  before the virtues of the cortex where known many distempers were removed with great difficulty and if the public will but give me leave i shall endeavor to render this method apparently as efficacious in the cure of the gout as the cortex is in fevers  this disease is called in greek rthrti in latin arthritis the gout and by affecting various parts has received as many terms viz ngra the gout in the shoulder eirgra the gout in the hand schi in or about that bone that is connected to the os ilium gongra in the knee and podgra in the foot  i shall confine myself to treat of these two that implies all the other viz hereditary and adventitious the first descending from the parents the adventitious from causes arising through intemperance in the nonnaturals but both from an effervescence of the nervous juice with the saline particles of the blood received with our food or too great freedom of spirituous fluids whence the nerves tendons ligaments the membranes about the bones are tormented and from whence proceed swellings redness hard sandy concretions on the joints  what time of the year this distemper invades is no material circumstance but it is certain that in hereditary gouts be the regimen ever so strict the patient shall have one or more fits  the acquired or adventitious comes unexpectedly and no certain time of continuance  the signs are a vehement pain in the joints viz the heel the ancle leg or the knee but not to all alike presently after a chillness with a shaking fit and a slight fever succeeds which increases with pain so exquisite as is hardly to be endured the pressure of the bedcloaths or the least motion in the room giving uneasiness and continues some little time before it remits then a gentle sweat coming on the pain abates and the sick falls into sleep and the part affected is immediately found to swell the following and perhaps for many days after it may return with equal violence in the evening and gradually go off in the morning in like manner other parts at that time may be affected and with the severity of pain until the principal paroxysm is complete which is longer or shorter according to the quantity of salts as well as the age of the sick  in such who are young and strong and have seldom the gout the fit may continue fourteen or sixteen days but in elderly people and such as are frequently afflicted it generally holds for two months such as are broken or much weakened either by their years or a long continuance of the disease it is most commonly six months more or less or till the heat of the summer  in the increase of the fit the urine is commonly of a high color with a red sediment abounding with sand and the belly usually costive a depraved appetite a coldness seizes the whole body about evening which continues the whole fit  in the decline the part or parts are subject to a violent itching from whence falls a leprous kind of scurff  when the gout is enraged by medicines unskilfully applied and the length and obstinacy of the disease perverted other parts are then infected as head shoulders stomach hands wrists elbows and sometimes one or more of the fingers are distorted or made crooked and at length generating tophs and chalky concretions like crabseyes which in time break the skin and fall out and fresh chalk comes in their place  it frequently afflicts the thigh and hip that the patient complains of an heavy weight but without exquisite pain and the sick have their joints almost every way contracted and weakened especially the knees whereby the use for a long while is taken away and by frequent tits to those pares most oppressed partly by age and weakness a total loss ensues  the urine in the decline of a fit is generally loaded with sand and too frequently if the disease happens to be of a long duration so as to confine the patient from motion is the beginning of a fit of the stone  it is to be observed that as the fever is that ushers in the gout so will be the fit if the fever be short and sharp the fit will be so  it is the general opinion that a tartarous urinous salt is the principal cause of this distemper paracelsus terms it morbus tartareus as proceeding from and caused of tartar a mixture of an acid liquor or salt with the synovia which is a transparent mucilage like the white of eggs and this being hardened is the chalky matter so common to gouty persons  helmont says its original is in the stomach which breeds an acid which insinuating itself into the synovia coagulates it and by a preternatural heat it is hardened into chalk and that the intenseness or remissness of the pain is to be attributed according to the difference of the salts but the intemperate use of wines especially those of the french i believe to be a very good reason we have so frequent complaints of the obstinacy of this distemper for the smaller the body of the wine is so much the more is it loaded with tartarous salt likewise an immoderate freedom of portwines has a vrey bad effect but more so if ever so little pricked as experience has demonstrated  some hereditary gouty subjects that have severely suffered and had a narrow escape for their lives i have known entirely forsake their darling liquor and take to madeira wine or brandy mixed with a little water and with the assistance of a few proper medicines continued free for a long time that before the regimen have been subject to tedious and long fits  the adventitious gout is known to proceed immediately from the immoderate use of wine or fermented liquors whereby the acid faeculencies remaining in the stomach become an acid and vicious tartar corrupting the lympha and juices create the antecedent cause which nature in her defense to preserve the principal parts forces to the extremes as the joints of the hands arms legs and feet which irritates and hurts the fibers of the nerves and tendons and thereby causes pain tumor redness and inflammation this matter remaining long in the parts affected for want of proper remedies to carry it off by degrees coagulates and becomes chalk or stone  a late learned gentleman who wrote a treatise on this distemper says that an hereditary gout is ingraned and transubstantiated into the solids and impossible to be rooted out by art and industry but speaks more favorable of an acquired as being more confined to the fluids a proper diet due exercise and a few well chosen remedies may go a great way if not to a perfect cure yet to make life tolerably easy but i hope my endeavors will convince the world of this error by showing that there are medicines that will in most cases totally remove this complaint and at the same time strengthen the tone of the stomach  this is the essential reason of the writing this treatise viz to remove this ingraned and transubstantiated conception and to make it appear that it may be done with as much safety and certainty as any other distemper and that either hereditary or adventitious gouts in proportion to the offending salts may be effectually removed and if the patient be but freed from chalky concretions and of a constitution not too much broken with frequent paroxysms to prevent a relapse but if so worn out with age and frequent returns of the fit i can assure him of a better state of health though not absolutely of a cure  the general and direct method in curing the gout in the fits is a gentle perspiration and breathing sweat by medicines repeated twice a day as long as the fit continues that causes no sickness at the stomach and that are easily digested giving a gradual heat and warmth through the body dilution frequently by proper liquors such as old small beer with a little madeira wine water boiled with a few spices mixed with a little brandy that may lie warm on the stomach thin water gruel with madeira wine during all the time of the fever is not to be omitted liquors may be more freely indulged than solid food and are always to be regulated by their lightness on and agreeableness to the stomach and by their not rendering the patient more hot and restless than the gout itself would do for whatever causes sickness must of course draw in the gouty matter but if it produce an agreeable sensation and not inflame will procure coolness and rest  the diet ought to be easy of digestion such as sagoe or panado with a little madeira wine or brandy or jellies little or no flesh meat during the fever is best and that the patient should eat sparingly for overmuch feeding nourishes the disease all salt and pickled meats and food of large nourishment is to be avoided the body is to be kept soluble which is commonly the reverse but may easily be so by a simple glyster of broth now and then with a few carminative seeds boiled in it  the urine is to pass freely and plentifully because sometimes a good part of the morbific matter may be carried off that way immoderate sleeping and watching is to be avoided likewise venery  if the patient can suffer motion it is better to use it by which the calculus is prevented  lastly the mind is to be kept serene and pleasant a cheerful friend and a glass of good madeira wine will keep up the spirits and in some measure lessen the fatigue of a tedious confinement  by this method i am certain this stubborn distemper is to be removed and have known some to have been freed from it for several years who by intemperance and irregularities of life have taken as great pains for a relapse but this is to be attributed chiefly to the goodness of their constitution  to speak something of the medicines that have this salutiferous effect the professors in physic do generally concur that if a medicine could be discovered that would sweat the part affected it would be the only and infallible means of success and the properest way to remove the load of tartarous salts and viscous matter which is the principal motive of this chronical disease  now the nature of these medicines are of such effect supposing the complaint in the foot which is a considerable distance from the stomach that soon after the first dose is received they have this consequence viz give the patient very sensible reason of its reaching that part by an additional warmth and moisture indications sufficient to a gouty person and if one dose have so great effect what must result from repeated doses every day but removeing the obstruction enlarging the pores braced tight with pain and anguish and by a full and free perspiration setting at liberty the cause of the distemper  in answer to some invidious people who attribute the operation of the medicines to a preparation of mercury others again to antimony and from the quick and unexpected relief the patient so suddenly receives to some assistance from the opiate tribe  the publishing this secret would immediately convince them of their gross errors besides a ponderous medicine as mercury or antimony must of course detect itself but i shall at this time wave the argument and when proper make it public but to satisfy the timorous shall so far declare that there is not one grain of an opiate or those minerals in the composition  it is certain minerals such as mercury and antimony have been used but prudently condemned as dangerous medicines breaking and tearing the smallest and finest vessels and fibers by their particles so that the body when the blood is replenished again with gouty salts becomes in a worse state in respect of the future fits which will become more painful and obstinate than they would have been in several years time under the common symptoms  and as to opiates they are never to be given but in extremities when the patient has been many days without rest and not then but by joining spicy nervous and stomach medicines to them so that it is plain nothing of that kind can be in the composition which is to be administered morning and evening and has no other effect but a gentle perspiration and breathing sweat and so repeated for a few days the symptoms of a regular fit are completely carried off  the irregular gouts where the constitution is broken and impaired and the gouty humor fixes on the head the intention to be had in view is to expel the said humor outwardly upon the muscles and joints and to fix it there and is to be treated as any other violent headache or as an inflammation on the brain by bleeding in the foot blistering on the ancles to give the gouty matter a vent downwards some authors are bold enough to prescribe mercurial and antimonial vomits but they are seldom to be ventured on in any constitution for the active part of the gout is too dangerous to be attempted by such an operation even bleeding without an absolute necessity is not to be admitted of but when other mild methods has been ineffectually used gentle stomach purges may be frequently and safely repeated but care must be taken that the medicines be not too hot especially in young sanguine constitutions and at the same time endeavors must be made toward a powerful evacuation by the pores which will not fail spending the gouty humor  the gout in the stomach is a common and less dangerous case for it rarely comes on or goes off without touching there and is as easily removed but toward the decline of life especially in those that have been long afflicted the paroxysm generally of great length is more obstinate especially when it settles in a constant pain and in nauseating and kecking in the stomach  though vomits are reckoned dangerous in the gout lest they should derive the humor on the stomach yet i have known some contrary to advice bold enough to make experiment and that have done it without any visible alteration on either side upon the first seizure of the stomach a gentle vomit is by some prescribed as a dose of the indian root and repeated as they found occasion but i never had a patient that pursued my method of evacuation by sweat to have any call for such an operation therefore cannot easily admit of the remedy stomach purges such as hiera picra with tincture of diambra or snakeroot blisters on the ancles highest cordials and most generous wines may be now freely indulged and without any fear of inflammation but if the gout should continue still in the stomach and become habitual then the bath waters with steel the aforesaid stomach purges frequently repeated a regular diet and exercise perpetual blisters between the thighs powerful evacuation by the pores cupping between the shoulders or bleeding in the foot are the only means effectually to remove it  the gout in the intestines must be treated altogether as in the stomach and no opiates to be used but in the last extremity  but if there should be a translation of the offending matter from the stomach or elsewhere to the lobes of the lungs you must behave in the same manner as if it was an absolute peripneumonia or inflammation on the lungs  these are cases that are generally attended with great fatigue and danger yet i shall exhibit an instance of a gentleman in a hereditary fit of the gout and near seventy years of age who had been a cripple by the chalky concretions in his knees full twenty years and had entirely lost the use of his legs and during the paroxysm the stomach was affected with a continual pain and heat no liquids but the most spirituous such as brandy or aqua mirabilis would rest on his stomach  after some weeks and various methods had ineffectually been made use of i was admitted and gave him the medicines and along with them warm spice stomach medicines which continued for twelve or fourteen days removed it from his stomach into his hand and elbow whereby the tone of the stomach was restored and the fit gradually carried off  i might instance many cases that would have proved dangerous if it had not been for these remedies but for brevity sake must omit them  since hereditary and adventitious gouts proceed from one and the same principal a tartarous salt having seen no remarkable difference worthy observation but that an adventitious in some constitutions has been equally as violent as the other i shall treat them alike  therefore a gout in a person of a firm stiff state of nerves of a middle age and free from chalky concretions i may venture to assure him of a cure in the time of fourteen or twentyone days by taking the medicines  a nervous gout in a loose flabby and relaxed state and of the same age a few days longer but when ascending toward the grand climacteric then the time cannot so easily be limited however i may affirm that it will be barely half the time of the customary length of the paroxysm  in young subjects i have known the cure performed in ten or twelve days to an entire extirpation and this great benefit obtained by no other method than medicines that promote evacuation by sweat that cause no sickness thirst or any inconveniency whatever but sit easy on the stomach  in the practice of ten years in this distemper i do not remember an instance of the gout either hereditary or adventitious that withstood the efficacy of these medicines so long a time as a month though the patient has had both legs and arms at the same time affected neither an instance of a relapse and i am certain if this practice was but generally known it would meet with a proper encouragement in spite of the obstacles that attend an undertaking of this nature that has not the sanction of the superiors in physic but i hope in time every one will be convinced that the sole end and design is immediately calculated for a public benefit and that it may appear more so and take off all thoughts of an imposition i am willing to wait upon any one that shall desire it and satisfy them by word of mouth of the efficacy of the method and as no reward is expected till the cure is effectually performed so i hope no quackery can be ascribed to this manner of purlication  finis errata page   pares read parts
