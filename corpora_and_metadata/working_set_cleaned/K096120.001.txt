author at the literarypress no    wardourstreet soho and sold by all booksellers  m dcc lxxxviii  preface to a curious inquisitive mind not to have some knowledge of the world we live in is the greatest mortification in nature hence it is that persons who have had a liberal education have taken all the opportunities that fell in their way of traveling into distant parts even at a great expense and hence it is that such persons to whom these opportunities never occur are eager to converse with travelers and read their accounts with avidity and pleasure but such is the scanty and uncertain information they thus gather and so various and different are the accounts of different men that little is to be depended on and what is generally most worth attention is seldom learnt to supply these defects collections os voyages and travels have at different times been published but they have been such separate accounts such vague relations and such detached journals as have swelled those works to a great number of very large expensive volumes that instead of entertaining and instructing the reader have confused and tired him and after the reading of months and years have left him almost as little informed and nearly as much in the dark as when he first set out to remove these objections to make a knowledge of thae habitable world a pleasing and an easy study and to open to mankind a view of nature is the design of the present publication it is the authors intent to blend the modern discoveries and the voyages and travels of late years with those of former ones to compare the accounts of different writers and ascertain the true ones to omit all that is dry and uninteresting in those accounts and retain only such information as the generality of readers will wish to be acquainted with and to embellish the pages with such a variety of maps and copperplates as will make the whole a very valuable publication the authors plan is to begin with the countries situated about the north pole and trace them downwards to the south pole describing in his way the several countries of the known world the natural history of those countries as far as is useful to a general reader the manners customs laws religion etc of the people these will be faithfully set forth from the printed accounts of travelers published in different countries with the authorities annexed and the plates will consist of maps plans and a diversity of interesting subjects many of which mill be new such as have never appeared in this country and engraved in a style that must give universal satisfaction  a description of greenland from the german of crantz who was there in      and      and others chap i of the country in general greenland is the remotest tract of land in the north it lies between europe and america and is commonly classed by geographers among those northern countries that remain unknown as far as it has been discovered it has been found to reach on the northeast side from the   th degree n latitude to the  0th and on the side opposite north america to about the  0th degree  it belongs to the crown of denmark  no ship having as yet traced it to the most northern parts on account of the ice it is not yet decided whether it be an island or not from some late discoveries of the russians it does not appear to join on the east with spitzbergen nova zembla or tartary but is supposed to join america on the northwest because the sea that apparently parts them and is called daviss streights or bassins bay grows gradually narrower as it approaches the   th degree and because the coast which rises very high toward that bay falls lower and lower the further north we go the greenlanders indeed say though it is doubtful how far they can be relied on that daviss straight contracts itself so much as it tends northward that they can travel on the ice so near to the opposite shore as to be able to make the inhabitants hear but that they cannot get across owing to the strength of the current from the north  icelandic authors have described old greenland on the eastern side as crowded with churches and villages and they might have said the same of the western side opposite to america for that the old norwegians or people of norway had houses and churches there also is evident from the many vestiges of them now to be found  when seamen speak of greenland they generally mean the danish islands of spitzbergen lying north of lapland between the   th and  0th degrees of latitude with the eastern coast of greenland lying opposite thereto this eastern coast is but thinly if at all inhabited at present but the western side of greenland from the   d to the   st degree north is again colonized by europeans the islands of spitzbergen are uninhabited except during the season of the whalefishery some few dutchmen were once left there a whole winter but they all perished the globe is here so round that even at the distance of six miles in a calm sailing east or west the masts of a ship only are discoverable at eight miles no other part can be seen than the topmast and at    miles distance the flag only yet the mountains of spitzbergen rise so high as to be seen    miles  lord mulgrave in his voyage to the north pole coasted round them  the land on the western side of greenland is barren high and rocky and rears its head in most places adjoining the ocean in such lofty mountains and inaccessible cliffs as may be seen at sea at the distance of  0 leagues the cliffs and mountains being constantly covered with ice and snow these by continually falling have filled the valleys and seem annually to increase their height the plains between the rocks are also covered with frost except here and there a patch where there is a scanty portion of earth and grass an occasional little brook and pond and some few low scattered shrubs  along the coasts in daviss streights and baffins bay which is the sea that divides greenland from the northern coasts of america there are numberless deep bays and creeks that run up far within the land and the shores are bordered with many islands of different extent to those who have seen the norway coast we may say this of greenland is not unlike it except that the hills here are not clothed with trees nor the valleys enriched with herbage and that the mountains are every where high and pointed  within land there are no inhabitants and but very few upon the coast the few there are inhabit the southern parts from statenhook to the   d degree but as no europeans live there these places are but little known to us  of the european settlements the most southern is the colony of frederics haab or frederics hope situated in the   d degree of north latitude begun by the danes in      it lies one mile and an half from the open sea and is a good haven and place of trade in the islands opposite where the dutch merchantships formerly harbored many greenlanders reside being well situated for catching fish seals and reindeer this colony is yet but small in      it consisted only of a factor a moravian missionary and about six or eight european sailors three or four of whom were married to greenland women  twelve leagues north of this colony is that famous iceglance or shining ice called in the charts eis blinck eisblink it is a great high field of ice whose glances in the air resembling the aurora borealis may be seen at sea for many leagues it was an inlet within the land whose mouth is now blocked up in such a manner by many huge pieces of ice driven out by the ebb that it forms as it were an arched icebridge eight leagues in length stretching from land to land and two in breadth it has many openings or irregular arches from    to  0 yards in height which might be passed through in boats but from the danger of pieces of ice often falling within these and many others that tumble from the adjoining hills are driven by the ebb through these arches into the sea  see the plate  such greenlanders as wish to enter this harbor carry their little canoes over land upon their heads and when they have passed this bridge they find open water for  0 leagues in length and two in breadth places are found here where greenland houses formerly stood  a proof that the mouth of the harbor was once open  about    leagues north of frederics hope is another colony called fischers fiorte or fishersbay begun in      here the moravians established a second mission in      but as few greenlanders live about this place it has but little trade in this neighborhood are seen many ruins probably the relics of the old norwegians  a third colony called godhaab or goodhope lies in    degrees    m    leagues north of fishersbay here there are some hundreds of small islands crowded together in the compass of six leagues the moravians have here also established a congregation built a church a provision house a smiths shop and a brew house and the houses of the natives are scattered round them this is the oldest colony in greenland having been founded in      it was formerly inhabited by some thousands of greenlanders but the small pox having made great ravage in      the number is so decreased that there are now few natives here settled  to give our readers some idea of the ravages the small pox made it was calculated in      that on the whole western coast of greenland in the space of  00 leagues there were not above  0000 greenlanders there settled whereas in the year    0 the number was computed at  0000  thirty leagues north of goodhope there are pretty large plats of grass near the seaside and wood is to be found  in latitude    degrees    min    leagues north of good hope is a fourth colony founded in      trade here is pretty good though there are but few greenlanders this colony and that of goodhope is frequented by one ship only and the trade consists of seals blubber and the skins of seals and foxes in this neighborhood are several salmonfisheries  in the   th degree of north latitude is wydebay a fifth colony established for traffic and the whalefishery in      this is one of the most commodious places for trade and residence on the whole coast  sixteen leagues farther north in    degrees lies another colony called egedes mind or egedes memorial erected in      this place is frozen up all the winter and is not open till may when the whalefishery is over  a fourth colony established in      lies in    degrees there are also three or four others but the   th and farthest north is in    degrees erected in      we are told by the natives that the country is inhabited as far north as    degrees though very thinly for notwithstanding there is plenty of eiderfowls white bears seals and whales yet owing to the long winternights no one liked to live there long the land being little else than dreary rock and ice in these parts instead of building their houses with wood and turf as in more southern places they are obliged to erect them with clay sealskins and the horns of the unicornfish according to their information the land stretches northwest toward america and they tell us that here and there are stones standing erect with arms extended like our guideposts as if they were set up as directions for traveling thence to the northern parts of america  we wish it was in our power to give the reader any tolerable account on which he might rely of the state of greenland some centuries back the natives know nothing of their forefathers but that they extirpated their former northern inhabitants  according to the account of arngrim jonas the learned icelander one eric a descendant of a norwegian earl being condemned to a three years banishment sought this place and finding it returned to iceland and the third year persuaded people to go to his newdiscovered land which he called greenland representing it as a place abounding with pasture wood and fish eric was followed by    ships full of people and in process of time greater numbers flocked there from iceland and norway and stocked the country with inhabitants both on the east and west side till it was computed to be a third part as numerous as a danish episcopal diocese  writers are not decided about the time of these events but it seems to be about the year   0  torfoeus the icelander who wrote in the   th century speaks of a number of monkeries and some nunneries and theodore who was a bishop in iceland in the last century relates that in einars inlet in latitude    degrees stood a great wood where cattle were pastured that belonged to the cathedral church at the end of the bay near the village gadar in the great island rinsey says he is an extensive hunt of reindeer and also the best soft bastardmarble of which the greenlanders make pitchers and vessels containing  0 or    barrels each so firm as to endure fire further west lies long island containing eight farms belonging to the bishops see he makes mention also of    bays or inlets on the east side round which stood   0 villages forming    parishes besides a bishops seat and two cloisters torfoeus describes the air as more serene and settled and the cold not so intense in greenland as in iceland and norway it is related also in the danish records that in the year   0  there was such a storm of thunder and lightning that a church was thrown down many pinnacles of rocks torn off and the dust of the broken stones flew about like rain and that this storm was followed by such a severe winter as they had never before seen when the ice did not thaw for a whole year  their descriptions of the fruitfulness or produce of the land are not only various but contradictory the iceland annals sometimes tell us that it bore the best wheat and at others that nothing would grow there for the cold they speak of woods where white bears were hunted and mention oaktrees that bore acorns as big as apples and of a taste as pleasant as chestnuts we mention these accounts but there is little in them to be relied on  in the danish chronicle we are told that in  0   the greenlanders became tributary to the kings of norway which was soon after they embraced the christian faith and that they were governed by a viceroy according to the laws of iceland we find no traces of their military strength either by land or sea the greenland trade indeed is said to have been very considerable and it may easily be believed that they exported a great deal of meat butter cheese fish train and pelts but these commodities seem to have been fetched by foreign vessels though navigation was not neglected by them for they not only sailed from iceland and norway to greenland in their own ships but the first discovery and navigation of north america is ascribed to them and perhaps a brief relation of this curious piece of history will not be unentertaining it is given by mallet in his introduction a lhistoire de denemarc and by pontoppidan in his history of norway transcribed by them from the iceland historians jonas and torfoeus confirmed by the testimony of the ancient historiographer adam brementis who wrote in the middle of the   th century and consequently at the time of the discovery  an icelander named herjolf went every year by sea to traffic in several countries accompanied by his son bioern once in the year  00  they were separated from each other by a storm and bioern arriving in norway got intelligence that his father had sailed to greenland a place then but little known he accordingly followed him but being driven by another storm to the southwest discovered a flat champaign country overgrown with wood and on his return described also an island he did not make any stay at either of these places but when the storm ceased made the best of his way northwest to greenland this discovery being made known leif the son of eric whom we have mentioned ambitious of acquiring fame like his father by discovering and colonizing new countries fitted out a ship with    men and went to sea with bioern the first land they made was stony and barren and they gave it the name of helleland that is flat bare land they next discovered a low country with white sand covered with some wood which they called markland or levelland two days afterward they saw land again whose northern coast was sheltered by an island here they found shrubs bearing a sweet berry and sailed up a river till they came to a lake from which the river issued the air was mild the soil fruitful and the river swarmed with all sorts of fishes particularly large salmon having continued there the winter and found that the sun rose about eight oclock in the shortest days it is evident the place must have been in the   th degrees of latitude and to be that of newfoundland or the river st lawrence in canada  having been long enough there to erect some huts they missed a german mariner whom after a long search they found in the wood skipping and very merry on being asked what made him so cheerful he replied that he had met with and eaten such grapes as people made wine of in his country when leif saw and tasted these grapes he called his new country viinland that is wineland  the ensuing spring they went back to greenland when thorwald leifs brother with a view of carrying the discoveries further sailed thither the same year with leifs crew and traced the land westward and the summer following eastward the coast was every where covered with timber trees and beset with islands but as the ship had received some damage they were obliged to spend most of their time in repairing her  having repaired their vessel they examined the east side of the land and perceived three small boats covered with skins and three men in each all of whom but one they seized and wantonly put to death some little time after a great number of the same kind of men in their boats assaulted them but they defended themselves so well from their arrows behind the boards with which their ships were guarded that the savages were forced to fly they called these indians skellings that is dwarfs and jonas writing after myritius calls them pygmaeos bicubitales and says they were found also on the west side of greenland he describes these men as having so little strength that there was nothing to fear from them yet thorwald and he alone fell by one of their arrows he ordered his people to set up a cross at the head and foot of the grave on which account that cape was called krossaness by which it appears that thorwald was a christian as well as his brother leif the rest of the greenlanders icelanders and especially the norwegians that resorted from time to time to wineland were probably heathens who would rather live in a strange land than embrace the christian religion which at that time was propagated in norway with severity thorwalds companions wintered in wineland and next spring returned to greenland  the same year thorstein the third son of eric with his wife and children in all    persons sailed for wineland his chief design was to bring away his brothers body but he was driven by a storm on the west coast of greenland at a great distance from any of the norwegian settlements there he took up his winter quarters but he and his followers lost their lives by an epidemic sickness  settling a colony in wineland was from this time more seriously thought of an eminent icelander named thorfein married thorsteins widow and went with her and others in number    men and five women to wineland they took with them all kinds of cattle tools etc and began to build and to plant the skraellings soon found them out and bartered with them their skins and their furs desirous of having some of their weapons in exchange but thorfein forbade it one of them however stole a battleaxe and was stupid enough to try it on his comrade but his curiosity having cost the other his life a third seized the weapon and cast it into the sea  three years after this thorfein returned to greenland and brought with him such valuable merchandise that he excited in many a desire to seek their fortune in wineland but no further account of this country worth mentioning is to be met with after the year      that is  00 years after its first discovery it is probable that those indians at present about newfoundland who are so very different in shape and manner of living from the other americans may be descended from them  i shall take this opportunity says crantz to speak of the extraction of our present greenlanders who were formerly called skraellings  the greenlanders say they were called by the former christian inhabitants karallit a name the eskimaux indians or northern americans gave themselves and a term which according to their manner of pronunciation may be turned into skraelling  there being no satisfactory footsteps of greenlands having been inhabited before the arrival of the norwegians the most probable supposition is that the present savages first came to greenland in the fourteenth century and that their route was not from the east out of europe but from the west out of greenland for the natives of greenland bear no resemblance to the laplanders or the people of spitzbergen but resemble most the kalmucks of tartary and as there seems to be no open passage for shipping beyond  0 degrees north for lord mulgrave in his voyage to explore the parts about the north pole could penetrate no further in the summer months than to about the  0th degree all beyond appearing to be an extensive plain of ice of an enormous thickness these things considered the greenlanders must have originated from the eastern parts of tartary through the northern parts of america and indeed the language of the eskimaux indians in labrador and the native greenlanders are so much alike as also their persons customs manners etc that it is scarce to be doubted but that the greenlanders are a branch of the eskimaux indians who fled either across daviss streights which are barely  0 leagues wide or elsetravelled up higher to the top of baffins bay where by the stone guideposts it is supposed that the land joins the narrowness of the channel between the eastern coast of tartary and the southern coast of north america being only    leagues across favors this assertion  it may be asked perhaps what became of the norwegians who are allowed formerly to have inhabited greenland a plague which raged in all the northern countries in the year    0 called the black death is supposed to have made great ravage in greenland and many corroborating circumstances evince that those who survived this pestilence were slaughtered by the savage skraellings  chap ii of the northern seas as the land is covered almost every where with ice and snow all the year round so is the sea in which are a variety of icemountains or pieces of floating ice of stupendous magnitude and form some of them wearing the appearance of a church or castle with square or pointed turrets others resembling a ship in full sail others again large islands with plains valleys and hills rearing their heads  00 yards above the level of the ocean  this ice like glass is for the most part hard clear and transparent some pieces of a pale green color others of a sky blue some gray and others black in many places they are an obstruction to the navigation in others during the whale fishery seamen moor their ships to them and on their flat surfaces frequently unload their trainbarrels as in sailing through these seas the ice mountains can be avoided they are attended with no great danger the flat driving ice however is terrible greenlanders assure us that on the eastern side of this country tracts of ice have been seen  00 leagues long and in many parts from  0 to  0 leagues broad and three or four yards in thickness and that such pieces will float and drive with the winds and currents when there is no opening made by the wind and stream one piece follows another so close that a person may leap from one to another without danger and may plainly see the joints where they were broken off lord mulgrave was so hemmed in by the ice that at one time he despaired of getting his ship out and had absolutely determined to take to his boats designing to draw them over the ice into more open water and this in the month of august hence it appears that the greenlanders are so beset at certain seasons as to find no passage out nor european ships any passage in  with this and other great inconveniences the wise author of nature has however combined a great benefit for though he has denied this frigid and rocky region the growth of trees and almost forbidden ships to bring them any fuel he has ordained that the streams of the ocean should convey to these inhospitable shores a great deal of wood which comes floating there partly without ice but chiefly with it lodging itself between the islands were it not for this miraculous provision the europeans there settled would have no wood to burn nor the greenlanders who burn oil instead of wood any timber to roof their houses build their boats or shaft their arrows which procure them food and clothing among this wood brought here accidentally are great trees torn up by the roots which by driving up and down for years dashing and rubbing upon the ice are quite bear of branches and bark and corroded with great woodworms a small part of this driftwood are willows alder and birch driven from the bays in the south and large trunks of aspentrees which must come from a great distance but the greatest part is pine and fir  it is difficult to decide from what country this wood proceeds but it is supposed to come with the easterly current from siberia or asiatic tartary where the trees must be washed down the mountains by the waters which the rains and flood occasion and brought away by the rapid streams of their rivers  chap iii of the air and seasons this country being covered with everlasting snow it must naturally be very cold and raw in such places in winter where the inhabitants enjoy the sun for an hour or two in the day the cold is tolerable but where the sun is entirely below the horizon whilst people are drinking tea the emptied cup when put down will freeze to the table paul egede in his journal of january        says that in latitude    degrees when he was there the ice and hoarfrost reached through the chimney to the stoves mouth without being thawed by the fire even in the daytime so that over the chimney was an arch of frost with little holes through which the smoke issued the door and walls of his room were as if plastered over with ice and what is scarce credible linen froze in the drawers the beds were frozen to the bedsteads and the eiderdown coverlid and pillows became quite stiff with frost an inch thick from the breath they were obliged to hew their fleshbarrels in pieces to get out the meat and though they thawed it in snow when it was put over the fire the outside would be sufficiently boiled before the inside could be pierced with a knife  the summer in greenland is from the beginning of may to the end of september during which five months the natives encamp in tents yet the ground is not mellowed by a thorough thaw till june and then only on the surface nor does it cease snowing till this time in august it begins snowing again but no snow continues on the ground till that which falls in october the snow in august is either soon dissolved by the sun or dispersed by the wind in which last case the wind scatters such a subtle snowdust that we scarce dare put our heads out of doors  in the longest summerdays particularly in serene and clear weather it is so hot that people are not only obliged to throw off their wintergarments but on the sea the pitch will melt on the ships sides and from april to august the fogs are so thick almost every day that people cannot see  0 yards before them it has been often remarked that the weather in greenland is just the reverse of what it is in europe in the year      when it was so remarkably cold throughout europe it was so mild in greenland that it is often colder here in summer  in general the air is so wholesome and pure that if a man clothes himself warm eats moderately and takes good exercise he will enjoy a good state of health and spirits the winds are as variable here as in other countries but when it once begins to be stormy which happens mostly in autumn they rage so vehemently that the houses shake and crack tents and the lighter boats fly up into the air and the seawater scatters about on the land like snowdust when any one is obliged to leave his house in order to put his boats into shelter he must creep upon his belly lest the wind should take him off his legs  there is no night at all in this country during the summer beyond the   th degree north in the longest days the sun does not set it shines not however with such luster at night as at noon resembling only a very bright moon which a man can look at without being dazzled on the other hand the winternights are so much the longer and in the   th degree the face of the sun is never seen above the horizon from november  0 to january    and yet there are no dark nights here as in other countries the inhabitants enjoy a moderate twilight and the moon and stars added to the snow and ice give such a light that people can do very well out of doors without a lanthorn and see plainly to read print of a middle size as in the shortest days sometimes the moon never sets so little is seen of it in the summertime and the stars never appear from may to august  chap iv of the productions of the soil the reader may readily conclude from the situation and nature of this country what he is to expect in regard to its fertility though the bodies of rocks near the sea yield a great deal of coarse marble and many of the hills a kind of asbestos or stoneflax yet their surface produces little the valleys in general have no other herbage than moss and sour moorgrass and the uninhabited islands where the birds nest and dung furnish only a few low shrubs heath and herbs the land however near the greenland houses and encampments from many years cultivation with the blood and fat of seals though in itself nothing but a barren sand produces the finest herbs in uncommon quantity and size  grass grows here not only in fenny sandy and turfy ground where indeed it is in general very short and bad but also in the cliffs of rocks where any earth has lodged and especially near the houses where it grows very thick and long moss is the chief produce of which says crantz when i have been sitting on a rock i have countd near  0 sorts round me without rising one sort is like a a soft thick fur which the natives use as we do wastepaper and also to stop the crevices of their houses another sort serves them for tinder and wicks for lamps they have also a kind of white moss on which the reindeer feed in winter and which in cases of necessity would preserve the life of a hungry man there is another kind of moss that serves them instead of bread being occasionally boiled with milk as a substitute for oatmeal europeans have several times attempted to grow barley and oats these will shoot up as fine and high as in our country but seldom get into ear and never ripen on account of the early frosts even in the warmest places as the season will not admit of sowing till the middle of june they cannot raise many vegetables radishes grow as well here as in most other countries but sallad and cole are very small and will not bear transplanting  whortleberries and cranberries are here met with and a fruit like the mulberry only yellow instead of red these last are packed up and exported are a very refreshing delicacy and a remedy for the scurvy there are plenty of large juniper berries but held there in no estimation of trees there are three kinds of willows but the cold will not suffer them to rear their heads obliging them to creep upon the ground their birch though somewhat different from ours is in the same predicament the greenlanders talk of alders that grow in the southern parts twice the height of a man and as big round as his leg and say that the wild servicetree grows there in abundance and brings it is fruit to maturity they also speak of a wild pea which they boil and eat and mention a fruit resembling our large yellow plumb which they compare to oranges but the further we go north the more naked and steril is the land till at last nothing is to be met with but bare rocks  chap v of their animals unfruitful however as this land is it affords nourishment to some though but very few kinds of beasts which supply the natives with food and raiment hares and reindeer they have in plenty but more of the former than the latter hares are white both in summer and winter are pretty large live on grass and white moss but are little regarded by the natives  their reindeer are of that northern kind which are met with in spitzberg siberia norway lapland and the northern parts of america they are here wild and not easily caught the largest are about the size of a twoyear old hfr their color brown or gray with white bllies their skin very thick of hair and above an inch long their antlers differ only from those of the common buck in being smooth gray and broad as ones hand at top their flesh is tender and welltasted they are very cleanly and contented creatures live in summer on the tender grass they find in the valleys and in winter on the white moss which they dig for under the snow between the rocks a greenlander once caught a young one bred it up and it grew as tame as a cow but having done some mischief he was obliged to kill it  here are also foxes but somewhat different from those of southern countries some are white but in general they are blue or gray they bark like a dog and resemble one about the head and feet live on birds and their eggs upon berries muscles crabs and what the sea casts out the natives catch them in traps and if in want of food would rather eat them than hares blue foxskins are eagerly bought up by the factors  white bears so often heard of are frequently met with in all parts of greenland they have a long narrow head like a dog and are said to bark like one their hair is long and as soft as wool their bodies are often three or four yards in length their flesh is white and fat tastes like mutton and the natives are very fond of it they prowl upon the flakes of ice after seals and dead whales and will attack the sealion though this creature frequently masters them they will swim from one piece of ice to another and when attacked will defend themselves even against a boat full of men when on land their food is birds and their eggs and if impelled by hunger they will devour the human species digging dead bodies out of their graves in winter they immure themselves in holes between the rocks or bury themselves in the snow till the sun invites them abroad again when allured by the scent of seals flesh they will hunt out a greenlanders house break into it and plunder it the natives in their turn raise a hue and cry after the robbers surround them with their dogs and kill them with lances and harpoons though they often lose their own lives in the assault  here are no tame beasts except dogs of a middle size which resemble more a wolf than a dog not barking but howling and growling they are too stupid an animal to be of much use in hunting but are harnessed as horses to a sledge from four to ten at a time in which the natives visit each other or draw home their seals over the ice their skins are used as coverings to beds and as ornamental borders to their garments  of landbirds there is no great variety because there is little food for them the principal is the northern partridge such as frequents cold countries and the alps in switzerland they are called snowhens they cast their feathers twice a year the color of the cocks are gray in summer and white in winter the color of the snow  a wise precaution of providence to preserve them from birds of prey which hunt after them and but for this circumstance would readily find them it is a good bird to eat and easily caught their claws have within a thick ball covered with small feathers to enable them to endure the cold and as their toes are not divided the whole way up they are capable of swimming here are also snipes and some small singing birds and of birds of prey the great darkbrown eagle gray and spotted falcons white owls and ravens  as to insects and vermin  the natives are troubled with large gnats besides small ones in such quantities that in hazy summer weather it is difficult to screen themselves from them they have all sorts of earthworms and maggots but nothing venomous except spiders no serpents toads frogs rats mice fleas or such like animals these cannot live in this cold country  destitute however as the land is of living creatures the riches of the sea make it up as well in variety as multitude the many kinds of seafowls are too numerous to mention here unless we were writing the natural history of the place indeed they are not peculiar to greenland but are found in most of the higher latitudes we shall have occasion to speak of some of them when we are describing norway will therefore pass over all but the eiderfowl or black duck it is down being a profitable article of commerce it is flesh is eaten by the greenlanders and of it is skin they make their finest and their warmest undergarments this fowl is however most celebrated for it is valuable down which is found in great quantities when stripped of it is coarse feathers as the down when pulled from the dead bird is apt to heat by lying and will not swell and distend itself rightly they contrive to procure it from the fowl whilst living for this purpose they visit the nests which the tender mother lines with this soft substance either dropped or plucked from her body to prepare a warm bed for her callow brood of this down we have warm light coverlids in england but we shall have occasion to speak more of it hereafter  of the most profitable fishes the north is the proper rendezvous and residence where under the ice they find shelter from the whales that prey on them whales being frequently obliged to rise above water to draw breath cannot follow their prey far under the ice here then they retreat breed and fatten but in order to make them subservient to the use of man the wise creator has ordained that they shall annually make their way southward we see this particularly in herrings some cause unknown to man drives them out in innumerable shoals like swarms of bees as they advance they are chased by the cod the mackarel and other fish of prey and these in their turn are hunted by the seals and whales and obliged to fly to the shallowest sandbank for protection where the larger fishes cannot follow them and where they are caught by fishermen  these seas not only yield herrings salmon codfish etc but flounders holibut a variety of shellfish and some small fishes peculiar to this latitude  though the whole is almost universally known it would be unpardonable in treating of greenland not to give some account of this animal and it is fishery which employs so many ships yearly of different nations not less than  00 or   0 each ship having from five to seven longboats and that in a compass of two degrees from the   th to the   th these ships sometimes catch from   00 to  000 whales in the space of two months and wound many that escape  the greenland whale by english sailors called the black whale is described in martens voyage to spitzberg and zordragers greenland fishery to be from  0 to  0 feet long they were formerly from  00 to  00 feet in length but being now caught in such multitudes have not time to grow to their full size the head is a third part of the length of the whole body it has only two fins one on each side of the head from five to eight feet long but with these it rows along very fast it is tail is six or eight yards broad and turning up at both ends in a curve is enabled with it to dash the strongest boat in pieces it is however a timid animal never beginning an attack but flying at the least alarm it is skin above is commonly black and smooth like velvet and white underneath on the head is a bunch where are two nostrils through which it breathes and spouts out the water it takes in at it is mouth with a noise that can be heard at three miles distance it is eyes are placed between it is nostrils and fins and have eyelids that drop over them and are not larger than those of an ox it has no flaps to it is ears nor any teeth in it is mouth but contains in it is upperjaw which is six yards long those barders blades or whiskers as they are called of which we make the whalebone there are commonly   0 on each side but the  0 largest only are taken they hang like the pipes of an organ the least before and behind the longest in the middle which are generally four yards in length the tongue consists wholly of soft fungous fat like bacon which will fill from five to seven large barrels this fish brings forth it is young like a quadruped fullformed generally one at a time but never more than two which it suckles when pursued it wraps up it is young in it is fins close to it is body whales have two skins the inner an inch thick the outer one as thin as parchment under these lies the fat from six to    inches thick about the under lip it is two feet in thickness the fat of the whale will according to the size of the fish fill from  00 to  00 barrels it is flesh is coarse and is said to taste like beef greenlanders eat the part about the tail and call it a delicacy it is bones are hard on the inside full of holes like a honeycomb and filled with train  one would suppose that this enormous beast would require a great many large fishes for one meals food but it is swallow being scarce four inches broad it lives chiefly on a white slime swimming on the sea called whales food but which in fact is an animal wearing that appearance this it sups up by strong suction and as a great deal of water flows in with it the animal blows out the water again at it is nostrils this slime being found in the greatest quantity between spitzberg nova zembla and greenland where it floats in such abundance that the creeks are as full of it as our ditches with insects the whale rarely emigrates from these parts  the manner of catching whales is as follows  when a whale is seen or heard a longboat with six men in it for there are always five or six such boats ready makes up to it and endeavors to approach it is side near the head the whale finding itself pursued dives but rising again to breathe which it is constrained to do the men watch the opportunity row up to it is side and the harpooner strikes him usually near the fin with a harpoon a triangular barbed iron about a foot long and fastened to a stem the fish no sooner feels the smart than it darts down into the deep with the harpoon sticking fast in it to this harpoon is fastened a line  00 yards long and about as thick as ones finger which runs with such rapidity after the whale that if it entangles itself must either snap short or overset the boat it is one mans business therefore to attend to this line and wet the place on the boats edge on which it runs lest it should take fire the boat with the line follows the whale as far it can and if the fish is not mortally wounded it will flounce about in the deep for an hour and draw a line of  000 yards after it in which case fresh line is added by other boats if the fish comes up again alive they strike it with fresh harpoons and then kill it with lances when dead it rises to the surface of the water with it is belly upwards should it retreat under the ice they either pull away the harpoon or cut the line in which case they lose the fish a loss amounting to  00l that being it is average value  the whale being dead is towed up to the ships side and there fastened the first business is then to go with a boat into it is jaws and cut out the whalebone they next cut off the blubber from the tongue and then proceed to strip the whole body of it is fat beginning at the head and tail at once and ending in the middle forty or fifty men stand on the fish for this purpose and will strip it in four hours with the loss of it is fat the fish loses it is buoyant faculty and when turned adrift down goes the carcass into the deep with the general and joyful huzza of the whole crew in a few days it bursts and rises again and it is vast stock of flesh is a profuse feast to fishes birds and bears  this is the european mode of whalefishing but that of the greenlanders is somewhat different the women assist in this business their employ being to row the boats and mend the seamens jackets when they see a fish they row boldly up to it and strike it with several harpoons to which are hung large bladders made of seals skin which so incumber and impede the motion of the animal that he cannot dive deep when tired out they dispatch him with their lances the men then creep into their sea or springjackets which are made of sealsskin with airbladders and cover their feet hands and head all in one piece being fastened tight upon the head in these they leap fearless upon the fish and into the sea the air in their jackets keeping them erect in the water they next proceed as do the europeans to cut out the fat and whalebone and here the multitude are very disorderly all running promiscuously in a heap men women and children one over another with sharppointed knives for every one though a spectator only may share in dividing the spoil and it is wonderful how careful they are in all this scramble not to wound one another  the seal also is a native of the northseas is an amphibious animal with four feet and called in many places the seacalf or seawolf it has a rough hairy hide used by us to cover traveling trunks it is head pretty much resembles that of a dog with the ears cropped having a small aperture for the ear but no flaps it is body in the middle is bulky but runs out pointed toward each end for the convenience of making better way through the water it has two short feet before standing downwards perpendicularly and two others behind in a horizontal direction with webbed toes like those of a goose the water is it is natural element as it lives upon fish but having long nails in it is fore feet it climbs the rocks and is often upon land it is cry is like a wild swine and the young ones mew like a cat it has sharp teeth and large fiery eyes with eyebrows  seals are often found on the ice and land basking or sleeping in the sun and though they have a lame gait or walk can pad along so fast and by means of their hindfeet spring forward so quick that a man cannot easily come up with them they are taken for their fat and skins their fat which is near four inches thick is converted into trainoil and their flesh is red tender and juicy resembling in taste the flesh of a wild hog  there are five or six species of seals some two yards and some three yards in length i have seen one says crantz called a seacow of the seal species six yards in length and near as much in circumference over the breast this creature weighed  00 pounds and as it is eyes on pressing the skin sprung out a fingers length it is supposed the animal could throw them out and draw them in for shelter at pleasure  seals in general yield a great deal of blubber and the train that drops from it is not more rancid than stale oil of olives and with their skins the greenlanders frequently make their waistcoats they cannot easily be caught by a single person unless when they are big with young and of course helpless but as they are animals of passage retiring from greenland in march to cast their young and returning in june young and all like a flock of sheep the sealhunters endeavor on their return to surround them on the ice where they often lie sleeping in whole herds they first frighten them by shouting which occasions them to stretch out their necks and yell at which time the catchers take the opportunity to stun them by giving them a desperate blow on their noses after which they kill and flay them  to the greenlanders the sealfishery is the best harvest seals flesh with that of the reindeer is their most delicious and substantial food the fat supplies their lamps and fires with oil softens their dry food and by barter furnishes them with all the necessaries of life of the fibers of seals sinews they make thread the transparent skins of their entrails serve them for windows curtains for their tents shirts and those bladders they fix to their harpoons and of the maw they make train bottles when there is a scarcity of iron they make instruments and tools of their bones their blood with other ingredients they convert into soups and make their clothes bedding and boats of their skins  catching seals therefore is the great end of greenland education to which the children are trained from their infancy by which they maintain themselves become agreeable to each other and useful members of society  they have two kinds of boats for this purpose a large one and a small one the large one they call umiack or the womans boat and the small one kaiak the womans boat is from    to    yards in length four or five feet wide and three deep the other about six yards long    inches broad and barely    inches deep they are slatbottomed widest in the middle go off sharp at each end and are covered with sealskin the large boats are open at the top and are commonly rowed by four women one steering with an oar behind in the forepart is a mast with a sail made of sealgut skin six feet high and nine feet wide the wealthy greenlanders make this sail of white linen with red stripes and though they can with this sail make way only before the wind and cannot keep pace with an european umiak boat under sail yet they can row them faster and often make voyages along the coast from two to  00 leagues north and south with their tents household furniture all their property and often  0 or  0 persons besides the men accompany them in their kaiaks and assist them when they need it they thus travel at the rate of    leagues a day and every night unload pitch their tents draw their boat ashore and stay till the next morning  see the plate  the kaiak is covered on the top having a round hole in the middle into which the greenlander slips with his feet sitting on a board covered with a soft skin when he is seated the rim of the hole reaches just above his hips and he tucks his great watercoat in between the boat and himself so tight that the water cannot penetrate this coat being at the same time buttoned close about his face and body the man and his boat are as it were one mass at his side he places his lance and harpoon and behind him the sealskin bladder his pautik or oar for he has but one is made of red deal round in the middle and three fingers broad at each end this he holds in the middle with both hands and strikes the water on each side very quick and as regular as if beating time thus equipped he goes out to fish and if expedition requires it can row  0 or    leagues a day in these kaiaks they fear no storms can mount the boisterous billows like a piece of cork and should a wave break over them are unconcerned for they accustom themselves by way of exercise to overturn themselves in the water so as that their heads shall hang perpendicularly down and with a swing and stroke with their paddle set their boat to rights again in an instant  when a greenlander spies a seal he endeavors to conceal himself behind a wave till he is within  0 or    yards of it in order to take him by surprise having his lance harpoon and tackle ready as soon as within reach he casts the harpoon and if he hits his mark the seal feeling himself wounded dives dragging the bladder which is fastened by a string to the harpoon under water with him though from it is size he finds it difficult so to do but as the animal must come up every quarter of an hour to breathe no soon grows weary of diving is followed by the greenlander and pierced with a lance as he rises when killed the wound is stopped to preserve the blood this done the sealcatcher perforates the skin blows up the animal like a bladder to make it buoyant and takes it in tow  in this exercise he is exposed to great danger for should the line which fastens the bladder to the harpoon and which is of some length entangle itself with the kaiak the boat must be drawn down under water nay should he escape this danger if he approaches too near the dying seal it will bite him mortally a female seal that has young will often fly at it is enemy with fury or bite a hole in the boat and sink it  it is the stupid species of seal which the greenlander can thus take without assistance other seals are caught by companies of fishermen at certain seasons they retire into creeks and inlets there the greenlanders cut off their retreat and frighten them under water by shouting clapping and throwing stones when they come up to draw breath they assail them again in the same manner till they tire them out that they can dive no longer they are then surrounded and killed this mode of catching them is called kassigiak or clapperhunt it is not bad sport and the greenlanders are very active and expert at it if a seal has good broad water three or four leagues each way it can keep the hunters in play for two hours diving and rising again at the distance of three quarters of a mile should it in it is fright take to the land it is there attacked by women and children  they are often caught also on the ice many being killed whilst sleeping and snoring in the sun and in the springtime where the current makes a great hole in the ice the greenlanders will often station themselves round it and when the seals come in droves to the edge of this hole to breathe kill them with their harpoons  chap vi of the natives the greenlanders are of low stature not exceeding five feet in height but they are wellshaped and proportionate in their limbs their faces are generally broad and flat with high cheekbones like the scots but their cheeks are round and plump it is a common observation says ellis in his description of the esquimaux indians that men as well as beasts and the products of the ground with some few exceptions are smaller and smaller as they are more under the pole for though there are large trees growing at the bottom of hudsons bay there are nothing but shrubs in the   st degree and also that the people keep diminishing in stature according to the higher latitude they live in till the   th degree where there are no inhabitants at all  the eyes of the greenlanders are little and black but without any animation and their noses project but little from their faces their bodies are all over of a dark gray but their faces are of an olivecolour as their children are born white this gray tinge may proceed in part from their dirtiness for they are continually handling trainoil and grease sitting in the smoke and seldom wash themselves their food also may contribute to the same end for their blood is so affected by it that their sweat smells like train and their hands feel clammy like bacon but there are a few whose faces are not so round and whose complexions are fairer and might easily pass undistinguished among the natives of switzerland  their hair on their heads is universally strong and long and of a coalblack color but the men have seldom any beard as they take great pains to pluck it out their hands and feet are small and soft but their head and limbs are large they have high breasts and broad shoulders especially the women who accustom themselves to carry heavy burdens and being fat and corpulent can endure the cold with bare heads and necks and very thin clothing nay the men commonly sit naked within doors except their breeches and at this time their bodies emit such a steam as to be intolerable to a european sitting near them they are very light and active do not want for strength and can endure great fatigues a greenlander who has eat nothing but grass for three days will manage his little canoe in the most boisterous sea and a woman will carry a reindeer whole for the distance of four leagues or a piece of timber or stone double the weight which any englishman can lift  with respect to their temper they are of a phlegmatic nature not very lively but goodhumoured sociable and far from covetous they are so little concerned for the future as to hoard up nothing of course are very liberal in giving they are not apparently possessed of any high spirit but have a good share of what we call rustic pride and consider europeans as far beneath them esteeming themselves the only civilized and wellbred people when they see a quiet and modest stranger they say  he is almost as wellbred as us  they are not quarrelsome but patient and draw back where any one encroaches on them but if pushed to extremes become desperate in the greatest degree  though they are always busy about something they are very fickle and have no perseverance so that if they begin a thing and meet with a difficulty they throw it away in summertime they sleep five or six hours in winter eight and if they have worked hard and had a restless night will sleep the whole ensuing day in the morning they will walk to some eminence take a prospect of the weather and the ocean and if it appears unfavourable will seem thoughtful and dejected as at the dangers and burdens of the day but when no difficulties rise before them or when they return home from a successful fishery they are cheerful and conversable  they are so expert at concealing and expressing their passions that we might take them for stoics and they affect to be very resigned under any calamity but it is all affectation for no people are more irritable to anger and more revengeful when an opportunity offers  their clothes are made of the skin of the reindeer seals and birds their outer garment resembles a waggoners frock only not so long and loose and they put it on the same way drawing it over their heads like a shirt at the top of it is a hood which they can pull up occasionally over their heads like the hood of a capuchin their undergarment is a kind of shirt made of the skins of birds with the feathers inwards at present most greenlanders of any property make their upper garment of cloth or cotton yet cut in their own fashion their breeches are of sealsskin and are very short above and below their stockings are made of the skin of a seals foetus taken out of the body of the dam and their shoes of smooth black dressed sealleather tied with a thong on the instep the soles of their shoes stand out bending upwards both before and behind two inches broad but they have no heels the rich natives now wear woollen stockings breeches and caps and when they make a voyage cover themselves with a black smooth sealshide by way of great coat  the dress of the women is much the same only that their jackets have higher shoulders and a higher hood and are not cut round even at the bottom like the mens but from the thigh drop in a point before and behind below the knee and are bordered with red cloth the women also wear breeches with short drawers under them they wear a kind of high shoes or boots of white or red leather the seam of which is before and ornamented mothers and nurses wear an uppergarment wide in the back with a pocket in the shoulders large enough to hold a child which is left there quite naked to tumble about and is no otherwise taken care of they are very neat and careful of their best clothes but their everyday dress drips with grease and their heads swarm with vermin natural to their filth which like beggars they are expert at catching and kill between their teeth  the men wear their hair cut short in the poll and squared off on their foreheads but as it is a reproach to a woman to cut her hair except in cases of deep mourning or when they resolve never to marry they tie it up to the top of their heads so as to ornament their crowns binding it with glass beads or some gay bandage the same kind of ornaments they wear round their arms and necks and in their ears and round the borders of their clothes and shoes but such as aim at being beautiful and want to be admired draw threads blacked with foot under the skin of their chins cheeks hands and feet which leave a black mark behind as in the face resembles a beard the greenlanders mother performs this painful operation on her girls in their infancy lest they should never get a husband the indians in north america and several tribes of the tartars do the same but the greenlanders now converted to christianity have dropped this practice as a foolish vanity and a temptation to sin  in winter they live in houses and tents in summer their houses or cottages are generally built on some eminence near the sea in order that the snow may run from them they are seldom more than about four yards broad and from   to    yards in length according to the size of the family and just high enough for a person to stand upright in they are built with stones and sods their houses have neither door nor chimney but the deficiency is supplied by a passage   or   yards long by which they can pass through the middle of the house the roof of which passage is so low that they are obliged to creep in almost on their hands and feet this long entrance keeps out the wind and cold and lets out the thick air for as they burn only oil within they have no smoke the inside of the walls are hung with old tent and boatskins and the roofs covered with the same from the middle of the house to the backwall there is a raised floor or broad bench like a taylors shopboard made with wood and covered with skins and this floor is divided by skins streched from the posts that support the roof into apartments like horsestalls in each of which a family lives so that houses contain from three to ten families some more and some less on these floors they sit in the daytime the men with their legs hanging down the women behind crosslegged like a tailor and in the night they sleep on them along the frontwall opposite to this wall are several square windows made of seals guts and halibuts maws and sewed so neat and tight as to keep out the weather and yet admit the light a bench runs along the whole length of the house under the windows where strangers sit or sleep  by every post is a fireplace a block of wood is laid upon the ground and upon that a flat stone on the stone a low threelegged stool and on that stool a lamp a foot long resembling a half moon hewn out marble it stands in an oval wooden bowl placed under the lamp to receive the waste oil in this lamp filled with sealoil they lay some moss rubbed fine which burns so bright and gives such a heat as not only lights the apartment but warms it over this lamp hangs a marble kettle by four strings fastened to the roof in which they boil their meat and over this is placed a wooden rack on which they lay their wet clothes and boots to dry  the groundplan of a greenlanders house    d the entrance ccc are the raised floors for three different families bb benches over which are the windows aaa lamps over which each family boils it is provisions now as there are many such fireplaces in one house and as they burn night and day there is an equal and lasting heat but though these lamps yield no smoke their rancid smell and the steam arising from boiling so much flesh and fish often halfrotten and add to this their urinals within the house with skins soaking in them for dressing is almost intolerable to a person unaccustomed to it but in other respects we cannot but admire their wellcontrived housekeeping comprised within so small a compass their content in this state of poverty in which they conceive themselves richer than us and their order and quiet in such a narrow and crowded spot  without these mansions they have little storehouses where they lay up their provision and close by are their boats drawn on the land and laid upon posts with their bottoms upwards to preserve them  in dressing their meat they are as dirty as in every thing else seldom washing their kettles but leaving them to the dogs to clean their boiled meat and broth they eat with bonespoons from a wooden dish but their undressed meat lies on the bare ground they eat with their fingers and tear with their teeth and when the repast is over scrape their chops with a knife lick the blades and put it in their pockets so when they are covered with sweat they make their knife perform the same office and scrape it from their faces down into their mouths when they wish to treat a european genteelly they first lick the meat he is to eat clean from the blood and scum it had contracted in the kettle with their tongue and should this not be well received it would be looked upon as rude and unmannerly  they eat when they are hungry but the eveningmeal is the chief repast when they frequently invite their neighbors or send them a part of it the men eat first by themselves and their greatest joy is to see their children stuff themselves so full as to roll about the ground to make room for more they take no thought for the morrow but when they have plenty will dance and eat to excess in hopes that the sea will afford them a fresh supply the next day but the misfortune is when march comes and the seals retire till may if bad weather ensues they must and do struggle with hunger for many days together nay so little do they provide for a future contingency that they are often reduced to the necessity of eating muscles seaweed old tentskins and shoesoles if they have but oil enough to boil them and after all many a one perishes with hunger  should their fire go out they rekindle it by turning a stick with a string very quick through a hole in a piece of wood as do the eskimaux indians  chap vii of the conduct of the greenlanders in domestic life as we neither see nor hear of any unbecoming conduct in the greenlanders they appear to lead a good orderly life single women have very seldom any bastard children we meet with such things now and then in widows and divorced wives but though they are held in contempt for such things yet such women sometimes make their fortune by selling their children to those who have none or by living as wives with men who are not married single women are very reserved seldom are seen in private conversation with the men and a young woman would think herself affronted if a young fellow in company was to offer her a pinch of snuff  a young fellow never thinks of marrying till he is turned of  0 but when he is determined in his mind he chooses one about his own age and acquaints his friends with the choice he has made marriageportions are out of the question a man seldom gets any thing with his wife but her clothes her knife her lamp or a stoneboiler his great object is her skill in housewifry and she considess little else in him than whether he is a good sealfisher  as a son has his will in every thing his parents immediately consent and two old women are dispatched to the parents of the bride as negociators the damsel on being acquainted with it affects an unwillingness will hear nothing of the matter runs away and teras her hair sometimes indeed this dissatisfaction at the news is real women have often fainted at the proposal and have eloped and cut off their hair which last is an act of great consequence for when a woman has once lost her hair she is never sought in marriage afterward this aversion to matrimony is supposed to arise from the many repudiated wives in greenland however if the brides parents do not disapprove the women search for the daughter and having sound her drag her to the house of her suitor where she sits many days dejected with dishevelled hair and without eating any thing and if no persuasions avail she is compelled to change her state by force if she runs away she is brought back and immedsately obliged to perform the contract  indeed some parents take care to settle their children and for this purpose betroth them in their childhood and in this case they come together when they please without any further ceremony sometimes a married greenlander if he sees a young woman he likes at a dance and finds her any where alone will bring her home as a second wife by force and the matter is soon after reconciled  they seldom marry a near relation or indeed any person bred up with them under the same roof but there are some instances though they are held odious in the eyes of the people of a mans marrying two sisters or a mother and her daughter  being a great reproach to have no son it leads men here occasionally into polygamy though it is not very general scarce a married man in twenty has more than one wife if a woman does not breed she is sometimes put away and this with little more ceremony than a sour look on the part of the man and packing up her clothes on that of the wife when this happens the woman returns to her own friends and in order to bring an odium upon him conducts herself with great prudence and decorum  where a wife cannot agree with other women in the same house and this often occurs as the husbands mother if he has any generally lives with him and maintains the superiority over the family she will elope of her own accord especially if she has no son for sons are the pride of a greenlanders heart his greatest treasure and best security of his property there have been instances after divorce of the husbands running into the deserts and living like a hermit many years in a cavern flying always at the sight of his fellow creatures such quarrels however happen only between persons in their younger years who have married rashly the older they grow and the longer they live together the stronger is the attachment  where a man has but one wife and she dies in a few days after he puts on his best clothes and dresses his house and children in the best manner his boat and lances his greatest parade must also be in the completest order and all to render himself amiable he abstains however from all mirthful scenes and does not marry again till a year has clapsed unless he has young children and no one to nurse them if he has more than one wife and his first wife dies the second takes her place but this second must join in the general lamentation though the voice and tears shed on this occasion betray that the heart has but little share in the distress  the women are not very prolific seldom has a wife more than three or four children and at most but six when therefore they are told of the fruitfulness of other nations they compare them to their dogs very few die in childbirth and a still born or deformed child is scarce ever heard of though the mother works just before and immediately after her delivery the child is named by the parents or the midwife after some beast animal or instrument or after some deceased relation if he or she did not come to an accidental or untimely death being unwilling to renew the pain of such a loss nay where a persons name is the same with that of a distinguished friend lately deceased they call him by some other name so that in time a greenlander may change his name several times and many a one is at a loss to make a stranger acquainted with it because he is too modest to give his new acquired name and perhaps ashamed of his former one  mothers love their children excessively and carry them with them wherever they go in the pocket of their outergarment which is made for that purpose on their back between their shoulders they suckle them till they are four or five years old for want of proper food for children of course when children are obliged to resign the breast to others they will often die and should the mother die before the child can subsist on gross food the poor infant will not long survive her  children are here brought up without any discipline or any chastisement they seem not indeed to need severity as they run about quiet as lambs and are guilty of few extravagances besides such is the nature of a greenlander that if he cannot be brought to do a thing by gentle usage no compulsion will effect it he would sooner die than be compelled the older children grow and the more their understanding opens the more governable they are parents treat them on the footing of friends and if they are desired to do any thing they dislike they immediately without any apology refuse and parents put up with this refusal till the child sees it is error but instances of ingratitude in grown up children to their aged parents is scarce ever to be met with  as soon as a boy can use his hands and feet his father puts a bow and arrow into his hand and teaches him to shoot at a target when he is  0 years old he is equipped with a boat and learns in company with other boys to row it overset and rise with it and also to fowl and to fish five or six years afterward he goes out a sealfishing and the first seal he takes is dressed as a feast to the family and neighbors where he relates his prowess with a degree of triumph and the method he made use of to catch it the guests in their turn commend him extol the flavor of the meat and from this time the women think of finding him a wife but he who cannot catch a seal is despised and obliged not only to live on womens diet such as muscles periwinkles dried herrings etc but to perform the servile offices of a woman about the house at  0 he makes his own boat and a few years after he marries but dwells with his parents whilst they live his mother retaining the management of the house  girls are but little employed till they are    years of age when they begin to sew cook and dress leather and as they advance in strength row the womens boat and build houses as it is the mans business to hunt fish and procure provisions so is it the womans to butcher and to dress it for which they use no other knife than such as cheesemongers use to cut their cheeses it is the province of the women also to curry and prepare the leather and perform the office of shoemakers and tailors carpenters and masons from their hard labor and still harder fare women seldom reach the age of  0 of course there are always more men than women  their housekeeping and manner of living seems more disorderly and dirty than that of a beggar under a hedge to see their dirty hands and face besmeared with grease their meat dressed and eaten in so nasty a manner and their clothes and sleepingplaces swarming with vermin would disgust any one but so dreadful is the climate at times that in tempestuous weather a european is glad to creep into their houses and tents for shelter and if he has nothing of his own to share their commons and give god thanks for the blessing  dirty however as they are in their persons their pacific disposition is much to be admired several families here live in one house with less disturbance often than two families in one house with us where those families are nearly related if any one conceives himself injured he only removes to another house and that without a murmur they are happy to assist each other and live in some measure in common yet without ones relying on the labor of another if a man returns home with provision in the evening he divides it with the families under the same roof with him but poor as they may be no one presumes to ask for any thing nor indeed is it necessary in a country where such hospitality is practiced  chap viii of their civil character of their civil character in common life we may say they are discreet cautious friendly mannerly and modest but they know nothing of a false shame a jealous reserve or a labored affectation they study only to conceal their wishes and inclinations they are not so much ambitious of cutting a figure in life as of avoiding public odium and rendering themthemselves ridiculous they are strangers to salutations and tokens of respect laugh at european compliments and at a mans standing uncovered in presence of his superior and yet the young have a due respect for the aged and each man a proper one for the other in company they are social and jocular and very ironical irony will often affect what severity and reasoning cannot but if they are too much exposed and ridiculed they are as mulish as a restive horse assiduous to please and cautious not to displease they study to avoid every thing that will create uneasiness should one offend another the party offended neither expostulates nor returns any bad words they have not a word in their language that expresses abuse or cursing of course they are not very quarrelsome or contentious they do not contradict or interrupt any one in his discourse but one is suffered to finish his speech before another begins when they are diverted they will laugh but never loud or boisterously they are not ashamed of what is natural and so little idea have they of the indecency of breaking wind or catching a louse and cracking it between their teeth that they will not take a reproof for it but yet in company with foreigners where they find it disagreeable they will always forbear it  when they make a visit in their boats they never fail to take some eatable with them as a present if their company is liked they are welcomed on the shore with singing and all hands are ready to draw the boat upon land and unload every one is anxious to have the guest or guests at his house but as the visitor is unwilling to have it thought that he is come abroad for what he can get he waits with silence till he is much pressed to partake of their hospitality as soon as he enters tiny kindly compel him to take off his uppergarment and lend him a dry one the men sit among the men and the women by themselves the conversation of the men runs upon the weather hunting and fishing and that of the women on the death of their relations which they close with a general howl and then proceed to divert their guests with little entertaining stories all the time the horn goes round with snuff which they draw up out of a stags horn with their noses meantime the repast is prepared  a danish factor having been invited to a respectable greenlanders told me his dinner consisted of the following dishes dried seal boiled ditto half raw and rotten ditto dried herrings boiled willocks a piece of halfrotten whales tail which is reckoned as great a delicate as a haunch of venison dried salmon dried reindeer venison a desert of crowberries mixed with chyle from the maw of a reindeer and a dish of the same enriched with trainoil  they can prolong their tabletalk for several hours which chiefly consists of the process of the men in sealcatching to which the boys hearken with the eagerest attention if europeans are present they like to hear accounts of their country and express a desire to live in such a land but they no sooner are told that it sometime thunders and there are no seals to be caught than their inclination subsides and they are happy where they are they listen with pleasure to god and divine things provided no application is made to themselves and the validity of their superstitious fables and customs is allowed  their traffic is very simple money they have none of course they barter with each other for what they want and as they are as eager for new things as children they are for ever chopping and changing and often to their disadvantage they will give the most useful article in exchange for a trifle that pleases their fancy and will reject a useful thing in exchange for a bauble if it does not please them they seldom cheat or steal from one another holding it infamous so to do but they glory in overreaching or robbing a european esteeming it a proof of superior cleverness  they keep a kind of annual fair among themselves wherever there is a meeting of the people as at a dancingmatch or a sun feast which i shall explain hereafter they always expose their wares to view and say what they want to exchange and as the people in the south have no whales and those in the north no wood the greenlanders coast the country every summer from  00 to  00 leagues with new boats and tackling exchanging them for wood horns of the unicorn ish teeth whalebone etc part of which they truck on their way back  in these voyages they take their whole family and property with them and perhaps stay some years before they return for wherever the winter overtakes them there they tarry erect a house and provide themselves food for the winter months the land and sea is every where their own and they have thus friends and acquaintance in every place  their trade with the factories is in fox and sealskins and blubber and the articles they take in exchange are ironpoints for their darts knives locksaws gimblets chissels and needles striped linen cotton kerseys woollen stockings and caps handkerchiefs boxes wooden dishes pewter plates copper kettles lookingglasses combs ribbands and toys for children they are very fond of snuff powder and shot a little tobacco which they use only as snuff they expect for every small service they do for a small quantity of tobacco they will give you a couple of handfuls of uncleansed eider down a parcel of eggs or a dish of fish and many a spendthrift will part with the clothes from his back and bring penury on his family rather than deny the cravings of his nose  the sunfeast i mentioned is not a religious ceremony but a rejoicing at the return of the sun in the winter solstice about the   d of december on this occasion they assemble all over the country in large parties and treat one another with the greatest hospitality when they have feasted till they are ready to burst they rise up to play and to dance but having nothing but water to drink they cannot intoxicate themselves the only musical instrument they have is a drum like a tambour which the drummer beats with a stick to common time skipping at every stroke he gives and making all manner of antic motions with his head and his body this music he accompanies with a song in honor of sealcatching and expresses his joy at the return of the sun it is chorussed by the auditory as follows the welcome sun returns again cho amna ajah ajah ahhu and brings us weather fine and fair cho amna ajah ajah ahhu   when one is tired another begins and thus they continue the whole night through the next day they sleep and in the evening stuff dance and sing again this festival lasts several days and nights till they are quite exhausted and have nothing to eat  they have still other amusements when the moon shines they play at ball and they have various methods of trying each others strength such as striking one another on the bare back with the fist and trying who can hold out the longest sitting down and linking legs and arms together endeavoring to outpull each other hooking their fingers together and trying their strength by drawing etc  dancing assemblies are appointed also at other seasons of the year when they abound with stores and if the weather is unfavourable to procure more at these times they traffic and truck  singing combat   but the most singular thing in greenland is their singing and dancing combats by which they decide their quarrels if a man conceives himself injured he does not vent his anger in quarrelsome words nor proceed to any revenge but composes a satirical poem this he rehearses so often with singing and dancing before his family that they all get it by heart the man publishes his design of fighting with his antagonist not with a sword but a song and a place of meeting is appointed the party challenged attends at the place encircled with his friends when the challenger begins his song to the beat of a drum and chorussed by his party with amna ajah in this song he discharges so many mortifying truths at his adversary that the standersby have their fill of laughing when he has done the accuser renews his attack and so on and he that has the last word gains his cause on these occasions they will speak cutting truths but without rudeness or passion the body of the people present constitute the jury bestow the laurel and the two contending parties become good friends  it would be happy for other nations if quarrels were terminated in the same way no one can blame this mirthful mode of putting malevolence to the blush and of punishing offenders by public defamation among a savage people without religion and without any political constitution they live as our ancestors did immediately after the flood before they learned to covet another mans property or rob their fellow creature of his honor his substance his liberty or his life a father governs his own family in the best manner he can but never presumes to command out of that circle  should there be a fire under the same roof more acquainted with the weather or a better sealcatcher than ordinary he is looked up to and attended to in other matters is allowed the best end of the house to live in generally the north end and if any refuse to obey his dictates they will not live in the same house with him another winter  families are so attached to each other that they keep together as long as they live in order to assist one another if occasion requires where a number of boats go together in company they generally follow the wisest man or the best pilot no one presumes to usurp the least authority over another nor call him to account for his private actions and as they have no overplus or riches they are never called on to contribute to the public weal  mr delager in his relation of the ways and customs of the greenlanders says the whole country stands open before them every man may go and live where he will but if he finds inhabitants already settled on the intended spot he will not land till an intimation is given him that he is welcome there hunting and fishing which is all the land affords has no gameact to restrain it but is every where free to all nor does any one think of a prosecution if a perfect stranger comes to reap in the harvest that god has given at a good fishery nay even at a salmonwier which others have erected with great trouble they are only required not to harm nor frighten the fish away should strangers act against this order the inhabitants will rather go away themselves and put up with the loss than quarrel with them whoever finds driftwood or the spoils of a shipwreck on the strand enjoys it as his own though he does not live there but he must hawl it ashore and lay a stone upon it as a token that some one has taken possession of it and this stone is their deed of security for no other greenlander will offer to meddle with it afterward if a seal escapes from a man with his javelin in it and another man afterward kills it it belongs to the first man that struck it but if the creature is struck with the harpoon and bladder and the string breaks he that threw first loses his right if two strike a seal at the same time they divide it between them fowling rules are the same if any one finds a dead seal with a harpoon in it he keeps the seal but restores the harpoon to him that lost it if they catch a seacow or any other such animal of the ocean he that cast the weapon claims the head and tail for his own but of the carcass every man may cut off as much as he can in short they have a variety of usages with respect to property among them and however absurd some of them may be yet they never like alterations and their final reason is  the custom is now so  chap ix of their moral character we wish we were able to speak decisively upon their moral character as we have done upon their civil one considering that the greenlanders act not by the light of nature or revelation it is surprising to find so many lovely and laudable qualities in them qualities that must often put christians to the blush but as they ground their good dispositions on a bad principle namely selfishness it will naturally be supposed they must frequently act in opposition to our notions of right and wrong though the natives of greenland are a savage people untaught and uncivilized they are strangers to many vices which other nations are addicted to we hear no cursing among them swearing scolding or noisy contentions no bawling loud laughter contradicting detracting or railing and though they delight in returning an unbecoming action with irony and humourous contempt yet they make use of no coarse much less immodest joke no bitter mockery no filthiness nor foolery lying cheating and stealing are seldom heard of and violent assaults or highway robberies never drunkenness is unknown in greenland as to obscenity not the least trace of it can ever be discovered either in their conversation or their conduct and in all their festive meetings to which old and young resort nothing is seen or heard that can put even modesty to the blush though their children are bred up without education they are naturally tractable and governable and give their parents very little vexation and when they arrive at the years of maturity they are so far from being disobedient ungrateful or neglectful of their aged parents that a son and his wife will often compliment an old peevish mother with the disposal of their whole property  now as the greenlanders are not influenced by laws either human or divine to what are we to attribute these specious virtues one would suppose to reason or common sense as we cannot observe in them however any reflection or consideration but that a general heedlessness is their characteristic i am inclined to think says crantz that their moral actions must proceed more from instinct than from principles and that this instinct shows itself in a quick sensibility in cases of selflove profit fear and shame  that they are as naturally prone to evil as the rest of mankind is beyond a doubt but the fear of retaliation of evil restrains them from many vices and the dread of a bad or nickname from more their social and amicable disposition and their universal hospitality does not proceed from an innate benevolence or commiseration for the helpless but from selflove and interest they give in hopes of receiving again should they stand in need of it and they are hospitable that they may be treated hospitably in return they are pretty well versed in that fashionable morality called saving appearances you will seldom find a greenlander do a good office without the mercenary view of some speedy retribution should a stranger die and leave a helpless family without a near relation to befriend them no one will take charge of that family except one who wants a maid servant but they will unfeelingly suffer the poor wretches to die with cold and hunger if persons on shore see a boat overset at sea if he is not a relation or one that has served them they will look on with indifference and see him perish but among relations there are traces of much stronger love than is to be met with m more civilized countries many a mother has thrown herself into the sea because her child was drowned so is it with irrational animals though they are insensible to the pain and pleasure of their fellow creatures their love and concern for their own young is so much the stronger  another reason to believe that the greenlanders are actuated by instinct rather than by human reason they seem likewise to have no gratitude for if a european does them a piece of service their mere thanks are all they are disposed to return should their benefactor at any time be in want of their services he would not often find it when they are dressed in their best clothes they will strut about in their finery and look down on all around them with contempt especially if they can boast of any extraordinary dexterity or have been fortunate in sealcatching if their passions which they have art enough occasionally to conceal once break out they rage with more than brutal fury what they have a mind to do must be done and nothing can persuade them against their inclinations  though as we have observed they are remarkably chaste in public they are as much the reverse in private as other nations their polygamy does not arise from a desire of population but chiefly from lust though a single woman seldom prostitutes her person married women will where they can and without a blush  their treatment of poor distressed widows is not only unjust but barbarous if the widow has no near relations she is suffered to lie on the ground with her helpless children bewailing the death of her husband almost to distraction and her visitors whilst they bear the compliments of condolence on their tongues will clandestinely strip her of her little property and the unhappy despoiled wretch having no court of judicature to lodge her complaint in is left to the disagreeable alternative of lying down to starve or ingratiating herself perhaps with him who has been her greatest plunderer he will in all likelihood keep her for a time and if she cannot get into the favor of another she is left with her children to protract life a little longer by eating fishes muscles and seagrass but having neither clothes nor lampoil must finally starve and freeze to death this probably is one reason why the greenland people annually diminish nay what is still worse if a mother dies and leaves a sucking babe that cannot yet digest gross food and there is no one to nurse it the father will frequently bury it alive with the mother he does not do this but with the most painful sensations but necessity drives him to it many an old sickly widow that has no wealthy relations to support her is also buried alive and children will tell you that she is thus relieved from a lingering death where persons have no friends at all they will leave them to die unnoticed and unburied  in criminal cases where any occur the process is still more disorderly and savage no transgressors are punished with death but murderers and persons supposed to be witches and to have bewitched others to death if the friends of the murdered man discover the murderer they will stifle their resentment till an opportunity of revenge offers which they never forget though at the distance of thirty or forty years but will when they meet the murderer alone attack him tell him the reason of their doing so stab him and throw his body into the sea  chap x of the superstition of the greenlanders to speak of the religion of the greenlanders we cannot for they have none neither are they idolaters but we may say something of their superstition of which they have a great deal they have some traditionary confused notions of the creation the flood and a future state but they are so enveloped in idle tales as to bear very little affinity to the truth some have an idea of a supreme being from a conviction that man could not be the maker of himself and such as are blessed with this notion are readily converted to christianity the moravians who have a missionary at each colony are taking great pains to inculcate among them gospel truths some of these people conceive they have two souls viz the shadow and the breath of a man and imagine that in the night when they dream the volatile shadow elopes from the body and roams about hunting dancing visiting and the like it is this sect that support a set of conjurors whom they call angekoks who pretend to have the art of repairing a maimed soul of bringing home a fugitive one and changing a sickly one for the sound one of a reindeer a hare a bird or an infant this doctrine of transmigration of souls is particularly encouraged by helpless widows who in order to allure the bounty of parents will tell a father that the soul of her deceased child is flown into his son or that the soul of his deceased son has taken up it is residence in one of her children by thus imposing on his credulity she leads him to suppose that he is related to her and of course will be her friend in future  but the most sensible geeenlanders think of the soul as we do and that it survives after death but they differ much in their opinion with respect to the place or situation of a future state some suppose it in the abysses of the ocean as they draw their best sustenance from the bosom of the sea others conceive it is in the bowels of the earth and that the caverns in the rocks are the avenues leading to it there say they dwells torngarsuk that is the good spirit and his mother the evil one there is a joyous perpetual summer a shining sun that never sets there is the fair limpid stream and a profusion of fowl fishes reindeer and seals all to be caught without toil and none are admitted there but such as are dextrous and diligent such as have mastered many whales and seals undergone great hardships have been drowned at sea or died in childbed others that are more charmed with the beauty of the heavenly bodies carry their thoughts beyond the rainbow seek their paradise in the high empyreum and conceive the flight of the soul thither to be so rapid and easy that it rests the evening it departs in the mansion of the moon who was a greenlander and dances with those sportive spirits of which they suppose the northern lights to consist  the wiser greenlanders laugh at all this and say if there is such a luxurious paradise where the souls of men shall be entertained with hunting it can only endure for a time that they will afterward be conveyed to more peaceful mansions of whose nature they have no conception they believe also in a hell and suppose it to be some subterraneous region without light or heat and filled with terror and anxiety from these ideas such people lead a regular life and refrain from evil through a principle of hope and fear  these notions must have arisen from the truths of the patriarchal religion handed down to posterity by tradition but veiled and blended with new additions according to the distance of time from the days of noah when we come to treat of the more northerly american indians and the asiatic tartars between whom and the greenlanders there is a pretty great resemblance in their notions morals and manners and of whom we conceive the greelanders to be a branch we shall see that the further the savage nations wandered toward the north the fewer of their ancient conceptions and customs tliey retained if the present natives of greenland are thought to be a remnant of the old norway christians which is not impossible they may have derived their notions from them  besides the soul of man the greenlanders conceive there are superior and inferior spirits of the first that there are two only one good and one bad torngarsuk is their good spirit and him whom the angekoks or conjurors consult the bad spirit is a female some think torngarsuks wife and some his mother who dwells under the sea in a great mansion where she can detain all the animals of the ocean by her magic power  these angekoks or soothsayers have been in great repute among the greenlanders and men have had recourse to a variety of arts tricks and deceptions to gain the credit of a magician but when that credit is once obtained they are applied to by all the credulous to learn whether they shall have a good or bad fishery which these people are able to judge of from the weather and to know how to act when they are sick and so on sensible men under the denomination of angekoks may do some good but there are many old hags who take up this profession and who have no other means of gaining a livelihood the missionaties however have of late so exposed their arts and roguery that they begin to grow into disrepute and christianity gains ground daily  chap xi of their knowledge the reader may probably wish to be made acquainted with the degree of knowledge the greenlanders in general possess  this is very little their language which is gutteral and rather unpleasant to the ear may claim some kindred with the norwegian tongue relics perhaps of the old norwegians it has no affinity with any of the northern tartarean or indian languages except that of the esquimaux in terra labrador who seem to be one people with the greenlanders their words are varied and declined and of course their language is not near so raw and incomplete as might be expected from so unrefined a people the following is a specimen of part of the apostles creed  credo ego jesum christum in dei filium unicum ejus in operpunga jesus christusmut gum ernetuanut  dominuin meum in a spiritu sancto cum esset conceptus nalegautinut annernerub ajunginnerub pimmago  virgin maria a natus est pontio niviarsiamit mariamit erniersok pontius pilato gubernante passus est etc pilatus nalegautillugo anniartitok etc  they are tolerably well versed in genealogy and can trace their pedigree back as far as ten generations with all the collateral branches which is of great service to a needy person for no one is ashamed of his poor relations and if any one in distress can make it appear that he is any way related to a wealthy greenlander he will not want for support  of writing they have no conception nor can they count more than twenty they contrive however to reckon their years by winters and their days by nights but when they get beyond twenty they leave off counting  they have a very imperfect knowledge of astronomy conceiving the firmament to rest on a lofty pointed hill in the north and performing it is revolutions on that center the celestial bodies they tell you were once greenlanders or animals transported there by some peculiar fatality and that the planets in their conjunctions are two females wrangling together shooting stars they say are souls going from heaven to make a visit to hell and they have other absurd stories to tell respecting most of the stars and planets  in physic they have methods of curing themselves when sick and in surgery of bleeding setting a fracture and couching an eye  should all their remedies fail and a greenlander be on the point of death they dress him in his best clothes and boots and bind his legs up to his hips that his grave may be the shorter when dead they carry every thing within the house into the air that the smell of the corpse may go off they then silently bemoan him for about an hour and proceed to bury him which is done usually in some high remote place the nearest relation carrying the body on his back which sewed up in a skin is laid on some moss or on a skin on the ground for dig they cannot in a rock and heaped round and covered with great broad stones to keep it from the birds and foxes near the spot they deposit the boat and tools of the deceased which he daily used and if a woman her knife and sewing implements after the interment those who attended the procession retire to the house of mourning the men sit awhile leaning with their elbows on their knees and their heads between their hands and the women lying prostrate with their faces on the ground softly weeping and sobbing at last the father son or nearest relation repeats a funeral discourse or elegy in praise of the deceased and at every period his death is lamented with loud crying and weeping the following is the lamentation of a father over his son taken from mr dellagers account  woe is me that i see thy wonted seat but see it empty vain are thy mothers toils of love to dry thy garments lo my joy is gone into darkness it is crept into the caverns of the mountains once when the even came i went out and was glad i stretechd out my eager eye and waited thy return behold thou came thou came manfully rowing on vying with old and young never did thou return empty from the sea thy kajak brought it is neverfailing load of seals or seafowl thy mother she kindled the fire and boiled she boiled what thy hand acquired thy mother she spread thy booty before many invited guests and i took my portion among them thou espyest the shallops scarlet streamer from afar and joyfully shoutedst  behold the factor comes thou skippedst over the strand with haste and thy hand took hold of the gunnel of the shallop then were thy seals produced and thy mother separated the blubber for this thou receivest shirts of linen and iron barbs for thy spears and arrows but now alas it is over when i think on thee my bowels are moved within me oh could i weep like others for then might i alleviate my pain what shall i wish for more on earth death is now become the most desirable thing but then who shall provide for my wife and the rest of my tender children i will still live a little while but however my joy shall consist in a perpetual abstinence from all that is eligible to man etc  the ditty ended the women continue their howl in one tremulous tone the men only sobbing at last the victuals left by the deceased are spread on the floor before the mourners who eat heartily and never fail to repeat their visits daily whilst there is any thing left to eat which may be a week or a fortnight all condoling visitors afterward are received by the mistress of the house with a him that you seek you will find no more alas ye come too late and this accompanied with a howl where the father of a family dies those who come to condole with the widow which they continue doing ten or twelve months till she goes abroad endeavor to take something away with them at every visit either secretly or openly if the next of kin has not influence to prevent it till she is at last stripped so bare that many a poor woman with her children dies of hunger and cold  chap xii some further account of the greenlanders the foregoing accounts having been collected from the writings of those who were eyewitnesses to what they told and as they relate to the inhabitants on the western coast of greenland i will close this description with some further account of the inhabitants on the eastern side collected from the mouths of greenlanders themselves as set forth in crantzs history of that country it is a kind of journal told by a native who came among others to visit at one of the danish colonies in       one of these travelers who after he comes to onartok has five days journey to his own house and consequently lives  0 leagues up on the east side from latitude    told us that he lodged two men last winter who said that they and a third had made a three years excursion on the east side in their womensboats he could not tell us the native place or habitation of these strangers only that it was very far distant from him northeastward according to their account they tarried the first winter by the way the second year they proceeded as far as the ice would permit them and the third year they returned they had been so high on the eastern coast that the sun did not quite set in summer but illuminated the mountains even at midnight which agrees with the   th degrees in their way they were obliged at times to draw their tent and boat across the ice upon a sledge by dogs they always kept under the coast and never put far off to sea on account of the ice though there was plenty of ice all under the land but it is there sooner dissolved by the sun and carried away by the current than off at sea they gave us to understand that the people on the east side are bigger than those on the west that they have black hair great beards and look brown like the rest of the greenlanders that their dialect was nearly like their own but with a kind of singing tone that they had neither trees nor grass reindeer nor hares because they did not touch on the mainland but continued upon the islands but that they had seen many seals whales redfish soles eiderfowls partridges and foxes which constituted the food of the inhabitants whom they reported as numerous and friendly that they discovered a fine inlet and wished to go up it but were afraid of the canibals or meneaters said to dwell in those parts it is supposed there are or were such a class of savages for all greenlanders have a dread of them according to the opinion of this traveller necessity first led them to this inhuman practice being once reduced by a famine and a severe winter and from relishing human flesh they had accustomed themselves to eat their dead by laying them in a pit with other meat and eating it raw when half rotten and frozen even in time of dearth unwilling to slaughter middleaged persons they put to death old people and forsaken orphans and will at such time spare their dogs in preference on account of their usefulness they build their houses of stone like the western greenlanders and lay wooden rafters on the walls though wood there is very scarce they dress like other natives though their clothes are not so well made having no iron needles they had never seen a ship and had no boat with sails in other respects their kajaks and womens boats were like those in other parts he knew nothing of their religious notions only that they had angekoks or conjurers there also  a certain factor says crantz also gave me the following intelligence in the year      a man from the south wintered with us and told us that he had learned from some greenlanders who came from the eastern side that there were people inhabiting a certain inlet between the mountains who came down to the seacoast every spring in great numbers that the greenlanders of those parts fled always at their approach to the neighboring islands that those who followed them could not get at them for want of boats but shot after them with arrows which they carried on their backs in quivers and that these men having plundered and destroyed their houses retired into the mountains with the spoils  if these reports can be relied on it is probable that the abovementioned canibals and these men are one and the same people who descended from the old norwegians may have sheltered themselves from the savages in the neighboring mountains continued their enmity out of revenge for the murder of their ancestors ravaged them in the spring when provisions failed them and were considered by the savages through excess of fear as no other than canibals indeed the women in the west often tattle to their children of mountainspirits some sixteen feet high some scarce a foot in height from whom the europeans learned their arts and about a people on the easterncoast who were maneaters and had a face like a dog  some account of the northern parts of america round hudsonsbay the coast of labrador and the country of the eskimaux indians by capt ellis who visited that part of the world in      and      in our account of greenland we acquainted our readers that it is supposed to join on the north of baffinsbay with the continent of america for that the upper part of this bay is so narrow that the inhabitants on either side are able to call over to each other whether this be the fact or not is not yet ascertained but it evidently appears from the persons and customs of the natives on both sides that they are of one and the same origin the greenlanders therefore if the two countries do not join must have traveled across the ice and settled in those northern parts under this idea we cannot do better than give some account of this country here the natives of the coast of labrador and further north distinguished by the name of eskimaux being different from the indians of america more to the southward  the labrador coast and the parts of which we are now going to treat are situated round hudsons bay between the latitudes of    and  0 degrees captain ellis who sailed in      in search of a northwest passage from hudsonsbay to the great western ocean wintered in a creek of this bay near nelsonsriver in latitude   degrees  0 m he found the country covered with large woods chiefly spruce fir poplar birch larch willow etc and abounding with deer hares rabbits geese ducks partridges pheasants plovers swans and many other sowl in their proper season as also fish in great plenty and in as great variety  but the exceeding high mountains toward the north continually covered with snow and the winds blowing from thence full three months of the year occasion a degree of cold over all this country not felt in any other part of the world in the same latitude on the  d of november says he we could not keep the ink from freezing at the fire our bottled beer froze solid though packed up in tow and near a good fire when the wind was westerly or southerly the cold was very supportable but as it changed to the northwest or north it became immediately excessively keen and often attended with a sort of snow no larger than so many grains of sand which drifted with the wind in clouds from every plain or flat place that lay exposed to it so as in a very little time to obliterate every track and occasion people out in it to lose their way and often their lives nature furnishes every animal here with extraordinary furs to resist the cold that gradually falls off as the warm weather returns as in all the extremities of the body the circulation of the blood is naturally slower being further from the heart the spring of it is motion it follows that the feet and tails of animals are soonest apt to freeze to remedy this inconvenience providence has ordained that the animals of this country should have legs and tails shorter than those of other countries the cold captain ellis observes was so intense the winter he was there that if any of his people touched iron or any other smooth solid substance their fingers stuck to it in drinking a glass of brandy if their lips or tongue touched the glass they left part of their skin behind freezing to the glass an odd instance of this sort happened to one of his men who was carrying a bottle of spirits from the house to his tent for not having a cork to stop the bottle he made use of his finger which soon froze so fast in the neck that he was obliged to lose part of it to make a cure practicable they dug a hole twelve feet deep to stow their liquor in and found the ground very hard frozen even at that depth from this severity of the weather in the winterseason it is natural to conclude that the inhabitants must be most uncomfortable and unhappy but this is by no means the case for they have abundance of beaverskins to cloth them and many other conveniences which put them in some measure on a level with those who live in a milder climate  to say however that they are not subject to greater hardships than europeans would be idle their condition is melancholy enough though it does not make such an impression upon them as one would expect as they have no idea of frugality and make no provision against times of scarcity it sometimes happens that the indians who come in the summer to trade at the new factories missing of the succors they expected have been obliged to singe off the hair from thousands of beaverskins in order to feed upon the leather but the greatest hardships to which they are exposed is in their journies for it is a thing common with them to travel two or three hundred miles even in the depth of winter through a wide open country without meeting with any house to receive or carrying any tent to protect them in such journies it is their custom when night approaches to raise a little kind of sense with brushwood to the leeward of which they make a fire and after clearing away the snow they lie down upon the ground and sleep between the fire and the fence but if as it sometimes falls out they happen to be benighted upon some wild plain where no such sense can be made for want of wood they are then forced to lie down under the snow which proves some defense from the cold and which is a thing practiced in the extremities of siberia where the climate is not at all more temperate  the native indians of this part are of a middle size coppercolour with black eyes and long lank black hair they are of a cheerful disposition goodnatured affable friendly and honest in their dealings they live in tents covered with moose and deerskins sewed together and as their time is spent chiefly in hunting fishing and fowling they change their habitations according to the plenty or scarcity of game  they do not live in any great numbers together for the same reason because it would be more difficult to provide necessaries to feed and to clothe them of course they have no body of laws to regulate their conduct but are influenced in their behavior by a natural rectitude of disposition that restrains them from acts of violence and injustice the chiefs in every family or tribe who are generally chosen from among the most ancient of the people but chiefly for their skill in hunting and experience in trade domestic affairs or valor in war which they often wage with the eskimaux and of whom we shall speak hereafter direct those who reside with them in their different employments of hunting fishing fowling etc yet their advice is followed rather through deference than obligation for in point of exemption from power they may be truly called a free people  the clothing of the men here in summer is a loose coat made of blanket which they buy either from the french or english here settled a pair of leather stockings which come so high as to serve for breeches and shoes of the same materials the womens dress is the same except that in winter they generally wear a petticoat that reaches a little below the knee their ordinary apparel is made of the skin of deer otter or beaver with the hair or fur on the sleeves of their upperhabit are frequently separate from the body of it and taken off at pleasure being only tied with strings at the shoulders so that their armpits even in the depth of winter are exposed to the cold which they conceive contributes to their health they have but few disorders and these chiefly arise from colds taken after drinking spirituous liquors which they buy from the english contrary to the wiser maxims of the french who sell them none and of course keep them better in health and more capable of trafficking  they are pretty much subject to some disorders in the breast but to no contagious diseases whenever they find themselves indisposed they drink an infusion of the herb called wizzekapukka something like rhubarb fishbroth which they call shaggamitie or else sweat themselves in their tents and in the midst of a profuse sweat plunge themselves into cold water or roll themselves in the snow for the cholick they swallow a great quantity of tobaccosmoke and if their head is disordered force it out at their nostrils in the spring of the year they will frequently become snow blind when a film grows over the eye this they are ingenious enough to cut away with the sharp point of a gunflint  in their drunken fits they will often commit excessive disorders such as quarrelling burning their tents and abusing their wives but when they are sober they are very courteous and compassionate their affection for their children is singularly great the following is a remarkable instance of it which happened at yorkfort two small canoes passing a river when they had got to the middle of it one of them which was made of the bark of a birchtree sunk in which was an indian his wife and their child the other canoe being small and incapable of receiving more than one of the parents and the child produced a very extraordinary contest between the man and his wife not that both of them were willing to devote themselves to save the other but the difficulty lay which would be the greatest loss to the child the man used many arguments to prove it more reasonable that he should be drowned than the woman but she alleged on the contrary it was more for the advantage of the child that she should perish because he as a man was better able to hunt and consequently to provide for it the little time there was still remaining was spent in mutual expressions of tenderness the woman strongly recommending eskimaux as for the last time to her husband the care of her child this being done they took leave in the water the woman quitting the canoe was drowned and the man with the child got safe ashore  it is looked upon among them as a great offense for the women to stride over the legs of the men when they sit on the ground and they think it even beneath them to drink out of the same vessel with their wives one custom they have which is very extraordinary that when their parents grow so old as to be incapable to support themselves by their own labor they require their children to strangle them and this is esteemed an act of obedience in their children to perform  the manner of discharging this last duty is thus the grave of the old person being dug he goes into it and after having conversed and smoked a pipe or perhaps drank a dram or two with his children the old person signifies he is ready upon which two of the children put a thong about his neck one standing on one side and the other opposite to him and pull violently till he is strangled then cover him with earth and over this erect a kind of rough monument with stones such old persons as have no children request this office of their friends but it is not often complied with  their religious sentiments captain ellis knew little of all he could gather was that their notions were very limited and imperfect they acknowledge a being of infinite goodness whom they style ukkewma or greatchief they look upon him as the author of all the benefits they enjoy and speak of him with reverence they likewise sing a kind of hymn in his praise in a grave solemn tune not altogether disagreeable they also acknowledge another being as the instrument of all kinds of mischief and evil whom they call wittikka and of him they are very much afraid  the language these people speak is somewhat gutteral in the pronunciation but not harsh or unpleasant they have but few words and those are very significant  they have a very strong maxim of policy that of suffering or rather obliging their women to procure frequent abortions by the use of a certain herb that they may in some measure be eased of that heavy burden they feel in providing for a helpless family something of this sort was practiced by the natives of formosa when the dutch became masters of it they differ also from almost all other nations in another particular which is their manner of making water for here the men always squat down and the women stand upright we have already mentioned their animals but there is one thing we must not omit that here as in all other snowy regions to protect them from their enemies they become white in winter when every thing animate and inanimate is of the same color and what is yet more surprising is that dogs and cats which have been carried from england to hudsonsbay have on the approach of winter changed their appearance and acquired a much longer softer and thicker coat of hair than they originally had the dogs of this country are as large as our mastiffs they never bark but growl when provoked the indians use their dogs as beasts of burden for they have no other  to pass over the english hudsonsbay company when we are treating of this country would be wrong this bay is a vast sea upwards of  00 leagues from north to south and  00 leagues from east to west with a narrow passage into it like the mediterranean the company which consists of about nine persons and who have an exclusive trade in this bay were chartered in    0 they have four forts on the banks of it viz churchill nelson newsevern and albany which stand on the west side and are garrisoned by     men they employ four ships and   0 seamen export commodities to the value of l   000 yearly and bring home returns to the amount of l     0 which yield to the revenue l      this includes the fishery there small as this commerce is it affords immense profits to the company and some advantages to great britain for what we send there are the worst of our manufactories and the skins and furs that are brought home enable us to trade with many european nations to great advantage  within land there are large plains in this country but little herbage on them except moss there are great variety of shrubs and many of those known in europe as the gooseberry current and cranberry also a shrub bearing a black berry called partridgeberry on which the partridges which here are as large as hens feed there are such quantities of partridges and hares in this country that there have been taken in one season at port nelson  0000 partridges and   000 hares  there are here unquestionably abundance of minerals of different sorts iron lead and copper there are likewise a great variety of marble talks spars and rockcrystals of different colors in the northern part there is a substance that burns and resembles coal the asbestos or stoneflax is common here and a stone of a black smooth and shining surface that separates easily in thin transparent leaves resembling the muscovy talk which the natives use as lookingglasses  the air of this country is seldom if ever clear in the spring and fall they have heavy wet fogs and in the winter the air is full of an infinite number of icy spiculoe that are visible to the naked eye for as there arises at this time of the year a very thick vapor called frostsmoke this vapor freezing is driven by the wind in the form of spiculae  mock suns and haloes about the moon and sun very luminous and beautifully tinged with all the various colors of the rainbow are here common i have seen says capt ellis six of these mock suns at one time the true sun rises and sets with a large cone of yellow light perpendicular to it and no sooner does it disappear than the aurora borealis spreads a thousand different lights and colors over the whole concave of the sky with so resplendent a beauty that even the full moon does not efface their luster but if the moon does not shine these lights are much more apparent and one may read distinctly by them the stars seem in this country to burn with a fiery redness especially those near the horizon which strongly resemble a fire or ships light at a distance  thunder and lightning are not very frequent in summer though that season for about six weeks or two months is very warm but when it does happen it is terrible  the eskimaux indians on the northwest of hudsons bay are of a middlesize robust and inclinable to fat their heads are large their faces round and flat eyes small and sparkling flat noses big lips black and lank hair broad shoulders but feet uncommonly small in short they are so like the greenlanders that they are thought to have originated from the same stock the customs and manners of the two nations are nearly the same they have the same canoes kill seals and whales in the same manner and dress nearly alike only that the eskimaux both men and women wear large loose boots the boots of the women about the straits of hudsonsbay reach up almost to their waist and are made to project from the thigh with whalebone for the convenience of carrying their children in them whereas the women more to the southward carry them as do the greenlanders in their hood on their backs the eskimaux indians on the coast of labrador wear a cap made of the skin of a buffalos tail the hair of which hangs over their eyes to keep off the musketoes this somewhat obstructs their sight yet it is easily removed with their hands the children even wear them whilst they hang at their mothers backs  when they go to sea in order to catch fish they commonly carry with them a bladder full of trainoil as our people do a drambottle and seem to drink the contents with the same relish they have a very dextrous method of kindling fire to do this they prepare two small pieces of dry wood which having made flat they make a small hole in each and having fitted into these holes a little cylindrical piece of wood to which a thong is fastened they whirl it about with such velocity that the motion soon sets them on fire and then by applying the lighted piece of wood to some dry moss as we use tinder they make as great a fire as they please  though these people are ingenious they are very simple and it may amuse the reader to give him an instance of their simplicity as related by captain ellis these poor creatures says he were so far from being jealous of their wives that they would willingly have prostituted them to us from a notion that our children by them would have been in every respect as much superior to their nation as they took us to be for they conceived that in the most literal sense every man begets his like and that the son of a captain must be a captain and so of the rest  great as the hardships are which result from the rigor of the cold yet it may be justly affirmed that they are much inferior to those which they feel from the scarcity of provisions and the difficulty they are under in procuring them a story which is related at the factories and known to be true will sufficiently prove this and give the compassionate reader a just idea of the miseries to which these unhappy people are sometimes exposed an indian with his family coming down to trade from a place at a very great distance had the misfortune to meet with but very little game by the way so that in a short time himself his wife and his children were reduced to the last distress in these circumstances they plucked the fur from their clothes and preserved life as long as they were able by feeding on the skins they wore but even this wretched resource soon failed them and then what is terrible to conceive and horrible to relate these poor creatures sustained themselves by feeding on the flesh of two of their children on their arrival at the factory the distracted indian whose heart overflowed with grief told this melancoly affair to the english governor with all it is affecting circumstances and it was received with a loud laugh the poor savage with a look of amazement said in his broken english this is no laughing talk and went his way no doubt highly edified with such christian morality  a a description of iceland from the danish original of n horrebow who resided there two years von troil and others chap i of the country in general iceland is an island in the northseas between greenland and norway not farther than  0 miles distant from the eastern coast of greenland it lies between the latitudes of    and    degrees bessested the chief place lies in    degrees   m north latitude and    degrees west from the meridian of london that is   degrees farther eastward than it has been hitherto described it is extent has not been accurately ascertained but horrebow computes it to be about  00 english miles from east to west and about   0 english miles from north to south von troil computes it is length about   0 british seamiles and   0 in breadth however it is justly classed among the largest islands in the known world and is but little inferior in magnitude to the island of great britain  the country does not afford a pleasing view to the eye of a traveller for it is uneven covered with rocks and rugged mountains and continually clothed with ice and snow with barren fields between them destitute of wood and encrusted with lava for many miles  it is crossed in several directions by innumerable ridges of lofty mountains highest in the center so as to divide it into four quarters and these mountains with the rocks resemble those in norway and a great part of italy the whole island seems to have been laid waste by it is volcanoes some few islands lying off the coast are very fertile and bear good grass but they are not inhabited indeed iceland itself has but few inhabitants there being neither towns or villages in any part of it unless a few scattered houses can be called a village farms indeed of some magnitude are met with throughout the whole interior part except where the mountains interpose and round each farmhouse are a few straggling cottages the dwellings of the tenants who procure from the proprietor a house and as much pastureland as will keep them two or three horses and cows these farms belong either to the king of denmark the church or the peasants themselves and of these farms of which there are  0   throughout out the island     belonging to the king     to the two bishops of skallholt and hoolum there residing   0 to the clergy  0 to the poor and the rest to the farmers themselves the value of a farm that will keep  0 horses  0 cows and  00 sheep is about   0 rixdollars each dollar   s   d english  in the interior parts are very extensive heaths and plains bounded by mountains the greatest part of which are not so difficult to pass as the alps and pyrenees but have roads over them where some hundreds of horses and men pass every year the people of the north travel across the large chain of rocks that run along the country and fetch their winterstock of dried fish from the south and west on the top of some of these mountains are plains of the extent of  0 or    miles and in several parts of the island are lakes abounding with a variety of fine fish  to be sensible of the dreadful effects of volcanoes in this island the country itself need only to be considered the mountains are almost wholly composed of lava and the plains are crusted over with the same but covered in many spots with earth and turf large tracts of land have been laid waste by their irruptions and their ashes have frequently buried the fields half a yard deep and  0 or  0 miles in extent in         farms were consumed and  0 in      mount heckla which is a volcano more tremendous than vesuvius destroyed two farms in      seven in    0 and eighteen in one day in       mount heckla the largest vulcano in iceland is seen by all the ships sailing to greenland and north america it is situated it the south part of the island about four miles from the seacoast and is divided into three points at the top the highest of which is in the middle and is according to exact observation more than five thousand feet above the level of the sea sir joseph banks dr solander and dr von troil ascended it in september      they rode on horseback to the first opening from which the fire had burst which say they is a place surrounded with glazed walls add vitrified cliffs that they knew not how to describe a little higher up they found a great quantity of grit and stones and still farther on another opening not very deep but where they observed evident marks of hot boiling water as they ascended higher the mountain was covered with snow and about  00 yards below the summit they discovered a hole of about four feet and a half diameter from which so hot a steam exhaled that they could not ascertain the degree of heat by a thermometer they had with them  when they reached the summit which they did by climbing they found a space of ground eight yards in breadth and twenty long free from snow the sand however was wet as if the snow had just melted away at this place fahrenheits thermometer when held in the air stood at    but when set on the ground it rose to     the barometer was here at       and the thermometer at    it emitted some flames in the very month they visited it but sent forth no lava  anderson in his account of iceland tells us that about three english miles from heckla there is a small fresh water lake always warm but rather hotter in the winter and according to accounts of people in the neighborhood endowed with the peculiar property of taking fire three times a year and burning for about a fortnight in small bright flames but as neither horrebow nor von troil who were both in this neighborhood have mentioned this it is to be doubted certain it is that the country abounds with hot spouting watersprings which we shall presently speak of and from a variety of mountains whose tops are covered with snow flames of fire will often gush out from some of the mountains also flow large and small rivers which water the country below and yield very fine fish  hot springs are found in many parts of iceland from some the water flows gently as from other springs and it is then called laug that is a bath from others it spouts boilingwater with a great noise and is then called buer or kittel kettle i have visited says horrebow many of these warm baths but never found the least appearance of sulphur near them though von troil says he tasted sulphur in them nor do the waters taste of any mineral though the degree of heat in these springs is unequal i do not remember says von troil ever to have observed it under     of fahrenheits thermometer in some places we found it     at another where the most remarkable boiling fountain is     degrees if you fill a bottle at one of these spouting springs says horrebow the water contained in the bottle will boil up two or three times at the same time with the water in the well and if the bottles are corked up as soon as filled they will burst this water when cold is pleasant to drink and cows that drink of it yield a greater proportion of milk the inhabitants use these waters for various purposes some use it for dying others boil their meat in in by putting the meat in a vessel of cold water and setting it in the hot spring others bend hoops of great thickness with it and others bathe in it and wash with it  among the many hot springs in iceland is one worth the attention of the curious and we have given a plate the better to describe it it is about two days journey from heckla and makes its appearance in a large field where on one side the eye is awfully surprised with high mountains seen at a great distance covered with ice whose summits are lost in the clouds so that their sharp unequal points become invisible sometimes by particular winds the clouds shall sink and enwrap geyser the mountains leaving their summits only to view appearing as it were to rest upon the clouds on the other side the sight is dreadful awakened by the volcano heckla with its three points covered with ice rising above the clouds and with the smoke ascending from it forming other clouds at some distance from the real ones in one place is a ridge of high rocks at the foot of which boiling water gushes forth and further on a marsh extends about half a mile in circumference where are  0 or  0 boiling springs from which a vapor ascends to a prodigious height and from some water four or five feet in height  in the midst of these spouts an enormous fountain of boiling water rises by starts at certain intervals from  0 to  0 feet in height attended with a stupendous roar the depth of the opening from whence this water issues could not be ascertained for sometimes the water sunk down several fathoms and some seconds passed before a stone that was thrown in reached the surface the opening itself is perfectly round    feet in diameter and forming above on the surface of the ground a basin    feet in diameter whose edge is nine feet above the orifice or hole  the strength of the vapor that throws up this water is excessive it not only prevents the stones thrown in from sinking but even casts them up with the water to a very height  basaltine pillars like the giantscauseway in ireland are very common in iceland supposed to have been produced by subterranean fires in some places they extend two or three miles in length without interruption  some have been of opinion that the whole island was at once produced by fire but this may be a rash conjecture it has rather been the work of some centuries by several cliffs and rocks being produced at different times whose points have been connected by new eruptions and which have formed the basis of the whole island it is certain that earthquakes here are very frequent before the volcanos break forth in september      fifteen violent shocks were felt within a few days and it is not uncommon to see whole farms overturned by them and large mountains burst asunder but by no means does such direful destruction ensue as from earthquakes in other countries  chap ii on the climate after all iceland is a healthy country to live in the usual heat is not extreme nor the cold in general very severe the air and weather says horrebow will agree better with a stranger than the air and weather would with an icelander in denmark it is much such a climate as that of denmark with this difference that the windy and stormy weather in iceland is more frequent in very cold seasons the mercury in the barometer has been    degrees below the freezing point and at other times it has risen to  0  degrees  thunder and lightning here are very rare and met with only in the neighborhood of volcanoes of which there are about twenty in the island northernlights are uncommonly strong tinged with yellow green and purple and vapors of the ignisfatuus kind are often seen attaching themselves to men and beasts  the icelanders reckon their summer from the middle of april to the middle of october and the rest of the year with them is winter no spring or autumn but it snows and hails sometimes in summer as it does in denmark and what is remarkable a north wind seldom brings frost  it never freezes to such a degree in iceland as to cover the sea about the shores with ice the only ice that incommodes and hinders the inhabitants from putting out to sea is in the north and is that which comes floating from greenland sometimes spreading itself many miles about the northern coast and sometimes filling the eye with appearances of mountains and dales and animals running up and down them  chap iii on the productions where volcanoes or burning mountains are there pumicestone is generally found of course there is plenty in iceland it also abounds with ores iron copper and silver but they are never sought after the mountains contain rosin pitch and other bituminous matter sulphur is never found above ground but there is plenty beneath the surface about three feet under ground in many places ten tons weight may be collected in an hours time on account of the heat of the ground under which it lies the laborers dig for it in the summernights and tie woollen rags about their shoes to keep them from burning when the brimstone is first taken out it is so hot that it scarcely can be handled if they clear out a vein of sulphur it will fill again in two or three years so surprising is its vegetation there are also many saltsprings in this island  forests and wood are very scarce in this country but it is not without trees most farms have small nurseries adjoining but they do not grow to any size want of wood is however compensated by the great quantites of fine large timber that every year comes floating ashore of this they have more than they know how to dispose of but they have no such thing as a fir pine or other trees growing there they have some small birch and shrubs such as juniper and blackberry of which they make charcoal for their forges in several places roots of trees have been found in the ground which leads us to suppose woods have stood where now not a tree is seen  a very extraordinary sort of wood is also met with which they call sortebrand or black brand it is hard heavy and black like ebony generally found deep under ground in long broad thin leaves fit to make tables keeps well in water and never rots but no sooner is it exposed to the air than it drops asunder into pieces the smiths burn it as charcoal  all over the island are seen spacious tracts of good pasture for cattle where they will grow exceedingly fat every farm has a meadow or piece of ground which they call tun it is watched by dogs that no cattle may come near it being manured in the best manner they can for hay  all kinds of things may be produced here proper for a kitchen garden for they have a great deal of good ground and for the two winters says horrebow i staid in iceland the weather in the south part of the country was not severer than at copenhagen they have some piercing northwinds but nothing to obstruct vegetation in the year      when i came to bessested i found the kings garden in excellent order full of all kinds of vegetables such as parsley cellery thyme marjorum cabbage parsneps carrots turnips peace beans and all sorts of greens wanted in a family and of good growth and excellent flavor they have also fine gooseberrytrees and were other fruit trees planted there is no doubt but they would bear fine fruit the greatest difficulty is to get the trees over at a proper season for planting ships do not leave denmark for this place till may and then all fruit trees are in blossom that the fruits of the earth are not equally fine in all parts of iceland is not owing to the soil or air but the ignorance of the people it being said there are not  0 gardens in the whole country  now ground that will produce gardenfruit will produce corn and formerly farmers sowed it for their own use but none is grown now there is a prospect however of recovering this husbandry for the king of denmark has sent able husbandmen to introduce it and instruct the inhabitants in managing and cultivating their land their summers are not long but their vegetation is quick grass will run up two feet high in    or    days and as in lapland where it is much colder they sow reap and gather in their harvest in the space of six or seven weeks they would certainly do the same here  there is a weed or vegetable that grows in the sea which the icelanders call sol and the cattle are very fond of and thrive well on it even the people eat it coral is also found in the sea and a coralfishery might be here established with success and profit  chap iv of animals of wild fourfooted animals there are but two sorts bears and foxes bears are not natives of this island but come annually from greenland on the floating ice but the people give them a very unwelcome reception no sooner is a bear seen on the land or his track noticed but they pursue him nor do they quit their pursuit till they have found and destroyed him they use spears upon this occasion and though a bear will turn upon his pursuer yet by throwing a glove in his way they will soon be able to dispatch him for he will not stir till he has turned even every finger of it inside out and as he is not very dextrous with his paws this takes him some time and gives his pursuer either time to escape or an opportunity of killing him besides government gives a reward of  0 dollars for every bear that is killed and purchases the hide of the killer  of wild foxes there are great plenty generally of a darkred color but some few black some white and others gray these the icelanders take some pains to destroy by gins and traps as government in order to root them out gives a rixdollar for every  0 skins sold to a merchant  of tame animals they have horses oxen cows sheep goats and hogs their horses are properly of the norwegian breed strong lively brisk and tame to admiration they have some wild horses on the mountains very wild indeed that will fly at the people when they offer to catch them but when tamed no animals are more gentle  the cattle both cows and bullocks are not very large but very fat and fine there are as many here without horns as with cows yield a great deal of milk some will give  0 quarts a day but others not more than  0 sheep as well as saddlehorses are kept in stables in the winter when farmers keep their cows in their yards and feed them with hay in proportion to their stock when hay is scarce they use their cows to eat fishbones boiled soft and drink the water they are boiled in which they not only like but thrive on it is common to meet with oxen running wild about the mountains which however are brought home in autumn as every one knows his own by a peculiar mark  the customary price of a cow is about   0 else of wadmel a kind of baize by which every article is valued and sold thirty of these else are valued at   s   d english so that a cow is worth     but there is no breed of cattle so much attended to in iceland as their sheep and there are many peasants who have from two to four hundred the sheep differ from ours in several particulars they have strait ears standing upright a small tail and four or five horns every farmer is provided with stables and folds sufficient for a flock of sheep where they are sheltered in the winter and fed on hay in stormy tempestuous weather when the sheep are out they will hide themselves in caves and holes in the mountains but when they cannot find any retreat during a heavy fall of snow they gather together in a heap with their heads in the middle and bent toward the ground so that if they are buried in the snow the owner knows where to find them at which time they will eat the wool from each others backs in a storm of wind in summertime whole flocks have been carried away  0 or  0 english miles and often driven into the sea where they have perished  good sheep give from two to six quarts of milk a day of which as well as cows milk butter and cheese is made but the principal profit they derive from their sheep is wool they do not sheer it as we do but about the end of may when it gets loose strip it off at once like a skin the outer wool is something like camels hair but more shaggy designed by nature to enable them to support the rigours of the winter under this wool is a fresh coat of finer the price of six ewes from two to four years old is about    s english the shepherds that guard them are so expert that at one view in a flock of two or three hundred they can tell whether any are missing or whether any strange sheep are got in among them as the rams are suffered to run about among the ewes to prevent unseasonable leaping they tie a cloth under their bellies which is taken off toward christmas  as goats do not thrive well where there is little or no wood they are not very general in this island the few there are yield a great store of milk  the old annals of this country prove that it was formerly stocked with a great number of hogs but there is no great quantity now  dogs and cats are in plenty especially the former scarce a family being without two or three a housedog and others to attend their sheep  of birds of prey they have eagles falcons hawks and ravens owls and kites crows and magpies there are none the iceland falcons are the best for sport the king of denmark sends every year a falconer with two attendants to buy them up  of wild fowl they have woodcocks snipes ouzels and partridges in abundance but no quails of common fowls chickens ducks pigeons etc as in other countries here is also plenty of wild ducks and a profusion of coastbirds that will stray out to sea in large flights to the distance of  0 or  0 leagues it is the large quantity of fish these seas are stocked with that occasions such flocks of birds to harbor here there are also wild geese and swans  the swan is a constant inhabitant of this island great numbers of them frequent the fresh rivers up the country and breed there and the natives make great profit of their down and feathers so do they of the eiderdown of which we made some mention in our account of greenland the eiderducks generally build their nests in little islands made on purpose to invite them where they will swarm if not disturbed nay they will become so tame as to suffer people to come about them and take away their eggs whilst they are sitting when these birds build their nest they pluck the fine down from their breasts to line them when their eggs and down are removed they go to work again newline their nests and lay more and when the nests are robbed a second time and the duck has no more down the drake supplies it this is not removed till the young ones are hatched and flown one female during the whole time of laying will give half a pound of down there are generally exported every year on the companys account   00 or  000 pounds of down exclusive of what is privately exported in the year    0 the iceland company sold as much in quantity as came to l    sterling of this bird the female is the size of a common english duck the drake the size of a goose as soon as their young are hatched they run out after the duck and when she gets to the wateredge she takes them on her back and swims away with them and when at some distance from the shore she dives and leaves the young ones swimming to shift for themselves and swim after her  too much cannot be said of the great blessing god has bestowed on this island in the immense multitudes of fish which swarm the coasts from the northern parts of iceland in their passage to the southern in some places there is good codfishing all the year round  herrings come from the most northern parts where they breed and send forth vast colonies to all europe at certain seasons in passing by iceland they are chased by the whales and large fish into the bays and creeks in such multitudes that a boat can hardly be rowed among them and they may be taken up by pails full but the icelanders do not apply themselves to the herringfishery having neither materials for it nor a sufficient quantity of salt small herrings are food for codfish and the birds also snap them up the whale also swallows them in heaps once in particular a whale says horrebow pursuing his prey too greedily ran aground and the tide setting out left him helpless on the shore the inhabitants soon gave him his quietus and found in his belly upwards of  00 fine live cod a great quantity of herrings and some birds  in proper fishingplaces a variety of other fish is caught besides cod namely trout soles flounders haddock whiting turbot skate salmon and salmontrouts the inhabitants dry codfish all the summer and the danish merchants in iceland pickle many hundred casks of cod annually and export it to copenhagen  they catch also in the iceland seas seals and whales of all sorts  as to vermin no country on the globe is less troubled with it rats and mice indeed they have in plenty spiders there are a few but no beetles horseflies nor snakes of any kind the only troublesome things are gnats travelers however by hanging gauze over their faces keep them off  chap v of the people though there is scarce any country so little favored by nature and where she appears throughout in so dreadful a form yet iceland contains about  0000 people who cannot properly be called unhappy though they are unacquainted with some of the comforts of life  the icelanders are middlesized and wellmade though not very strong and the women are in general illfeatured but have white sound teeth whilst children they are kept very tender but when the lads are big and strong enough to row a boat and to go afishing they must then enter upon a scene of toil and labor an icelanders strength continues only from the age of  0 to  0 at which time it begins to decay the many hardships they endure when fishing bring on consumptions and asthmas which are reigning disorders here they make nothing of jumping into the sea to save their boats from running aground or receiving damage against the rocks and frequently keep on their wet clothes even in frost and snow it is very rare to see any one reach the age of  00 or even  0 the women are not used to any heavy exercise or hard labor for excepting the hayharvest their other work is chiefly done while sitting such as cleaning and combing of wool spinning knitting weaving etc of course they are delicate tender and chilly they have frequently hard labors and many die in childbirth in their best times they generally keep their beds unmoved eight days and many suffer their whole lives through the ignorance of their midwives  cholics consumptions and hypochondriac disorders are very epidemical among them and would employ a number of physicians if the poor could afford to pay them but the leprosy is the most prevailing disease which continues with them till worn out with hard labor and age when the icelanders are taken ill they resign themselves to god and nature few among them having any medicines or knowledge how to apply them there is however an apothecarys shop established in the island and four hospitals for the poor and leprous attended by skilful physicians and assistants  when children are put to the breast they are suffered to suck as long as usual in other countries but for the greater part they are brought up by hand they give them the best milk not skimmed and never when turned into whey indeed they are so carefully and tenderly nursed that they are all strait and welllimbed scarce a cripple to be seen among them  there are no schools nor indeed can there well be any the houses being scattered at such a distance from one another but parents and such of the family as are qualified instruct young children in reading the articles of their religion and the clergy in visiting their parishioners examine and prepare them for confirmation they are kept always at home whilst young and see no other examples than their parents set them which are not vicious  the icelanders are of a good honest disposition but they are says von troil at the same time so serious and sullen that i scarcely remember to have seen any one of them laugh the annals of the country show that in ancient times they were a warlike people having in a civil war made great slaughter among themselves however as at present this country cannot spare many of its inhabitants and as fortunately for them it is too remote for officers to go recruiting few of them have been trained up in a military line in the seaservice some of them have been promoted to the command of dutch vessels  vices are indeed much less common among them than in other parts where riches and luxury have corrupted the morals of the people theft is seldom heard of nor are they inclined to incontinence  though their poverty renders them incapable of following in many respects the hospitality of their ancestors yet they do it where they can they cheargive away the little they have to spare and express the utmost satisfaction if you are pleased with their gift in general they are not cheerful in conversation but simple and credulous and have no objection to a bottle of strong liquor if they can get it  the icelanders have made very few alterations if any in their dress in modern times it is not elegant or ornamental but yet neat cleanly and suitable to the climate their outside garments are generally a coarse black baize which they call wadmel the men wear a linen shirt with a short seamans jacket and a wide pair of breeches or trowsers over it when they travel they wear another short coat over all on their head they wear large threecornered hats and on their legs worsted stockings and icelandic shoes which consist of a square piece of leather rather wider than the length of the foot this is sewed up at the toes and behind at the heel and tied on with leather thongs the women are dressed also in black wadmel though on the north side of the island they are seen in white clothes they wear a boddice over their shifts which are sewed up at the bosom and above this a jacket laced before with long narrow sleeves to the wrists in the opening on the side of the sleeve they have chased buttons with a plate fixed to each button on which the bridegroom when he buys them in order to present to his bride takes care to have his name and here is engraved at the top of the jacket a little black stiff collar is fixed of about three inches broad of velvet or silk and frequently trimmed with gold cord the petticoat is likewise of wadmel and reaches to the ancles round the top of it is a girdle or belt set round with silver or some other metal buttoned and clasped before to which they fasten the apron which is also of wadmel and ornamented at the top with three great chased filligree buttons before over this jacket they wear an upper garment like a loose wide coat close at the neck under the collar of the jacket with narrow sleeves that reach to the wrists these coats are also of wadmel and a handsbreadth shorter than the petticoat it is adorned with a facing something like cut black velvet woven by the women down to the very bottom their jackets are made to sit neat and close to the waist and are laced in all the seams with colored ribbands on their fingers they wear many gold silver or brass rings about their heads they tie icelanders a coarse white linen handkerchief and over that another finer formed like a tuft on the top of the head and a foot and a half high over this and under the chin they tie a silk handkerchief the poorer women use a cotton one this kind of head dress is worn by all women single or married and round their necks they have usually another silk or cotton handkerchief in short their dress much resembles what is met with in old pictures or monuments in churches except the headdress the young girls wear caps but when grown up change them for these high heads a bride on her wedding day instead of a silk handkerchief wears a crown of silver under the linen tuft that stands so high upon her head she wears also two silver chains one hanging down very low before and the other resting on her shoulders behind besides these she wears a lesser chain on the neck from which a heart generally hangs and in which some perfume is put but during these solemnities the great coat is never worn several of the iceland ladies wear trinkets to the amount of three or four hundred rixdollars and these make their dress of broadcloth instead of wadmel as for lawyers and gentlemen in civil employs they dress in the modern fashion as they do at copenhagen with full suits lined with silk  the inhabitants who live near the sea employ themselves the year round chiefly in fishing every master of a family furnishes his servant with a particular dress made of leather rubbed over with oil the breeches and stockings are of one piece and come up pretty high above the hips and are laced on very tight a wide jacket fastened round the neck and middle of the waist with watershoes of thick leather completes it this however is never worn but at sea  their boats are commonly small holding from one man to four with these they fish near the coast but they have some that will hold    or    men and with these they venture six or eight miles out at sea as soon as their boat is shoved off from shore they take off their hats and caps pray for good success and recommend themselves by a prayer and hymn to the divine protection on their return they divide the fish they have caught equally among them reserving one share for the owner of the boat though perhaps not present  men women and children when they have nothing else to do especially in winter work at the cleaning twining and spinning of wool some danish weavers have lately come among them and they begin now to improve considerably in the art of weaving having had no fullingmills it must be supposed that they have had much trouble in fulling and milling all the woollen goods made on the island when it is known that they have used no other means than a cask or barrel with both ends out and when the articles to be milled are put in two men sit down opposite to each other with their feet in the cask and thus work the stuff about gloves and mittens they put on when going to sea and dipping them in seawater mill them on their hands as they row to full breeches and stockings they put them on likewise and rock themselves about with them by which means they have contracted a habit of perpetual rocking and moving their limbs about when they have no such work to do women wash their things generally with urine using neither soap nor lie in the business of dying they extract verdegrease with urine from copper vessels with which they dye their yarn and weave pretty striped woollen stuffs of various colors they are also not without ingenuity as a proof of this we need only mention that a peasant contrived some years ago a sledge in the form of a ship with sails large enough to contain four or five persons that would sail in the wintertime on the snow in an even country  the many ingenious icelanders so eminent in the literary world is a strong instance of their good natural parts every year some of their select youths are sent to the university of copenhagen where they discover such a spirit of emulation as dull persons are seldom observed to have and the common people have keen cunning heads and a great deal of mother wit they have like most other nations a strong propensity to their native place some however establish themselves at copenhagen and in other foreign countries and settle there as professors rectors seafaring people goldsmiths and a variety of handicraft occupations at the bishops seat at hoolum there was an icelander in    0 that understood the art of printing to perfection having learned it at copenhagen and with respect to industry the icelanders are as diligent in their several occupations as most people never neglecting or omitting any thing that ought to be done though the common people are rather too much wedded to their old customs they are fond of seeing curiosities and improving themselves are very ready to imitate very handy at making any thing and very expert at turning things to advantage  it is not at copenhagen alone that they are thus found ingenious the people in the country are conspicuous for like abilities many men in iceland have without the instructions of a master taught themselves to work in silver and brass there are also ingenious carpenters joiners and smiths they have no timepieces among them except hourglasses but they calculate time pretty exactly by the sun or stars when visible or by the tide which is always regular of course they never count time by the clock as one two three four oclock but have particular names in their own language for every hour and half hour in the day as for example noon midnight midevening broadday etc  the kings seat at bessested the bishops palaces the lawyers houses those of the civil magistrates and those of some of the clergy are built with stone or brick like the houses of denmark but the farmhouses and huts of the icelanders are built of lava and clay thatched with turf and so small that you have scarce room to turn in them they have no floors but the ground one and their windows instead of glass are composed of thin membranes stretched on frames which admit of light they have no chimneys never making a fire but to dress their food in which case they burn turf on the ground as there are no accommodation houses for travelers the magistrates in their circuits are obliged to take up their lodgings in the churches  their household furniture consists of tables stools benches chests and other necessary utensils but the houses of those of better rank are built with driftwood and covered with boards wainscoted within and are well furnished with lookingglasses and every thing requisite in a genteel way  the walls of their houses are about three yards high and the entrance something lower and about six feet wide below is the plan of one of them    a is the door or entrance of the long passage bbb lighted by holes in the roof over which a skin stretched on a hoop is laid  c is a common room    or    feet long and    or    broad where the women sit and dress their wool and do other work for the family and where the master and mistress generally sleep the walls of this room are generally wainscoted it is floored and ceiled and some of them have small glass windows but no fireplace on each side of the passage are two rooms with doors opening into the passage of which d is the kitchen e the eatingroom f the dairy and g the servants sleepingroom   neither of these four rooms is either lined or ceiled the smoke of the kitchen fireplace ascends through a hole in the roof without they have a booth or shed to stow their provisions etc and hard by a stable for their cattle farmhouses have also a smiths shop adjoining for they are too far from a neighbor to get their smiths work done any where but at home farmhouses have generally a few huts about them for workmen but they all belong to the farm the membrane of which their windows are made is the chorion and amnios of sheep or the membranes which surround the womb of the ewe  their food principally consists of dried fish sour butter which they consider as a dainty milk mixed with water and whey and a little meat as no husbandry is followed in iceland bread must be scarce the major part of what is consumed is purchased by the better kind of people and imported from denmark there is scarely any peasant that eats it three or four months in the year as a substitute for bread they eat dried fish well beaten but not boiled and spread with butter they however convert sometimes wildcorn that grows in some places into flour and bread and make a kind of flour also of rockgrass  to give the reader some idea of their cookery we will tell him they boil their fish in seawater eat their meat without salt and make broth by boiling their meat in four whey of a year old their kitchen utensils they have from copenhagen and they are in general neat and cleanly in their kitchens the icelanders in common eat two meals a day morning and evening they usually eat curds mixed with new milk and sometimes with juniper berries and at dinner they eat dried fish with plenty of sour butter or fresh fish and if they can get it bread and cheese  their common drink is water but they occasionally drink milk buttermilk or sour whey and such as can afford it import beer and wine  in so mountainous and rocky a country where there is no agriculture and but little commerce we cannot expect good roads they neither make use of carts nor sledges but when they are obliged to travel to seaports in order to exchange their fish etc for other commodities they take  0  0 or a greater number of horses with them each of which will carry from  00 to  00 lb weight the conductor of this cavalcade rides on before and his dog by a certain word runs after the straggling horses and keeps them together they never take any food with them for the horses there being plenty of pasture all the way  the length of their journeys is not reckoned by miles or leagues but by thingmannaleid that is as far as a man can go in one day which is about four icelandic miles or    english  the number of inhabitants is by no means proportionable to the extent of the country it was much more populous formerly but a pestilential disease called the sort dod or black death that raged from   0  to   0  almost swept away every soul from the island many places have been entirely depopulated by famine and in the years   0  and   0  the smallpox destroyed   000 persons this black death in the year   0  scarce left a person to relate the dreadful calamity it has accordingly been omitted in the annals of iceland in which nothing else remarkable is omitted the few who escaped that great devastation saved themselves by taking refuge in the mountains and by tradition relate that the low and flat country was covered with a thick fog during the time of this plague this disease extended itself to norway sweden and denmark and carried off so many thousands in those countries that they could not spare people for this colony the inhabitants however have now increased to about  0000 the greatest number of whom live near the sea along the coast there are    harbors in this island at each of which is a trading town or factory but these trading towns consist only of three or four dwelling houses for the merchants of the iceland company with a shop a warehouse and a kitchen  marriages here as in other countries are often contracted for the sake of interest and as consent is required in iceland with as much formality as in other nations it is not unusual for a father or the nearest relation to refuse consent on very trifling accounts when a young man has fixed his choice the minister customarily goes and asks the bride in marriage of her parents and guardians which if complied with not many ceremonies are afterward used nor as their houses are small have they many guests the bride and bridegroom are attended to church by their nearest relations and there joined in wedlock by the minister generally on a sunday before he goes into the pulpit when service is ended they have an entertainment at the brides house according to their circumstances but without music or dancing and when the feast is over they all retire to their respective habitations  they have indeed no idea of dancing the merchants sometimes at the factories will for their diversion get a fiddle and set them to dancing but this is merely hopping and jumping about when they have been treated and made merry they will sing a variety of heroic songs a man and woman taking one another by the hand and by turns singing long stanzas but having no skill in harmony they roar out in a very harsh and uncouth manner  i observed says von troil two kinds of musical instruments among them one called laanspil with six brass strings the other fidla with two horsehair strings both played on by a bow i heard also of another instrument called symphon but never could get a sight of it  among their amusements they are very fond of and very expert at the game of chess and play sometimes at cards but never for money when they meet together their chief amusement consists in reading their history the master of the house begins and when he is tired the rest in their turns go on some know these stories by heart others have them in print and others in writing and it is thus they are so conversant in their own history as they are and keep up traditional accounts  chap vi of their trade the trade of this island has been subject to many revolutions till the year   00 the people of norway were almost the only persons who sailed to iceland and traded in fish the english had this trade afterward till the reformation when it fell into the hands of the germans and was very profitable to the hamburghers but christian iv king of denmark who had the trade of his country much at heart turned his attention likewise toward iceland he prohibited the hanstowns from trading there in   0  and bestowed it on copenhagen and some other towns of denmark  the iceland company at copenhagen was not however established till    0 it continued till      and was then suppressed the trade of every harbor was afterward disposed of to the best bidder once in six years however in      a new company was chartered for which they pay  000 rixdollars annually to the crown of denmark they send near thirty ships there every year loaded with corn bread wine brandy salt tobacco fishinglines coarselinen timber and what persons in good circumstances have occasion for in their families taking back in return fish flesh butter blubber skins salted lambsflesh tallow wool coarse and fine baize foxesskins eiderdown feathers wadmel jackets stockings and gloves  it is difficult to determine whether the company profits much by this trade it is certain that the icelanders lose by it for the dutch smuggle in there much better goods than the company and smuggle out again a considerable quantity of fish  there is a market kept annually at hraundalsretter to which those who live up the country resort and barter their butter cloth and sheep for fish blubber and the like and at reikavik there is a woollen manufactory where twenty or thirty workmen are employed  the merchants are very suspicious of the icelanders and never purchase any of their goods without examining them all separately danish money is current in the country but there is very little of it their accounts are generally kept according to yards of wadmel and fishes wadmel we have already mentioned of fishes each fish weighing two pounds are valued at a rixdollar in specie that is about   s   d english  chap vii of their literature it would be forming a very wrong judgment of iceland to conceive it absorbed in ignorance and obscurity i can affirm says von troil that i have found more knowledge among the lower class of people there than is to be met with in most other places there are few peasants who besides being well instructed in the principles of religion are not also acquainted with the history of their own country which proceeds from their reading by way of amusement their traditional accounts nor is it uncommon to find persons among them who can repeat the poems of kolbein grimson sigurd gisle and gudmund bergthors by heart all of whom were poets in later times the clergy speak latin well and fluently and i have found better libraries in many parts of iceland than could have been expected  among the icelanders who have acquired most fame in the literary world are dr finnur jonson bishop of skallholt who besides many learned writings on the antiquities of iceland has lately presented the public with an ecclesiastical history in three quarto volumes replete with information criticism and erudition he was made bishop of that diocese in      and was alive in      halfdan ejnarson rector of the school of hoolum is another icelander who has written historia literaria islandiae and there are many others arnas magnaus and torfoeus both natives of this island have particularly distinguished themselves for literature in this and the last century  four or five centuries ago the icelanders were celebrated for their poetry and knowledge in history i could name says von troil many of their poets who celebrated the warlike deeds of the northern kings in songs and to the famous snorre sturleson author of the edda is even the swedish nation indebted for the first illustration of their history for this reason so high a value has been set on the ancient icelandic records and writings that they have almost all been drawn out of the country sir joseph banks brought away in      upwards of   0 manuscripts and has presented them to the british museum  that there is a printingoffice in iceland cannot be unknown as we are acquainted with the scarce editions of olof tryggwassons landnama greenland and christendom traditions printed at skallholt they have had a printingpress there since the year    0 and are well acquainted with the old runic characters  at a time when no great knowledge of the latin language could be expected even in sweden an icelander was however met with of sufficient capacity and learning to instruct youth to read and understand the latin poets and it may be affirmed by their ancient chronicles that iceland from the introduction of the christian religion there till the year      when it became subject to the crown of norway was one of the few countries in europe and the only one in the north where the sciences were cultivated and held in esteem and their ancient annals are the only remaining monuments of the old northern history and are of such authority that we cannot deny the same credit we so implicitly give to the writings of tacitus and livy  such great pains are now taken to appoint men of known abilities as teachers to the public schools in iceland that few of the clergy study any where else though in the year      there were fiftyfour students from iceland in the university of copenhagen  the language is the same as that formerly spoken in sweden denmark and norway and has preserved itself so pure that any icelander understands the ancient traditional histories of those countries better than the natives do themselves near the coasts some danish is spoken nor is it uncommon for a peasant to make use of latin phrases of salutation the following is the lords prayer according to the iceland language in       fader vor thu sem ert a himnum helgesst thitt nafor tilkomme thitt rike verde thin vilie so a jordu sem a himne gief thu oss i dag voit daglegt braud og fyrer gief oss vorar skullder so sem vier fyrergiefum vorum skulldunautum og innleid oss ecke i freistne helldur frelsa thu oss fra illu thuiad thitt er ruked og maattur og dyrd um allder allda amen there is an icelandic grammar printed in      and several icelandic dictionaries the edda which has hitherto been considered as the mythology of the ancients but now known to be an introduction to icelandic poetry is one of the most celebrated remains of antiquity and judged to have been written by snorre sturleson who was beheaded in iceland in      the following lines from this poem will give the reader an idea of their poetry  heigni eg hamri kringdan hang a riupu tangar grymnis sylgs a galga gynnung bruar linna the natural disposition of these words is eg heingi hamri kringdan linna gynnung a hang riupu bruar tangar a grymnis sylgs galga in english this i hang the round beaten gaping snake on the end of the bridge of the mountain bird at the gallows of odins shield by gallows of odins shield is meant the arm on which the shield is worn by the ripa is understood a falcon one genus being put for another the bridge of the falcon is the hand on which the falconer places him and it is end or tongue tongue the finger the gaping round beaten snake means a ring and consequently this long story means no more than i put a ring on my finger  from the above it may easily be imagined that there is no language that allows a poet so much liberty as the icelandic nor any so rich in poetical expressions but the difficulty of understanding it has been the cause of the contempt it lies under  before we quit this subject we will take occasion to say something of the few monuments of antiquity remaining on this island the only pieces of antiquity here to be found for their are no ancient manuscripts icelandic annals or historical traditions now to be met with are some ruins of an old castle near videdal some of a lesser one at laugernas and some remains of heathen temples and buryingplaces in different parts with an ancient place of execution at hegranas there are no other monuments remaining of sturleson than his writings except a mount overgrown with grass at reikholt said to have been raised from the ruins of his house the burying place of his family and at a little distance from them one of the finest baths in the whole island this bath which is large enough to contain fisty persons is enclosed with a wall of basalt and has incrustations a smooth level bottom and is surrounded with benches in sturlesons time a long covered passage led from thence to the dwelling house the spring is at forty paces distance which supplies the bath and the water is conveyed through a conduit at the end of which is a hole shut with a spigot and fawcet that lets in as much hot water as you please which can be easily cooled by water from an adjoining brook  chap viii of their religion etc when the roman catholic religion took place throughout europe it was likewise the established religion of this island and was not extirpated without some effusion of blood since the reformation the lutheran religion is the only one tolerated here though the people are not without their superstitions  the icelanders first received their own bishops in the year  0   at skallholt and in   0  at hoolum they were originally under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of bremen and hamburgh but in the year   0  or   became subordinate to azeus first archbishop of lund in scania and in      to the bishop of drontheim the lutheran religion was introduced and there established in       iceland is divided into     parishes of which     belong to the sea of skallholt which extends over the east south and west quarters and    to that of hoolum which extends over the north quarter each bishopric has a latin school with a rector and other assistants under him who teach theology and other branches of literature and fit out those designed for the ministry some however study at copenhagen and generally get the best livings and more lucrative civil employments but all the ministers are icelanders or natives in the time of the reformation a great part of the church revenues were secularized and now belong to the king the income of each bishopric may amount to  000 rixdollars out of which the bishop must keep the rector and corrector the minister of the cathedral church who is the bishops curate and a certain number of scholars who have lodging board and clothes allowed them and he must keep the cathedral and palace in repair so that the balance after these deductions reverting to the bishop cannot exceed   00 rixdollars per year some livings are tolerably good some middling and some very poor the best do no exceed  00 rixdollars a year the revenues of many of the poor livings are so small that their ministers are for support obliged to have recourse to manual labor or go a fishing like the common people and yet their congregations are not neglected they follow the example of the apostle paul who though he earned his bread by the labor of his hands was a great and edifying preacher  the conduct of the clergy is very narrowly inspected into as well as that of the people in general in regard to religious matters and the least fault is not suffered to go unpunished if a minister on a sunday sets out only on a short journey he is cited to appear before a court and the matter is there enquired into for the crime of drunkenness or any other indecency they lose their preferment and are deprived from the ministry their attention in religious concerns operate powerfully on the people an icelander never passes a river or any other dangerous place without previously taking off his hat and imploring the divine protection and he is always thankful to god when he has passed the danger  most of the churches have lands and revenues annexed to them for the people there pay no tithes they are built in the same manner as their houses though somewhat larger and a little higher the inside wainscoted and the roof covered with turf they are built proportionable to the congregations for the houses and farms being scattered about there are sometimes only seven eight or ten farms in a parish though some contain from ten to thirty and as all the parishioners cannot attend service at one time the congregations must in many parishes be small the churches as well as the houses are so low that you may touch the roof with your hand the cathedral of hoolum is built of framework    feet long  0 wide and about  0 high it stands a little higher than the ground being built in a hollow and has a wooden spire the framework of the bishops palace at hoolum is of oak and walled between and the roof covered with boards it was formed at copenhagen put up and walled in      and is now standing the cathedral of skallholt is much the same as that of hoolum but has a bell in the spire in most of the churches are painted altarpieces imported from copenhagen every church has a font handsomely railed and most have pews at least for the women and some a metal sconce ships or some other ornament hanging up as to the ornaments vessels and utensils they are as neat and as handsome as in our country churches  chap ix of their government iceland first began to be cultivated in the  th century by a colony of norwegians among which were many swedes they continued free in this corner of the world for a long time but were obliged at last to submit to the kings of norway and afterward became subject with norway to the kings of denmark they were at first governed by an admiral sent there annually but that mode has been changed many years a deputy governor being now appointed who resides wholly in the country and at the town of bessested one of the royal domains where snorre sturleston formerly dwelt the governor is generally a nobleman of rank in denmark and resides chiefly at copenhagen the salary of the deputy or lieutenant governor is   00 rixdollars per annum he has under him a bailiff or mayor whose salary is  00 rixdollars two lagmen or judges a sheriff at  00 rixdollars a year and    sysselmen who act as justices of the peace and receivers of the land tax at a salary of  00 rixdollars each  the norwegians on their first arrival in iceland made their own laws but these proving insufficient when the the number of people increased a fresh code was established in     and again another code in    0 but at present most matters are decided after the danish law and some more recent regulations  all causes are first heard and determined at the haradsthing or county court but an appeal lies to the althing or common court of justice held annually on the  th of july but the final appeal is to the supreme court of judicature at copenhagen there is more work for lawyers here in cases relative to freehold and trespasses than one would imagine the people suing each other on the least incroachment on their lands or property so obstinate are they that though they have grounds of some miles extent lying between them one will not permit the other to enjoy the least spot without making some return for it notwithstanding he may have no use for it himself nay actions have been brought by the more opulent and carried into the upper courts where the matter in contest has not exceeded the value of a dollar in spiritual cases the dean has a court which consists of himself and two assessors with an appeal to the consistorial court where the deputy governor presides and the bishops deans and clergy are assessors from this court there is also an appeal to the superior court at copenhagen  in criminal cases where the punishment is death the men are either beheaded with an ax or hanged the women are thrust into a sack and drowned each sysselman keeps a person at his own expense to perform this office  the kings revenues from this island are but small not exceeding  0000 crowns a year they arise chiefly from the secularized abbey lands and other royal domains farmed out at about  000 rixdollars a year and from the harbors farmed out to the iceland company at  0000 rixdollars in some districts he has one third of the tithes of the fish and every subject worth more than twenty dollars pays him  0 fish or about   s english and the people act very conscientiously in this respect scorning nothing so much as to rob the king of his revenue  a description of lapland from the latin of professor scheffer who was employed by the chancellor of sweden to travel into that country and give the king a particular account of it olaus magnus an archbishop of sweden and others  chap i of the country in general and it is productions lapland is divided into three parts one of which belongs to the crown of denmark one to that of sweden and one to the empire of russia that belonging to the swedes is by far the most valuable and comprehends all the country from the gulf of bothnia to the mountains that separate norway from sweden swedish lapland then is the object of authors in describing this country which is about  00 german miles in length and  0 in breadth and lies between    and    degrees of north latitude further north than iceland or any part of greenland we have treated of in depicting swedish lapland we describe the other two though we shall speak occasionally of those belonging to denmark and to russia  the laplanders are supposed to have been descended from finlanders driven out of their own country and were called lappes which signifies exiles to have an idea of the country the reader must conceive a vast mass of mountains crowded together and rising by degrees to such a prodigious height as to be always covered with snow even in the summertime in the wintertime the most rapid rivers are covered with ice four or five feet thick nay the largest lakes and the sea itself is frozen sufficient to bear any weight but what is most astonishing and seems not very probable is that the heat of the summer is as intense as is the cold in the winter the only relief they have are the vapors that rise from the neighboring seas and from the snow which remains both summer and winter in the recesses of the rocks and hollows between mountains which all that season are extremely subject to lightning and thunders spring and autumn are seasons unknown among the laplanders there being but an interval of a very few days between the cold of winter and the heat of summer it appearing almost a miracle to such as are unacquainted with these parts to see the fields clothed with green herbs and grass which a week before were enveloped in snow nature seems so sensible of the shortness of the summer here that she brings things to perfection with a speed incredible but to those who have seen it the soil is neither fertile nor barren but between both though it is full of flints and small rocks and of course very rough and uneven indeed there is but little ground fit for tillage for besides the rivers and lakes of which there are a great many dusky forests and unhealthy morasses cover great part of the flat country in the more southern parts of lapland the ground is much better calculated for herbage than the northern parts in the neighborhood of bothnia they have a variety of vegetables in their gardens such as coleworts turnips parsneps radishes etc but further north little of this is to be seen for besides the rocky hills and mountains there are vast tracts of barren sand which are raised frequently by high winds and cover the adjacent country like snow these sands are sometimes so dangerous to travelers from their depth that men and beasts have missed their way and been buried in them on the side of norway the sands are sometimes mountainhigh nature has divided this part of the swedish territories from norway by a vast ridge of mountains a hundred leagues in length as by a wall and the tops of these mountains are frequently so high that they appear like clouds above the horizon  the principal rivers that wash this country rise out of the mountains of norway and discharge themselves into the bay of bothnia and as these rivers are often swelled by the melting of the snow and ice they are full of cataracts and waterfalls which fall with great noise from the rocks and in many places are scarce navigable there is one called niomesaski or the hares leap where the river luhlao forces it is way through so narrow a passage between two rocks that a hare may leap from one to the other these cataracts are a great hindrance to ships but they afford a vast number of fishes and are very beneficial to the meltinghouses  with respect to the lakes many of them are so large as never to have been traced some are  00 miles long and  00 broad and abound with islands they yield such an incredible quantity of fishes that the natives chiefly live on them and the laplanders hold them so sacred that they will not allow the least dirt to be thrown into them  the situation of this country is so near the pole that in some parts during the summer months the sun never sets and for three months together during the winter months it never rises for the same space of time but this part of the country is inhabited by savage laplanders though in the summer the sun does not set yet it skirts the horizon only and it is rays only slide along the ground so in the winter it is not much below the horizon of course there is a constant twilight sufficient for people to pursue their work besides the further the sun is removed from mankind the more they enjoy the benefit of the moon for rising higher than it does with us it affords a more considerable light so that what other nations perform in the daytime is by laplanders done by moonlight nay when the moon does not shine the glittering of the stars in a pure and serene air give more light than with us and this augmented by the glare of the snow enables them to see sufficiently to do almost any business they have to transact abroad  the air of lapland is generally very pure and clear and consequently not unwholesome but the weather is very changeable owing to the winds and suddenly so the winds rage here with great violence and one particular wind from the sea brings with it such thick fogs that the people are not able to see one another in the wintertime this wind drives such a prodigious quantity of snow to the continent that if any one is caught in it he has no other remedy than to lay flat on the ground and cover himself as well as he can till it is over and then make the best shift he can to get from under it and seek shelter in the next cottage among the mountains which separate swedish lapland from norway the winds rage says olaus petri with such fury as sometimes to carry men and beasts from the tops a great way down the precipices so that they are never seen or heard of more the only remedy people have in such tempestuous times is to run for shelter to a den or a cave on these mountains no trees will grow and it is easy to be imagined that the cold in this country must be excessive intolerable to any one but those who are natives of the place in winter it is no unusual thing for their lips to be frozen to the cup in attempting to drink and the limbs of the inhabitants often mortify with the cold  among the productions of this country are pinetrees fir juniper birch the servicetree and willow the asp the alder and the dogtree lapland produces no oak beech or hasel nor any fruit trees such as our apple pear or cherrytrees they have currants and a variety of palatable berries some peculiar to the climate and many useful herbs vast quantities of angelica grow every where wild on short but thick stlks and they have some herbs met with in no other country than this several different mosses and a grass which is so soft and warm that the laplanders put it into their shoes and gloves to defend them against the rigor of the cold  silver mines have been discovered and worked in lapland and there are also mines of copper and lead and plenty of ironore beautiful crystals are also met with and some amethysts and topazes and a variety of minerals polished by nature pearls are likewise met with in some of the lapland rivers but not in the seas and they are found not in oysters but in shellfish like muscles they have not that lively brightness that makes the oriental pearls so valuable though now and then one is found of equal size and beauty i saw once says scheffer a pearl of lapland so bright and so exactly round that   0 crowns was offered for it and the jeweller protested that if he knew how to match it he would not sell them both for  00 crowns whilst these pearls are growing they stick fast within the shell but when come to maturity loosen and when the muscles open drop out  chap ii of animals birds and fishes among the wildbeasts of lapland the bear is esteemed the king of the woods exceeding the rest in strength and fierceness they are very numerous here and do considerable mischief to the cattle and those storehouses which the laplanders erect on the bodies of trees for the bears will pull them down and destroy the provisions there hoarded the elk or elges is the next animal of importance it is something of the reindeer kind but as large as a horse a french gentleman employed by the danish merchants who traded to the north in the beginning of this century relates that he was once out an elkhunting in norway that they no sooner saw an elk than before they fired at it it dropped and that asking how it came to fall down dead in that manner was told it was the nature of the animal to be thus taken with a kind of falling sickness which often seized them in the beginning of a chase and that from this disease they are called elks or miserable creatures when close attacked the elk will stand boldly in his own defense and will frequently destroy two or three dogs by his heels there are also in lapland wild reindeer wolves gluttons beavers otters foxes martins ermines squirrels and hares the wolves here are white and great enemies to the tame reindeer but what is remarkable a wolf will never attack a reindeer if it be tied to a stake but if at liberty he often becomes their prey possibly the wolf is afraid of a snare and therefore avoids the rein deer when he sees the rope by which he is tied for this creature is very timorous and alarmed at the sight of a rope which he considers as a snare to catch him besides as the laplanders generally tie their reindeer to stakes when they milk them wolves when they see one tied conceive a man is near at hand to kill them but some wolves are so fierce that they will sometimes fly upon a man or woman especially if she is with child so that travelers says olaus magnus are obliged to go armed and women are never suffered to travel without an armed attendant the wolves being eager after them if with child and they know by the scent if they are so  gluttons are likewise very numerous here the head of this animal is rounder than and their tails long and sharp like the wolfs and it is body larger but feet shorter than the otters it is skin is very black and very bright and looks like blackflowered damask it is valued almost as much as a sableskin though the hair is not so soft nor so fine it is an amphibious animal dwelling partly in the water like an otter indeed some have taken it for a species of the otter but it resembles most our turnspitdogs it is a gluttonous animal nothing coming amiss to it but it lives chiefly on waterfowl it is so ravenous that it is said to devour a carcass larger than itself and unburthens it is stomach by squeezing itself between two close standing trees  of foxes there is a great variety in lapland black brown ash color and white the black ones are the finest and rarest and their skins are worn on the caps of persons of the best rank in muscovy they will fetch  0 or    ducats a piece some of the brown foxes are marked with a blackcross on their backs as our asses are  martins also are no less numerous than the foxes and no country affords finer skins than this the food of the martin is birds and squirrels by the help of it is claws it will climb the trees in the night and catch the squirrels who have no chance of escaping but by running up upon the smaller boughs to the top of the trees where the martin by it is weight cannot follow them and by leaping from one tree to another the birds they catch whilst at roost  the number of squirrels throughout lapland is incredible and they have this peculiar property of changing their color twice a year in summer they are red in winter gray but notwithstanding their numbers they sometimes leave the country in such troops that few are left behind samuel rheen and olaus petri who have both been eyewitnesses of the fact assert that when they are about to leave the country they retire in whole troops to the lakes and there putting themselves upon small pieces of bark or cork set their tails upright as if they were under sail and are carried as the wind directs them though sometimes they will paddle on with their feet if the weather should prove tempestuous perhaps both the ships and ships crew shall fall a sacrifice to the waves but should this be the case the country is soon restocked by the few that remain for a female squirrel brings five or six at a litter  the ermine is nothing but a white weasel with the tip of it is tail black it also catches mice as weasels do the mice are mountainmice and differ from ours by having short tails and standing hair of a red and black color mixed they are called in norway lemming rheen says they appear suddenly in rainy and stormy weather and cover the ground by their vast multitudes so that olaus and wormius have imagined they fell from the clouds but the fact is that they either delight in rainy weather or perhaps are driven by violent rains and storms from their caves they are not fearful but bold and do not run away at the approach of a passenger but will if struck turn about and bite the stick like an enraged dog they never enter any houses or huts or do any mischief there but keep among the shrubs and brambles they will sometimes divide themselves into two parties and attack each other like warriors and when the laplanders who are a suspicious people see this they conceive it presages future wars in sweden these mice are not only food for the ermine and fox but also for the reindeer and what is singular their life is so short that they live no longer than after an herb which they have eat of grows again of course they die in heaps  hares here become white in winter as many other of the lapland animals do a care of providence to preserve them from the hunter they being then not distinguishable from the snow  i come now to the tame domestic animals of this country lapland affords no horses asses oxen sheep or goats indeed horses would be useless of course they set no value on them but the natives sometimes purchase oxen sheep and goats in norway for their flesh their wool and their skins they keep them however only one summer and then kill them the only tame animal proper to lapland and which is no where else to be found except in the most northern parts is the reindeer and perhaps the most useful of any in the creation it resembles the stag only is larger and droops it is head and it is horns project forwards the laplanders call it herki or puatze when the reindeer walks the joints of it is feet make a noise like the clashing of flints or cracking of nuts in summer it feeds upon grass and leaves and in the winter upon moss which it has a wonderful sagacity in discovering and when found it scrapes away the snow that covers it with it is feet such as are designed for use the laplanders geld at a year old by biting the nerves near their genitals the females like our ewes furnish them with milk cheese and young ones and it is observable that such as have young ones though the fawns suck them before they are milked will give more milk than those who have no young ones to suckle their milk is as rich as cream and very nourishing though thin milk makes good cheese it will not make butter as these animals are of great use they are careful to preserve them from wild beasts or straying into danger for which purpose the master and mistress as also the children and servants are commonly near at hand whilst they are feeding it is a hard service for servants in the wintertime to watch them whilst they feed among the mountains this and their small wages is the reason why they do not continue above six months in one place their yearly wages being no more than a reindeer of two years old scanty as their provision is in winter the reindeer thrives best at this season of the year for in summer they are nothing but skin and bones they swim with their bodies half above the water with such incredible force and swiftness across the largest rivers that a boat with oars shall scarce be able to keep up with them this animal seldom lives beyond the thirteenth year and what is most surprising says lundius is that when a laplander dies the whole or at least the greatest part of his reindeer die at the same time  the chief part of a laplanders riches consists in the number of reindeer he possesses for besides the food it furnishes whither fresh or dried they are used as horses in traveling their skin forms excellent clothing both for the bed and body their milk and cheese are pleasant and nutritive and their intestines and tendons are converted into thread and cordage but with these excellent qualities they are not without their inconveniences for besides the difficulty of keeping them from straggling they frequently grow restive to the great danger of the driver and his carriage their surprising speed for they are said to run at the rate of  00 miles a day seems to be owing to their impatience to get rid of their encumbrance none but a laplander could bear the uneasy posture in which he is confined in the sledge they travel in or believe that by whispering the reindeer in the ear they make him acquainted with the place they are traveling to and the length of the journey he has to go  the reindeer thus supply the place of horses sheep and cows to which other nations are accustomed it is the animal to which the laplanders apply all their care except their dogs which they train up to hunting and guarding their huts and cattle and which they sell commonly to one another for one two or three crowns a piece  of the winged tribe lapland abounds in swans ducks geese lapwings snipes and all sorts of waterfowl besides heathcocks stockdoves woodcocks and partridges and of poultry they have cocks hens and turkeys of all kinds the lapwing here seems to be a bird of passage as they come to this country every spring to breed olaus petri says they come in such vast flights as to darken the sky and wherever they settle at nights or come to look for food they make such a noise that you may hear them at half a leagues distance  there is a kind of snipe peculiar to this country called by the natives kniper black on the head back and wings the bread and belly white with a long red bill set with teeth with short red webbed feet like those of a duck  their partridges are white here in winter and gray in summer and differ from our partridges in this that they have feet like hares covered with wool instead of feathers from whence they are called lagepedes besides these useful birds in the mountains they have eagles which will sometimes kill the young reindeer  with respect to fish they have incredible quantities of all kinds scarce any part of europe abounds so much with salmon as the bothnian sea from their mountains descend vast rivers of fresh water in which salmon are seen to swim against the stream in shoals   00 barrels of salmon have been exported from torna in one year and whole ship loads of dried pikes the produce of the lakes are annually transported into germany this country produces few weazels and no snakes neither are insects very frequent here fleas they know not but are full of lice because the laplanders wear no linen and change their clothes very seldom they louse themselves in the summer and in the winter expose their clothes to the cold air which kills them in the marshy grounds of the north they are pestered with great gnats which make an odious noise when they sting the reindeer run from them to the tops of the mountains and the natives defend themselves against them by keeping in their huts a continual smoke when asleep they cover their heads and bodies with a blanket and when abroad they cover themselves with skins and a clothcap which they can pull occasionally over their faces but some besmear their faces with rosin or pitch by way of a further defense  chap iii of the people the laplanders in general are very low of stature seldom more than four feet and an half in height which has given occasion to the ancients to place their pigmies in these northern countries the women are rather handsome their complexion being a mixture of white and red but the men are swarthy and probably the lowness of their huts and tents and their constantly sitting in the smoke may contribute not a little to the dinginess of their hue they are not only short of stature but extremely thin a fat man being seldom seen among them for the coldness of the climate not only prevents their growth but dries up the moisture of their bodies they have very thick large heads prominent foreheads short and flat noses wide mouths and like hogs are hollow and blear eyed their hair is short straight hard and thin and universally black in both sexes the beards of the men scarce cover their chins their breasts are broad their waists rather slender and though the men in general are spindleshanked they are extremely active and swift of foot they will swim over their lakes and rivers with incredible swiftness and are so expert at diving as to continue under water a considerable time and when they rise will with a spring throw themselves frequently out of it lundius who was a native of lapland gives us an instance of the agility and expertness of a fellow that lived in his time who having quitted his habitation to change it for a better came with his whole family to the banks of the stoortutaad which being frozen over he endeavored to pass upon the ice but scarce had they reached the middle of it than the ice broke under them and his wife and another woman were carried away by the rapidity of the current which the laplander no sooner saw than he plunged into the water swam after them a great way under the ice and brought them safe ashore to the surprise of his countrymen who agreeable to their general infatuation were persuaded he had formed himself into a fish rivalling each other in climbing inaccessible rocks and the highest trees like monkeys are their daily exercises but vigorous and nimble as they are they seldom if ever walk upright but stoop continually attributed to their sitting on the ground in their low cottages  dwelling chiefly in the forests among wild beasts each family at a considerable distance from another and enjoying no conversation but what arises within their own hovels what wonder is it that they should be addicted to superstition but of this i shall treat at large hereafter in disposition they are timid and dastardly beyond expression flying at the very sight of a stranger or at the approach of a ship to the shore from a conception that they come to rob them or carry them into slavery from this inherent timidity in the laplanders the swedes never draw any of their soldiers from among them whereas every other part of that kingdom furnishes a certain number and yet timid as they are they will live and pass whole nights alone in the most dreadful forests without any appearance of fear and are not in the least terrified at those visions or specter which they idly conceive appear to them on the tops of the highest mountains nay so ill adapted are they to a military line that from the greatest natural attachment to their native country they could not live long out of it but would soon languish and die besides it has been found by experience that not only a more southern climate but the diet of the swedes particularly salt and bread are as incompatible with the constitution of a laplander as their dried fish and raw flesh the customary food of those northern regions would be with a swede  from a consciousness of their own weakness and a fearful disposition it must naturally occur that they are mistrustful and the consequence of this temper is a proneness to do all sorts of mischief clandestinely rather than not avoid the danger they apprehend from others hence it is that as they deal much in magic they endeavor to hurt one another upon the slightest occasions a little matter enrages them and when they are enraged they are as ungovernable and bloodthirsty as wild beasts this is most observable in their old women who if put into a passion which they soon are will rave like a madman should any one says tornaeus speak harshly to them point at them or ridicule them with words or gestures or should a person chance to touch them unawares or a spark of fire fall on their hands they will be seized with such a furious madness as to fall foul on him who was the cause of it will tear his face and hands and strike him with any thing in their reach nay so little respect have they on these occasions to themselves and others that they will expose what nature teaches them to keep concealed so that during this paroxism of fury they are like a person raving in the same manner do the men act when drunk  among other vices the laplanders are very industrious in cheating one another a vice natural to mean spirits endeavoring to be beforehand with others in what they fear from them and when they are successful in any underhand trick they never fail to laugh at those they have outwitted they are also great tatlers so that two or three seldom meet but their conversation is filled with slander and detraction they are very apt to censure and find fault with other nations conceiving themselves to have qualifications superior to every other country so that there is scarce a swede comes among them but they give him some nickname they are also avaritious and what is almost a paradox at the same time lazy though there are many spacious places in lapland sufficiently fertile they will leave them uncultivated from more idleness thus they pass their lives choosing to overcome the want of convenient sustenance by patience rather than by labor neither do they like to bestow much pains in dressing their food nor do they ever go a hunting or fishing unless necessity compels them no sooner have they dined but they lay down to sleep this indolence of disposition may probably give rise to another bad quality they possess that is of neglecting and illtreating their parents when old and sick they are also says wexovius in his description of sweden a man who lived among them addicted to lasciviousness though they abominate and punish adultery men and women without the least distinction of age or sex live and lie promiscuously in the same hut clandestine cohabitations says lundius are very frequent among them especially among the men and maidservants without the least danger of bastardy they being naturally of a barren constitution indeed the whole country of lapland is not computed to contain more than  0000 inhabitants the danish laplanders says the french traveller i have mentioned are stupid brutal and lascivious especially the women who will prostitute themselves to all comers if they can do it unknown to their husbands the swedish laplanders have two other bad qualites that of drunkenness and swearing in times of the first they are sure to quarrel and often cut one another faces with knives and in their oaths they make use of the most dreadful imprecations he who swears will frequently strip himself naked to his waist and thus solemnly devote himself his wife children and reindeer to the devil they take it for granted that if the swearer is innocent no harm will be the consequence of this oath but if otherwise some great misfortune will attend him if the whole family be innocent they will all escape without harm their melancholic habit renders them very subject to frightful dreams and apparitions which they consider as infallible presages by their genius of what is to besal them thus they are frequently seen lying upon the ground asleep and some singing loudly others howling and making a hideous noise like wolves  after exhibiting their illqualities it is but justice i should say something of their good ones they are in the first place strict observers of conjugal fidelity thefts are never known among them every one enjoying his own in quiet without the least danger of being robbed though they will overreachone another in their dealings they abhor the very thought of stealing foreign merchants trading in those parts may and often do leave their property in the open air covered only from the snow and bad weather and travel to a great distance to buy up more commodities without the least danger of losing it and indeed in a country without villages enclosures or fixed habitations without such an honest disposition in the people they could not trade there at all the laplanders also are very charitable to the poor a character almost incompatible with avarice but they are so and will frequently provide them lodgings and sustenance for months together they are very ready to assist the poor with their own reindeer either by giving them one or lending them more than one nay two three ten or twenty for a whole summer they are also very obliging and hospitable to strangers receiving them with great kindness and being ready to do them all the good offices in their power  on the whole however this nation compared with other northern countries is barbarous and unpolished but they are naturally a cleanly people washing their hands and faces many times a day neither do they want ingenuity making all their tools and household furniture themselves they make also their own clothes and shoes and all their instruments of hunting fowling and fishing and many things they make for foreign trade they have a genius likewise for singing and have generally a clear and harmonious voice  chap iv of their houses and habits in former ages the laplanders did not inhabit any houses but dwelt about in tents and huts erected in places where convenience of pasturage or fishing led them but this custom of wandering from place to place was abolished by an edict of charles ix in   0  the words of which run thus we ordain that in every lapmark that is province of lapland a certain register be made of all the fens lakes and rivers as likewise of the names and numbers of all those who hitherto have enjoyed the benefit of them secondly that an exact account be stated betwixt the number of families and that of the rivers and lakes in order to make such an equitable division among them that each family may not possess any more rivers and lakes than are requisite for it is maintenance every lapmark being thus divided honest and just men are to be appointed who without favor or affection shall assign to each family it is due proportion after which time it shall not be lawful for any laplander to wander at his own discretion throughout the whole lapmark as has been the custom hitherto  since the time of this edict each family has been confined to it is own allotment it not being lawful for one to invade or encroach upon the property of anther though their former custom of wandering from lapmark to lapmark was thus put a stop to yet their habitations are by no means settled but they wander about within certain districts as convenience induces them indeed the necessity of getting their livelihood which depends on reindeer fish and wild animals obliges them to seek out for such places as will furnish their reindeer with pasturage and their families with fish and game this change of habitation must not be supposed to be so total as that they leave and never return to their former ones but they rather take a regular round within the space of a year through all the parts of their allotment this is the custom of those laplanders who live among the mountains but those who take up their residence in the woods return frequently to their dwellings in the course of a year such as accustom themselves to fishing are careful to dwell always near their lakes or rivers in spawning time and those who abound in reindeer remove in the winter to the woods and in the summer to the mountains of norway when they travel thus from place to place they are not guided by the track of any high road their being no such thing in lapland not even in the summer but they know how notwithstanding to find out their huts though at ever so great a distance as they will find out a bear or other wild beast when they once discover his track in the wintertime they perform these circuits in their sledges of which i shall speak by and by in the summer they travel on foot and carry their utensils in paniers upon their reindeer these paniers are made of thin broad laths of flexible fir such as the dutch commonly make boxes of in the nature of bandboxes the top of which is enclosed with latticework of birch twigs which opens occasionally and the bottom is covered with bark or skins these are hung over the back of the animal by thongs the bottom to the side of the beast and the top outward a reindeer thus loaded will carry about   0lb weight thus they not only remove their utensils but their household furniture and also their children that are not able to walk whom they hang on the sides of the reindeer in their cradles when they are thus removing their quarters they proceed generally in the following order in the front walks the master of the family followed by several reindeer so laden then his wife followed by other reindeer next the remainder of the beasts driven gently along in one herd by their children and servants and the cavalcade closed with him who has charge of the magical drum of which i shall give the reader a particular description the reindeer thus laden follow one another the one behind being tied to the panier of the one before and the foremost led by the master  the mountain laplanders build their huts but slightly because they return but once a year and on quitting the place they destroy them but other laplanders make theirs more durable as they leave them standing they first erect them in the following manner they fix four posts at as many corners on the tops of which they place three crossbeams so that there shall be one on each side and one behind but none across the tops of the two foremost poles on these crossbeams they set up six long poles or rafters leaning with their tops against each other to form an angular roof which they cover with a thick woollen cloth called by them waldmer but the more opulent cover this again with linen  the wood laplanders make their huts either of boards or six posts meeting at the top in the form of a cone the bottom of which is a sexagon covered with branches of fir the bark of fir or turf to this hut they have a door before and behind the foredoor is the common entrance but the backdoor is sacred to the men through this they bring in the provision of the day which they catch in hunting and here they perform their sacrifices to their god thor the women are forbidden to go out through this door because the men who always pass this way when they go out hunting consider it as an illomen to meet a woman at such times these houses or huts are not divided by partitions but the several chambers are distinguished by logs or pieces of wood laid on the ground and the whole compass of the hut is so contrived that the hearth of stone can be placed in the center the smoke rises through the top which is open in these huts sleep the whole family the master with his wife and daughters on one side the fireplace his sons and the men and maidservants on the other a hut in danish lapland has also no light but what enters by a hole in the top none of these northern nations make use of beds the whole family matter mistress children men and maids lie down all together very familiarly on bear skins spread in the middle of the room and when they rise in the morning the skins are taken up and laid by till they are wanted again at night for the same occasion  the floor is covered with branches of birchtrees to keep them from wet over which are spread skins of reindeer which serve both for beds and chairs these are their dwellingplaces in which two superstitious ceremonies are observed viz no one in walking up and down the hut must follow him who is going out but must keep his turn between the fire and those who sit about it and no woman in crossing the hut must pass with her feet over the legs of a man they considering it as ominous  besides these huts they have storehouses where they keep their flesh fish and other provisions these are erected with wood on the trunk of a tree after all the branches are cut off not unlike our pidgeon houses built upon posts so that they are about nine or ten feet from the ground the door is at the bottom like a trapdoor to which they have access by steps cut out in the trunk of the tree like a ladder these lofty storehouses are designed to secure their provisions from wild beasts and to prevent their climbing the steps are constantly greased  the men in the summer wear brogues reaching down to their feet close to their body over which they have a coat or loose garment reaching to the middle of the leg and tied round the waist with a girdle they wear no linen their clothes being made of a lightgrey coarse woollen cloth called waldmar but the richer sort of people wear better cloth of different colors green blue and red black they never wear even the better sort of people make use of coarse woollen when at home and employed in daily work the girdle is generally leather studded with tin and a tin buckle the more opulent decorate theirs with silver studs which resemble a semicircular button at the girdle hangs a knife in a sheath with a square pouch rather longer than broad with a purse and a case with needles and thread the knives are brought from norway and the sheath which is made of reindeer skin is sewed together with tinwire thread and embroidered with the same and at the end of which hang several rings the pouch is also made of reindeer skin the hairy side outward over which is another skin of the same size and this again they cover with red green or blue cloth ornamented with tinwire thread in this pouch they keep a crystalstone with which they strike fire a steel with some brimstone some tobacco and other odd things their purse is of the same leather shaped like a pear here they keep their money and things of value at the end of it hang abundance of rings their needlecases are also decorated in the same manner besides these they wear abundance of brass chains and rings on the girdle as well as most other parts of the body the pouch hangs down before below the girdle the rest on both sides on their heads they wear a cap which the better sort cover with some skin in shape they resemble our nightcaps are made of some colored cloth or of harefur twisted and knit like our stockings sometimes they are made of the loombird skin with the feathers on in danish lapland this cap resembles a seamans bonnet but made of reindeer skin with the hair outward and bordered with white or gray foxskin they have also a method of fitting the whole bird with his head and wings to their heads which is not unbecoming they wear gloves like ours their shoes are of a peculiar make made of reindeer skin with the hair on and all of one piece except that they are sewed together at the bottom on which they tread so that the hair of the one part lies forwards that of the other backwards this is contrived to prevent their slipping they put their feet into a hole in the top the toe is pointed and bends upwards and the seams are strengthened with some narrow pieces of red cloth they wear them on their barefeet and tie them on with leather strings wound three or four times round their ancles that they may sit close to the feet they stuff them with hay  when the gnats are troublesome they wear leather garments and in the winter the men wear both coats and breeches of rough reindeer skin called mudd they have boots gloves and caps of the same and their caps at this time of year cover all the head like a hood reaching down round the shoulders and having only a hole before just big enough to look through  the women in summertime wear long coats which cover their breasts arms and whole body being laid in pleats from the middle downwards these they call volpi and are worn over their bare skins having no linen the women also wear girdles but broader than the mens and instead of studs ornamented with plates a fingers length and more on which are engraved birds flowers and the like these are fastened upon leather so close to each other that the whole girdle seems to be but one piece of tin the richer sort make these of silver from this girdle hang abundance of brass chains and on one of them a knife and sheath on another a pouch on another a needlecase and on all a great many brass rings and all hung before to the weight of  0 lbs and more but this weight they disregard as they like the jingling it makes and think it adds to their beauty  they wear also a kind of tippet made of colored cloth which surrounds the neck about a hands breadth and coming down on both sides below the breasts ends in a narrow point this they adorn with many studs upon the breast and sometimes about the neck engraved with all sorts of figures and with small chains hanging on them on their heads they wear a kind of round red cap or bonnet flat on the top on their legs stockings that reach only just below the ancle and on their feet shoes like the men in the winter their garments are like those of the men both sexes wearing breeches in cold weather women unmarried or married wear the same habits at night they cover themselves all over with woollen blankets or rugs to defend themselves from the gnats which in summer are very troublesome and to remove the inconvenience of their weight they suspend them at some distance from their bodies by strings fastened to the top of their huts under these coverlids upon one or two reindeer skins they lie quite naked both in summer and winter  womens clothes in danish lapland are made either of coarse cloth or reindeer skins with the hair outward their stockings are of the same their shoes of fishskin with the scales on and resemble the wooden shoes in france having nothing to fasten them on their coifs are like those of the norwegian women their hair is twisted up into two braids or tresses one of which hangs down on one shoulder and one on the other their coif is made of coarse canvas and all their linen is of the same kind some of them wear a ruff eight fingers broad which they tie behind them as gypsies do in muscovy lapland the women embroider their own and their husbands clothes on the edges with tinsel thread which they draw between their teeth as fine as wiredrawers do their threads of gold and silver with a drawingiron  chap v of their magical arts and ceremonies there is scarce a country under the sun where the name of lapland has reached but what has heard of their magic which is not yet quite abolished among them these countries says olaus magnus speaking of finland and lapland but who was a very credulous man were in the time of paganism so well instructed in sorcery as if they had been disciples of zoroaster the persian they are such prodigious sorcerers says peter claudi writing of the norwegian laplanders of later times that i much question whether they ever could or can now be matched in this art by any upon earth at present however they do not practice it so frequently nor so publicly as they did in former times the king of sweden having put a stop to it by severe laws the reason the people give for using it is to defend themselves against the evil designs of their countrymen for which reason parents instruct their children in the art and when they die bequeath to them as part of their inheritance such spirits and demons as they have found serviceable to themselves were i to mention the many wondrous stories and miracles which many respectable writers have said they have wrought the reader would only laugh at me for magic in this enlightened age is wholly exploded but according to the opinion of laplanders certain families have their own demons not only differing from the familiar spirits of others but also quite contrary and opposite to them that is spirits belonging to them hostile to those of others and securing them against the demons of other families some laplanders are weak enough to believe that they are possessed by a demon from their very infancy and some from the time of manhood whilst he was busy in the woods a laplander will tell you a spirit appeared to him and offered him assistance on certain conditions which he accepted this settled the demon taught him a certain song which he is obliged to keep in constant remembrance these spirits say they appear under different shapes some like fishes some birds others like a serpent or dragon others in the shape of pigmies about three feet high no sooner are they seized as they suppose by the genius but they appear like madmen bereaved of reason this continues for six months during which time they do not suffer any of their family or relations to come near them but range about the woods and other solitary places melancholy and thoughtful scarce taking any food which renders them extremely weak if you ask their children where or how they receive their sustenance they will tell you from their genii  in every house in danish lapland there is a large black cat which is highly respected by them the laplanders talk to it as if it was a rational creature and go out of their huts every night with it to consult it alone and it will follow them like a dog either a fishing or hunting though this animal looks like a cat i should have believed it says the french gentleman whom i have mentioned had i had but a little more superstition to have been a familiar spirit ministering to them  whenever a laplander says lundius has occasion for his familiar spirit he calls to him and makes him come by merely singing the song he taught him at the first interview by which means he has him at his service whenever he pleases but they never appear to the women or enter into their service to exercise their sorceries they have recourse to certain instruments a drum knots darts spells and the like the magical drum called by the natives quobdas or rannus is made out of the hollow trunk of a pine fir or birchtree growing in certain particular places and turning according to the course of the sun it is made out of the root cleft asunder and hollowed out on one side over which they stretch a skin the other side is unequal with a handle raised by notching the wood deep on each side of it they resemble our kettledrums but are of an oval form on the skin which covers this drum they draw in red paint made of the bark of an aldertree boiled and beaten various figures of their own gods as well as of jesus christ the apostles sun moon stars birds and rivers whenever they are disposed to beat this drum which they often do with a short piece of reindeers horn the end of which branches out like the capital y they place a large brass ring with several small ones strung on it on a figure drawn for the sun in the center of the skin that covers this drum which when beaten dances over these figures and according to it is progress the sorcerer prognosticates the finlanders bordering upon norway and subject to the crown of denmark use these drums likewise they are considered as sacred things are always carefully wrapped up and never suffered to be touched by marriageable women if a family drum is to be removed from one part of the country to another it is either carried last of all and by the hands of a man or else must be brought by a quite different road or some untrod way lest if any one but more especially a woman should pass the same way after it it might endanger her health if not her life should it so happen says wormius that a woman is obliged to travel the same way through which the drum has been carried before she presents a brass ring for the use of the drum to break the enchantment  now these superstitious people weakly imagine they can effect four things by the help of this drum viz to learn what is passing in distant places though never so remote to know the good and bad success of any undertaking what issue any distemper is likely to have to cure diseases and to know what sort of sacrifice their gods are best pleased with the drummers are generally men who are bred to the profession live by it and those who wish to consult them pay in proportion to the enquiries they make he who beats the drum kneels down as do all the persons present and sings a song with a loud voice after he has done beating it he falls down with his face on the ground and the drum over his head as if in a trance the men and women present continue their singing without intermission till the drumbeater is awakened from his trance to put him in mind of what is desired to be known and take singular care that no fly or insect incommodes him for they imagine if he was either disturbed or they were to discontinue singing he never would come to life again when the man awakes from his trance in which he is sometimes many hours and during which time they conceive his soul to have left his body he tells what he has been able to learn by help of his drum  another instrument of their magic is a cord with knots which they use to raise a wind and northern masters of vessels are such dupes to the arts of these impostors as to buy these cords in order to procure the gale they have occasion for of three knots tied in this cord by loosening the first they are to have a tolerable fair wind at untying the second a very fresh gale but by loosening the third they are to have very tempestuous weather this art of magic is most practiced by those laplanders subject to the crown of norway and who live upon that coast the mariners of those seas are also weak enough to suppose that these magicians can stop a ship in full sail let the wind blow never so strong and that there is no remedy against this enchantment but by smearing the masts and doors of the vessel with the menstrual blood of virgins which was the opinion of pliny  lib    c   i am very apt to believe says he what is related of the menstrual blood viz that it destroys all magical arts if smeared only on the posts of the doors  the french traveller whom i have already mentioned gives us the following relation of this magical process but as his account is wonderful and not accompanied with his name we must leave the credit of it to our readers  we were becalmed on the finland coast some of our crew were so superstitious as to give credit to the common opinion that the inhabitants of the country under the articpolar circle as well as those that dwelt on the coasts of the sea of finland are windmerchants and can raise and sell a gale when they please it is certain they are almost all of them wizards and as children of the prince of the air pretend to dispose of the wind as their proper merchandise we were weary of lying upon that coast and this led us to try means to get off however impossible these means might seem to be the captain of our ship was for trading with the wizards accordingly he sent his longboat ashore with his mate to trade with some of these men and purchase a wind a commodity we then stood much in need of though i believed nothing of the matter i had the curiosity to accompany him we landed at the first village we came to and applied ourselves to the chief necromancer told him what we wanted and asked if he could furnish us with a wind that would last till we reached mourmanskimre the conjuror gravely replied no and told us his power extended no farther than the promontory of rouxella it being a great way to that place we thought if we got there we might easily make the northcape of course requested him to go on board with us and make his bargain with the captain the wizard consented took three of his comrades with him leaped into a small fishingboat and accompanied us to the ship the price was soon agreed on ten kronen about    or    shillings english and a pound of tobacco for which the wizard was to furnish us with a fair wind to rouxella the money being paid he tied a woollenrag to the corner of our foremast it was about half a yard long and a nail in breadth with three knots in it this was all the captain had for his ten kronen when the necromancer had done this feat he returned on shore with his companions the captain agreeable to the instructions he had received from the conjuror untied the first knot in the rag and it so happened that the wind immediately blew west southwest a brisk gale and carried us thirty leagues beyond maelstroom without giving our captain any occasion to untie the second knot and this accident confirmed our crew in their diabolical superstition this maelstroom is an eddy or whirlpool in the norwegian sea in which many vessels that approach too near it have perished of which we shall speak more in our account of norway the wind beginning to shift a little and inclining to the north our captain untied a second knot which kept it in it is old corner till we made the promontory of rouxella when we had passed it the needle of our compass turned back half an inch which led some to fancy there was lodestone in the mountain and had we not had a very dexterous pilot we should certainly have lost our course we were two days and two nights in this dangerous situation having nothing to depend upon but our pilots experience on the third day being far distant from the mountains of rouxella the needle of our compass pointed again to it is center from which we concluded that we drew near the northcape where the wind failing us our captain untied the third knot at which there arose a north northeast wind so violent that we thought the heavens would fall on us and that god was going justly to punish us for not relying on his providence but dealing with infernal artists we could bear no sail during the tempest our ship drove at the mercy of the winds and waves and we expected every instant to go to the bottom every one fell on his knees and begged gods pardon i own i never was so much afraid in all my life and i believe the whole crew were in equal consternation when by goodluck or through divine mercy the extraordinary force and agitation of the waves prevented our striking and drove us a musket shot off the rocks for we had been driven very near the shore on the fourth day the wind was laid and being pretty fair we in two days after put into port  a third instrument of their magic is a leaden dart about four inches long which they suppose the magician can send forth to a great distance to take revenge of their enemies who are thereupon seized with a cancerous tumor in the legs or arms so as to destroy them in three days  they have a variety of other magical contrivances to bring about certain purposes which it would tire the readers patience to relate the magic cord indeed to procure favorable winds is a very common traffic on the banks of the red sea and is managed with great address on the part of the magician who thus keeps up the price of his knotted talisman  chap vi of the diet of the lapland nation and their manner of catching their food etc the general diet of the people is not the same all over lapland for as the laplanders are divided into highland and woodland so there is a remarkable difference in their food the lapland mountainers or fiallappais says samuel rheen live upon their cattle and not being accustomed to fishing they live upon flesh cheese and milk all of which their reindeer supply them with besides which they frequently about midsummer purchase sheep goats and oxen from norway which they milk in the summer and kill in autumn their food then in the spring is chiefly cheese and dried fish in the winter scarce any thing but the flesh of reindeer boiled reindeer venison is very good food and the fat and marrow a delicacy as with us they eat also the blood of the reindeer boiled with water to the consistence of a poultice  the wood laplanders or graanlappars as they are called feed partly upon fish and partly upon wildfowl and wildbeasts which they catch in the forests among all the wildbeasts bears flesh is most in esteem and their greatest delicacy they have also certain sauces made of blackberries strawberries a kind of mulberries and the like of the wild angelica and the inner rind of the pine tree this is all the laplanders food for bread and salt are things known only to few as they neither sow nor reap they have no flour what they have is from norway instead of flour they use dried fish which they grind to powder instead of salt they season their food with the inner rind of the pine tree which they slice into thin skins no thicker than parchment dry in the sun then cut it into small pieces put it up close in boxes made of bark bury it in the sands for    hours kindling a good fire over the hole which turns it red and makes it very palatable as a relick of popery they abstain from flesh every friday eating fish milk or cheese they boil their meat fresh just enough to heat it through in order to preserve the gravy and make as they think their broth the better they frequently boil fish and flesh in the same kettle but their flesh dried in the sun or air they eat without further dressing boiling only the bones for the sake of the marrow  their drink is commonly water which to prevent it is freezing they keep in a kettle hanging over the fire but they occasionally drink the water in which their fish or flesh has been boiled and sometimes whey ale and beer used among other northern nations is unknown to them being destitute both of barley and hops but when they make merry or drink for pleasure french brandy is their liquor and nothing will so soon win their hearts as a present of it to allay the heat in the mouth occasioned by the brandy they use a juice of berries which they preserve against the winter the same french gentleman i have mentioned tells us that the laplanders of denmark have a sour liquor which they drink with greater gout than either beer or brandy and it is made by an infusion of juniper berries and a grain like lentils both which grow there in plenty they make a brandy of the same grain and it has the same effect as that drawn from the grape though it is as strong as french wine this traveller says they drink it as common drink among the swedish laplanders the use of tobacco is much in fashion which they purchase from norway and of which they make snuff indeed these northern nations where bread and salt is so scarce have so particular an inclination for tobacco that it is almost fatal to them  in the winter they eat within their huts in the summer on the grass without them they sit or lie down in a circle without any ceremony or precedence every one taking his place where he lights first and without either bench or stool but merely on a skin with their legs under them in this circle they draw a piece of board or stump of a tree before them by way of table their meat when taken out of the kettle is laid on a piece of woollen cloth for plates or dishes they have none and in better houses upon linen any liquid thing they put upon a wooden tray they take up their meat with their hands and for want of plates put it on their gloves or caps their drink is taken up in a wooden ladle which serves them for a cup they are great eaters when they have any thing to eat at other times can fast as well as those who have none are never sparing of their food but will eat day and night while it lasts though their general meals are but twice a day morning and evening there are two things they never omit at meals one is to say grace after them and next following the grace to exhort one another to mutual faith and charity giving each other the hand as a pledge of that reciprocal attachment which ought to subsist between persons of the same family whilst grace is said they lift up their hands by way of acknowledgment and the words are to this purpose good god be praised for this meat and grant that what we have now eaten may conduce to the strengthening of our bodies  having shown what the laplanders live on let us next see how they procure their food this is by hunting the chief employment of the men there are certain days of the year which they consider as ominous such as st catherines st marks and st clements on these they never hunt lest their bows should break and they should have illsuccess all the year after besides they never attempt to hunt till they have consulted their drum and if they meet a woman in their way they have small hopes of success it is for this reason as i observed that the women are never suffered to go out of their huts at the same door with the men they eat but little before they go abroad in hopes of returning soon and seldom take any food with them but a little reindeer marrow which they conceive strengthens their legs if they are not successful they fast the whole day  in summertime they hunt on foot with dogs which are of a very good sort both for scent and attack and to make them fiercer they keep them always tied up but in winter they track the wildbeasts in the snow and follow the track with long wooden scates on their feet which i shall presently describe small beasts they kill with bows and arrows the larger ones with spears and firearms ermines and beavers are caught in traps as we catch mice and squirrels they kill with blunt darts that their skins may not be injured indeed they are careful with pointed darts not to strike the animal in a part that will injure the skin and they are the best marksmen in the world hares are caught in snares and whoever finds one snared will always restore it to the right owner the reindeer is killed at rutting time by tying a do to a tree the bucks will soon come about her and when they are within gunshot they fire at them but in the spring they soon overtake them with their scates  bearhunting i shall treat of more particularly as it is attended with more than ordinary superstition the first step they take is to trace out the bears den by their track in the snow and he who finds it is said to have circumvented him and has the chief management of the hunt when a den is discovered they laplanders joyfully invite their relations and friends to the sport with the same ceremony as we invite our friends to a feast bearsflesh being their greatest dainty this is about march or april when the snow is deepest and they can best make use of their scates when their friends are assembled they fix upon a drummer who is to consult his drum whether they shall be able to kill the bear or not encouraged with the hope of success they march in good order to the forest he who traced the bear being at the head of them with a spear next to him walks the drummer and after him he who is to make the first attack and so on according to the office they are to be employed in one to kill the bear one to boil the flesh another to divide it and another to fetch water and wood and they are very particular not to encroach upon one anothers office when they reach the bears den they fall on courageously with spears and firearms till they have killed him this done they sing a song in token of their victory they have peculiar songs for this purpose that which they sing on killing him runs thus kittulis pourra kittulis iiskada soubbi jalla zaiiti which is thanking the bear for coming there and that he did not hurt their persons nor break their spears in killing him after they have proclaimed their victory they drag the bear out beating him with rods and small sticks they then put him on a sledge and draw him home where they mean to boil him singing all the way ii paha talki oggio ii paha talki pharonis that is praying the bear not to raise tempests or do any harm to his murderers the reindeer that draws the bear is not to be used any more that year as they approach their hut they are met by their wives whom in a song they request to chew some bark of an eldertree and spit it in their faces in order to give them the appearance of having lost blood in the encounter for the elderbark chewed is of a redcolour as each enters the backdoor his wife spits in his face they are no sooner entered than the women sing kittulis pourra toukoris i e thanks to you dear husband they then proceed to flea and boil the bear and feast upon it after which the men retire to a hut erected for themselves it being forbidden for any one present at a bearhunt to cohabit with their wives for the next three days no woman enters the huts where they boil the bear the skin is the property of the man who traced the animal and the flesh after they have eaten their fill is divided among them certain parts to certain men two are deputed to carry the womens share to their hut singing as they go olmai potti swerisgisandi polandi engelandi frankichis intimating that they came from foreign parts with the present from sweden poland england and france the women go out to meet them singing olmai potti swerigislandi polandi engelandi frankichis kalka kaubsis laigit touti tiadnat i e you men who are come from sweden poland england and france we will tie redstrings round your legs which they accordingly do all this over he who had the skin for his share hangs it on a pole for the women to shoot at with darts blindfolded singing at the same time and she who first hits the skin bears the bell her husband being supposed to be the man that shall kill the next bear the women then work tinwire crosses or pieces of cloth and these the hunters wear about their necks for three days to conclude the whole when the men after the three days return to their huts and wives each takes hold of a chain that suspends the kettle and after they have danced round the fire three times they run out at the common door the women singing and throwing ashes upon them as they go done as supposed as an expiation to cleanse them they being thought till after this ceremony unclean and not fit to cohabit with their wives  it being considered as the greatest piece of bravery in a laplander to kill a bear such as have adorn their caps with as many tinwire laces as they have killed bears  birds they kill with snares and firearms and as often as they kill one with a gun they pull out two of the largest feathers from the left wing and throw it down at the place where the bird was shot to appease the anger of the gods of the forest  it is evident from what has been said that the laplanders must use several sorts of weapons in hunting the first are their bows which are about three yards long made with birchwood lined with a slip of pine as giving a greater elasticity to them glued in by glue made of the skins of perch boiled these bows they draw by the mere strength of their arm but they have crossbows made of steel the string of which they draw by an iron hook fastened to their girdle setting the foot within a ring fastened to the head of the bow so that they have the whole power of the body to draw the string to the nut which holds it their arrows are of two sorts one pointed with iron or horn and the other blunt to kill an animal without wounding the skin their guns and crossbows they have from suedertramden a town of helfingerland famous for armourers and gunsmiths from whence also they are supplied with gunpowder and lead for shot the mountainers sometimes get their guns from norway and will give from eight to ten crowns for a good one  i mentioned above that the laplanders pursued wildbeasts over the snow by means of long wooden scates these are long slips of wood eight or nine feet in length and about twice as broad as the foot one scate is generally a foot longer than the other the bottom is covered with reindeer skin with the hair on the grain of which turns backwards in order to prevent their slipping back these are fastened to the feet by withs that govern the foot and the withs tied round the leg with these scates by the help of a stick with a round piece of wood at the bottom to prevent it is entering the snow will they drive themselves along so incredibly swift as to overtake the fleetest reindeer and what is astonishing they will by writhing and twisting their bodies ascend by windings the highest mountains and descend from the tops again without any danger of falling which seems next to an impossibility in climbing the rocks the hair of the skins with which the scates are covered prevents their going backward and when they descend their motion is as swift as the wind some use these scates better than others but those who are masters of the art of scating will travel  0 miles in a day and after drinking about a glass of wine will appear as fresh and hearty as if they had never stirred out the swedes call this way of sliding skriidabini  chap vii of their employment the chief employment of the men as i have observed is hunting but they have other business in providing the necessaries of life among these cookery claims the first place for all their food is procured and dressed by the men so that the women never interfere in the kitchen unless the men are absent the laplanders are also their own boatbuilders which are made of deal fastened or sewed together with twigs and calked with moss they are made about six yards long and about one and a half broad and are rowed with two or four oars and are so light that one man can carry them in these they will venture upon the most rapid rivers generally naked in summertime to be ready for swimming in case of oversetting and though they are timorous in other respects when they are going to some great fair or solemn meeting they will in these boats pass cataracts or waterfalls of half a league long betwixt the rocks without any sign of fear alleging that they are conducted on by their genii  they make also their own sledges which resemble a boat cut in half boarded up at the section these are round at the bottom so as to roll from side to side the forepart is turned upwards to prevent any interruption in passing the snow and the top covered before about a yard in length with sealskin stretched over hoops to keep out the snow under which they stuff moss or hay to warm their feet leaning with their back against the upright piece at the other end they are generally made about two yards long and just broad and capacious enough to hold one person  the men are also dexterous in making boxes and large chests which they inlay with bone they are also so clever at basketmaking that no other nation can come up to them these are made of the roots of trees steeped in hotwater and slit in long thin pieces so as to bend at pleasure which they twist and entwine so close together that they will hold water like a solid vessel these baskets are much esteemed in sweden and frequently transported into foreign countries for the goodness and beauty of their workmanship  they make all sorts of carpenters work and vessels hollowed out of wood with great art and a variety of useful things in horn and bone carved and inlaid they have also a method of cutting flowers beasts etc in bone by way of moulds in which they cast tin to wear on their girdles their hunting instruments they ornament very curiously all these things are made by the men each for his own family having received no instructions but from their parents or what they acquire from their own ingenuity  the employments peculiar to the women are making clothes and shoes for themselves and for the men and harness for the reindeer and to effect this they first make their thread of reindeer nerves which are beaten and prepared like flax some of these threads they cover with tinwire like our silver thread they also spin wool for swaddling clothes and knit their white haresfur into caps which the women wear as a defense against the cold and are softer than swansdown itself they also weave their fillets with a shuttle the method of drawing their tinwire deserves to be particularly mentioned they having no other instrument than a piece of horn with holes in it of different sizes through which they draw the wire with their teeth and will draw it as small as goldwire but in pieces of about an ell only in length with the thread covered with this wire they embroider their clothes and those women who are most expert at this are best esteemed they also embroider their glovetops boottops and shoes in so pretty a manner and enrich their apparel with tin plates cast in curious moulds and such a variety of spangles as in a sunshiny day make a very glittering appearance they decorate the trappings of their reindeer in a similar manner  laplanders   as the women take part with the men in all their journeys and each bears her share of the toil in traveling they wear breeches as well as the men in summertime they travel on foot in winter in such sledges as those described which having a flat part behind the person within leans against it with his back and is tied close in with linen or leatherfillets so as to leave only the upper part of their bodies at liberty this sledge is drawn by one reindeer not joined to it as we join our horses to a carriage but by a single rope fastened on a thick cloth round the animals neck and passing between his fore and hind legs to the prow or head of the sledge he who rides governs the beast with a single rein fixed to his head and horns which he holds in his right hand by a stick fastened at the end of it and by which he can throw the rein at pleasure either on the rightside or the left the sledge he governs with his left hand for being semicircular at bottom it requires some care to balance it lest it should overset they will thus travel says zeigler   0000 paces or  0 german leagues in    hours and the women are as expert in conducting this machine as the men the account of the journey made in      by order of the northern company erected at copenhagen by frederic iii gives the following description of the sledges in russian lapland and their manner of traveling in the winter but it is in my opinion too mavelous to be credited after we had agreed with our host says the writer for some reindeer to carry us farther into the country he sounded a horn at the door of his hut at which    or    reindeer came running to him instantly of which he chose six for so many sledges being provided with a guide when we were ready to go our host whispered in the ears of each reindeer certain words which we supposed were to direct them where to go and in an instant they began to run with incredible swiftness over hills and valleys continuing thus without intermission till seven oclock at night when coming into a pretty large village situate in a plain near a lake they stopped at the fourth habitation and all together struck with their feet against the ground the master of the house understanding the signal came and took us out of the sledges and we were soon equipped with other fresh reindeer after the master had whispered into their ears they ran very fast all night without keeping any certain road till about two or three oclock in the afternoon when coming to a small village on a hill near a forest these beasts stopped as the others did but meeting with no inhabitants we were obliged to bait them for an hour with the moss we could find and refreshed ourselves with what provisions we had this done we were for continuing our journey but it was not without a great deal of trouble that our guide could make them go further this being the place appointed by their master which obliged him to have recourse to his wits for he went into the adjacent wood and returning whispered into the reindeers ears three or four times so that at last they went on but not so fast as before  the women also assist the men in fishing for besides angling and dragging they kill a great deal of fish in the winter by thrusting their nets under the ice which they do by making holes in it above and introducing a stick and then by stamping upon the ice they frighten the fish into the net  chap viii of the amusements marriages language etc of the the laplanders that the laplanders are naturally inclined to idleness i have already shown let us then see how they dispose of themselves in their idle hours their most general way is in visiting and talking for as they lead a solitary life each family living separate in it is own hut at a considerable distance from one another they delight much in mutual conversation  at public meetings during their assizes and fairs which are chiefly in the winter season they have some sports peculiar to the men and others for the diversion of both sexes the men frequently try their skill in jumping over a line tied up at certain heights and over ditches and rivulets and also at shooting with a bow and arrow and wrestling and the women as well as men frequently play at a kind of trapball cards also make a part of their amusements and their games are those common to all europe  these are their sportive transactions among their solemn ones their marriages claim our first attention he who intends to marry looks out for a maid wellstocked with reindeer for it is the custom in lapland for parents to present their children as soon as born with one or more reindeer and so again when they cut their first tooth which for ever after with all their increase belong not to the parents but to those children they were given to so that by the time a girl is    or  0 years old with good luck she will be possessed of a numerous herd now the more reindeer a young woman has the sooner may she hope for a woer or a husband a laplanders attention as in this country being more drawn by a womans fortune than her person the poorer class of people are contented to marry the daughter of a man who lives in a convenient place for hunting and fishing  when a laplander has looked out for a wife which is commonly done at their public meetings at fairs or when they pay their tribute to the state he takes a journey to her father accompanied by his own father if alive if not by two or three persons whom he thinks will be best received and be most likely to intercede in his behalf when they reach the end of their journey they are all invited to come in except the suitor who stays without passing his time in some trifling employ till he is also invited in for without an express invitation it is considered as rude for him to enter with the rest after they have raised their spirits with brandy which they bring with them as a present and call the wine of good success the young mans friends enter on their business and the spokesman solicits the maids fathers consent and that he may not be wanting in respect he addresses him as if he was a prince calling him grandsire venerable father best and greatest of fathers bending his knee at every word he speaks if they were acquainted with the title of majesty they would give him that amongst the rest during this application the young woman is sent out of the way if the young man is admitted to address his mistress he goes immediately out of the hut to his sledge puts on his sundays apparel and she being called in he is suffered to salute her which is done not only by pressing their lips but their noses together after the salute he presents her with some of the best dainties the country affords which he takes out of his bosom as a reindeers tongue the flesh of a beaver and the like which she in the presence of others refuses to accept but being secretly called out they are again offered and if accepted the suitor requests leave to sleep near her in the hut which if granted the marriage is as good as concluded if she rejects his proposals she throws the presents at his feet but frequently notwithstanding her and her fathers consent the marriage is deferred for a long time sometimes two or three years for the young man is obliged to get the consent of all her kindred and relations which is generally not done but by presents in the mean time however he visits his intended bride occasionally and on his way diverts himself with some amorous song of one of which the following is a translation  kulnasatz my reindeer we have a long journey to go the moors are vast and we must haste our strength i fear will fail if we are slow and so our songs will do kaige the watery moor is pleasant unto me though long it be since it does to my mistress lead whom i adore the kilwa moor i never again will tread thoughts filled my mind whilst i through kaige past swift as the wind and my desire winged with impatient fire my reindeer let us haste so shall we quickly end our pleasing pain behold my mistress there with decent motion walking over the plain kulnasatz my reindeer look yonder where she washes in the lake the waters from her purer limbs nw clearness take these songs are not set to any tune nor always sung in the same manner but according to the taste and abilities of the singer  whenever they pay their mistress a visit they carry brandy with them as a present with tobacco and beavers kidneys powdered which they use as snuff should there afterward arise any difference or should the young womans father retract his promise he is by law obliged to pay for all the brandy and other things presented except that which was drank at the first meeting and it is but just he should for a father will sometimes keep a suitor in suspense a whole year in order to get from him what he can but should every thing succeed according to expectation the wedding day is appointed the day preceding it all the young couples relations meet at the brides hut where the bridegroom makes his marriage offerings according to agreement to the brides father perhaps a silver drinkingcup a brass kettle with a bed and bedding to the mother a silver girdle a long robe and a tippet or collar embroidered with silver to the brothers sisters and other relations silver spoons silver plates and such like the next day the marriage ceremony is performed at church by the minister and followed by a feast the bride and bridegroom appear in their best apparel the bride with a coronet on her head golden chains about her neck and rings on her fingers the bridegroom clothed in fine cloth with a silver girdle round his middle the first thing the bride does is to unloosen her hair and give the string to the maiden who is next of kin to her they then bind her hair with a silver fillet in imitation of a coronet as they enter the church the bridegroom is conducted in by the men and before the bride some virgins lead the way next comes the bride led or rather dragged along by a man and a woman and with a melancholy countenance as if reluctant to enter into the state of matrimony they are married after the lutheran ceremonial and when she is to say yes as a token of modesty and chastity it is with so low a voice as scarce to be heard even by the priest when the ceremony is over they return to the brides hut where they are entertained and where each of the guests brings his share of the provisions if the hut will not contain the whole company the boys and girls climb up to the top of it and by strings let down within with hooks at the end draw up their proportion of the feast when the wedding is over the newmarried man is not at liberty to remove his wife and goods immediately but is obliged to serve his fatherinlaw for a whole year after at the expiration of this time he may if pleases set up for himself when her father not only gives her the reindeer which he bestowed on her in her infancy with all their increase to the number sometimes of  00 but also all sorts of household furniture and a number of reindeer more as do all the rest of her relations  they are very ambitious of having a numerous family but seldom have more than seven or eight children as soon as a woman is delivered of a child she takes a large draught of whalesfat which is procured from norway and which is as rank as trainoil the infant is first washed with snowwater and immediately after when it can scarce draw breath it is plunged up to the neck in warm water there are women of so strong a constitution as not to keep at home after lyingin more than four or five days though the churches are very thinly scattered throughout this country sometimes at the distance of two or three hundred miles from each other yet the laplanders will carry their children when but fourteen days old all this way to be baptized through wide marshes thick forests and across the highest mountains in wintertime they carry them in sledges in the summer on a packsaddle over which the cradle with a child enclosed is hug but though the women are able to travel in fourteen days after delivery they do not cohabit again with their husbands till after the end of six weeks their cradles are made out of one piece of wood hollowed like a small boat covered with leather and lined with moss in which the infant is tied naked and when they take it out they wrap it up in soft warm skins with the hair on when the women travel on soon they sling the cradle child and all upon their backs like a knapsack children here grow very slow and are instructed by their parents in all that is necessary for them to know for there are no masters the boys are daily taught and very early to shoot at a mark and when they have been ny time accustomed to it are not suffered to eat till they have hit it and the laplanders are so expert at this exercise that they will hit an object of a quarter of an inch in diameter at a distance as far as they can see as a provision for the girls their fathers give each of them as i have before observed a reindeer or two at their birth another at the first tooth they cut and sometimes again others at other periods these with all their increase is the property of the child to whom it is given and if they are at any time exchanged for money or other things it is laid by for the childs use and should the parent die guardians are appointed to look after it  notwithstanding the laplanders undergo a great deal of hardship yet they enjoy a great share of health they scarce know what sickness is nor even those epidemical distempers which sometimes afflict whole countries there is no such thing in lapland as the plague putrid or inflammatory fevers nay should infection be carried there it would lose its virulency the only general disorder among them is sore eyes which is often the forerunner of blindness attributed to their constant sitting in smoky huts the mountaneers are often blind owing to the continual glare of the snow on the mountain sides they are sometimes however afflicted with the pleurisy inflammation of the lungs pains in the back and giddiness in the head and as they are subject to few disorders they are strangers to physicians and the use of those medicines with which we are acquainted having recourse only to such remedies as old women prescribe they live frequently to a great age to  0  0 and  00 years and are able at this time of life to traverse the highest mountains and most impenetrable forests so that whenever they die it is generally more from years than distempers when any one is dangerously ill the drum is consulted to know whether he will live or die if he dies let the disorder be what it will the hut where the corpse lies is forsaken till they proceed to bury it if a poor man the body is wrapped up in an old piece of woollen cloth if rich in linen and put into a coffin made of the trunk of a tree hollowed out oy a person hired for that purpose and who till the corpse is buried wears a brassring tied to his rightarm as a preservative against the harm which the manes of the deceased might otherwise do him those who live at a great distance from a church bury their dead in their sledges in the first convenient place and such as are less religious put into the sledge with them a hatchet flint and steel conceiving that as they are to wander through dark places they will have occasion for light and also a hatchet to open themselves through the woods a way to heaven but such as have been taught to believe in future judgment bury them in and near the churches and so despicable do they hold the office of a gravedigger that no laplander worth any thing will undertake it they generally employ a swede where they can get one and if not some very poor laplander the body of the deceased is buried according to the rites of the lutheran church attended by mourners not dressed up as in england in all the pride of woe but in their worst clothes and when the body is in the ground his sledge and clothes are left upon the grave left any infection should remain in them the third day after the funeral they have a feast where the chief dish is the flesh of that very reindeer which drew the body to it is grave and which is killed for the purpose and eaten in memory of the deceased by all his kindred and relations the bones of the reindeer are afterward collected and buried in a box  the french writer whom i have had occasion to mention more than once traveled from danish laplandy to that belonging to the crown of russia and he tells us that he once was present at a funeral in russian lapland when a person there dies says he the corpse is taken from the bearskins on which it lies and placed by six of his most intimate friends in a wooden coffin being first wrapped up in linen his face and hands only bare in one hand they put a purse with money in it to pay the porters see at the gate of paradise and in the other a pass signed by a priest to be given to st peter as a certificate that he was a good christian and ought to be admitted into heaven they also put into his coffin a barrel of brandy and some reindeer venison to eat and drink on the road having as they suppose a long journey to take they then place the image of st nicolas instead of a crucifix near the coffin and at a convenient distance from it pile up some fir tree roots and set fire to them weeping and howling plentifully and throwing themselves into a thousand different postures to show the extravagance of their real or affected sorrow  this st nicolas is not the one whose festival they celebrate in france but nicolas one of the seven deacons mentioned in the acts of the apostles they dress his image in a pilgrims habit in along robe with a camail or bishops ornament hanging down over his shoulders a broad girdle about his middle and a staff in his hand  when this noise and gesticulation is over they march round the corpse several times in procession asking the dead man why he died if he was angry with his wife if he wanted any thing if he was hungry or adry if he had lost his game at hunting if he had bad luck in fishing if he had not clothes to his mind and the like this done they howl again and limp and act like so many madmen the priest who assists at this solemnity and the mourners every now and then sprinkling the corpse with holy water  of the moveable effects which a laplander leaves behind him according to the constitution of sweden the brother of the deceased takes twothirds the sister one and as they bury their money in the earth to conceal it from their families if a father dies suddenly it is seldom found such reindeer as have been presented to the children in their infancy with all their increase come not into the division if they have any real estate as grounds lakes or hills they are not divided among the children but are the property of the whole family as well brothers and sisters as children founded on the division of the country by charles ix by virtue of which each family has it is peculiar allotment of land for which they pay an annual tribute the money they have among them is chiefly rixdollars but they seldom take any to their principal fairs of which there are two every year in each lapmark or province of lapland which hold two or three weeks at a time but deal by barter that is exchanging one commodity for another unless they wish to purchase any thing curious or rare when it is bought with money  i shall close this chapter with a few words on their language there is a great similarity between the language spoken in lapland and that in finland so that there is little doubt but that it originated in finland from whence the laplanders sprung each province has a peculiar dialect so that the natives of one lapmark will scarce understand those of another the lapland language like that of other nations has it is declensions comparisons conjugations moods and tenses and may be grammatically learnt  the following are some lapland words night ji an eye silmae a river jocki a nose niuna a lake jaur a father atkia ice jenga a mother am a mountain warra a bride morswi a forest medz heaven albine water kietze a bear muriet rain abbrae a fox reimmes snow mota a bow taugh a wolf seibik an arrow niaela  the laplanders have no characters of their own but their words are written with the roman letters such as are used by england and other european states their almanacks are indeed set up in runic characters like those used in sweden in former times there are few of the natives who can read and much fewer who can write this not being considered as a mark of education  chap ix of their religion and government the lapland nation as many others before them was after it had continued a long time in the darkness of paganism enlightened with christianity they did not embrace this religion from principle and conviction but to keep in favor with the crown of sweden by whom it was conquered in      and to avoid those penalties that were inflicted on the obstinate but it is to gustavus adolphus in      and to queen christina his daughter who succeeding him they owe the churches and schools that were first founded in that country the churches however are but thinly scattered scarce more than two or three in any one lapmark or province and in some not more than one before the close of the   th century the laplanders were so far from having any books written in their own tongue that they did not understand what letters or writing meant but certain portions of the bible and several religious books are now translated into the lapponian language and circulated among them and a number of ministers are appointed by sweden to attend their churches and instruct the people nay some of the lapland youths have of late years applied themselves with such success to the knowledge of literature and the study of divinity that they have been entrusted with the ministerial function when the lutheran religion took place in sweden it soon made it is way into lapland and continues there to this day though there are some remains of popery left such as abstaining from flesh on certain days signing themselves with the cross etc great part of the tribute paid by the laplanders to the crown of sweden is settled upon the clergy here and upon their families and has made them so independent that when they take their circuits throughout their respective districts as they do every year to teach and instruct those inhabitants who are a great distance from the churches they are treated with great respect veneration and hospitality they are very regular and attentive to all pious exercises and are seldom if ever heard to swear but with all the pains taken with them their ministers have not been able wholly to extirpate their ancient superstitions and their evil consequences thus they believe that the world was from eternity and will continue for ever that when the moon is eclipsed evil spirits are devouring it some days they call black and unlucky and others white and the reverse on the black days for example on the feasts of st mark st catherine st clement and the first day of christmas they will never go a hunting or do business of any moment as on these days they say spirits wander about and must be appeased by certain sacrifices they are also great observers of omens and make particular reflections upon what beast they meet with first in the morning they do not give entire credit to what is taught them concerning the resurrection of the dead the union of the soul and body and the immortality of the soul but they believe there remains something of us after death but know not what it is they also share their devotion between christ and their fictitious gods whom they worship at one and the same time among their idol deities there are three whom they adore with more than ordinary reverence thor storjunkare and the sun by thor is understood thunder or the god of thunder who has the disposal of mans life and death and the command of evil spirits they put the rainbow in his hand and say it is with this he shoots the demons storjunkare they consider as thors vicegerent and attribute to him the many blessings of human life it being their opinion that all animals are subject to his jurisdiction and they worship the sun as the author of procreation and the origin of light and heat to each of these deities they pay a peculiar worship and offer various sacrifices the place where they offer up their adorations to thor is generally a piece of ground consecrated for the purpose behind their huts and within the distance of a bowshot here they erect a kind of scaffold made of boards and resting upon feet not unlike a large table this is the altar on which their sacred images are placed and which they surround annually with branches of birch and pine and strew with their boughs and leaves to their god storjunkare they pay their worship at certain mountains banks of rivers or standing waters these places of worship are held so sacred that all women are excluded from them the image of thor is seldom any other than the stump of a tree shaped on the top like the head of a man into which they drive an iron nail with a small piece of flint to enable him to strike fire of the sun they have no peculiar image worshipping it under that of thor but storjunkare is represented by a large flint stone about a foot high full of holes such as they find in or near the highways their sacrifices are wholly performed by the men and prior to their offering them they always consult their drum to know what kind will be most acceptable their most usual sacrifices are the buck reindeer except to the sun which is always a young do though spirri nils a native of lapland says they sometimes will offer up cats dogs lambs and hens every year they make a new image of their god thor and consecrate it by anointing it with the oil and fat of the first sacrifice and burying the body sacrificed no sooner does a laplander approach the sacred altar but he makes a low reverence bareheaded and with bended knees places his offering on the table and fixes the horns of the reindeer on one side so that the table stands on a plat surrounded with horns  such is the idolatry and superstitious worship of the lapland gods which is continued to this day among many of the natives of that country  next is their government before they were called laplanders that is about the year  00 they were subject to the swedes as at present but were governed by a king of their own as a tributary prince they were not conquered by the swedes till the latter end of the thirteenth century when ladislaus though unwilling to be at the expense of an expedition against a set of vagabond savages yet as he could not endure that a people dwelling almost in the heart of his dominions should refuse obedience to his crown he invited private persons to undertake the conquest with the prospect of great advantages the bikarti their neighbors engaged in it and succeeded on this subject i cannot pass over in silence a plot laid by one of the bikarti for the execution of this design as it is recorded by buraeus one of these people having laid a scheme to surprise some lapland chiefs on the road as they were returning home from bikarti the northern parts of this country being destitute of inhabitants in those days he lay down in the highway through which they were obliged to pass and ordered his wife to cover him over with snow as this was in the night and the natives of lapland always walk single one before the other he rose unexpectedly upon them and with his sword put them all to death as they passed one ofter the other the darkness of the night and their distance from each other furthered his design till the last man happening to stumble over some of the dead bodies perceived his danger and made a brave resistance but the inhabitant of bikarti seconded by his wife at last overcame him and slew him the laplanders thus bereaved of their leaders were soon brought into subjection by the craftiness of one man from this time lapland became subject to the bikarti as tributaries to the crown of sweden things continued thus till the reign of gustavus i who in      took the reins into his own hands and sent governors into lapland of his own appointment and it continued thus till the reign of charles ix when the government of that country was reduced to it is present state  the laplanders are governed by the swedish laws and have now under their king a provincial judge a senator of sweden called by them lagman and his deputy called underlagman next to them an interpreter of the law and several others whose office it is to hear and determine causes from whom there lies an appeal to the court of sweden but as the capital crimes of theft rapine murder and adultery are scarce known in lapland and no one either lends or borrows money every one living contented on what he has there are but few causes that give rise to those contentions which employ so many lawyers in other countries  whenever a judge gives sentence either in a civil or criminal cause it is always in presence of a priest from an opinion that when a priest is by the judge will be restrained from acting unjustly  the tribute they pay the crown of sweden is either the tenth part of their reindeer or three rixdollars for each deer and a pair of shoes as carriagemoney of the deer to the kings storehouses or treasury a considerable part of which is allotted as i observed for the maintenance of the clergy besides this they pay something to the king of denmark and the great duke of muscovy not that they are any way subject to these princes but in return for the many advantages they receive from their territories having liberty to hunt and fish there  upon the whole the inhabitants of lapland though dwelling in a cold and icy region that affords them few of those comforts and conveniences which other nations boast of are far from unhappy or without their blessings basilisks scorpions serpents and suchlike venomous creatures are never heard of thunder and lightning seldom disturb their rest and whenever it does happen is neither violent nor of any long continuance earthquakes and pestilential diseases which make such ravages in southern and eastern countries are both unknown in lapland  add to this they dwell in their cottages in the utmost security free from all danger of an insulting enemy from the dread of bombs and other murderous instruments and from the fear of being condemned to the galleys or being carried into slavery should they ever be attacked by any hostile power which never yet was done or from their situation likely to occur they have this to console them that without much trouble they may avoid their fury they have nothing to do but to pack up their furniture cottages and all and with their whole family remove them on the backs of their reindeer till the danger is past to inaccessible woods unknown to any but themselves  in short the serene winters the most delightful and light summer nights and the pure and wholesome air they enjoy together with that prodigious plenty of fish with which their rivers end lakes are stored the vast number of wildfowl and beasts the produce of their woods the pleasantness of many of their valleys the richness of their silver copper and iron mines the refreshingness of their brooks and the murmuring noise of their waterfalls contribute to entice a considerable number of inhabitants to this remote corner of the north  chap x a general account of russian lapland from took and others russian lapland is about eight hundred miles in diameter and yet contains no more than twelve hundred national families the people are of a middling stature have a flattish face fallen cheeks darkgrey eyes thin beard brown hair are well built straight and of a yellowish complexion occasioned by the weather the smoke of their habitations and their habitual filthiness their manner of life renders them hardy agile and supple but at the same time much inclined to laziness they have plain common sense are peaceable obedient to their superiors not given to theft not fickle cheerful in company but mistrustful cheats in commerce proud of their constitution and country and have so high a notion of it and of themselves that when removed from the place of their nativity they usually die of the nostalgia or longing to return their women are short complaisant chaste often wellmade and extremely nervous it frequently happens that a woman will faint away or even fall into a fit of phrenzy on a spark of fire flying toward her an unexpected noise or the sudden sight of an uncommon object though in it is own nature not in the least alarming in short at the most trifling things imaginable during these fits of terror they fight with every thing that comes in their way and when they come to themselves again are totally ignorant of every thing that passed  in familiar conversation hearers often move their lips exactly as they do who are speaking  as the consequence of a russian laplander is derived from his reindeer and property they are anxious to have large possessions and hence it is that their disputes are chiefly about inheritance and this covetousness renders them deaf to the cries of the poor as they dare not use a reindeer that has once drawn a dead body to it is grave the interment of a parent will often cause a long litigation among the children  a laplander often runs away to some neighboring canton to avoid the punishment annexed to some trifling offense and this retreat is as important to him as an european would think a flight to the east indies  notwithstanding the introduction of christianity into this country the laplanders have preserved the manners of the nomades or shepherd people so that they turn not their hands to husbandry they are either fishers or hunters but are often masters of large property in herds some will possess from  00 to  000 reindeer and a great quantity of silver in money and plate they mark their deer on the ears and range them into classes so that they constantly know whether any one is strayed away though they cannot count so great a number those who possess but a small stock give each of them a name they castrate the males which they mean not to keep for propagation by crushing the testicles with their teeth such reindeer grow alert strong large handsome and tame these are for draught and they are held in such estimation that when they mean to pass a compliment they will call one another haerze jez that is a gelded reindeer they hunt in snowshoes like the swedish laplanders and travel as they do and when they come up with large animals as wild reindeer wolves etc they frequently knock them down with heavy clubs  the dress of this people is like that of the swedish laplanders only that they carry about them in their pouches pipes and tobacco for smoking  they carry on commerce with the norwegians and sell and buy with money the balance of this trade is in favor of the laplanders because they can furnish more skins and furs than they lay out in flour oatmeal clothes knives hatchets and other hardware hence it is they pay their taxes in current coin though they are at liberty to pay them in skins and furs  whenever they are inclined to eat the head of the family spreads a mat drello on the ground covers it with dishes and men and women squat round it every russian laplander carries about him always a knife a spoon and a little cup to drink out of each has his portion separately given him that no one may be injured for they are great eaters before and after meals they say a short prayer and when the meal is over shake hands with each other in their visits they also give the hand and kiss saying bueriss or pueress i salute thee they spread clothes on the ground for their guests to sit on the chief place of distinction is between the master and mistress after dinner they introduce fruit and tobacco when they smoke they spit in their hand and snuff the spittle up their nose on paying a visit to a person of distinction they carry him presents and give the name of bouorazt to whom they wish well to  the laplanders do not use the hotbath so universal in russia but every saturday which is with them the holiest day in the week both sexes bathe in rivers together  all the money which they have not immediate occasion for they bury in the earth as they do their plate and other things of value nor will they at the point of death say where it is hidden conceiving they shall want it in the other world owing to this great part of their property is lost  many of their children die by the hard manner in which they are brought up but those who survive are generally robust and alert living free from care temperance and continual exercise contribute much to their strength of constitution and this is assisted by their taking care to build their houses on an elevated spot yet notwithstanding all this they seldom live to an advanced age  the common diseases of the country are the itch the phthisic and putrid fevers besides inflammations of the eyes general in all places where the habitations are smoky the venereal disease is unknown here their remedies are chiefly idle charms and superstitious ceremonies in wounds however they apply turpentine and for the itch they bathe in water in which birchbark has been infused in internal disorders they drink the fresh blood of a wild reindeer if they feel any external pain their usual remedy is fire they light mushrooms prepared like touchwood and burn it on the part affected till the skin cracks and bursts  as among the jews sterility is a kind of reproach so is it among the women of russian lapland they are generally delivered without difficulty the husband assists at the labor for without this practice they would often be distressed their habitations being so far distant from each other  the laplanders of muscovy and those of norway are equally superstitious and fertile in apparitions and childish tales they never mention the bear by his name but call him the old one with the fur cloak they imagine also that their magicians have the power of controuling the winds and the rain of producing and destroying insects of speaking to spirits and a thousand other fooleries but they believe at the same time that thunder is inimical to magicians and hence this proverb if it was not for thunder the world would be destroyed by magic  of the christian laplanders there are two communions those of the greek and lutheran churches and there are of both sects many very well meaning honest men  a map of sweden norway and denmark map of sweden norway and denmark  a description of norway from pontoppidan bishop of bergen in norway in    0 and others chap i of the country in general by norway is understood the northern way it is bounded on the south by the entrance into the baltic sea called the scaggerac or categate on the west and north by the northern ocean and is divided from sweden on the east by a long ridge of mountains it lies between    and    and half degrees north latitude and is according to the best estimation in a direct line through the air  0  norway miles or about  0 0 english long and it is breadth from the frontiers of sweden toward the northern ocean about the   d degree is about    norway miles or     english from thence the country becomes gradually narrower toward the north in the frigid zone where norwegian lapland or finmark is situated but as this part of norway is sufficiently described in our account of lapland we must refer our readers to that for a knowledge of this part of the country our design here being only to speak of norway from the   th degree southward  the air light warmth etc varies much more in norway than in most european countries according to it is extent and exposure to the sea in the beginning of the year the daylight increases rapidly and decreases at the approach of winter in the same proportion in the middle of february says pontoppidan i have been able to read without difficulty at six in the morning which at the same hour in october was not possible in summernights the horizon when unclouded is so clear and luminous that at midnight one may read write and do every kind of work as in the day christian v during his stay at drontheim which is in    degrees  0 minutes north in june      used to sup at midnight without the use of lights in the district of tromsen which is properly the extremity of norway toward the finmark islands about the   th degree the sun is continually in view in the midst of summer and in the depth of winter it is invisible for some weeks and all the light perceived at noon is a faint glimmering of about an hour and a halfs continuance which as the sun never appears above the horizon chiefly proceeds from the reflection of the rays on the highest mountains the summits of which are seen more clearly than other objects but this is not the only light there is besides the moonshine which by reflection of the mountains is exceedingly bright in the valleys and creeks so that the fishermen are well able to follow their employ at times when their daylight is contracted to six hours the aurora borealis or northern lights enables them to continue their business  the degrees of heat and cold are in norway various beyond conception and not only from the annual vicissitudes of the seasons but in the very same season and on the same day in most of the provinces the winters cold generally sets in about the middle of october lasting till the middle of april when the waters are continually frozen to a great thickness and the mountains covered with snow the intenseness of the cold is so great that in january and february the largest rivers with their roaring cataracts are arrested in their course by the frost and the very spittle is no sooner out of the mouth than it is congealed and rolls along the ground like hail and no sooner has a horse dropped his dung on the ice than it moves and leaps about owing to the sudden change from heat to cold which occasions a violent conflict when the sharp and dense air penetrates forcibly into the lighter and expells it  it is necessary to use great caution in such weather in which an unexperienced and unguarded traveller may be deprived of his nose and ears the natives cover their faces with a piece of gauze and some rub their faces with snow but in long journeys over the highest mountains where the air is much keener and the winter quite insupportable no precautions will avail without the convenience of mountainstoves or houses with fire in them which are kept at the public charge for the repose and warmth of travelers of the impracticability of traveling over these mountains in the winter months the swedish history affords a melancholy instance in february      seven some say nine thousand swedish soldiers with their officers perished on the mountain of ruden or tydal which separates jempteland in sweden from the diocese of drontheim without any other enemy than the extreme cold which surprised them on the ridge of that mountain where no one could come to their assistance  in the autumn of the preceding year in a war between the danes and swedes this corpse which then consisted of ten thousand men had penetrated into the country and appeared to have a design upon drontheim to clear a passage for the main army but the danish general budde made such good dispositions against the enemy that they laid aside their design of attacking drontheim and cantoned themselves among the norway peasants advice however soon after coming that count sponeck was in full march toward them they had orders to make the most precipitate retreat over those desert and lofty mountains but just as they had reached the frontiers of their own country they were overtaken by a storm accompanied with an extreme cold and much snow which so bewildered them that the greatest part of them perished a company of  00 norwegian sledgemen under major emahus which followed them close to observe their retreat found the enemy dead upon the mountains some sitting some lying and some in a posture of prayer all frozen to death how great must have been their distress may be judged from their cutting their muskets to pieces in order to burn their stocks generals labarre and zoega were among the dead but generals alderfield and horn barely escaped with their lives and of the whole body only   00 or according to others no more than  00 survived this dreadful catastrophe  but the severity and inconvenience of this cold it has pleased the creator to tempr with some advantages and a greater variety of preservatives against it than other countries afford this frost and snow facilitates the conveyance of goods by land for without it they can neither convey the timber they have felled to the water nor carry their goods to market in their sledges the country abounds in large forests affording them plenty of fuel and timber for building the wool of the sheep and the furs and skins of wildbeasts furnish them with warm linings for their clothes and good bedcovering the innumerable flights of wildfowls supply them with down and feathers the mountains themselves serve for fences and retreats and above all it is to be observed that even the cold air occasions warmth in the human body by rendering it more firm and compact and fortifying it against external injuries thus is the natural warmth by the closeness of the pores repelled toward the inner vital parts particularly the stomach so that the northern people are known to digest smokedflesh dried fish and and other food hard of digestion better than any other nations in short i may venture to affirm says pontoppidan that were the norwegians tempted by any thing to change countries with the italians the winters cold would not be their motive for this is the least of their complaints and for my part says he speaking of bergen which lies in the   st degree of latitude i cannot say that the cold here has ever been more painful to me than in other parts  we must here also mention a wonderful instance of divine economy respecting the weather which we should hesitate to commit to writing did not thousands of witnesses confirm it when the winter rages with such severity in the east parts of norway that all the fresh waters are frozen the lakes and bays are open on the west side though lying in a direct line with the eastern parts the air is misty and cloudy and the frosts are seldom known to last a fortnight or three weeks in the center of germany which is  00 leagues more to the south the winters are generally more severe and the frosts sharper than in the diocese of bergen which extends to the   d degree north where the inhabitants wonder to read in the public papers of frost and snow in poland and germany at a time when no such weather is felt here the harbors of amsterdam hamburg copenhagen and lubeck are frozen ten times oftener than ours for with us it is generally known not to happen two or three times in a whole century and what is yet more extraordinary when the harbor of bergen is frozen the seine at paris may be concluded to be in the same condition thus is our winter at bergen so very moderate that the seas are always open to fishermen and mariners and it is seldom that the bays and creeks are frozen over except those that reach far up the country where they meet with keen and dry northeast winds blowing from the land as far as the  0th or   d degree the northsea continues open and navigable both winter and summer except in the creeks and along the shores in finmark iceland and greenland from whence the large masses of ice being detached are seen to float in the sea  the amazing difference of weather in the same latitude which arises from natural causes is according to the wise design of the creator requisite for the wellbeing of the country for the eastern parts require a hard winter for the subsistence of their inhabitants to enable them to carry their goods a great way to market and take back necessaries whereas mild and open weather is no less necessary to the western parts where the inhabitants chiefly maintain themselves by their seafisheries it is expedient for them that the sea should be open during the whole winter for from the middle of january herrings scates cods etc are chased by the whales toward the coasts when peasants sally out in multitudes from the creeks into the sea and thus procure a great part of their subsistence for the whole year and several thousands of the northern peasants of both sexes during the months of january and february pass the whole day upon the open sea and only toward the approach of night betake themselves to their huts in the neighboring islands the mildness of the winter is likewise necessary for curing and salting the fish which in frosty weather would be spoiled and useless  after this account of the cold in norway it is proper to say something of the heat in the summer months it is not only warm but hot to such a degree from the reflection of the mountains and other causes that persons who have been born and brought up in sultry climates might fancy themselves suddenly transported home but these heats are of short duration were they of longer continuance they would bring grapes and other fruits and vegetables to the like exquisite perfection as in other countries  there cannot be a more decisive proof of the summers heat in norway than that several vegetables and particularly barley grow up and ripen within six weeks or two months it is certain that where nature has but a short time to work she accelerates her operations and acts with greater energy in our northern gardens it is indeed seldom that the winter fruits can attain to their proper maturity but those of the summer keep pace with the fruits of denmark where strawberries cherries and the like are ripe so early as the first of july  from these instances it is but candor to admit that however natural and lasting the cold may be in norway yet the impartial sovereign of nature has not so far neglected the inhabitants but they may pass their days agreeably especially when the salubrity of the air is considered in the middle of the country particularly about the mountains the inhabitants have scarcely an idea of sickness unless it be hereditary or contracted by intemperance it is reported that in the vale of gulbrand which is regularly visited by very salubrious gales especially in the parish of laessoe there are persons of such an extreme age that from a weariness of life they get themselves removed elsewhere in order to die the sooner that farther in the province of valders and in other parts meal may be kept many years without any damage a proof of the purity and dryness of the air from this wholesomeness of the weather medicine is very little understood and practitioners in physic meet with very few patients whilst lawyers are never at a loss for clients  it is only in the chief towns that physicians are to be met with where they are established as provincial practitioners with a public salary and notwithstanding this have but little employ in the populous city of bergen where there are  0000 people there are but two physicians and these two are sufficient  there is a great deal of rain in norway occasioned by the clouds pressing against the mountains and these frequent showers are of great use to vegetables for in a rocky soil where the earth lies very shallow was it not for this constant humidity the crops would be burnt up in the vale of guldbrand and other parts where the mountains are not steep and general and of course the rains not so frequent water is conveyed into the fields by trenches and thrown upon the cultivated lands by scoops as is practiced in persia and other hot countries the great mountain of filefield makes a very remarkable difference in the weather between it is two sides when it is fine weather on the eastern side it shall not be so on the western and vice versa for the course of air when impelled against the highest mountains is checked seldom ascending high enough to pass over them and this is not uncommon in other mountainous countries for we are informed in paul van caardens voyage to the east indies that whilst the summer season lasts from cape cormarin to the coast of coromandel it is winter during that time from diu to the aforesaid cape in like manner on one side of the mountain called gates or ballagates the fields are clothed in their verdure and the country appears in all the gaiety and luxuriancy of summer whilst on the other it is covered with fogs and rain  in the northern and eastern parts of norway the snows are very thick and lie long on the ground but in this respect are very beneficial to the peasants enabling them as we observed before to transport their commodities to distant markets in traveling over the snow they make use of truviers a kind of snowshoes broad and round made of withies keeping the feet from sinking in the snow and sometimes they are obliged to cover their horses feet with the same they have another contrivance for traveling on the snow which are long and thin pieces of board fixed to the feet so smooth that the peasants will slide with them over the snow with the expedition of ships under full sail these are the scates which the laplanders use and which we described in our account of that country they are here called skies in time of war a corpse of four or six hundred of these skiemen are very serviceable as light troops for reconnoitring procuring intelligence or for any sudden enterprise no place being inaccessible to them and they being always sure of coming upon the enemy by surprise though the snow has it is advantages it has also it is inconveniences among these the greatest is the sneefond that is when a mass of snow falling from a mountain top shall overwhelm both men and cattle and demolish houses a century or two ago for the precise time is not certainly known a whole parish situate between quindherret and hardanger was wholly covered by a snowfall and so remains to this day the snow which had fallen from the adjacent mountains not dissolving the year after was gradually increased and hardened by lying the situation being high and hemmed in among the mountains something like the famous eisblinc in greenland of which we have given a description and plate in our account of that country many lives were lost in that disaster of which no memorial would remain were not the truth of the story which was at first much doubted still confirmed by several utensils such as scissars knives basins etc brought to light by a rivulet which runs under the snow an incontestible evidence that this spot was formerly clear of snow and inhabited experience silences all cavils on this head the snow being known by age to become so firm and indurated that a horses shoe makes no impression on it and as it yields very gradually to the sun it is thus sparingly dispensed for the daily benefit of the inhabitants in the vales except in a damp southerly wind which penetrating the snow the mountains pore down whole torrents these accumulated snows thus become constant springs for promoting vegetation in the open grounds below and when these springs are too early exhausted the grass and corn inevitably suffer and are sometimes withered for want of moisture these currents likewise by their impetuous descent drive great numbers of little mills every farmhouse having it is own mill another advantage arising from these snows is that cattle which in summertime are turned out upon the mountains for pasture are so extremely tormented with heat musketoes and gnats that they run about regardless of danger and in this frenzy many have lost their lives falling down the precipices which lays the peasants under a necessity where no snow is near of erecting sheltering places for the cattle but if any snowhill be in sight the cattle move toward it knowing that they shall there be relieved by the coolness which it communicates to the air a further remarkable instance of divine goodness in this case is that just as far as the snow melts and runs from the mountains the very best grass is observed to grow and in the greatest plenty  the wind in this country is generally southerly seldom directly west but sometimes southwest or southeast a north northwest and particularly a north northeast wind are little known here but when they do blow they verify the words of solomon the north wind drives away rain eastwinds are here temperate and bring dry weather whereas southwinds bring rain the inhabitants of the large province of nordland who in not less than  00 barks visit bergen every year at the fair and assizes and most of whom have a hundred leagues to sail are often favored with north and southwinds like regular tradewinds though not so infallibly to be depended on  besides these regular winds the coast is subject to waterspouts and also to fieldflagers or mountainsqualls that is gusts from the land by which without the utmost precaution a vessel is suddenly lost in the security of fine and calm weather but the real hurricanes or whirlwinds are known to be extremely dangerous to ships by their sudden and rapid vortexes which throw the sea at a small distance into such an agitation that the water in drops flies up into the air like smoke the common people from an old superstition call them ganskud conceiting that a necromancer of finlapland has then sent out his ganfly to do mischief these are small flies which the lapland magicians preserve to deceive the people in this particular and which the reader may find a further account in our description of that country  as the mountains of norway consist in general of rocks intermixed with quarries of marble freestone slate etc which toward the sea are almost stripped of earth by the force of the winds and further up in the country are covered indeed with earth but not more than a few yards deep and often less one would be apt to think that below this slender covering the whole kingdom of norway is but one solid stone only of a different nature figure and height but the error of such a conclusion is evident not only from the many deep creeks running up the country but fresh water lakes swamps and fens in some of which though sounded with lines of several hundred fathoms no bottom has ever been found and add to this that however mountainous and craggy norway is thought to be yet it affords many champaign wellcultivated tracts of land of six eight or ten leagues in extent the mountains are so extensive that to pass them a man must sometimes travel  0 miles to pass hardanger he must travel  0 miles and the rivers and cataracts which intersect these dreadful precipices and are passable only by slight tottering wooden bridges render traveling in this country very terrible and dangerous  swamps and marshes lie both on the ridges of the mountains and in the valleys at the foot of the steepest precipices these in many places render the ways very unsafe being passible only in the driest summer months and sometimes not even then unless as is the case a kind of causeway is formed over them at the public charge with thousands of logs and large pieces of timber laid across the marsh which are soon rotten in these places the ground is as soft as dough yielding and moving under the foot there being probably beneath these marshes an abyss of standing water which is thus weakly vaulted over near laessoe in the diocese of christiansand this kind of timber causeway is carried on for near a mile and if a horse or much less animal happens to make the least wrong step he sinks beyond recovery the earth indeed here as in many other countries seems to have a vegetative or selfrenewing power for there are a great many peat bogs in which bodies of large firs and pines which the turpentine has preserved are found some yards under ground which shows the earth to have been gradually filled and as it were grown up from a mixture of leaves twigs moss reeds and the like that entire skeleton of a whale accidentally found in      in tistedale near frederickshall is a further proof of the same it was found buried with earth and sand   0 feet under ground  to give the reader some better idea of these mountains we will describe that of filefield to him the height of which is upwards of two miles and a half and the road over it by a tedious ascent through many windings to it is summit it is great elevation may be known from the change from heat to cold which as we rise it becomes so sensible that the traveller may very well suppose himself transported from a hot summer to a piercing winter i crossed it says bishop pontoppidan on the   th of may      having the day before observed the barley in the low grounds to be in great forwardness and the heat in the narrow valleys thereabouts so sultry that at noon i was obliged to shelter myself in borgen chapel but after a few hours progress up the mountain of filefield i found myself rising as it were into the upper region of the air toward the pure and subtle ether and as much in the depth of winter as if it had been new years day surrounded with snow and ice the sun shone bright but with so little heat that though it was within three weeks of midsummer all the waters were frozen particularly the fresh water lakes there i was very desirous of returning being diffident of the assurances of my guides that the ice would bear for as the snowwater lay upon it i apprehended it might give way however i got over in my sledgechaise which as is here customary was drawn by peasants and not by horses from the top we have a prospect to the extent of   0 miles in crossing from this mountain we are obliged to pass a tremendous cataract which divides it and into which an enormous piece of rock larger than any castle has fallen and by obstructing the passage of the waters causes a dreadful roar it serves however as a pier to support a wooden horsebridge from one mountain to the other the passage or highroad down the side of one eminence of the mountain and up the side of the other is seldom more than a ledge cut out of the rock broad enough for two horses to pass and often for considerable lengths a passage only for one without any rails or fence as indeed it is impossible to fix any these ways or ledges hang on the sides of perpendicular and craggy steeps of stupendous height in some places cut through the rock in arched passages in others the road is merely a scaffold three feet broad shored up with stonework or suspended by ironbolts fastened in the mountains side should it happen as it occasionally has that two men on horseback should meet in one of these narrow ways where two cannot pass and at some distance from a wider spot so that they cannot back their horses there is no alternative but one mans raising himself above the head of the other by a rope fastened filefeild to a crag of the rock above whilst the other pushes his horse down the precipice into the water below by which means he passes and the other lowering himself down travels on afoot  over filefield is the high post road and the way is marked all along with posts at two or three hundred paces distance that in snowy or dark weather the traveller may not lose himself in these desert wilds where no living creature is to be met with except here and there a few wild reindeer  in some measure to refresh and relieve the traveller two mountainstoves or resting houses are maintained on filefield at the public charge and three on dofrefield and furnished with fire light and kitchen utensils there is but one way of avoiding this chain of mountains in the road from sweden to nordenfields and that is in a hollow where it seems interrupted by a long and deep valley reaching from romsdale to gulbrandsdale and this low road many prefer in their journies from the highlands to the seacoasts or to romsdale market it was in their march through this long defile that a body of  000 scotch sent over in      as auxiliaries to the swedes were put to the sword by the peasants of gulbrand who never give quarter these precipices and narrow passes are the best fortifications in the world  in many of the mountains in this country are vast cavities in that of torghatten in the district of helgeland which stands out in the sea is a large hole quite through it about half way up possibly throughout   0 else in height and  000 in length through which the sun may be seen on the top of this mountain is a piece of water or reservoir the size of a moderate fish pond the rainwater which gathers there trickles down it is sides through fissures and cracks in it is lower part is a cave full of rugged windings in which a line of  00 fathoms was dropped out of curiosity to measure it is hiatus but no bottom could be found  in the mountain of dolsteen there is also a wonderful cavern similar to that in the peak of derbyshire it is entrance is twelve feet broad and six feet high no sooner are you entered but it is breadth and height increases to the dimensions of a large church the sides of which are perpendicular and the roof vaulted about the middle there is a descent like steps which leads so low that those who are within hear the dashing of the waters for it joins the sea over their heads there are more steps that lead still lower but no one has found himself courageous enough to venture further stones have often been thrown down and the echo of their fall has continued for a minute but whether it fell into water or on rock could never be distinguished the length of this cavern may be judged of by two candles being burnt out in going through it and returning  in the district of evindvig six leagues north of bergen in a place called stenesund is a mountain whose sides for a great height from the water and for half a quarter of a league next the sea abound with such petrified bodies as are sought for in the cabinet of virtuosos many kinds of cornua hammonis large and small snakes muscles worms insects and many others this cannot be called a lusus naturae appearing as it were to have been impressed into a paste or dough and no rational enquirer can entertain any doubt that the rock was once as soft as dough when these bodies were intermixed with it this with other circumstances confirms the opinion that rocks in general were once in a soft state but petrified by time  in the highlands of norway the villages cannot be so large compact and convenient as in other parts but the houses lie scattered among the valleys generally at half a quarter of a leagues distance in some places as in the creeks of ulland and nordal the peasants houses stand so high and on the edge of such a steep precipice that ladders are fixed to climb up to them so that when a priest is sent for who is unacquainted with the road he risks his life and more so in the winter in such places a corpse must be let down with ropes or be brought on mens backs before it is laid in the coffin the mail likewise in winter must at some distance from bergen be drawn up over the steepest mountains these things with the difficult roads owing to the narrow passes on the mountains sides the sudden rising of the rivers which must be either waded through or crossed on ruinous bridges the east clefts in the rocks occasionally covered over with snow and in which sometimes a traveller or animal is lost the shelter these mountains give by their cavities to beasts of prey and the breaking and falling of eminences to the destruction of houses and cattle below are the inconveniences attending such a country but when the reverse of the picture is contemplated we shall have reason to adore the beneficent creator who withholding from mankind some benefits is pleased to bestow on him others  where a sheep or goat chance to make a false step and fall into a projection called a mountainhammer from whence it can neither get higher or lower a peasant will cheerfully venture his life for it and descending from the top of a mountain by a rope of some hundred fathoms will sling himself on a crossstick till he can get his foot on the place where his goat is when he fastens it to the rope and it is drawn up with himself but the most amazing circumstance says pontoppidan is that he will run this risk with the assistance only of a single person who holds the end of the rope or fastens it to a stone if there be one at hand for though one man cannot draw up the weight of another with the addition of a sheep still as the man let down can help himself by the craggs of the rock it is easily effected there are instances of the assistant himself having been dragged down and sacrificing his life in fidelity to his friend on which occasion both have perished of these melancholy and not unfrequent accidents of a man or a beast falling some hundred fathoms from the precipices it is observed that the resistance of the air against the falling body is so great that they are not only suffocated and deprived of life long before they reach the ground but their bellies burst and their entrails gush out this circumstance throws a light on an obscure passage in the new testament acts      falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst  where part of a mountain breaks away and falls down on the country if the pieces are but small the damage is but slight but sometimes though not often entire crests of rocks some hundred fathoms in length and breadth have fallen which occasion a violent agitation in the air and has all the appearance of a prelude to the general destruction of the world when they fall into a creek or any deep water the fragments are out of sight but their submersion causes such an agitation of the water as to overflow and carry away the adjacent houses  besides the collecting of clouds and dissolving them in rain which mountains do besides their masses of snow reservoirs and springs which send down large and small currents of water fertilizing the lands below and turning as we observed infinite number of mills it is well known that though the surface of these mountains are too hard to be ploughed they afford large and excellent pasturage and the property of the northern peasants in oxen sheep goats etc would be considerably reduced were it not for the spacious range here met with mountainous countries may also be considered as the storehouses or treasuries of providence where are laid up and from whence he kindly dispenses according to the exigencies of the world in every age those metals and minerals which are become so indispensable in human life and the want of which as a medium in commerce obliges some nations to exchange their commodities for a bit of iron norway till a century and a half ago appears from all accounts to have wrought but few mines consequently the country contained treasures out of knowledge since that time matters are so improved by the assistance of german miners that the silver copper and iron mines in norway have produced to the amount of several millions the mountains here are natural fortresses for as a long chain of them divides two kingdoms the norway peasants who are excellent marksmen post themselves in time of war on the steep inaccessible rocks where animated purely by a zeal for their country they gall the enemy incredibly and in the defiles or narrow passes a handful of men will keep off a numerous army and these natural fortifications are also an ornament to the country affording the most delightful contrasts in the diversity of it is prospects nature has been more profusely lavish of her favors to the situation of some farmhouses here than to most royal palaces in other countries though assisted with all the embellishments of groves terraces cascades canals and the like some trading places as bragness and others are charmingly situated between mountains at the mouth of rivers and so delightful is the situation of the district of waas some leagues castward of bergen that it has been called the northern italy certainly to one who desires no more than a regular assemblage of the beauties of nature though of mere nature there cannot be a more enchanting prospect for all the buildings in it are wang church the parsonage and a few farmhouses scattered on different eminences but the beauty of the prospect is much heightened by two uniform mountains gradually rising in the same proportions to a vast height betwixt which runs a valley near half a league in breadth and a river sometimes spreading into little lakes and sometimes precipitating itself down the rocks in foaming and sonorous cascades on both sides it is bordered with the finest meads intermingled with little thickets and the easy declivities of the verdant mountains covered with fruitful fields and farmhouses standing above each other in a succession of natural terraces meet the eye with rapture between these a stately forest presents itself to view and beyond that the tops of mountains covered with perpetual snow and still beyond these ten or twelve dreams issuing from snowclad summits form an agreeable contrast in their meanders along the blooming sides of the mountains till they lose themselves in the rivers beneath  having said so much of the land it is proper to give some account of the waters the coasts of norway are washed for three hundred leagues by a part of the north or great atlantic sea which by very narrow channels forms a multitude of islands some from three to nine leagues in length and not barren but most of them so small as to be inhabited only by a few fishermen and pilots who keep a small stock of cattle which they send out for pasture to the nearest little islands rocks and sheers these sheers are little more than large rocks or a kind of stone columns founded in the bottom of the sea the heads or capitals of which scarce rise higher than some fathoms above the waves there are a million or more of these and the whole western coast of norway is defended by them for no naval power will dare venture within them without a pilot of the country and even then they are in danger from the least storm which here gives no warning in so much that in an instant unless they have the good fortune to secure themselves in a safe harbor they may be dashed to pieces in the creeks which are all enclosed with steep rocks this coast indeed affords a great many and good harbors which few other maritime countries can boast of to prevent the danger arising from the winds and currents in these straits by order of government many hundred of large iron rings are fixed in the rocks more than two fathoms above water as moorings for the ships where there is not room for them or where is no anchorage for the norway shore is level or gradually ascending in a very few places but generally so steep and angular that close to the rocks the sea is from one hundred to three hundred fathoms deep there are sandbanks further off at sea from ten to fifteen fathoms deep which are the daily rendezvous of all sorts of fish  from the sea several large and small creeks run six eight or ten leagues up the country most of them a hundred fathoms deep on the banks and more than four hundred in the middle where fish are caught in great abundance in floge creek about five miles from drontheim a line of  000 fathoms would not reach the bottom so that the sea here is thought to have an opening or communication with the immeasurable abyss  among other singular things there is a fresh water river near gaarden stafseng on helgeland in which turbot and other seafish is sometimes caught though this river has not the least visible communication with the sea but it must have it by some subterraneous passage  there is a remarkable property in the water of the north sea namely an oiliness or fatness which when a ship is on fire so far from extinguishing it increases the flame this oiliness has probably some connection with it is effulgence and scintillations for when the water is stirred by rowing or otherwise it appears on fire this hitherto inexplicable phenomenon has been illustrated in the best manner by a little piece published at venice called nuovo scoperto intorno di luci notturne dell aqua marina which though our purpose is not to enter far into natural history as it may entertain our readers we will give the authors account of it having observed that in the gulf of venice the water is luminous only from the beginning of summer till the end of harvest and that this light is most copious in places abounding with seagrass and still more when the water is put in motion in      he filled a flask with it and carried it home but it emitted no light except that it sparkled when stirred in the dark straining the water through a close fine cloth the cloth shone in the dark but not the water though shaken or stirred having some time after procured a microscope he gathered some seagrass which is most apt to glitter in the night examined it in a dark place and discerned above thirty of these lucid particles on one single leaf he shook this grass over a sheet of paper and one of these particles fell off it was as subtle as an eyelash about as long and it is color a black yellow on examining it with a microscope he plainly found it to be a living worm or annular maggot consisting of eleven wings and as many mamillae or teats on the sides instead of feet and both at the head and rump four antennae or feelers like the horns of a snail in the prosecution of his researches he found that all these lucid appearances in the water arose from these minute and and almost invisible maggots whose whole bodies were lucid though when at rest their refulgence was considerably fainter in spring these animalculae consine themselves to the seagrass but in summer they are dispersed all over the sea and mostly on the surface this experiment puts it beyond all doubt that the glittering of the sea in a ships course is occasioned by these worms from this experiment says pontoppidan i am of opinion that those lambent flames which by hovering in the night about a ships rigging strike terror into the seamen and the ignis fatui or jacka lanthorn which deceives the traveller by land are of the same kind  in the   th degree near the island moskoe is another singular thing the current between that island and the next is so rapid and violent that it is roarings exceed those of a cataract and are heard at a great distance they continue without intermission except for a quarter of an hour in every six hours that is at the time of high and low water when it is impetuosity is at a stand at this time fishermen can venture in but this motion soon returns and however calm the sea may be gradually increases and runs back with such a draught and whirling vortex as to suck in whatever comes within it is sphere of motion and keep it under water for some hours when the fragments shivered by the rocks appear again this and three other vortices among the ferroe islands which are about twentyfour in number belong to the crown of denmark but add little to it is revenue lie about    degrees west of norway four degrees northeast of shetland and contain about  000 inhabitants these vortices have no other cause than the collision of the waves rising and falling at the flux and reflux against a ridge of rocks which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract thus the higher the flood the deeper must be the fall and the natural result of this is a whirlpool or vortex this whirlpool at moskoe is called moskoestrom and by navigators the navel of the sea when the sea is agitated by a storm it is dangerous to come within five miles of it perhaps it is hardly in the power of fancy to conceive a situation of more horror than of being thus driven forward by the sudden violence of an impetuous torrent to the vortex of a whirlpool of which the noise and turbulence still increasing as it is approached are an earnest of quick and inevitable destruction while the wretched victims in an agony of despair and terror cry out for that help which they know to be impossible and see before them the dread abyss into which they are about to be plunged and dashed among the rocks at the bottom large stocks of firs and pinetrees after being absorbed by the current rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew on them this plainly shows that the bottom consists of craggy rocks among which they are whirled to and fro it happens frequently that whales come too near the stream and are overpowered by it is violence when it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves  the fresh water springs of norway are uncommonly good so that the common people who live more upon water than wine or other strong liquors hold out to a very advanced age some of the lakes in this country are so extensive that in former times according to the history of norway fleets have been fitted out and wars carried on in these inland seas in some of them are floating islands or parcels of land about  0 or  0 else in length with trees growing on them which having been separated from the mainland are driven about as the wind sets and when close to the shore are shoved off with a pole they are said to grow as it were by the accession of reeds grass weeds and the like this may be wonderful but not so much so as what is called the mardyne which as i am told says pontoppidan is frequently met with in the salt water creeks these are level clods composed of seagrass twigs and the foam of the sea upon which fishermen say certain seafowls lay their eggs if this be matter of fact it must be acknowledged another instance of the wise disposition of the creator  at any great distance from the sea the rivers of norway are not navigable for a vessel of any considerable burden on account of the number of waterfalls from the height of six to ten fathoms but they serve to convey large timber by floating it the owners mark these timbers and trust them to the current and at places where they wish them to be conveyed to large booms fortified with iron bolts are laid across the river to stop them these are called lentzs here they are brought ashore and the persons who have the care of these lentzs know to whom each piece belongs by it is mark and is paid for the care taken of it the waterfalls are every where used for working sawmills where with little labor planks and boards are sawed out to all dimensions  these waterfalls however are not without their inconveniences the gule which has it is rise in a mountain in the north near skarsfield in the year      to the astonishment of the country seemed totally drained whereas it had only buried itself under ground from whence it again burst forth with such violence that the earth and stones thrown up by the eruption filled the valley and made a kind of dam which however was broke through and washed away by the force of the water on this occasion besides some churches    farmhouses were destroyed and   0 persons drowned  another instance of this kind still more wonderful happened in   0  this was the sudden immersion of the family seat of borge near frederickstad into a deep abyss the particulars of which are as follow in the night of the fifth of february that superb edifice together with every thing in it sunk down into an abyss of a hundred fathom deep and the gap was instantaneously filled up by a piece of water between three and four hundred else long and of half the breadth the house was doubly walled but of these as well as several high towers not the least trace was to be seen with it perished fourteen people and  00 head of cattle lord and lady woernsekiold the owners of the house two children and the steward had the good fortune to escape the lady being then near her time was attended by a midwife who in great consternation came to acquaint them that the house and ground began to give way on which they immediately crossed the water to a seat of her lords brother where the next day she was delivered the cause of this catastrophe was no other than the river glomen which is the largest in norway precipitating itself down the waterfall near sarp had probably for a long time in it is subterraneous concealment undermined the foundation a like instance happened in switzerland in      when the whole town of pleurs suddenly sunk in and was never seen afterward  chap ii of the productions of norway norway is almost every where so unfit for agriculture though not for pasture that the proportion of ploughed ground with respect to the meadows woods and mountains is not above one in eighty and if the peasants were not considerably assisted by the great fisheries the timber and charcoal for the mines grazing and the liberty they have of killing game the country could not be supposed to furnish subsistence for above half the inhababitants another misfortune is their pernicious nightfrosts for in some parts of the most fruitful provinces the grain is subject to miscarry by sudden frosts so that one day it shall seem fine and flourishing and the next owing to the nipping cold of one night shall be destroyed but when the lands are capable of cultivation they are so prolific as to produce from six to tenfold and never lie fallow the grounds in parched seasons are always watered with scoops as they wet the sails of a ship by means of aqueducts carried on by hollowed timbers from the nearest spring to the field and from the lands lying warm being sheltered by the mountains though the seedtime is late the harvest is forward and farmers generally have their corn in nine weeks from the time of sowing  though the farmer in norway does not toil in the fields of an oppressive lord nor is obliged to give the tenths of his crop to support the clergy but the fruits of his labor are his absolute and certain property yet agriculture here is attended with great difficulty and inconvenience the fields consisting in general of little spots of ground among the rocks many of which must be dug instead of being ploughed and all their grain is reaped when made into sheaves a great number of poles    or    feet long are stuck up in the field and six or eight sheaves are hung at certain distances on each pole so that several days rain if it should fall would be soon exhaled or discharged and then the corn is housed not with wagons but on sledges except in some places in the frontiers where wagons have with difficulty been introduced for so prejudiced are the norway peasants and so tenacious of the usages transmitted to them by their forefathers that they will adopt no new customs though better than the old ones nor will they venture to remove a stone which their fathers had suffered to lie this rustic bigotry which more or less prevails every where is a great obstruction to public utility counteracting all improvements in husbandry the peasants here being more inclined to become fishermen and the like than to clear and improve their lands this error however gradually loses ground and an enquiry is now made for spots proper for sowing stones begin to be removed and fens and morasses drained by covered trenches in clearing the forest or wood ground they proceed in the following manner having felled the timber they leave it on the ground two years to dry at the end of which time they set fire to it generally about midsummer but when the clouds promise rain the wood being burnt as much as possible the greater pieces quenched and the lesser together with the surface of the soil the moss and small roots being reduced to ashes without staying till the earth grows cool they sow rye on the ashes still so hot that the seed cracks snaps and denotes that the husks are split they wait then for rain to soak them and if this happens the peasant may set down in the certain prospect of such an exuberant ryeharvest as will scarce appear credible yet nevertheless true for without some extroardinary accident a single bushel of burnt rye will produce from  0 to  0 bushels which is certainly the effect of a concentration of the vegetative spirit in the ashes which before it can evaporate impregnates the grain with such wonderful fecundity but these conflagrations sometimes do a great deal of mischief for the knops of the pines will shoot along the air like rockets and have been known to set fire to houses at a considerable distance and when the first frosts seizes the green wood it is not only violent from the turpentine but attended with a boisterous wind and dreadful roarings  all sorts of grain are produced in this country and their pasturages or meadows are so liberally blessed as not only to equal other countries but to surpass many farmers keep a great number of cows and fat so many cattle that they export a great deal of butter and tallow when seedtime is over and the people can be spared they drive their cattle to the mountains which at that season afford sufficient fodder for the snow is no sooner melted than the grass appears seven or eight inches high grown under the snow if the distance of this pasturage be not more than five miles the milk is brought home twice a day but if the distance be ten or fifteen miles they erect huts here a maidservant constantly lives for the security of the cattle against the wildbeasts who generally fly from such a weak keeper this maid is employed in making butter and cheese which she brings home once or twice a week  in most places they cut their grass for hay with scythes but in some reap it with a sickle and to dry it hang it on a fence made with stakes fixed upright and crossed with poles  all kinds of esculent and garden vegetables are found here in gardens as in other countries there is a kind of northern turnep called naper which is sold in the cities in great quantities they are sometimes very large as flat as a dish and a single one has been known to weigh   lb  there are here also a great variety of medicinal herbs and flowers and some noxious ones and many wholesome and palatable berries peculiar to the country with respect to fruits grapes peaches and apricots do not ripen well here but plumbs do but as to apples pears and cherries they are met with every where  though in the article of fruit trees norway must be acknowledged inferior to most countries in europe yet this deficiency is most liberally compensated in the blessings of it is inexhaustible forests in most provinces immense sums are received from foreigners for masts beams planks etc not to mention the homeconsumption for houses built entirely with wood beam upon beam ships bridges moles piles fuel etc likewise for the infinite number of founderies which require such prodigious quantities of smallcoal besides the quantity felled and burned to clear and manure the land and also the number of young trees used by the peasants as fences to their gardens houses etc these and all other circumstances considered want of wood in norway must have been at least as great as the present abundance of it in most provinces had not nature endued the soil even in the most barren mountains with a most singular fecundity in the spontaneous production of trees an evidence of which are the many shoots from the smallest fissures of the rocks which thrive much better than when carefully planted in a good soil so much is exported that sometimes such piles of it are seen in the ports like little mountains that one would imagine it must require a long time to remove them whereas a single embarkation for england holland france or spain in a few days sweeps them all away a few weeks however cover the quays again the sawworks are the best manufacture in norway an infinite number of families getting a comfortable maintenance from them together with the felling and floating of timber the tenth of all sawed timber belongs to the crown of denmark to which norway is subject and makes a considerable branch of the revenue the vast thick forests every where seem to remove any apprehensions of the countrys being in want of common timber but as to firtrees and oaks it is to be feared posterity will be at some loss for them unless the forestlaws are more strictly executed and young trees forbidden to be exported to give the reader an idea of the value of a ships mast we must tell him that a choice mast tree which when standing shall be estimated at  00 rixdollars or about    l  0 s english cannot after it is cut down be conveyed to the seaports for less than double the prime cost for besides the many other trees required to form a kind of bed for it to slide on lest it should be injured by the rocks sometimes a hundred trees and upwards must be felled to make way for it and laborers are employed to hawl it in places impassible for horses the red fir will stand several hundred years the farmhouse of naes in gulbrandsdale in which king oluf lodged in  0   when he took a circuit round the kingdom is now standing    0 and from the roots of firtrees the peasants extract tar even a hundred years after the trunk has been cut down this tar is a very profitable commodity and the london dispensaries are covetous of having it from nordsiord in this country  the norway sea affords both red and white coral and the mountains a great variety of marble spar or glittering stones talk alabaster chalkstone millstone slate and the like marble which in most countries is so scarce and bought up at so great a price is found here in several places and in such quantities that if all europe were to be supplied from hence the quarries would not be exhausted that wonderful substance the magnet or loadstone is found here in such quantities that some tons of it are exported annually to amsterdam here is also the abestos or cottonstone found in the parish of waldens which makes linen or paper that will not burn but what is most singular that in this country thus abounding in stones there should be no flints those used in firearms are imported from denmark or germany the mineral mountains however produce the quartz firestone and a number of chrystals which they call mountaindrops as they are found hanging on the mountains in the shape of grapes and other indeterminate figures some of them resemble diamonds so much that a certain officer of reputation in the district of hardanger a few years ago sent two stones found there to london in order to have them made into a pair of earrings for his lady when the merchant to whom he had given the commission called upon the lapidary for them he was asked what he looked upon those stones to be the merchant answered norway chrystals then replied the lapidary give me a note of hand that they shall not be passed for real diamonds which the merchant did i mention this story to show how the world in things of value are more governed by imagination than reality otherwise there could not be that immense disparity in the price of norway and oriental stones here also is found that isingglass with which ships lanthorns are sometimes glased granates amethysts and agates  but among the produce of the norway mountains are their great treasures of metals and minerals paracelsus predicted that between the  0th and  0th degree northern latitude time would display such a store of wealth in metals as should be superior to all the treasures that ever the east afforded should time verify this prediction the generation then in being must construe it as a completion of the words of job      from the north comes gold for in the year      when paracelsuss golden age was thought to be at hand a golden mine being discovered the abovementioned words were the impression on one side of the ducat with the head of christian v king of denmark on the other but that mine soon failed as the gold though fine would not bear the expense of working the silvermines however are unquestionably one of the greatest distinctions of this country there are now two carrying on to the vast advantage of the sovereign and the community these are the works of kongsberg and jaresberg  the first lies near sandswerd twenty miles from drammen and is the most considerable and of the greatest profit of any in europe and in respect of pure massy silver veins quite inexhaustible whereas the german silver ore is in a great measure invisible and must be extracted from the lead or copper in which it is concealed this work was began in the year      and was discovered in the following manner two peasants attending their cattle on those steep mountains which separate telemark from numedal found the first silverore in some fragments of stone fallen from the mountains and which by way of pastime they used to throw to one another when they heard a jingling sound the metallic substance it yielded they imagined to be lead and carrying it home tried to melt it into bullets buttons and the like but not being able to effect it they sold it to a goldsmith who used to sell his goods about the country this man informed government of it and orders were given to survey the parts where it was found the result of which was so favorable that miners were sent for from germany these were the inhabitants of the newbuilt minetown of kongsberg and the ancestors of many thousands now living there who in process of time mixed with the norwegians each nation to this day performs divine service in it is own language but all are under the direction and government of the college of miners their college however has since undergone several changes and the work has been carried on sometimes by a company of sharers and sometimes as at present by the king alone the kongsberg ore is found frequently in solid masses of some magnitude the miners indeed dig through the rocks for weeks and find nothing but by and by the rock suddenly exhibits several thousand pounds weight of silver and thus repays them for all their trouble and animates them to further prosecution in the royal museum at copenhagen a piece is preserved of which the whole world cannot produce it is equal it is weight being   0lb and it is value  000 rixdollars upwards of l 000 sterling the shaft called old gods blessing one of the most ancient and rich among all the mines which sometimes within a week has yielded some hundreds of pounds of rich ore never fails to strike the beholder with it is astonishing depth being no less than   0 fathoms perpendicular and the circumference at the bottom forms a clear space of some hundred fathoms the sight of so many piles of wood burning on all sides  0 or  0 in number in this gloomy cavern and continually fed in order to soften the stone in the prosecution of the mine seems according to the common idea an image of hell and the swarms of miners bustling about in habits according to their several occupations may well pass for so many devils especially when as a signal that a mine is going to be sprung in this or that course they roar out berglivet berglivet that is take care of your lives the produce of this mine is annually on an average l 00000 a year and employs about      men part of near   000 people dwelling in the town of kongsberg  curiosity says a french traveller led me into one of these mines a crane erected over the shafts for drawing up the ore in tubs let me down the same way i got into the tub and was lowered pleasantly enough but when i got to the bottom it looked like plutos kingdom there was nothing to be seen but frightful caverns flaming fires and creatures more like demons than men they were clothed in black leather jackets each having a camail such as priests in france wear in the winter a piece of peaked leather tied round his head a little above his nose and hanging down on his breast like a muffler and an apron of the same some of these miners use the chizel some the hatchet to beat out the copper stones while others are seeking for the copper veins or sounding to try if they can discover any watery place which sometimes is hid in the bowels of the earth and breaking forth on a sudden drowns them all without the greatest care the masterminer who attended me finding i was taken with a cold fit owing to the damp of the place rung a bell and we were drawn up as easily as we were let down  the other silver mine was discovered in      and lies near bragnas it is ore is very rich but like that of the german mines has a large mixture of lead and copper with it and must be separated by fusion but this is expected to turn out equal to the other  of the copper mines there are many and their importance may be conceived from hence that besides the many millions which for these hundred years past have accrued from them to private persons the tenths alone bring an annual revenue to the crown of thirty or forty thousand rixdollars or near l  000 and upon a swedish invasion a draught of  000 effective men has been made out of the workmen in these mines however next to the timber iron is one of the most profitable products of norway several hundred thousand quintals being annually exported partly in bars and partly in castiron as stoves cannon pots kettles and the like the natural profit of which is estimated at three or four hundred thousand rixdollars or l 0000 sterling here are also to be met with sulphur vitriol and alum  chap iii of land and seaanimals of fourfooted beasts norway has those in common with england and also the elk and reindeer bears wolves the lynx the glutton the martin ermines beavers and the lemming or norway mouse  their horses are generally small but well proportioned plump and round their color chiefly a deep bay with black manes and tails and a streak along the back they are fed only with hay but yet are spirited swift and in good condition owing most probably to their not being gelt for ten miles about bergen no peasants dare keep a mare so that nothing is used but stonehorses for as there are no coachroads for horses to draw on in pairs every thing brought to this city is packed on the backs of horses driven single three or four together one before another and were these horses to meet with mares there would be frequently mischief as it is the horseman must take great care for when these horses meet they seldom part without a signal of animosity norway horses are very surefooted they go dancing along always full of spirit and ascend and descend the highest steeps be they ever so slippery in a surprising manner when feeding in the mountains should they be attacked by a wolf or bear they show a great deal of courage fighting with their sorelegs and generally come off victorious for if any one attempts to turn about and kick the bear or wolf will instantly leap on his back in which case he gallops off with his angry rider till he drops down by the loss of blood  cows here are also small and dont give more than about four quarts of milk but feed is cheap and farmers keep a great number in spring when they are first turned out they make a large fire in the fields to which the cattle in the farmyard all run particularly in cold nights and lay round it for winterfeed the peasants cut off the boughs of trees in summertime tie them up in bundles dry them and bring them home by cartloads of which the cattle eat the leave and young branches but in fishing towns for want of other food they feed their cows with cods heads and fish bones nay cows here will even eat the bones of their own species which they break and swallow greedily and will gnaw them as a dog does the peasants give their cows daily a little salt which whets their appetite and sometimes throw them a redherring which they apprehend is a treat to a cow as well as to a human creature  of the sheep there is nothing remarkbale but their standing together in the winter under the snow and eating one anothers wool as in other snowy countries the place where they collect themselves is discovered by the warm damp that rises above the snow country people are here very fond of and keep too many goats for they often injure the young trees from bergen alone is shipped off annually  0 or  0000 goat skins exclusive of several thousands dressed for suffian corduan and russia leather these creatures climb the rocks and steeps inaccessible to men wherever grass is to be found they will get at it when no other grassfeeding animal can but they often thus get themselves into such dangerous situations as not to be able to stir either one way or another when so circumstanced they will bray loudly and the norway peasant to save his goat will suffer himself to be let down by a rope a hundred fathom or more as we have already mentioned venturing himself in such a manner as another man would not do for his best friend where goats run wild as they often do in this country till they are ten or twelve years old they are so bold that if a wolf comes toward them alone they will not go out of his way and if they have dogs with them will resist a whole herd a goat will frequently attack a serpent and when he is bit by it will devour it though he is at some trouble in so doing it will disorder him for some days but seldom kills him  hares are here in great plenty and turn white as in lapland in the winterseason in winter they catch mice like cats and pursue them under the snow  the elk is an animal whose form is between the horse and the stag and is here called by some equicervus they are so long legged that a man can stand upright under their belly are of an ash color and have horns on their head like deer but not so long and round rather flat and broad with small points about the edges they are harmless creatures and keep about the houses in winter their flesh is much of the taste of venison and the hide sells for a good price being converted into buff leather  the reindeer we have given an account of in our description of lapland so have we of the glutton and some other animals of this country they here run wild and are shot and sold like other game  bears are found all over norway they are a fierce ravenous and cunning creature the bear is said to carry her young but a month brings forth two or three at a litter blind and naked and as small as mice each in form like a mere lump which the mother continually ecks till it expands or unfolds itself when these young ones are bringing up it is dangerous to meet the old ones for then they will attack whilst at other times they are only upon the defensive against mankind excepting it be a pregnant woman whose condition they know by scent or by instinct and with all their might will strive to get at the foetus a clergyman says bishop pontoppidan told me he would not believe this till he saw an experiment with a young tame bear which he chained in his yard leading a woman with child almost up to him he began to make an uncommon noise reared and tore about so that they were obliged to shoot him a clergymans wife also related to me continues he the danger her husband once found her in when big with child returning home on a summers evening he saw a bear trying and taking all the pains he could to break open the door of her bedchamber where she lay in the greatest anguish hearing him roaring and jumping up in vain at the window which fortunately for her was too high for him from this it is to be observed that if any of those women who are a whole summer in the country attending upon the cows should lose their virtue and become pregnant she would be daily in danger of her life otherwise these poor girls are so intrepid that they will often pursue a bear hollowing with sticks in their hands and hunt him till he leaves his prey behind  the bear has never been known to hurt a child his food in necessity is roots grass and wild angelica but animal food suits his palate best as the flesh of sheep goats cows and horses his attack is with his forepaws not using his mouth till he is master of the creature when he sucks it is blood and drags the carcass to his den if the way to it be uphill or through bushes that he cannot drag it easily along he has been seen to take the whole carcass in his forepaws walking on his hind legs only  of this creatures prudence and discretion they give innumerable instances among many the most singular and credible is that out of a whole herd of cows he picks out that which has the bell about her neck which by running generally gives the signal of danger at this bell he is mightily offended he tears it off and if it is a hammered one will strike it so flat with his paw that it shall never speak or vex him again he will fire off a gun when he has taken it from his pursuer and shows a great deal of cunning in saving his life when set upon by two or three together when the first that fires at him has missed his aim or slightly wounded him he will sly upon the unarmed man and hugging him will retreat upon his hind legs as far as he can knowing very well the others will not shoot at him for fear of shooting their companion when he has thus retreated to the edge of a bank or hill he will throw himself down with the man and there leave him dead or alive sometimes the fall will kill them both if he finds himself mortally wounded he endeavors to rob the hunters of his hide which he knows they come for and will therefore lay hold of a very large stone and if there be a deep water near him will plunge himself into it when the farmers go out a bearhunting they go commonly three or four in company as soon as they meet with one they force him and tire him first with their small dogs which are broke in for the purpose and who run under his belly and lay hold of his genitals large dogs he will seize on at once and tear them to pieces but when the little ones have worried and tired him he will get up to the side of a tree or rock set his back against it and tearing up the stones and earth will throw them at his pursuers at this time the marksman shoots him with a rifledbarrel gun if he receives the ball in his chest or under the shoulder or in his ear he falls if not he grows outrageous and will fly upon the shooter who then desends himself with a dagger which a norwegian farmer always carries about him hanging at his side by a brass chain should he not succeed with this he loses his life if no one is at hand to assist him for the bear fleas his skin off pulling the hair and flesh over his head and ears face and all sometimes however the bear is contented with beating his conquered foe with his paws till he seems to be dead and when he perceives that he draws no more breath will leave him a life has sometimes been saved this way if the farmer conquers which is almost always the case he fleas the bear and fixes up the head on his house as a trophy of his victory a hide will sell for five or six rixdollars each rixdollar  s  d english the flesh is not much liked tasting like liver but a sat bearham is a great delicacy  fierce as the wolf is he is daunted at the least opposition and only bold and daring against those who fly before him even a cow or goat that turns against him will put him to flight hunger will make a wolf in winterseason seize a dog chained in a farmyard and upon the ice take away a horse from a sledge which obliges travelers at that time of year to go armed many contrivances are used to destroy them instruments to blow them up charged guns laid by a carcass that go off with the least touch deep holes with secret traps above into which they fall and it is remarkable that when another animal falls into the same pit with a wolf as is sometimes the case the wolf is found sneaking in a corner at the greatest distance from his fellowprisoner whom out of fear he dare not approach  the lynx or lossen in norway called goupe is something like a wolf but smaller and is of the cat or tiger kind it is however equally fierce and dangerous and tears all to pieces that it can master it is skin is lightgrey or white with black spots like the panther and is sold from eight to twelve rixdollars each according to their goodness when a goupe is attacked by a dog he throws himself on his back in the manner of a cat and turns up his forelegs to defend himself the dog on this lays hold and thinks himself conqueror but the goupe then makes use of his claws so effectually as to flay his enemy alive  to what we have said of the ermine in our account of lapland we will here add from the authority of bp pontoppidan that in calm weather they will swim to the small islands in search of the eggs of waterfowl which they are very fond of and when they have their young on any of these islands they will bring them to the continent on a piece of chip or bit of wood the mother swimming behind and with her snout shoving it along small as this creature is it is capable of destroying the elk or bear by creeping into their ears when they lie asleep and laying fast hold with their teeth when the large animal feels himself thus attacked he begins to run about and roars till he has exhausted himself at length being wearied out he becomes faint droops languishes and dies in the same manner will the ermine steel himself upon a sleeping eagle and will let this bird fly away with him upon it is back where he continues gnawing him till by the great effusion of blood the bird drops down dead on the ground  in the body of the beaver is a bag in which is the precious castor of the shops with this and with his fine darkbrown skin is carried on a considerable trade at elverums fair the beaver is an amphibious animal living as well in water as on land not to mention their manner of building their houses here would be unpardonable for though many of our readers may be acquainted with it from reading other books many perhaps know nothing about it the beaver is shaped like a longbodied dog with short legs a short and flat head small round ears and eyes a large thick and smooth tail which weighs several pounds the skin of which is covered with fish scales and is so much of the fishy kind as to taste like fish and cannot bear to be long out of the water the rest of his body is flesh the roman catholics consider the tail as fish and eat it as such his hinder feet are webbed like those of a goose and are of the same fleshy nature as his tail cannot be long out of water the beaver builds his house in such a manner that he can always have his hind part hanging in a place which is open from ice all the winter that he may continually throw his tail forwards and backwards in free water  to be sure of this advantage even where the water rises and falls he builds always at the wateredge a wooden house three stories high and regularly raised above one another like a little tower where he and his mate have each their separate lodging and bed to fell the trees for building of these houses the wise creator has furnished this little animal with a tooth four or five inches long and sharp at the end not unlike a boars tusk with this as with a small ax he prepares the wood for the joists fits all together and lays them so over one another that they will not fall after this to transport these materials to the spot he uses a most surprising dexterity as i am assured says pontoppidan by many who have been witnesses a number are employed on this work together and one will suffer himself to be used as a cart which the others like horses take hold off fastening on him by the neck and dragging him along for this purpose he first throws himself on his back with his legs up between which they lay their prepared timber and in this manner convey it to the spot one load after another but this always costs the first a bare back for it takes off all the hair  of the otter as it is well known in this country we shall only say upon the authority of pontoppidan that when young they may be tamed for that a credible neighbor of his assured him he had so used one to the house by feeding him with milk that at command he would go into the river and fetch him a fish or two at any time  the lemming or norway mouse is that mountain mouse we have described in our account of lapland and to which we must the reader  after the quadrupeds we come to speak of creeping animals as to serpents toads and other poisonous creatures of that kind they are not found but in the southern parts of norway to show the power of serpents even over birds which do not seem subject to them pontoppidan relates on the authority of many credible witnesses that as one of them lies on the ground he will raise his head about nine inches with his mouth opened till a lark or a swallow or some lowflying bird in it is flight happens to have the misfortune to come perpendicularly over him on this the bird continues stationary though at some fathoms height and finding itself irrisistably impelled begins to cry sadly and at last drops directly into the serpents mouth who well knows how to separate the feathers and throw them out that this happens is corroborated by other authors sir hans sloane says the same of the american rattlesnake but how the effluviae rising from the natural powers of the snake or serpent should attract the bird we leave others to investigate in one of the hamburg magazines is dr c j sprengers experiment with a mouse which was let loose on the ground to a snake it made a few turns squeaked a little and then run directly into the snakes mouth who all the while lay still with his mouth open  we shall pass over lizards frogs snails grasshoppers worms spiders caterpillars flies ants etc common to other countries and mention the clusterworm peculiar to norway it is properly a congeries of animals and consists of a great number of small worms gathered and extended a great way along the earth just like a rope of many fathoms a finger and a half or two fingers broad each worm is not thicker than a piece of course thread and as long as a barleycorn of a watery color and a black spot on the head these worms like to be together and are found by millions continually crawling upon each other yet so that the whole company constantly follows and leaves a path behind them like a drawn line  of birds norway may boast of a great variety sea as well as land some in common with other countries and some little known but in this their numbers are so great on the seacoast within ten or twelve miles of the shore that one would imagine all the seasowl of the universe were collected here in one flock and they are often seen in such flights as to obscure the heavens in many places they keep dogs trained to fetching the shore and strandbirds out of their holes in the rocks which are almost inaccessible but one farmer must not keep more of these dogs than his neighbor that he may not prejudice him in his livelihood the dogs as well as the farmers run the greatest hazard of their lives in this employ and sometimes perish by unhappy falls for they either climb up those excessive high and steep rocks finding but here and there a hold or place for their feet or else they are let down from the top  00 fathoms or more that they may get into the hollows under the projecting clifts and caves formed by nature at foeroe which exports annually several thousand pounds worth of feathers to copenhagen there is held a birdhunt of this kind which is circumstantially described by mr lucas debes who was many years a dean in that country and with whose account we shall entertain our readers it is taken from his faeroa reserata page   0  it is not to be described says he with what trouble and danger they look for the birds in the high and steep rocks many of which are more than  00 fathoms perpendicular and there are particular people who by nature are fitted for this kind of birdcatching and are called birdmen they make use of two methods to catch them either climbing up these perpendicular rocks or else being let down from the top by a strong rope when they climb up it is by the assistance of a pole    or  0 feet long with an iron hook at the end they who are underneath in the boat or stand on a cliff fasten this hook to the waistband of the mans breeches who climbs and a rope round his waist by which means they help him up to the highest projection he can reach and fix his feet upon then they help another up to the same place and when they are both up they give them each their birdpole in their hands and a long rope is tied round each others waist at each end one of them climbs up as high as he can and where it is difficult the other by putting his pole under his breech paths him up till he gets to a good resting place the uppermost of the two then helps the other up to him by a rope and so on till they get to the place where the birds build and where they search for them as there are in these rocks many dangerous places yet to climb whilst they are bound together with a strong rope one always seeks a convenient place to stand safe whilst the other is climbing about if the latter should happen to slip he is then held up by the other who standing firm helps him up again and when he has got safe past those dangerous places he fixes himself in the same manner that he may assist the other but accidents sometimes happen for should one not stand firm or not be strong enough to support the other when he slips they both fall and are killed and there seldom a year passes but some lose their lives  when they reach those places where the birds build some are tame enough to be taken by the hand but where they are wild they either throw a net over them in the rock or entangle them in a net at the end of their poles as they are flying in and out of their holes a boat is underneath in the sea into which they throw their dead fowl and presently fill it in tolerable weather when there is plenty of game the birdmen will continue out in the rocks eight days together lying at nights in some hole in the rock where provisions are let down to them by lines and where others go daily in boats to bring away what they kill  many rocks are so frightful and dangerous as not to be climbed the men then are let down from above by a strong rope  0 or  00 fathoms long and about three inches thick one end of this the birdman fastens round his waist like a belt and then draws it between his legs so as to sit on it six men at top hold the rope letting it sink by degrees laying a piece of timber on the edge of the rocks that it may not cut the cord there is another line fastened round the mans waist which he pulls to give signs when he would be pulled up or let lower etc this man is in great danger from the stones in the side of the rock loosening by the rope and falling on his head to guard against this he wears a thick cap but this does not save a mans life if large stones fall on him the experienced in this business thinks nothing of the danger and will shift himself from place to place with great readiness catching the birds as he swings upon the line slinging himself from one ridge of the rock to another and when he has killed a sufficient number he ties them to the small rope and they are drawn up or fastens them to his belt and will often work himself up by the rope in this manner he will swing about all day and catch a great quantity of game  where there are not a sufficient number of men to hold the rope it is fixed to a post and the birdman will slide down without any help many of these men are so expert at the business that they will hang and climb without fear in places where they can but catch hold with their fingers and pitch the ends of their toes and when the distance between them and the sea beneath shall be more than  00 fathoms  among the waterfowl met with in this country is the eiderduck of which we have given some account in treating of iceland we shall only observe further here on the authority of pontoppidan that as ravens and crows hunt out for these birds nests to suck their eggs it has made them sometimes build half a mile up in the country as a place of more security and when the young ones are fit to go to sea with their mother she squats down for them to climb on her back and carries them away by an even flight this down is sold in norway for   s a lb english and is so light warm soft and ready to spread itself that two handfuls squeezed together is enough to fill a down quilt  to enter into the variety of birds met with in this country and describe them all with their particularities would be swelling this work to an enormous size and deviating from the plan we set out upon which is to describe the different countries and their natural history only as far as is useful to a general reader if he requires more we must refer him to those treatises which describe the animals birds and fishes of the several parts of the globe let it suffice to say then that norway has not only the birds we have mentioned but eagles and almost all that are common to other countries  it is the same with fishes none of which we shall attempt to describe but such as are very remarkable we have already given an account of the vast quantities of fishes which the northern seas afford the first inhabited land from the north pole that emigrant fishes touch upon next to iceland is norway as also the north of scotland and the orkneys such quantities of herrings cod and other valuable fishes are caught in the northern parts of norway as bring in annually upwards of a million of rixdollars to contemplate the ways of providence in the article of fishes must be pleasing and wonderful to a philosophic mind and to open the readers ideas on this subject we will lay before him a few observations of rollin in his study of nature for the service of youth speaking of fishes he says how many kinds of fishes of various sizes do the waters produce i contemplate all these and it seems to me that there is nothing but a head and a tail they have no hands or feet and their head has no free motion if i was to draw any conclusions from their form i should think that there wanted every necessary to support life yet with so few external parts they are more active quicker and more ingenious than if they had many hands and feet they know so well how to use their fins that they shoot forward like an arrow from a bow and rather fly than swim fishes devour one another continually how therefore it might be asked can these inhabitants of the sea subsist but here gods providence has allotted means and ordains it thus that their breed and increase shall be wonderfully great and that their fruitfulness shall by much exceed their necessity of devouring each other so that those which are eaten by others are always very short of those which arise from the next brood when i consider how the small fishes escape from the large by whom they are looked upon as their prey to hunt as they please i see the weak are much the nimbler and are always prepared to fly to places where the water is so shallow as not to admit the large to follow them thus has it pleased the creator to make up their weakness by giving them so much circumspection how is it that fishes can live and thrive in such waters as i cannot drink how is it in the midst of salt that their flesh does not taste of it how comes it that the best and fittest fishes for the use of man approach the shore and as it were offer themselves to our wants and at a time when they are the fattest when on the contrary others that are not so useful keep farther off why do herrings mackrell etc all which in the time of their increase and growth live in unknown places at certain seasons appear in our seas about the coasts as if to offer themselves to fishermen and even throw themselves into the nets and on the hooks whose hand but thine o lord guides them so wisely though thy great care is seldom received with due thankfulness  anchovies are here salted and barrelled up with spices for exportation they differ very little from the herring except in size being much smaller  the shark is a fish common to these seas of which there are several species but the whole tribe of sharks have no bones excepting that of the back but only a cartilaginous or gristly substance instead of bone they do not like most kinds of fishes eject their spawn but are viviparous and like the whale bring forth their young alive five or six at a birth their skin is hard and rough and full of prickles and their fins are used by turners carvers etc to polish their work the mouth of the shark is not placed like that of any other kind of fishes but underneath a pretty long snout designed as it were to prevent their destroying other fishes in too great quantities for they are obliged to turn on their backs when they would devour their prey unless it happens to swim just under them the shark bites very keenly has a voracious appetite and is so fond of human flesh that they will in shoals follow the guinea ships to america for the dead negroes that are thrown overboard in the passage they have been known to bite a mans leg off when bathing in the sea was it not says sir hans sloane in his voyage to jamaica for the necessity it is under of turning on it is back to catch it is prey at which time the pursued fishes escape there would be nothing that could avoid it for it is a swift swimmer has great strength and the largest swallow of the fish tribe existing some of them are from  0 to  0 feet long  the whale here at certain seasons is very generally met with having sufficiently described this fish in our account of greenland we shall only observe here that they are seen on the western coast of norway in vast quantities about january at this time the sea appears covered with them and from the water spouted from their nostrils continually they have the appearance of a large city with a great many chimnies smoking  the herring is a fish every where known and from the norway seas sent almost all over europe in the netherlands there are above   0000 people solely employed in this fishery in norway also there are many thousands of families thus maintained herrings like mackrell assemble together and follow oneanother in vast shoals and it is said they have always a leader of their own species eighteen inches long and proportionably broad which fishermen will never destroy if they can avoid it no one but a norwegian fisherman can form any idea of the largeness and extent of these prodigious shoals if infinity were applicable to any thing created one might venture to make use of that word with respect to herrings for each of them has more than  0000 grains or eggs in it is roe  a hill of herrings for so a large shoal of them is called according to the fishermens accounts reaches from the bottom to the surface of the water which in most places where they are caught is from one hundred to two hundred fathoms deep they extend also to a considerable circumference were they all to be caught the greatest part would be lost for it would be impossible to get hands tubs salt and other necessaries for the curing them several hundred shiploads are sent annually from bergen to foreign parts besides what is consumed by the peasants who make them their daily provision  during the herringfishery the country people assemble together on the shore by thousands while a great number put off several miles to sea at this season one may often see in the compass of a mile upwards of two or three hundred fishing boats lying on their station for a whole month or longer and casting their large nets which are sixty or seventy feet long they generally put two of these nets together and though there are a great many perhaps  00 or   0 in one place and pretty close together yet in a few hours they will be so loaded with herrings that they often sink to the bottom and are with great difficulty drawn up again in each net they will often catch   or  000 large herrings which hang fast by their gills in the meshes what i am going to relate says bp pontoppidan is surprising and what foreigners will hardly believe but i myself am very well assured of it and the whole city of bergen can witness the same that with one cast of the net in sundifiord there were caught as many herrings as filled  00 some say   0 jaggers each jagger  00 tons burden which make  0000 tons taken at one draught in bp pontoppidans account of norway there are doubtless many very surprising things told but he seems very cautious of advancing what appears incredible on authorities he could not rely on where he asserts matters to be as he relates them he has sufficient proof of the fact and where he does not he gives it as a matter of doubt and as reported only  the sturgeon is a fish in fine perfection in the north sea they approach the shore about midsummer with the summer herrings which they drive along at such a rate that they will raise themselves above the surface of the water in the pursuit they do not swim together in shoals or extend in breadth but follow oneanother in a strait line laying hold of each others tail as this fish is not armed with teeth either for use or defense the marks of providence appear in it is peculiar structure having thick broad scales or plates of bone which cover it is body as a coat of mail and are it is best defense  the coast of norway is also remarkable for it is codfishery where this fish is dried or salted and barrelled in great quantities upwards of  0000 tons weight of dried cod has been exported from bergen in one year besides a great deal of pickled cod in casks great quantities are also exported from trontheim christiansund and stavanger and for this purpose alone are annually imported  0000 tons of spanish and french salt barrelled cod is chiefly sold in the baltic but dry cod at hamburgh bremen and amsterdam from whence they are carried up the rivers all over germany some are exported to flanders and england but not so many as to italy spain and other countries in the mediterranean  as the french cannot do without the spawn of norway codfish which they use by way of bait to strew in the sea in order to catch a sort of fish something like herrings several thousand casks of cods roe are salted down every year in norway and the demand has been so great that for twenty years together there has been annually exported fourteen or sixteen shiploads of roes only besides what they carry in their own bottoms from the liver of the cod they extract trainoil of which  000 casks are annually exported from bergen two hundred cods will generally yield a cask of oil  the walruss or seahorse is seen sometimes on this coast but not so frequently as about iceland or spitzberg where it is found in incredible numbers several thousands being often seen together their body and head are like those of a large cow and they have short hair on their skin like the seal but what is most remarkable is that their two large teeth or tusks which project out of their mouth are full eighteen inches long and are very good ivory  of shellfish the norwegians also have great variety besides oysters muscles cockles lobsters crabs etc in common with other countries oysters are here pickled barrelled and exported it is said the crab and starfish often feed upon the oyster and when the oyster opens it is shell to take in it is food they will artfully throw a stone in to prevent it is shutting close again and being pinched with the shell this is more wily even than the fox whose tongue or paw is often held fast by attempting to get at the oyster to show how large oysters have been found there are in the kings museum at copenhagen two oystershells that were drawn up by a cable at goa each of which weighs    lb they are five feet in diameter and the fish was so large that every one of the ships crew had a considerable piece of it  in the diocese of christiansund there is a pearl fishery belonging to the king and carried on at his expense they are given to the queen as one of the regalia of the kingdom of norway these pearls are the produce of a small fresh water muscle and are found in certain rivers and brooks there is a manager or intendant presiding over this fishery the pearl is generally found in that part of the fish which is called the beard in the oyster and sometimes on both sides but the pearls are always flat on that side that grows to the shell there are some norway pearls not inferior to oriental ones but the number of these is not very considerable  such a trade is here carried on in lobsters that every spring there are never less than  0 or  0 lobsterbusses from london and amsterdam which are loaded with them each having wells capable of containing   000 lobsters alive a lobster in norway eight inches long is vaiued at one penny sterling of a less size one halfpenny at this low sale they produce annually  0000 rixdollars that is l   0 sterling in the diocese of stavenger alone to encourage the exportation of lobsters by the natives it is established in the harbors that a norway vessel must be first loaded before they have permission to sell any to foreigners  such an infinite variety is there in the inhabitants of the ocean that it is probable one hundredth part of them have never come to the knowledge of man or or probably ever will was it possible for our sight to penetrate through the thick medium of water as we can through the air according to the accounts given by diverse we should see very wonderful objects the many we have seen may give the learned some idea of the rest was it possible that the sea could be drained of it is waters what incredible numbers of uncommon and amazing sea monsters would exhibit themselves to our view which are now entirely unknown such a sight would at once determine the truth of many hypotheses concerning seaanimals whose existence is disputed and looked upon as chimerical the following extraordinary sea monsters that are occasionally met with on the coast of norway says pontoppidan though they may appear incredible are wellattested by numbers of credible witnesses and hundreds of testimonies might be produced for each instance if it was required  among the many sea monsters often seen in the north sea the first we shall mention are the merman and mermaid the existance of this creature is questioned by many nor is it at all to be wondered at because most of the accounts given of it are blended with fables and idle tales but that does not render it impossible in the nature of things it is well known there are seahorses seacows seawolves seahogs seadogs etc so called from their bearing a near resemblance to the landanimals of those species why then may there not be seamen and seamaids when we know that in the tribe of landanimals there are apes and baboons nearly resembling the human species i hope then i may be credited says bp pontoppidan when i declare that in the diocese of bergen are several hundreds of persons of credit and reputation who affirm with the strongest assurances that they have seen this kind of creature sometimes at a distance and at other times quite close to their boats standing upright and formed like a human creature down to the middle the rest they could not see i have spoken with many of those people all eyewitnesses to the existence of the creature and i have taken all possible precautions in examining them strictly on the subject the result was that i found them all agree in every particular of their accounts but of those who have seen them out of the water and handled them i have not been able to find more than one person of credit who could vouch it for truth this is the rev mr peter angel minister of the parish of vand elvens gield on sundmoer i shall relate what he assured me when i was once on my visitationjourney he said that in the year      he being then about twenty years old along with several other inhabitants of alstahoug in nordland saw what is called a merman man lying dead on a point of land near the sea which had been cast ashore by the waves it is length was above three fathoms it was all over of a darkgrey color it is lower part like a fish and had a tail like a porpus it is face resembled that of a man with a mouth forehead eyes etc it is nose was flat and as it were pressed down to the face in which the nostrils were however very visible the bread was not far from the head the arms seemed to hang to the side to which they were joined by a thin skin the hands were to appearance like the paw of a seal the back of this creature was very fat and a great part of it was cut off which with the liver yielded a great quantity of train oil mr luke debes in his description of faroe tells us that the people there have seen a mermaid with a fish in her hands of course concludes they are animals of prey this mermaid he thus describes she stood close to the shore two hours and a half and was up to the navel in water she had long hair on her head which hung down to the surface of the water all round her  another wonderful sea monster seen sometimes in the north is the great seaserpent these creatures continually keep themselves at the bottom of the sea excepting in the months of july and august which is their spawning time they then come to the surface of the water in calm weather but plunge into it again as soon as the wind raises the least wave if it were not for this the reality of this snakes existence would be less questioned than it is though the coast of norway is the only place in europe visited by this terrible animal i questioned it is existence myself says pontoppidan till that suspicion was removed by the full evidence of credible and experienced fishermen and sailors in norway of which there are hundreds who can testify that they have annually seen them nay the honorable lawrence de ferry a captain in the navy shot one in company with several men in the year      all of whom made oath of the truth of it this creature appears on a fair estimate to be full  00 english feet long and it is body in circumference to be as big as two hogsheads when it lies on the surface of the water it is in many folds that is there are in a line with the head which it carries near two feet out of the sea some small parts of the back to the number of twentyfive or more to be seen above the surface of the water when it moves or bends these at a distance appear like so many casks floating in a line with a considerable distance between each the head has a high and broad forehead and resembles that of a horse it is snout being flat with large nostrils and several stiff hairs standing out like whiskers it is eyes are very large of a blue color and look like two pewter plates the whole animal is of a darkbrown color but speckled and variegated with light streaks or spots that shine like tortoiseshell it seems to have a quick smell for to avoid any danger arising from them fishermen carry some castor with them a little of which they throw into the water whenever it appears in sight which it always flies from otherwise they would be in danger of being sunk for this animal has been known to throw itself across a boat and sink it and it is excrement which floats on the surface of the water is so corrosive as to blister the hands of those who handle it there seems to be some allusion to this creature in the prophet amos chap   v   and though they be hid from my light in the bottom of the sea thence will i command the serpent and he shall bite them the supposition that this seasnake answers the description of the leviathan or the crooked serpent isaiah      that shall slay the dragon that is in the sea or that it may be the long serpent mentioned in job       is not without some foundation egede an author of credit says that in      he saw one that raised itself so high out of the water that it is head reached above the maintopmast of the ship and we may strengthen these assertions by an account of modern date jens anderson and mads jenson master and mate of the margaretta of esterezer of norway declared on the   th of august      before j r lamy a magistrate of dundee in scotland that on saturday the  th of august      between the hours of nine and ten in the forenoon being on their voyage to dundee in latitude    degrees    m n about fifteen or sixteen leagues to the eastward of the island of may they as well as the whole crew of the said ship perceived within less than one miles distance of the southward of them what they conceived to be an animal called in norway a seaserpent a creature of a huge size emerging from the sea that from it is appearance it seemed to form three low islands or sandbanks of a greyish color that they conceived the length of it to have been at least three english miles that it lay stretched from s w to n e that it is breadth appeared to be about twenty or thirty fathoms and that it was in sight fifty minutes and went down gradually without any remarkable agitation of the water from the time of it is ascending and during it is appearance on the water the weather was perfectly calm and it went down again as soon as a breeze came on the waves broke on those parts of it which were above water as on a bank and the greatest apparent height it bore above water seemed to be from two to three fathoms  we come now to the kraken which is incontestibly the largest creature of all the animal creation and consequently deserves the best account the nature of things will admit of norway fishermen affirm that as they row out several miles to sea in hot summerdays when they expect by their situation to find  0 or  00 fathoms of water it often happens that they do not find above  0 or  0 and sometimes less at these places they generally find the greatest plenty of fishes by this they judge the kraken is at bottom if the depth at this time decreases they find the animal is raising itself nearer the surface of course they take to their oars and get off when they have reached their usual depth and find themselves out of danger they lie upon their oars and a few minutes after see this enormous monster come up to the surface he there shows himself sufficiently though his whole body does not appear and in all likelihood no human eye ever beheld except the young of this species it is whole back or upper part which seems to be an english mile and a half in circumference and looks like a number of small islands surrounded with something that floats and fluctuates like seaweeds here and there a larger rising is observed like sandbanks on which various kinds of small fishes are seen continually leaping about till they roll off into the water from the sides of it at last several bright points or horns appear which grow thicker and thicker the higher they rise above the surface of the water and sometimes they stand up as high and as large as the masts of middlesized vessels  it seems these are the creatures arms and it is said if they were to lay hold of the largest man of war they would pull it down to the bottom after this monster has been on the surface of the water a short time it begins slowly to sink again and then the danger is as great as before for his motion occasions such a swell and such an eddy or whirlpool that it draws every thing down with it within it is sphere of action  this enormous seaanimal in all probability is of the starfish kind which consists of a round body as a center without a head from which extends eight or ten points or legs resembling the rays of a star and what we have called it is arms are more properly antennae or feeling horns with which it moves and gathers it is food which consists of fishes those who have observed it have taken notice that for some months the kraken is continually eating and in other months continually voiding it is excrements during this evacuation the surface of the water is colored and appears thick and turbid this brings the fishes about him when he feeds upon them and after digestion converts them into baits for other fishes  many seafaring people have given accounts of floating islands that is sudden appearances of land which again as suddenly vanish particularly in the north sea this can be nothing but the back of the kraken and if there be any credit that it is in the power of a fish to stop a ship under sail as some seamen report it can be no other than the kraken  chap iv of the people we come now to speak of the people of this country who were most probably the followers of odin driven out of asia by pompey the great and who spread themselves to the north as far as they found the country habitable the famous district quaenanger in the manor of nordland where the fabulous rudbeck supposes his northern amagonian or female republic to have existed is well known this republic if any such there was was driven with the ancient inhabitants of norway by the followers of odin into finland the petty kings of these more modern norwegians who then took possession of the country were in the tenth century conquered by king harold harfagre and such as would not submit to him left the country and fled to iceland greenland ferroe shetland and the orkneys where they settled  the norwegians are in general robust tall wellmade and lively the peasants who live among the mountains are generally taller than the rest and have a certain severity in their countenance which commands respect and seems expressive of the strength of their intellectual faculties along the coast they are not so tall and robust but more corpulent and plegmatic and have a rounder visage in most parts of norway the air which the peasants breathe is clear fresh and wholesome their diet plain and homely and as they undergo a great deal of labor both by sea and by land and are naturally of a cheerful disposition they have a constant series of good health and more are found here upwards of  00 years of age than in any other nation they are inured to cold and hardships from their childhood and will run about barefooted on the ice in the latter end of november the mountaineer woodmen have their beards often loaded with icicles and their bosoms filled with snow and when their naked breasts are occasionally exposed they seem as hairy as their chins on my travels says pontoppidan over the highest mountains of norway which are covered with snow where houses are of no service i have seen the peasants in great numbers do the work of horses and indeed they seem almost to equal those animals in strength i have observed that when they have been in a profuse sweat they have thrown themselves every halfhour upon the snow to cool and refresh themselves and have even sucked it to quench their thirst all this they undergo without the least apprehension of a cold or fever or without murmuring or betraying any discontent on the contrary they go singing on merrily all the while and hold out for nine hours together at the hardest labor immaginable with incredible cheerfulness and alacrity how wisely has providence endowed these people with constitutions equal to their respective wants a remarkable instance of this may be seen on the islands near the coast where the peasants of both sexes assemble by thousands about the middle of january to reap their winterharvest from the ocean at these times every family takes with them five or six weeks provision chiefly dried fish keep out at sea all day and great part of the night by moonshine in open boats and after that crowd together by scores into little huts where they lay down in their wet clothes and have scarce room to turn here they repose themselves the remainder of the night and the next morning return to the same laborious employment with as much pleasure and cheerfulness as if they were going to a merrymaking  the hair and eyes of the norwegians are lighter than those of most other nations and a dark complexion here is as rare as a fair complexion in france or italy for we find that the clime changes here and in all northern climes hares partridges and other animals from a dark or brown color to the finest white the farther we proceed from the equator the more is the black color of the inhabitants lost they are still pretty brown above the tropics but we meet with none that are entirely white till we get a great way into the temperate zones and at the extremities of these zones we find the fairest complexions the blonde or flaxen complexion of the norway women strikes the eye of the admiring traveller and he can scarcely believe that the female he now beholds and the african he lately cast his eyes upon are of the same sex but beyond the temperate zone and where the frigid zone commences the inhabitants lose their fair complexion and grow darker for as excessive heat darkens the skin and gives the inhabitants of the torrid zone a tawny complexion so does excessive cold the same  the cold in norway and norden by no means obstructs the growth of the body obvious by the complete stature of the people in these countries whereas the laplanders greenlanders and samoiedes are all a short thickset race and of a darkbrown complexion certainly occasioned by the intense cold in that climate  daily experience shows us that every nation is in some degree characterized and distinguished by it is particular air nourishment education and manner of living the norwegians are in general dextrous active penetrating and ingenious especially in all kinds of mechanical performances every inhabitant is an artizan and supplies his family in all it is necessaries with his own manufactures so that there are few hatters shoemakers tailors tanners weavers carpenters smiths or joiners by profession all these trades being carried on in every farmhouse they never think a boy can be a useful member of society nor a good man unless he is made master of all these but these dabblers in so many trades it is natural to suppose can seldom excel in anyone branch it is sufficient however that they perform them well enough for their purpose yet many of these mechanical peasants bring their work to such perfection that it is hardly distinguishable from townmade goods at hardanger there are several country fellows that make their own violins and some of them so good as fit to be played on in a concert but this genius chiefly leads them to carving in wood all manner of devices with their tolleknive being a short broad knife of their own forging among others a peasant in the beginning of this century whose name was halvor fanden excelled so much in this art that connoisseurs would give their weight in silver for his carved cups and other works in bassorelievo and in the royal museum at denmark they are considered as their greatest artificial curiosities in the same museum there is a bust of christian v carved in a certain wood called beenwood by a shepherd who in the year      when the king went to drontheim stood in the road to see his majesty pass and received so strong an impression of his face that he was able to represent every lineament and feature to the life without having ever seen the original but once en passant at arendal they build ships from two to three hundred lasts burden and all by imitation without any rules of art  formerly the norwegian youth not only the common people but also those in a more elevated station were trained up to wrestling riding swimming throwing the dart scating climbing steep rocks and forging iron the other parts of their education consisted in writing the runic character blowing the horn and composing songs and odes so that every norwegian peasant was an artist a gentleman and a poet it is in some measure the same now next to sounding the horn which is a kind of a hautboy they have a musical instrument which the farmers call langleek having six brass wires stretched upon a sounding board about four feet long and six inches broad but though the peasants prefer it to a guitar or lute it will hardly please a delicate ear but the violin is their most admired instrument and is sometimes used in the house of mourning where they will sit at the head of the coffin playing all day long perhaps to drive away melancholy they do the same when the corpse is carrying to church in a boat which is frequent in the western parts but this is not so strange as an old and superstitious custom in some places in the diocese of christiansand where they ash the dead person why he died if his wife was not kind to him or his neighbors civil to him in some places in lardal in the diocese of bgen every one that comes into the room where the corpse is falls on his knees at the coffin and begs forgiveness of the deceased if he has ever offended him their clergy frequently tell them of the absurdity of this it being too late to ask forgiveness but so used are they to their old customs that they find a difficulty to break it off  the capacity of the norwegians for literature is not inferior to their skill in mechanics and bodily exercises had they the same opportunities for improvements as their neighbors in denmark they would make an amazing progress we may judge of this by the children in norway who take their learning extremely fast and are capable in a very short time to get a book by heart and comprehend the meaning of it every norwegian peasant especially the freeholder that can pay his taxes governs his house and possessions with as much power and authority as a nobleman no one directs or controuls him this gives them a certain freedom and generosity of mind and if the liberal arts had as much encouragement here as in some other countries they would undoubtedly make a considerable progress in a short time and among a number of any other nation the norwegians would be found of a superior genius in the republic of letters it is found by experience that those who live further up the country near drontheim are the most ingenious in conversing with the peasants about any spiritual or temporal concerns within their knowledge we find them provided with judicious and pertinent answers their questions are generally clear and rational and their answers discover great penetration and knowledge superior to many who have had all the advantages of education  another good quality observable in the norwegians is civility and a courteous behavior being very obliging and willing to serve others in this they do not fall short of the politeness of the french whom they resemble more than any other nation their behavior is not affected but quite natural and may be looked upon as the particular genius of the country the norwegian peasant in point of politeness exceeds the danish burgher and the norwegian burgher especially of the mercantile class in this respect equals at least the danish nobility as to fidelity and honesty they are not less practiced here than in other countries in short the norwegians says molesworth are a faithful honest people and in their loyalty the throne of denmark has found it is chief support as a proof of their valor and fidelity to their king and country i will only says pontoppidan give an instance or two in a late war i mean the zeal of those citizens that fired their own houses to dislodge the enemy and the peasants who dispersed themselves about in the rocks and defiles with their firearms to cut off their retreat and did not suffer them to pass without being remarkably weakened in the year      when the swedish army had invaded norway whilst one of the governors of a fortification on the frontiers was lying near a navigable river with his corpse which was greatly weakened waiting for fresh transports from denmark there came a number of greyheaded farmers to him and offered themselves with all their accoutrements as volunteers for his majestys service there came one day particularly a body of  00 such volunteers from tellemarken who were vigorous and in good spirits with firearms and three weeks provision in their knapsacks and thus accosted him good day father we hear that you have got strange unwelcome guests that you want to get rid off if you have a mind to make use of us only tell what we are to do and you shall see that we are men it was these peasants who were commanded by captain coucheron in the action of krogwood when the swedes endeavored to force a passage through and were repulsed with the loss of  00 men but the norwegians who were well posted did not lose a man  the skill of the norwegians in maritime affairs is well known they have a genius for all warlike employments are not easily repulsed but will support the honor of their country and undergo the greatest fatigues with very little rest or nourishment the norwegian army consists of  0000 effective men besides    or   000 sailors which all europe can hardly match  it is a pity that such hardy veterans should ever quarrel among themselves in former times they would carry their revengeful disposition so far that in a partyquarrel the common peasants would stand upon their point of honor and fight it out with their knives and before they began would hook themselves together by their belts then draw their knives and would not be parted till one or the other was mortally wounded or killed this brutish custom prevailed in norway till about the middle of the last century to such a degree that they say when a peasant with his family was invited to a wedding the wife generally took her husbands shroud with her because on these occasions they seldom parted before they were intoxicated with liquor the consequence of which was fighting and this seldom ended without murder some of the peasants who have put away these instruments and broke themselves of this wicked custom still retain that revengeful spirit and that insolence and pride which were the promoters of it however they make use now of a less pernicious instrument and employ the lawyers pen instead of a knife they are very obstinate and will persist in their animosities to the last and if a poor man has it not in his power to pursue his suit his neighbors will often make a collection to enable him to do it  but with the foregoing fault there is a commendable ambition in the norwegian peasant which makes him strive to live independent of his friends and if his freehold be incumbered he uses his utmost efforts to clear and redeem it there are many not a little proud of being thought to be descended from noble families and this ridiculous vanity prevents them from marrying their children very advantageously by standing upon their blood and birth they are fond of being respected and honored to the utmost and the great complaisance they show to others is not without a view of having it returned from the same source springs the norwegians desire to distinguish himself in his station by fine clothes an elegant house etc this is very conspicuous in most tradinghouses where commerce gives them an opportunity of conversing with foreigners especially the english whom they chiefly endeavor to imitate and for want of abilites to equal us in splendour magnificent entertainments furniture and equipages a great many ruin themselves the bergen merchants indeed who are most of them descended from the frugal dutch or germans continue still in that way like good sober tradesmen  but though the norwegians endeavor to follow the english in these particulars and in a conceited opinion of their own country yet they are very unlike us in friendship and hospitality for there is no country in the world where the people are so hospitable liberal and so willing to serve and oblige strangers as they are in norway a traveller is seldom suffered to pay for his lodging which may partly proceed from the few persons who visit those parts they therefore think it a duty to treat the stranger as well as it is in their power and look upon it as an honor done them if he accepts of their civilities notwithstanding all this the peasant never gives the upper end of the table to the greatest guest he thinking that place belongs only to himself they keep open house for three weeks at christmas set out the best things they can afford and load their tables during the whole time nay on christmaseve they invite the very birds to the festivity and hang out at the barndoors on a pole an unthreshed sheaf of corn for that purpose  as the norwgian thus contributes to the good and happiness of others so he also endeavors to make himself cheerful and always to appear goodnatured envy and discontent are here banished to the rich and great whose temporal advantages are rather a plague than a comfort the little the common people have to indulge in relishes and agrees with them and they enjoy it though it be plain and homely except it be in public companies and entertainments where they are rather too much inclined to drink but they are temperate in their daily meals have no superfluity and therefore most of them live to a great age many to  0 or  0 some to  00 or   0 years in the year      in the diocese of aggerhuus only     persons had reached  0 years of age    had reached  0 and four were upwards of  00 in      when christian vi and his royal consort visited their norwegian dominions they took up their residence in the house of lieutenant colonel colbiorsen in frederickshald who was desirous of diverting his royal guests with what they call a jubilee wedding this was performed in the garden under tents pitched for that purpose  there were four couple married being country people invited from the adjacent parts and out of all these were none under  00 years of age who all of them lived several years afterward these eight married people made themselves exceedingly merry on the occasion and danced with green wreaths on their heads which brides always wear on their wedding day this is so extraordinary an instance of longevity as is not to be met with in the history of any other country  though norway is in general a very healthy country yet it is not exempted from it is peculiar diseases among the diseases that most appear in the diocese of bergen which is the most unhealthful spot in all norway is a kind of itch probably owing to the people eating a great quantity of fat fish it is a kind of leprosy that breaks out in ugly boils on the face they have also a disease called allevilde which seizes the patient at first with violent shooting pains flying from one part of the body to another and often breaking out into sores and ulcers another is begavning a kind of epilepsy but seldom so violent as in other countries which some attribute to the eiderdown beds they lie on they have cures however for them all except a certain fever which the peasants call landsarso which appears seldom but is contagious and epidemic it is something like the distemper which soldiers are apt to catch when encamped on damp places it is malignant and painful and when it rages carries off great numbers  we will now speak of their food and manner of living in the article of diet there is a great difference between those who live in the country and the inhabitants of tradingtowns a great part of which consist of danes germans dutch and english who make their bread and dress their victuals in the danish fashion they have almost all sorts of provisions here in perfection except butchers meat which is not very plentiful as for wildfowl all sorts of game and all kinds of fish except carp they have in as great abundance as in any other country in europe milk is very good and rich and as to wines spices etc greater quantities of these are imported than there is occasion for or good economy requires most merchants live here in a more elegant manner than the noblesse of other countries all kinds of wines are so common in norway that it may be questioned whether more is not consumed there in private families than even in the winecountries  the peasant in norway as in other places keeps close to the customs and manner of living of his forefathers and as he follows them in other things so does he in his modes of eating and drinking bread which is the chief support of life is not made of rye among the peasants except on festivals but of oatmeal and in flat round cakes extremely thin and large as a small dish and they call it fladbrod it much resembles our seabiscuits and will keep a year if put in a dry place some reckon the oldest to be the best and in former times she was esteemed a good housewife that saved for her sons wedding a piece of bread that she had baked for his christening  when grain is scarce as it sometimes happens to be after a severe winter the peasants are obliged to have recourse to an old custom as a disagreeable but sure method of preserving life their bread in time of scarcity is thus made they take the back of the fir tree boil it and dry it before the fire then grind it to meal and mix a little oatmeal with it it has a bitter and resinous taste and does not afford much nourishment but even in the most plentiful times they will occasionally eat it that they may be prepared against a time of scarcity which does not happen once in a century in the province of bergen which is the most barren there is least reason to complain as they import a great deal of grain from denmark and places round the baltic and keep their magazines full such norwegians as live by the seaside like the icelanders and finlaps eat dried stock fish by way of bread  the peasants make themselves a kind of hastypudding of oatmeal and barley meal which they call soup and in which they will sometimes boil a pickled herring or a halfsalted mackrell or salmon  they are better provided in norway with fresh fish than in most countries they have also plenty of growse partridges hares reddeer raindeer etc they also kill cows sheep and goats for winterstock which they pickle cut in thin slices dry in the wind and eat like hungbeef this they call skarke and it requires a ploughmans stomach to digest it their general drink is small beer in winter milk and water in summer and good strong beer at christmas and they are fond of smoking tobacco  the norwegians who live in towns have nothing remarkable or particular in their dress but the peasants differ much from these those which are called strilefarmers have their breeches and stockings all of a piece something like the hussars with a wide loose jacket made of a coarse woolen cloth called vadmel their waistcoats are of the same and some that will appear finer than ordinary cover the seams and put a border all round of the same sort of stuff but of a different color which looks like lace and has a gay appearance norwegians the hardanger peasants are particular for wearing black clothes edged with red which distinguishes them from their neighbors the vaasserne wear all black and the strile peasants wear white edged with black about soynefiord they wear black and yellow so that the inhabitants almost of every parish in the province vary in the color of their clothes  they all wear a hat slapped all round or a little brown gray or black cap on their heads this last is a sort of quartercap made quite round and the seams are ornamented with black ribbands they have shoes of a peculiar fashion without heels or soles which consist of two pieces the upper leather which sets close to the foot to which the other is joined in a great many plaits or folds in winter and when they travel they wear a sort of halfboots that reach up to the calves of their legs these are laced on one side something like a roman buskin when they travel on the rocks in the snow that they may not sink too deep they put on what they call truvieres which are round like the hoop of a small barrel worked across with twigs or wicker and this keeps them up but as this way of traveling is troublesome when they have a long way to go they put on scates about as broad as the foot but six or eight feet long and pointed before these are covered underneath with seals skin so that the smooth grain of the hair turns backward toward the heel such as they travel with in lapland with these snowskates they run about on the snow as well as they can upon the ice and faster than any horse can go with which the corpse of soldiers called keirlobere or scaters in time of war march with great expedition like the hussars  a norway peasant never wears a neckcloth or any thing of the kind except when he is dressed for his neck and breast are always open and he suffers the snow to beat into his bosom which he esteems an ornament but on the contrary he covers the veins in his wrist close to keep them warm binding them round with a woolen fillet which goes several times round the wrist and is supposed to contribute to their strength about their body they wear a broad leather belt ornamented with unequal brass plates to this belt hangs a brass chain which holds their tolleknive or their large knife gimlet and other tackle  the womens dress has likewise it is distinctions when at church and genteel assemblies they wear jackets laced close with leather girdles and silver ornaments about them worth sixteen or twenty rixdollars they wear also a silver chain three or four times round the neck with a gilt medal hanging at the end of it their handkerchiefs and caps are almost covered with small silver brass and tinplate buttons and large rings such as they wear on their fingers to which they hang again a parcel of small ones which look brilliant and make a gingling noise when they move  a maiden bride has her hair platted and hung as full as possible with such kind of trinkets as also her clothes for this purpose they get all the ornaments together that they can the more the better and with these belts buckles buttons plates rings etc she makes a grotesque figure not much to the advantage of her person  in some tradingcities especially at bergen and christiana they have begun to build stone houses but their houses in general are built of fir and pinetrees the whole trunks of which are used in building being laid one upon another and only chopped even to make them lie close at the corners they are mortaised so that they never give way these trunks are left round as they grow both inside the house and outside and are frequently boarded over and painted which gives them a genteel appearance the inhabitants of bergen do not trust goods of value which are not in constant use in their dwelling houses but keep them in warehouses out of the town  in countryvillages they do not build their houses adjoining to each other but in the manner of a great many towns in switzerland and holland every house standing by itself with their fields and grounds about them and there are some farmhouses that look like small villages but they are generally let to three four or five families and frequently consist of six eight or ten separate apartments and the stavburet or magazine for all the provisions is generally placed at a considerable distance from the dwelling house for fear of fire it stands very high upon poles to keep the provisions dry and preserve them from mice and other vermin the kitchen where they cook and brew stands also separate as do the barns haylofts cowhouses stables and the like such a farm has generally a mill belonging to it situated by some rivulet besides a smiths forge for every farmer is his own smith at sundmoer and other places in that diocese are frequently seen some lonely houses on the tops of high mountains surrounded with rugged and steepprojecting rocks so that there are few castles so inaccessible for there is often but one way to come at them which is by small steps and here and there some wooden pegs fixed so that the ascent is very dangerous and few people venture up that are not used to them up in the country where timber for building is but of very little value there is many a farmhouse as large and handsome as a noblemans seat the dwelling house frequently is two stories high having a railed balcony in the front with handsome windows and the rooms wainscoted  windows in norway are new things and seldom seen in peasants houses for on this side of filefield in the whole diocese of bergen it is rare even among the rich farmers to see what they call a glarstuerne that is a dwelling house with windows houses without windows receive their light at the top which is about the height of the room where a square hole is made in the middle in summer and fine weather they leave this hole quite open but in winter or wet weather it is stopped up with a wooden frame over which is strained the inward membrane of some animal which is as strong and transparent as a bladder this light is lifted off or put on with a pole which is reckoned a most necessary piece of furniture in every farmhouse those who come to a farmhouse on any important business especially courtship must lay hold of this pole before they utter a word through this lighthole also passes the smoke they having no chimnies this custom one would suppose would be very hurtful to the eyes but it is not so for the smoke meeting with no obstruction soon rises above a mans head and it seldom falls so low in these rooms as in many that have chimnies  under this lighthole generally stands a long thick table and benches of the same wood at the upper end of the table is the hoysoedet or high seat which belongs to the master of the house only who also has a little cupboard for his own use in which he locks up all his treasures in towns they cover their houses with tiles but in the country they lay over the boards the sappy bark of birchtrees which will not decay for many years they cover this again with turf three or four inches thick which keeps the house close and warm sometimes you may see servicetrees and always good grass growing upon the turf which induces the goats to leap about and climb up there for good pasture and many a farmer mows it and gets a pretty good quantity of hay from the top of his house  commerce or trading with foreign nations has for many ages flourished in norway forty or fifty sail of merchantmen deeply laden from different parts of the world come annually into bergen harbor in the spring and about  00 ships loaded with the produce of the country sail out of it and two or three hundred sail are seen lying there at a time drontheim christiana and bragnaes are the most considerable trading cities of this kingdom next to bergen whose trade is very considerable to all parts of europe and on a moderate calculation brings in more than  00000 rixdollars a year the produce of norway exported is copper both wrought and unwrought iron cast into cannon stoves and pots or forged into bars lead though but in small quantities masts timber dealboards planks marble veegstone millstones and seylstones varity of fish is also exported as cod herring salmon ling flounders and lobsters also cowhides seacalfskins goat skins some dressed into cordovan leather various kinds of coarse and fine furs of bears wolves foxes beavers ermins and martens eiderdown and other feathers butter tallow trainoil tar juniper and several other sorts of berries and nuts salt alum glass vitriol and potashes all the abovenamed products of norway fish timber and metals excepted may upon a wellfounded calculation amount to three millions of rixdollars yearly  this nation has a genius for trade and navigation though as has been before observed their splendid manner of living in some places is an obstruction to it norwegian youths are sent to english french and dutch merchants countinghouses to improve themselves and learn the language and some young people go there from the same parts for a year or two for a similar purpose  as every inhabitant of norway is an artist and wants not the assistance of any professed mechanic such trades are not very general for this reason there are but two cities in the heart of the country which are koningsberg and roraas all the rest are situated upon the coast all fine and curious works are imported from holland and england though the norwegians begin to improve in such articles and by degrees find the advantage of it especially in joiners and cabinetmakers work agriculture is carried on more or less every where some farmers export their corn but many more are obliged to buy more than half they use and he is accounted a good farmer who can grow enough to supply his own family this in a great measure proceeds from the peasants choosing rather to work in the woods or at the fisheries than be employed in agriculture but as they begin now to improve the waste grounds more than ever a little time will make a great alteration but the lord of nature having distributed various dissimilar means of living among different nations that one may have need of the other and that one country may dispose of it is supersluities to another and import other things which it wants at home i say this considered perhaps things are as well as they stand for if norway was to produce a sufficient quantity of corn so as not to want foreign grain denmark would not probably know where to dispose of it is superfluity in that commodity grazing and breeding cattle is the chief part of the farmers employment by which he not only supplies his own wants but derives a profit by sending them to market in the mountains the peasants make grazing almost their only occupation and send their cattle as has been observed to a great distance to grass in fruitful spots or on the tops of mountains or in the valleys or along the rivulets that run between the hills  cutting of wood selling and floating of timber burning charcoal extracting tar and every thing that belongs to the woods is the principal employment of the peasants of norway of woods that belong to the public and are no ones peculiar property they have the wood etc for their labor and generally stay there for several weeks together taking as much provision with them as they can carry or having it sent after them when the timber is felled and cut they are obliged to leave behind a great deal of the lop to rot the large timber they draw away in the winter to the nearest river or lake by a horse or two fastened to each piece and in the spring the merchants or their agents are there to receive it and order it be floated where they think proper in this work as well as at the sawmills and preparing wood for faggots making staves for casks and hoops for the fisheries great numbers are employed and still greater in burning of charcoal of charcoal vast quantities must be delivered to the melting furnaces within the distance of eighteen miles at a fixed price viz at   s   d engglish per last each last consisting of twelve tons and each ton two seet square if this privilege was not granted to the mines it would be impossible to work them  the roots of the firtrees which have stood several years in the ground after the trees have been cut down and thus imbibed the fatness of the soil they burn for tar this they do in the open fields and carry it to the seaport towns for exportation  besides the silver copper and ironworks which afford a livelihood to many thousands in norway as has before been shown great numbers are employed in navigation and fishing and maintain themselves by these occupations hence all the peasants that live near the sea are so accustomed to it from their childhood that like amphibious animals they cannot live without rowing or dabbling about in the water mr leeganger the minister of karsund declares that during the time he had the parish of udsire which was fifty years not above ten grown men died ashore the rest having been drowned at sea  hunting shooting and birdcatching afford some of the people of norway a comfortable livelihood for every one is at liberty to pursue the game on the waters without control the best marksmen live in the mountains but these hunters in times of distress will sometimes fall upon the farmers and partly by threats and partly by begging oblige them to relieve their necessities  having now treated of the people in general their manner of living employments and occupations i will close this account of norway with some few remarks on the nobility and freeholders of the country of the nobility there are but few left for which this reason may be assigned that a noblemans estate has not the privileges belonging to the demesne of the nobility longer than it is inhabited by the lord in person formerly the nobles were very powerful here and consisted of dukes earls and barons but they are now reduced to a few indeed since the sovereignty of denmark some norwegian families have been ennobled whilst many of the families of the ancient nobility are reduced to the class of peasants these however are not wanting in family pride and pick up all the intelligence they can by tradition etc of their pedigree and publish it in some of their funeral sermons where the whole genealogy is generally traced and the escurcheons preserved in some of their houses as a mark of distinction  exclusive of these foibles every freeholder in norway has vanity enough to consider himself as noble by right of inheritance there are several peasants who now inhabit the house which they can make appear their ancestors possessed and inhabited for   or  00 years before them for according to the norwegian law which differs in this from the danish no freehold can be alienated by sale or any other way from him who has the right of inheritance if he sells it and has it not in his power to redeem it he must declare every tenth year at the sessions that the want of money is the only reason and if he ever surmounts that difficulty or if he or his heirs to the second or third generation be able to redeem it then he who inhabits it is considered only as a possessor pro tempore and must turn out immediately and give up the premises to the right inheritor for this reason they keep a strict account of their pedigree that when occasion offers they may have recourse to it  for any thing we have to say respecting the government of this country we must refer the reader to our account of denmark  end of the first volume
