ah in what dictionary shall i find meet words to vent the grief that labors in my mind o muse a hapless brother bard deplore who is fallen fallen fallen to rise no more mourn all ye friends of peter and of fun mourn very hard indeed  and when yeve done come listen to my lay and mind what i have to say now you must know this cock of rhyme was hatched in some unlucky time some planet of malignant power presided over his natal hour i see i see the fates decree or do or say whatever we can to serve this poor unhappy man some dire disaster must attend and so he will come to no good end you know vide and eme sop in the pan at court i got him placed but now he is ousted and disgraced did i not give him good advice and that not once but twice or thrice but all advice i fear is vain the rogue has been at his old tricks again nay what is worse than all that is past he now is held in durance fast as you will hear if you will attend the following story to its end scarce had he warmed himself at court before he fell to wicked sport well fed and clothed he there begun to play all sorts of wanton fun complaints were brought from every quarter   one while he would steal a maid of honors garter and by such flattering token prove how high he stood in maidens love another while perdue as dead he would couch neath maid of honors bed as if intent on nightly wickedness but now i am well assured twas nothing less bromfield and hawkins both declare that he could do no mischief there i mean in maid of honors bed for all his mischiefs in his head in ambush thus he only lay to hear what they in sleep would say and then forsooth the wag would run and tell their secrets all in fun on this the maidens all combined and in petition formal joined with loud complaints against our bard declaring it was very hard that he their private chambers should invade and hear what they in midnight dreaming said such test was far too much for any mortal maid of waking maids all own there are great numbers but ah what earthly maid can answer for her slumbers but what they most of all things feared was that he would publish all he heard they knew that peter had a tattling tongue which blabbd out all but chief if aught was wrong should he in nightly ambuscade discover that they in sleeping fancy only had a lover of courtly maids this slandrous tale in peter pindars ode would stand and fly forthwith in palmers mail to all the gossips in the land in short  if he must be indulged in suchlike sport the sisters one and all resolved to quit the court the virtuous maidens rueful plaints were heard and full of reason and of truth appeared peter was questioned on these heads of maidens garters and their beds was by his master reprimanded and to his proper post remanded with charge no more to be so rude as thus indecently to intrude to gratify a curious whim for maids or not what was it to him but not the virtuous maids alone his fellow servants every one complained of saucy peter his gibing and his meter but chief of all the laureatbard with reason good averred twas hard that he could never make a birthday song to scape the witty malice of his tongue that when he did his very best of all his words he would make a jest often as he formed a sober rhyme or strove to soar in verse sublime the rogue was sure to mock him with another and now would call him tom and now would call him brother long had he borne his arch grimace but now grew weary of his place rather than be the butt of monkey peter he would quit the trade and deal no more in meter to fly from such intolrable attack he would forfeit both his bays and marks and sack of chaplains all he would make a jest for peter never loved a priest he always was a very wicked boy and never would the sabbath day employ in conning over the phrase is rather stiffrumpd but peter pindar must answer for it biblephrase sublime his sabbaths all were given to fiddling and to rhyme his mother told him twas a shameful thing to make such wicked songs about his k  g ah son she would say twill bring thee to the gallows as sure as spending sabbath day in alehouse and as he added year to year he more and more alarmed her fear lest he should take to wicked ways and in a halter end his days   but after this digression short let us now resume our thread at court and peters farther pranks report bedchamber lord or page in waiting was sure to bear his waggish baiting whoever came to court was peters butt and sport at every human ailing at every human failing whether halt or blind or lame he would loll his tongue and make his game with hasty speech and uttrance quick he would play you every monkey trick it is said his r  l master didnt escape the mimic waggry of this rhyming ape at length the courtiers one and all determined to effect his fall and yet the question may admit of doubt whethr all their efforts could have got him out so much his master loved him till he a traitor proved him now gentle reader

such a resolution and ease us of the plague of prosecution  peter intrepidly hold hold my lord not quite so fast if you are i am not in haste i have some small skill in law as well as rhyme and mean to avail myself of further time i am not to be browbeaten so in every action that i do i know how far it is safe to go produce your frenchman  let him swear to any given day or year i will prove that at the very time i was employed in making rhyme or making up a pill or bolus which you will next let him swear to place  then i will swear and prove an alibi think not i am so abandoned and forlorn i

peter justice shall be done thee whatever judgment falls upon thee meanwhile i would have thee better spend thy time and leave off this bad trade of making rhyme  peter intrepid to the last no that my

losing gamesters by and by may win ins may go out and outs once more come in and oh if so then your fell foe will work your woe impeachments thick will follow quick and make you kick against the prick but f  x will stick as close as tick nor quit you till he sends you to old nick  ld t  y aside sure never impudence on this side hell this rascal peter pindars did excel addressing the c  l my lords this is a horrid horrid thing a foul conspiracy against the k  g to stop the passage of his r  l life i do not say by poison or by knife but by a method still more deep and dark such as would leave no indicating mark nor aught of outward symptom that might lead to trace the author of such shocking deed my lords in all my reading my lords in all my pleading a case in point i never knew the case is altogether new search all kingkilling cases the jesuits were but asses compared with this astrictive fellow peter   d  nd costive in his plot however lax in meter my lords i freely own i am no physician i cannot speak with warwick lane precision  nor galen nor hippocrates my book but old blackletter littleton with coke but lawyers sure may have as good pretense as any other men to common sense allow me this and i can reason give why in such case no mortal man can live to shut such channel must be certain death not more so stopping up the vital breath how long such case might go i will not say i cannot fix the limits to a day but to my reason it appears most plain that half a month would kill the stoutest man and sure you will own my lords in suchlike ail the k  gs prerogative can naught avail in cases of evacuation and every other operation pertaining to our common frame the r  l functions are the same with those which nature calls from you and me in this my lords at least i trust we all agree then from your own experience freely speak and say what man among you ever went a week this said a gentle murmuring sound of hear him hear him circled round reechoed by a large majority though not unanimous the favoring cry the scottish corpse in deepest wonder all sat amazed as struck with thunder to hear lord t  y talk at such a rate  then crowding all together tete a tete their notes posterior they compared and all with one consent declared such argument was void of sense and counter to their own experience some said the mon was mad  but all agreed he would got a glass of whisky in his head at length tweedside on t  y fixed his eye and holding forth his leg uprose to make reply  ld tweedside hoot mon ye talk just like a fule i will send ye cross the tweed to schule and there yell see our bonny lads can gang without the like of this the winter lang wous mon were we to cast away our meat wi ilka moon wed soon hae naught to cat fra side of tweed to johnny groats ye wadna find a peck of oats but here is sic wastefu wark as never was seen ye cram your weams fra morning until even and gin ye canna lat it out you are than au fou of bile and gout not sae wi us  we gang a moon and mare and yet our weams are neither sick nor sare my lords i dinna speak from partiality nor any cause my lords of nationality this peter pundar ye may see is naught to me nae mare than ye my lords i trow ye ken full eel i never countenanced the cheel nor mean to do it for this ane thing the fallow does nae like his k  g because he wadna buy his sang in that i own he is very wrang but as to this conspiracy i will wager that it is au a lie i canna think that sic a deed could ever enter the loons head but if it did how could he do it my lords i canna make that out ye ken full weel to court he never gangs the kallon gets his bread by making sangs my lords his times employed the leevelang day to win baubees by lilting of the lay as to your idle tales of this and that of accoucheur a roi and g  knows what my lords i wad believe as soon ld t  y giving ld tweedside a look of disapprobation we are just now sitting in the moon hoot mon dont luke at me sae surly and make not au this hurlyburly about a thing of naught till ye hae further sought consider weel what you are about or else yell get us au turned out troth mon i did nae think ye sic a fule to bring us here to be the ridicule of folks of ilka rank and station bath high and low throughout the nation a balladmaker stop up the k  gs weam o lourd o lourd well au be brought to shame my lords we munna show our faces the folks will call us fules and asses and weel i wat some cheel will tak the hint and stick us au together in a print yes yes my lords yell see your sels in etches your lawland lads are deevlish quick at sketches besides that fallow pundar there ere lang will link us au into a bonny sang troth now i think on it twad be better before we rise to tuck up peter we soon could put him out of the way and stop the lilting of his lay the loss of sic a loon wad nae be much  i have got a bit of inkle in my pouch if auld friend t  y will but gie the beck well make a noose and put it round his neck and sae even lat him swing but dinna tell the k  g if he should speer for peter we may say the loon brak out of jail and ran away and now my noble lords what say ye au wha votes for highland execution law wed find some hole about the c  l house where he wad lig as still as any mouse i see ye laugh my lords and weel ye may i dinna mean to hang the lad today i only meant a fling at t  y there for bringing us like april ninnies here good faith i would hae him luke about and see how he can get us out of sic a scrape as this  for should the k  g surprise us in it twad be a serious thing he would turn us out to seek our bread wi auld friend t  y at our head for wha wad keep sic fules about him sic c  ls only fit for gotham my lords i fear i have tedious been and by friend t  ys lukes and ein he is in a deevlish angry mood i find i dinna care for that  i will speak my mind in points of law i readily allow to him we au mun doff our hats and bow on this side tweed i mean  but in a case of costive weam he talks just like an ass i see he does nae ken what he is about if he wad let me i could help him out but this he winna do  he will hae his way and troth i fear he will lead us au astray   i see this silly business mun gang on weel weel among sae many fules i am but one now let us suppose this frenchmans tale a fact i canna deemt a treasonable act for what is a moon that could nae kill a k  g did i not tell you twas a common thing for my northbritish countrymen to gang two moons or three  and yet we are as strange as ye are here  as free fra ails save now and then a little bit of yuking outwardly in the skin as to that babbling frenchmans silly chat about a pension or the like of that the tale appears to me an arrant fiction and fraught wi nonsense and wi contradiction if pension was the object of his game ye ken my lords he might hae that at hame but pensiond slave he winna be nor sell his wulksandliberty for au that k  gs and courts can gie he does nae like their straitlacd ways their proclamations and their sabbath days kirkganging orders make him sick he likes to wag his feedlestick and thinks it is the better way to chase the muckle deel away by playing bobbing joan and sic like airs than singing psalms at kirk and saying prayers  lord sidewind here by your leave my lord let me put in a word permit me to object that though he did reject a handsome proffered pension here nathless the culprit might elsewhere make hearty zealous application moved both by interest and by inclination what though a g  e has ever been his snarling does this evince that louis is nt his darling i apprehend this was the very matter which prompted peter to become a traitor for brunswicks line he bears a crabbd affection because the house of bourbon is his predilection  ld tweedside in reply hoot hoot i canna think him sic a ninny to pouch a loui rather than a guinea and au for naught but love and itch of treason sic deed wad prove the fallow void of reason a subject fit in murky cell wi bedlamites for aye to dwell no no my lords say what ye will the kallon has some conscience still k  g g  e he says has bairns and times are hard and for this cause he lately has declared it gangs against his grain and he is nae willing to tak fra him a single siller shilling weel then i argue thus a fortiori  good faith twad be a strange unlikely story that fond of louis as ye say he is he would ask for siller at a time like this hoot hoot ye ken full weel my lords i trow the grand monarques a brokenmerchant now and to their sorrow creditors have found he canna pay a mark in ilka pound is this a time to ask for pension amang sic quarrel and dissension that louis canna get a sous to pay his tradesmens bills and keep his house but now my lords i fear you are weary grown of my long talk and t  y gins to frown he seems to be in a most deevlish passion as if he would gie us pundars sang  d  n seize ye au  weel now i have said my say and now my auld friend t  y fire away the color glowed in t  ys cheek thrice he essayed but could not speak with blow of fist so fierce his choler burned it is said he split the c  l board in twain at length when wonted powers of voice returned he thus begun in high indignant strain  ld t  y my lords i dont regard one single jot of all that sell from that drybellied scot  quick roused at this and fraught with ire his eye balls flashing hostile fire tweedside retorted  d  n your blude gin i had not a mind as good for this illibral national reflaction to make your life and saul pay satisfaction for au ye luke sae grim and talk sae big i neither heed ye nor your muckle wig order order order all order echoed through the hall lord hopeful o fie o fie my lords command your passion or else our c  ls will disgrace the nation rude language this unmeet to fall from members grave in c  l hall o may this fray be never told o may no tongue the tale unfold and yet i speak it with great sorrow the tale will all be told tomorrow perhaps even now some patriotspy in corner snug is standing by to catch up every word that falls within the compass of these walls o tell it not in gath o tell it not in bath but sure it will be told afar and sure it will be published near then what will foreign nations say when they are informed of this affray they will say our c  l is all riot no better than a polish diet o glorious news for sh  d  n and f  x o welcome subject for their witty jokes how will they chuckle when they once find out we make as much fracas within as they without but in one point they are wiser far than we among themselves they very well agree my lords our measures only they oppose disdain not to learn wisdom from your foes  ld courtly my lords i hope you will one and all attend and mark the prudence of our premierfriend a forward youth he is of wondrous parts he charms our ears and captivates our hearts persuasion ever dwells upon his tongue so very much i never think him wrong endowed with all his fathers force and fire in wisdom grave the son excels the sire in years advanced thrice ten or little more he boasts the cautious temper of three score my lords let loss of place alarm our fears and bind us to this youth who is wise above his years  ld makepeace my lords this prudent motion i for one in which i trust i shall not stand alone most cordially approve  and now my lords i am up  i wish to utter a few words happy if any thing that falls from me should be the means to make us all agree revolving this strange matter in my mind the only proper method i can find is to call in two men of famous skill well read in every book on costive ill the sons of aesculapius best will know how far a case like this may safely go my lords you will own this is a point that falls without the competency of these walls the question was no sooner moved than by the board nem con approved  enter two physicians ld category well doctors you have heard the case no doubt what are your thoughts upon it pray speak out  dr primus my lord i think the matter is possible in nature for any man or woman though it is not very common in suchlike case to go for thirty days or so secure from all alarms of dissolution or any injury to constitution  ld c  y did ever case like this in all your practice and experience fall  dr p i cannot say it did    ld c  y then reason give how costive patient in such case could live  dr p my lord in fault of such evacuation our system operates by transpiration that is my lord by porous exsudation  ld c  y to dr secundus now doctor give us your advice  dr secundus i will my lord and in a trice and partly with my friend i say  content in other points i widely must dissent for in default of such evacuation i own my learned brothers transpiration in plainer terms his porous exsudation might help dame nature for twelve days or so further than this no mortal man can go the stoutest k  g that ever wore a crown in half a month must lay his scepter down  ld c  y to the board my lords this case is harder than we thought and g  knows when to issue twill be brought what do you say our time should now be spent in thinking of some new expedient  ld dinnerbell my lords if my poor feeble voice be heard this puzzling point had better be deserrd and to the learned corpse in w  klane reserrd meanwhile my lords we may go home and dine recruit our spirits with a glass of wine may take a little private recreatiion and then resume this deep deliberation done done nem con now gentle reader should some lord invite thee perhaps a sumptuous dinner may delight thee but if no lordly invitations come then cat thy muttonchop and be content at home but if nor house nor home be thine nor muttonchop nor silver coin alas thy case is very hard thou would better change it with our bard peter lives well and at free charge until he is set once more at large and that i think must be ere long unless lord t  y right or wrong to show how far his power can go in wreaking vengeance on a foe should grasp him in his arbitrary paw and give him vide state trials bp a  ys case bishop atterburys law but if he does this will not hang peter nor stop the effusions of his meter it is true such law would make him prance and send him cross the sea to france but t  ys utmost malice no further goes than calais from thence our bard may strait proceed and at versailles its merits plead what though the plot did not succeed his will was ready for the deed even good intentions of this sort are well received at bourbons court it ever was the gallic nature to hug a rebel and a traitor whenever they find a rogue in grain for future jobs his service they retain here may our bard snug refuge take as did ere while that yankee snake like peter fostered by his k  g till he shot forth his vengeful sting to wound the land which gave him bread and raised from earth his recreant head and if capricious fortune should befriend him and old ben franklins wondrous luck attend him peter highhonourd by our gallic foe may figure at versailles a rebel plenipo but now it is time our business should go on i wish these guzzling c  l lords were done for sure they take a tedious while to dine   oh here they come wellflushd with rosy wine twobottle men i warrant you or more two did i say  more likely three or four  president of the board once more my lords we are all in c  l met let every noble member take his seat and now i hope you will be good boys refrain from quarrel and from noise commit no outrage or disorder or i must call you all to order  ld t  y my lord you have spoken like a prudent man and keep us all to order if you can  ld category is there no message come from w  k lane cannot all the learned there this case explain  dr deputy my lord in due obedience to your high command deputed from our learned body here i stand with long deliberation on points of transpiration orporous exsudation our minds are all in deep and dark confusion and cannot grope the way to fair conclusion my lords the members of our college do all with one consent acknowledge the case is not within their knowledge the point suspended must remain till france and italy and spain with every other learned nation have penned a latin dissertation when all our rays of science are collected we hope sufficient light will be reflected some fair conclusion to make out and clear this point beyond all doubt meantime my lords you will not forget that we have received no money yet you know my lords with men of our description the maxim is  no guinea no prescription in this one case our brethren all agree that nothing must be done without a fee this wanting not a word they will write or speak but keep within their teeth their latin and their greek if then you would know our whole collected sense you must not be too sparing of your pence our name is legion  we are many and every man must have his guinea  down with a hundred thousand pounds or so  well then begin and see how far twill go instant at name of hundred thousand pounds lord hopeful starting from his seat cried  zounds this peter pindar plagues us more than hastings  amidst such lavish spendings and such wastings my sinking fund will never go on and then my lords we are all undone for f  x and b  ke will pour forth fierce orations and drive us from our places and our stations doctor we give no answer now tomorrow you shall further know  dr deputy withdraws ld t  y to the board my lords we nothing further can discover this peter pindars trial must  stand over when w  klane this puzzling question clears or stronger evidence from france appears i will send a proper summons to you all and hope you will meet me here in c  l hall meanwhile till we have fairly tried him pen ink and paper shall not be denied him  peter thank you my lord i will use your favor well and this my next d  n ode shall tell  c  l adjourns peter i see thy cause will tire them out yes yes thou wilt get off now i make no doubt but what avails this one escape thou wilt soon be in another scrape for ah my illstarrd rhyming brother thou must be hanged one day or other what say thou peter to all this  peter why faith i take it much amiss that thoust stopped short of thy intention to sport thy muse with my suspension long while i have been in tiptoe expectation to see how thou would perform the operation but this postponing is an artful scheme my penetrating eye perceives thy drist thy muse unequal to the lofty theme would hide her nakedness with this poor shift forgive me if i do thee wrong by rash conjecture of thy song i grant thou have some little skill   i see that thou have words at will in common chat and suchlike humble sport  sermoni propiora  seems thy forte but where is thy simile and phrase sublime for fancys flights i fear thou have no rhyme no  loftiness of song is not for thee but homer virgil milton and for me and now my hand is fairly in i will show thee how thou must begin if thou would boldly soar in epic line and rival homers lofty song or mine now cock thine eye and see me fly of t  ys direful wig of vengeful laws of plot and costive k  g the tragic cause which launched from tyburntree to plutos reign the soul of tuneful bard untimely slain sing heavenly muse etc  thus must thy numbers flow to hurl a lofty bard to shades below and always end thy song with brilliant dash which frenchmen call eclat and englishmen call flash observe my lessons well and by and by thy feeble unfledged muse may learn to fly now peter pindar without joking you are grown so saucy and provoking thou wilt rouse my cholric indignation to give thee such a flagellation as thou had never yet and wilt not soon forget then take this little sample of my skill and own i have similes as well as words at will   fox and grapes simile as fox which eyes the ripened grapes and knows no fruit is sweeter but if he cannot will not have those grapes sort thou o reynard peter   the disappointed swain simile as swain who woos a pretty maid and fain at church would meet her but ah whose rival wins that maid sort thou greenwillow peter   the old maid simile as ancient maid who will not wed if suitors will not entreat her and sorely rails at marriage bed sort thou forsaken peter   grubstreet bard simile as vilest bard who mocks his k  g in motley doggrel meter still disregarded by his k  g sort thou o grubstreet peter   pindar and his muse like to like as is thy darling and prolific muse of easy virtue and unblushing face sort thou forgive me if i wrong accuse devoid of honor loyalty or grace  peter what touch my honor rather strike me dead   my dearest rhyming brother peter so well i love thee and thy meter i would not touch a hair upon thy head with such a pleasant and facetious fellow i would sooner drink a bottle and be mellow my dearest bard with thee o may i swing if i dont love thee as thou love thy k  g but as to honor peter say no more repeat no grievance aggravate no sore  peter honor i had    yes yes no doubt no doubt but usage hard has worn thy honor out but it is no loss for what can thou with this same honor have to do it never sold thy bolus or thy pill it never paid thy printer k  ys bill if then thy honor brings no profit what good to thee can ever come of it thy brother wit jack falstaff used to say that of such useless bauble he would have none which could not keep him out of dangers way nor heal a wound nor set a broken bone of falstaffs prudence i produce this sample for peter pindars lesson and example for sure you are congenial souls as ever met over flowing bowls or ever carousd with giddy heir apparent or made disloyal jest of r  l parent o had i shakespeares deathless lyre o would his muse my verse inspire thy name o peter still should float along the stream of time in neverdrowning song and whilst the years in long succession roll still jack and peter should swim cheek by jowl  but now of flourishing enough let us find the thread where we broke off my muse forgets  o fie upon her   but now i recollect  twas honor of this i tell thee once again that honors loss will be thy gain this honor would not let thee sing nor mock and ridicule thy k  g such loyal monitor would strike thee dumb and poet pindar turn to poet mum and this would be thy certain ruin thy woeful starving and undoing  but this is only wasting precious time  i am now to give thee simile sublime the gibbet simile as when some rogues on lofty gibbet hung some rogue as impudent as ever swung his ghastly corpse all dangling in the air retaining even in death a dire kingkilling air sure peter this must freeze thy very blood you are very bad if this will not make thee good but since you are so ambitious and presumptuous grown i will hoist thee higher still  but then i will fetch thee down but be nt afraid it is all in sport and thou wilt receive but little hurt nay in this game thou wilt be the only winner for thou not i wilt carry off the dinner the kite simile as when some ctswd kite ascends on high waves in the wind or sails along the sky if preys in view and hunger presses hard slap down he comes to snatch a chick from poultry yard now peter thou have stolen that chicken twill serve thee for a little picking i guess that you are a greedy elf thou wilt eat it every bit thyself perchance to k  y thou would help a wing but deuce a bit to me or even to g  e thy k  g peter i like not shooting in the dark because not one in three may hit thy mark give me that open daylight rebel poet who tells his name nor cares if all men know it but thou behind this pindars mask art snug as biting vermin latent close in rug by gods unnamd by british men clepd  bug yes this bushfight is thy delight how often like coward savage have thou laid in dark and silent nightly ambuscade thy spiteful feathered shaft to wing and wound the heart of g  e thy k  g a k  g who never injured thee but very much offended me by such disuse of r  l shears and such neglect of peter pindars ears such cowardly attack i never will forgive i will point thee out a black as long as ever i live i have more to add  which further still will grate for though thou art a witty fellow with thee i never will be mellow assassins ever were my mortal hate yes now more seriously i come to think i must recall my former hasty motion if ever with rebel rogues like thee i drink may baneful juice of hemlock be my potion moreover peter if the fates decree that judgment must overtake both thee and me for this our crime of wicked rhyme if thou and i must both be shipped away to found new families at botny bay before such foreign trip i take this first inquiry will i make what passengers are going and if i find that thou art there i will cry rash mariner forbear nor be thy own undoing if life or ship or cargo thy regard for once o take a convicts word from steerage drag that wicked wicked bard and toss him headlong overboard now reader faith my muse is at stand what further sport to give thee on the land and so to end the matter i will dash him in the water and here i have such a simile to treat with as every day i am sure thou will not meet with thou wilt swear that even pindar peter never made a longer or a better i will launch him off in majestoso because it is fit that he should go so as when some convict cleaves the watery way condemned to colonize at botny bay the bark unequal to the sinful freight her timbers groan beneath the pressive weight lo how the welkin lowrs what clouds arise see angry neptune mounts into the skies on every side tremendous billows roar old oceans roused and foams from shore to shore see lightnings flash hark dreadful thunders roll and rend the blackning sky from pole to pole the trembling pilot quits the helm and leaves his bark the sport of raging winds and waves hark what shrieks and dismal skies hark what crashing hark what slashing hark what bumping hark what thumping rumbling jumbling fumbling tumbling cursing swearing ripping tearing shouting bawling mainmast falling planks all starting decks all parting friends lamenting foes relenting ranting raving mercy craving peter trembling not dissembling pindar quaking for odemaking vessel rocking foundring sinking sailors wicked and unthinking ah not loved grog but briny water drinking drowning and blasting one anothers eyes pause ad libitum there  down she goes with peter pindar in her this it is to have on board a grievous sinner  but lo who is he that floats upon the main by jupiter it is peter up again do all i can to keep him down this buoyant fellow will not drown i see our poets tuneful breath will not be stopped by watery death but now again i am at a stand how i shall get him back to land o would some vessel but appear in view or passing to the old world or the new   huzza  a dolphin charmed by peters song bestrid by peter nimbly glides along alternate up and down he steers his course like master tommy riding hobbyhorse say peter did thou ever ride so prettily before cheer up my boy  thou wilt soon behold thy native shore kind dolphin speed thy way to plymouth sound and land thy poet sasc on cornish ground rejoice o friends of peter and of ode you will see him soon he is posting on the road escaped from perils both of land and main your bard is turned upon your hands again finis
