an essay at a plain exposition of that difficult phrase a good peace  by the author of the review  printed for j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row      price   d  introduction the subject i have here undertaken is so nice and a plain treating of it so difficult so dangerous and especially in me so liable to the censures of prejudices on both sides that it has been with some hesitation that i go about it  not that i am so solicitous of whom i please or displease in my handling this nice affair for he that is so can never speak with an impartial freedom a liberty absolutely necessary to the clear stating things of doubtful acceptance and a liberty which when i cease to preserve to my self i shall cease to write at all  it is very hard with me in this case more than with any other author in that whereas others are wary in what they write for fear of displeasing the government and irritating men in power my difficulty is a clamor raised by them who without arrogance i may say cannot confute me pretending that i am too careful to please men in power in which as my lord rochester said of his whore i have the scandal without the joy the reproach without the profit of the charge but as the same men brought the same charge when the other party was in power and thought it as much a crime i appeal to all the world what heed ought to be given to their censure i only introduce this with a brief challenge to them let them find any change of principle in all i have written if they can and if what i wrote under the late ministry and under this ministry agrees it must be some body else that has changed principle not me let the issue determine it  i would be glad to please every body but my aim is to speak truth with honesty if it please no body i am not solicitous so it be but truth and honesty he that can say it is not let him stand forth and be seen he that cannot contradict the truth i speak will have but small success in calumniating the honesty with which i speak it  and yet i had not entered now upon this subject but that the writers of the town according to the usage i have some years been treated with laying all their bastards at my door and almost every book being called mine as well of one side as the other i thought my self a little obliged to declare my self and let you all know my notions of things with my name to them that i may no longer bear the scandals of the present filth of the press with pardon for that expression  hitherto i have said nothing on the subject nor do i purpose to say any thing but what i will fairly own and defend and that i hope may answer the people who call every thing they dont like by my name  i am not apt to make apologies and i entreat the reader to place this impertinence to the account of the ages follies which oblige me to it in order to defend my self from a charge so unjust as that of being the author of books which i never gave my self the trouble so much as to read  an essay etc peace without other encomiums it is sufficient to say merits every mans approbation and though the whole town is agitated and angry about it yet no man will be found among us but what will readily own he is for peace  it would be happy for us all if we could talk of peace with a little more of it in our tempers that we could be at peace when we pretend to desire peace it is to me the strangest thing in the world that we are all falling together by the ears and making war about peace if you talk of one man who otherwise we liked well enough hang him he is a rogue he is come over he is for peace the other side are even with us and they talking with this or that acquaintance who tom or jack ay he is an honest fellow enough a good natured fellow enough but he is got in with these furious people he is all for blood nothing but carrying on the war and pushing all things to extremities death and destruction are always in his mouth he is mad if you do but talk of peace to him  unhappy nation what end can these things lead us to not a public society not a coffeehouse not a meeting of friends not a visit but like jehu to jezabel who is on my side who who is for peace who is for carrying on the war society is converted into cabal all public meetings appear sorted into committees or bandyed into sides as their notions of peace or war incline them  i cannot but make one brief observation which may have some philosophy in it and i dare say it is all natural the note may have its uses in it which every one may improve as they see fit when you find men sitting in a public room say a coffeehouse or tavern and talking of the public two to one of my money before you hear a word they say that i tell you at first who are for peace and who are for war the gentlemen who are for peace you hear them but at a small distance their voices are low their speech deliberate their words are soft calm and spoken easy like the subject they speak of the other side that are for war you may hear them into the street or down the stairs their voices are thunder they speak the word war with something of the noise of war as if they were giving in the field the word of command or bidding a platoon give fire again look in their faces the men of peace have it in their countenances their faces are covered with smiles a sort of calm and smoothness of temper sits on their brow they look pleased and serence like the spirit that possesses them the men that are for war seem in a ferment their eyes sparkle something boisterous appears in their faces they look as uneasy as they talk and the aversion they have to peace shows it self in their countenances some cross lines seem to be drawn over their faces by which they discover the temper they stand in as to the thing that they have in debate  well however come near to these gentlemen and argue closely with them and you shall find them all join in this that peace in its general acceptance is a blessing which no man can have a real stated aversion to the offspring of heaven and an emblem of eternal blessedness no man can open his muth against peace as such nor are the gentlemen i am speaking of who are against peace at this time against it in this sense let no man mistake me i am not writing a satyr against any body it is the unhappy circumstances of the present national temper that i am speaking of that we are uneasy to one another differing disputing caballing and sometimes downright quarelling and about what not peace in general no every one is for that but the peace now to be treated of between the confederates and the king of france that is the uneasiness  nor to do every one justice is the question among us whether we shall make peace with france or no every man of sense every man of principle every man that has any knowledge of the circumstances of the nation or concern for its prosperity and happiness wishes for peace no man will say that he is not for peace the very war is made for peace it is the condition of every manifesto every declaration all the alliances all the articles of the confederacies which lay down the causes and beginnings of the war are full of it peace peace to restore the tranquillity of europe to restore the liberty of europe to restore the balance of power in europe the whole war turns upon this point and to be very plain the justice the honor and the reputation of the confederacy can be supported and defended upon no other foundation nothing else can justify the allies for taking up arms neither do they pretend to any other justification of it the word is the necessity they are driven to there being no other way left them to obtain peace indeed no war is just but what is made for peace nothing but peace can make war lawful so that peace being the only thing pretended to in the undertaking this war for any man to say they do not desire peace is to say they fight as the great turk does for his pleasure for increase of his dominions for conquest and the extending his power which is just as much to be defended as the pirates of madagascar or as robbing on the highway and no otherwise  but to come to the point the particular objection lies another way it is not a peace in general that our people object against but the nature and circumstances of the peace and here we give the peace an epithet which requires some enquiry into a good peace this is the distinction this alone it is that our whole dispute turns upon and the exposition of the true meaning or acceptance of this word is the subject of this undertaking  a good peace say the objectors we are all for but not such a peace as you would have or as you would make and this is the state of the case two men quarrelling together in this town one a west countryman the other a north countryman among some scurrility that past between them says west to his antagonist i am no yorkshireman why says north what have you to say to yorkshire are there not a great many honest men in yorkshire i would have you know there are as honest men in yorkshire as in any part of england ay ay says west that may be true for ought i know but that is called honesty in yorkshire which is not honesty in other places  this is something like our case as one sort who are charged with being against peace justify themselves and say no we are not against peace but are for a good peace or none so those on the other side who are for peace say they are for no peace but a good peace also but the case will lie very much here and indeed only here whether that is not called a good peace by one side which is not called a good peace by the other and so we are brought down by both parties to the great enquiry which is the subject of the present discourse viz  what is to be understood by a good peace  in pursuing this enquiry impartially it will come of course that we consider the mistakes which people are naturally led into about this question and the various constructions which the men of this day are pleased to put upon this word which construction varies as interest party and opinion leads them  i shall not spend time to enquire how it comes to pass that there are at this time such mistakes and so many opinions upon so plain a question and how a nation so clearsighted as we are comes to see with such differing views put such a differing sense upon a word of such consequence at such a time as this for really the unhappy breach of parties among us and the prejudices which constantly attend those partydivisions give us but too plain a method how to account for them and it must be that men being blinded by their passions and their prejudices are deprived of the clear and uninterruped use of their judgment give their opinions with partiality as the several interests of the parties they espouse influence their judgments  to come at a right understanding of what we call a good peace it seems necessary with plainness and freedom to lay down a little historically the state of the war as it respects britain and her allies and this i shall do as plainly and briefly as i can  after the peace of reswick for i shall go back no farther the king of france having recognized king william settled all the reunions and surrendered to the confederates what was agreed to be surrendered europe had a pleasing prospect of a happy and a lasting peace there was but one event which had any thing in it fatal or threatening to the tranquillity of this part of the world and this was the death of charles ii king of spain without issue which though it was not then happened yet it was probable could not be far off however to prevent the evil consequences which such an event might bring upon europe and as the preamble to the treaties of partition says to prevent a new war the two kings of england and france with the states general entered into a convention or treaty for bringing all the claims and pretensions to that succession to a balance this is the so much controverted treaty called the treaty of partition in the preamble to which are the following words relating to what i am now treating of  be it known to all who shall see these presents that the most serene and most mighty prince lewis xiv etc and the most serene and most mighty prince william iii etc and the states general etc desiring nothing more heartily than to strengthen by new engagements the good intelligence reestablished between them  there is keeping up the peace they had made and to prevent by measures taken in time the events that might raise new wars in europe have to that end etc there is safety against future troubles and so he goes on to the articles of the partition vide treaty page     after the end of this transaction europe was in a perfect tranquillity i mean as to nations for as to peace at home god knows we enjoyed less of it than ever but heaven healed our needless breaches by making two real breaches upon us and finding the nation sick and surfeited with the little peace we had he visited us with a new war and the death of the king  the new war began purely on the french side who made himself agressor by two steps taken in a direct contravention to the solemn treaties he had made though those treaties were ratified and exchanged in due form and so fairly executed that europe and especially england entirely disarmed laid by their fleets and broke their troops reducing the establishment of forces to the stint or limitation of a profound peace  the two steps i speak of which the french took to break this peace were   the owning declaring and complimenting the pretender by the style and titles due to king william as king of england scotland and ireland notwithstanding the article in the treaty of reswick by which he had before acknowledged king william   the other was the seizing and taking possession of the whole spanish monarchy by virtue of a will or pretended will of king charles ii to the duke of anjou and declaring the said duke of anjou king of spain etc notwithstanding his agreement and solemn ratification of the treaty of partition then in force  these things produced a war as universal to this part of europe as ever was engaged in which has now been carried on nine year and   months from may the   th   0  to october the  th      of the successes and probable end of which i need not enlarge here it may come to be spoken of again  i must do his most christian majesty that justice as to say i never saw or heard that in all his manifestoes or declarations of or concerning this war he ever stooped to give many reasons why he took either of the steps except only his own will and pleasure viz that so he had thought fit to do viz we have thought fit rather to accept the said gift of the late king charles to our said grandson etc  and we have thought fit to salute the said prince meaning the pretender by such and such titles and the like  but the more his majesty thought fit to take those unccommon steps and the less reason he was pleased to give for them the greater and the juster reasons they were why the confedetates should enter again into that war which was the consequence of it and this is evidently taken hold of in that sense by the english and the dutch in their respective declarations of war as follows  whereas instead of giving the satisfaction that ought justly to be expected the french king has added thereunto  note that is unto the seizing the spanish monarchy a great affront and indignity to us and our kingdoms in taking upon him to declare the pretended prince of wales king of england scotland and ireland and has also influenced spain to concur in the same affront and indignity we find our selves obliged for maintaining the public faith for vindicating the honor of our crown and to prevent the mischiefs which all europe is threatened with to declare war etc  i recapitulate these things because from these foundations will best be inferred what ought to be esteemed by all the confederates a good peace which is bringing it down to the case before me and of which i shall speak again in its course  when the king of france had thought fit as above to take these two steps europe immediately broke out into a flame the people of england resented in a particular manner the affront put upon their king in the king of france setting up a pretender against him after he had solemnly owned his title and made treaties with him as king and addresses flowed from all parts of the kingdom to the king expressing their detestation of that treatment and pressing his majesty to a war  the other allies as much resenting the king of frances sezing upon the monarchy of spain and setting up his grandson philip v prepared for war also upon that account upon these mutual grievances was formed the treaty called the grand alliance in which the particular demands of the allies without which it is made unlawful for them on either hand to make peace are particularly stipulated with this express condition also that it shall not be lawful to any of the confederates to treat of peace with the enemy without the mutual assent and advice of the rest of the confederates  and here again you may have a stated foundation for what we ought to call a good peace nor is there in any of these things any feigned construction or forced sense by which any one can be led to make the terms of peace more or less for this like the statutes of a nation is the rule to go by  to the law and to the testimony was the word of of old to the grand alliance and to the declaration of the reasons of the war is the word with me and i believe will be so with all impartial men in the world  here is the cause of your making war here is your declared resolution when it shall end and till when it shall not end and when these ends are answered the causes the reason and the original motion of the grand alliance cease  and here i must touch a very nice point and which yet i shall do plainly and with respect i shall be the last man in britain that shall endeavor to lessen the duty and regard that the people of this nation ought to pay to the votes opinion or declaraions of the parliament which is our rue representative and whose actions are our own  but speaking in the language of the confederacy i say with humble submission no vote no address no declared opinion of the parliament as to the terms of the peace can alter at all the foundation of the war or bind the rest of the confederates beyond the obligations they are under by virtue of the aliances and stipulations of confederacy they are already engaged in  thus as it is not in the power of any of the confederates legally to make peace or treat of peace without common consent etc so neither is it in the power of any of the confederates to impose farther conditions upon the rest or to say we will not make peace unless such or such things be obtained although those things are not expressed in the said grand alliance which is the only obligatory limitation of peace and war  to explain my self yet farther with all posible respect and regard to the confederates if any one of the confederates or the states or parliament of their country should vote or declare that no peace should be made with france till such or such conditions were obtained were it putting the whole spanish monarchy into such or such hands as they please to name if such conditions are not expressed in the grand alliance i humbly conceive the rest of the confederates are not obliged by that vote  i come still nearer to the point for as i hope i say nothing offensive so i need cover it with no allegory or similies for i hate disguises  our parliament voted and addressed and gave it as their opinion and her majesty concurred with that opinion that no peace could be safe and honorable while any part of the spanish monarchy remained in the possession of the house of bourbon   but if this is neither expressed or implied in the said grand alliance which is the compact and the binding principle of the war i leave it to any impartial hand to make out how far would these votes or addresses be binding upon the rest of the confederates  this is to me an unanswerable proof that the grand alliance is the test the foundation to judge of the condition of the peace by and whatever treaty amouns to or gives to us all that is agreed to be demanded by that treaty may be called a good peace though it should not come up to the future opinions of any set of people whatsoever  from the votes and addresses of the british parliament i come to the late treaty if it be proper to call it a treaty of the preliminaries settled at the hague by monsieur torcy and the plenipotentiaries of the allies  if by these preliminaries the confederates pushed france to a farther length than the treaty of grand alliance had concerted well and good my answer is this if the confederates thought they had found an opportunity to gain more of france than they had set as the negative bounds of peace no body can blame them especially if they had obtained it i believe every honest man wishes with me they had obtained it but i will not say for this that no peace on less conditions than those preliminaries provided within the limits declared by the grand alliance would have been a good peace  as to the objection which some make viz that by their insisting on those extraordinary advantages they lost all the rest and pushed the king of france to extremeties which made him choose to run all risques rather than comply with them and that they might have had as much as the grand alliance required and as much as they had pretended to one another to make war for as to this i say they are none of the objections i am upon nor are they of any use to the present purpose    the question before me is what is the proper foundation of a good peace at this time to which my answer is as before the grand alliance is the test of a good peace yet as much more as you can i will never be the complainer but i dare not say that when what is there demanded can be obtained you have any just reason to carry on the war to obtain more at least unless all the confederates agree to do so for nothing beyond it can be obligatory upon the whole  it remains then that all which shall be said farther relating to a peace must be a comment upon this text  there is an event happened since the making that alliance which in that alliance there is no provision made for and which had it been foreseen the allies no doubt would have made some proper article to have settled this is the death of the emperor and this accident may give us room to enquire whether it does not make some needful alterations in the terms on which we are to insist for peace  my answer is plain i wish some people would bear with my plainness i say it does not and here without fear or regard to power or parties i shall say some things which i do believe will startle man kind a little in this case at least if we consider the popular notions which spread among us  we have been pushed on to set up the taking spain from king philip as the rest or stay of the confederates as a thing that we are all ruined and undone without and the parliament vote address and declare their opinion as before that no peace can be safe or honorable without it and yet i must tell you  there is not one word of recovering all the spanish monarchy out of the hands of the house of bourbon in all the grand alliance so that none of the confederates are under any obligations to go that particular length and not make peace without it  my argument turns upon this point then of which this is the abstract a peace may be honorable if made according to the tenor of the grand alliance  but the recovering all the spanish monarchy from the house of bourbon is no part of the tenor of the grand alliance  therefore a peace may be honorable though some part of the spanish monarchy should remain to the house of bourbon    if in this way of arguing i am put to prove the assumption  viz that a peace may be honorable if made according to the tenor of the grand alliance i make it out thus the grand alliance is a convention of all the allies declaring all the grievances for which they make war and on what terms only they will make peace  if all the reasons inducing the war are answered and all the demands upon which the war is declared are obtained it can be no longer just to make war when it is no longer just to make war it is just we should make peace and whatsoever is just in this case is honorable  i return to the grand alliance i say there is not one word of the terms of peace which are mentioned in the address of the parliament to be found in the grand alliance  the terms of peace limited by the grand alliance are these and none but these    an equitable and reasonable security to his imperial majesty for his pretensions to the spanish succession   a particular and sufficient security of the kingdoms provinces dominions navigation and commerce for the subjects of his majesty of great britain and the states general see for this the treaty of grand alliance entered into by the three powers the empire england and holland september     0  articl   and   the observation therefore is not mine nly it is the nature of the thing let any ne tell me how from hence does it appear that we must fight particularly till ot one branch of the spanish monarchy emain to the house of bourbone or that ur peace will be neither safe nor honouable without it    i do farther say and i appeal to the knowledge of all who were then in the management of things that it was in part and in private agreed if the king of france had complied with the evacuating article as proposed at ghertruydenberg that to save europe the farther distractions of the war and prevent the effusion of blood some small allotment should have been made to king philip v and this allotment was in their eye and according to what appeared was to be scicily sardinia corstca etc  now this was part of the spanish monarchy and philip was of the house of bourbon the consequence of this must the be according to the parliaments address that they would have made peace which was neither safe nor honorable  nor was this all but   the parliament was kept at hand by small adjournments in order if need were to have the necessity of receding from that vote o address or opinion call it what you will in order to a peace made appear these ar the things which i say may startle mankind  now gentlemen pray let me ask doe the vote or opinion of the parliamen make the conditions of a peace safe and honorable or is it so in the consequence and by the nature of the thing it self i desire to pay a just deference to the opinion of parliaments but never against the reason and nature of things  again the parliament was to have been desired if it had been found necessary to have receded from that vote  what would they have said to the houses would they have asked them to vote for a peace which was in their opinion not safe or honorable no no they would have alleged that such and such things being agreed it was judged both safe and honorable and the house must have been desired to alter their opinion  and now gentlemen let no man miake me i am not reflecting on the late inistry in this or on the late parliament  is what they ought to have done no dubt as cases and things alter the pinions of men must alter and reason quires that they should alter their opinins let them be kings queens parliaents or any body of men in the world  this was the case in the treaty of partion what passed upon that affair i need ot repeat but if such a treaty should yet e found necessary i make no question it shall be yet voted safe and honorable all ther and former opinions to the contrary n any wise notwithstanding  i have hinted this because i know our people run away with it that the parliament having made that address and given t as their opinion that no peace can be good i e safe and honorable but as before that all the spanish monarchy be taken from the house of bourbon and that therefore this only is the test of a good peace which i think is fairly and i hope modestly too confuted  i have nothing to do in this discourse with whom this or that part of the spanish monarchy should be given to i am upon the general and with all humble submission to parliaments addresses answers that i think it appears with a non obstante to what of that kind has past viz tha a safe and honorable peace may be made though every branch of the spanish monarchy should not be recovered from the house of bourbon  this i lay down as my general  i cannot dismiss this head without observing two things which being rightly understood will take off all that any one may think in this is reflecting upon the late parliament    that as the case stood then that vote was agreeable to the state of things in the world and to the prospect the confederates had before them both of the possibility of that conquest and of the necessity of it   that as the case stands now it is more than probable that same parliament in the same interest and with the same designs would have been of another opinion alteration of circumstances must for ever be allowed to be a reason for alteration of opinion in all cases in the world nor is it any reproach to the wisdom or integrity of that parliament to say that what might be absolutely necessary then may be otherwise now  i am none of them that leave my readers to guess at cases or need that any one should ask what are these alterations of circumstances which have happened since and which make this difference or whether and how it is more safe to leave part of the spanish monarchy in the house of bourbon now than it was before  my answer is direct the revolution which has happened in the house of austria since that time whereby the imperial crown is fallen to the same person to whom was then allotted the crown of spain is the alteration which i speak of and i cannot but believe that according to the treaty of partition and according to the received opinion of europe for some ages it would never be judged safe that the crown of spain should ever be permitted to be given to the person of an emperor any more than of a king of france  this is an opinion founded upon all the principles of safety which the princes of europe have acted upon for above  0 years past  viz the balance of power which by such a coalition or conjunction of power would be entirely broken and dissolved  will any man believe of the last parliament that they would have been of the opinion to have given the whole spanish monarchy to the person of an emperor of germany will any man say that no peace can be safe or honorable but what shall put all the dominions of the spanish crown into the hands of charles vi it is not dishonorable account to give of his imperial majesty to say it would make him too great for the rest of europe to be easy under i think i might be allowed to say the same of the queen of england  but i meet with an objection here which should be spoken to  viz what is this to the purpose the parliaments vote is not upon who you shall give it to but who you shall take it from not who shall have it but who shall not have it to this cavil for it is no more i answer that neither do i say who should have it but who should not and let this lie for those to answer to whom it belongs i know the question is invidious and ensnaring and though i could answer it i believe effectually and to satisfaction yet it is not to our purpose here and for that reason i wave it  the two negatives lie before us the house of bourbon must not have it say the addresses the nature of the things says now the person you would have given it to must not have it what then will you do with it  and this brings me home to the original question what is to be called a good peace as then i have thus stated the question i shall come to a direct answer as freely as possible    that alone can be a good peace where none of the parties are vested with so much power as overthrows the balance of europe   that alone can be a good peace wherein the great articles of the grand alliance which were the beginning and are the foundation of the war are fully answered in these two generals are comprised all the particulars which require any explanation in this affair    none of the several parties are to be vested with so much power as overthrows the balance of europe that this would be the case of the spanish monarchy were it united either in the person of a king of france or of an emperor of germany seems so plain as needs no farther debate and the reader is only referred for proof of it for the first to the king of france for the second to king william i will give it you under both their hands if any man can quote better authority he is welcome    the king of france his most christian majesty very frankly acknowleges for his part that it is not safe for europe that the crown of spain should be enjoyed by the same person who is king of france this you have in the proposals of peace made in his name and now under consideration signed by monsieur mesnager as follows  that he will freely and bona fide consent to the taking of all just and reasonable measures for hindering that the crowns of france and spain may never be united on the head of the same prince his majesty being persuaded that this excess of power would be contrary to the good and quiet of europe vide the   th proposal    the late king william his majesty declares in the solemn treaty between england holland and france called the second treaty of partition that that treaty being made for the good and safety of europe and to prevent future wars between the confdeerates therein named that the crown of sqain should never come to be enjoyed by the person of an emperor or a king of france in these words  if the most serene archduke should die without issue either before or after the death of the catholic king the share which is hereby assigned to him shall come to such male child of the emperor or of the king of the romans except the king of the romans mark that as his imperial majesty shall assign it to but on condition that the said part shall never be united nor belong to the person of him who shall be emperor or king of the romans or is become one or the other be it by succession will contract of marriage donation exchange cession appeal rebolt or otherwise as in like manner the said share of the serene archduke shall never come or belong to the person of a prince that is or shall be king or dauphine of france  thus you have the royal authority of both these crowned heads to prove what i have asserted in the first general    that alone can be a good peace wherein the great articles of the grand alliance which were the beginning and are the foundation of the war are fully answered  for evidence of this we need go no farther than the grand alliance it self  the terms of the grand alliance are these    that an equitable and reasonable satisfaction be given to his imperial majesty for his pretension to thespanish succession vide grand alliance artic     note here if the allies had understood that the whole spanish monarchy had devolved to him as his right let me ask these questions   why is it called satisfaction for the succession why is it not rather said till he be put into possession of the spanish monarchy it would certainly have been expressed otherwise if it had been meant he should ever possess it as emperor   why is it called his imperial majestys pretension to the succession and yet put into the hands of his brother king charles   i must be excused making two remarks upon this   satisfaction for the succession plainly infers his imperial majesty was never understood to be the person that should succeed it would never else have been called satisfaction for it this implies an equivalent with which he was to be satisfied instead of it and plainly acknowledges that the confederrates never dreamt of making an emperor of germany to be also king of spain   whereas it is called his imperial majestys right of succession why then was it given to king charles it is evident this transferring the crown by gift to king charles iii at the same time that we exploded king charles ii devising it by gift to king philip was but an odd title and gave such a handle to confirm k philips right his gift being prior to the other as i never yet could see answered but waving that which i have formerly insisted on and which is now no more a question the emperor being dead this argument may be drawn from it which i believe can never be answered that the emperor demitted his right to his brother because it never could be allowed tolerable nor so much as to be thought of that ever the allies would agree an emperor of germany should have it as the very same foundation of exorbitance which they were then declaring and fighting against in the king of france  the king of france then and the emperor finding that on both sides the taking the crown of spain to themselves would not go down with the rest of europe they respectively put a third person in the place philip and charles and both of them claim the crown of spain by gift neither having any real title  fate now has decided the point on one side for king charles is taken out of the contention and made emperor  can he then be king of spain certainly by any of the former notions of europe he can never be so received  well what is next have we any other branch of the house of austria to make a gift to if we have let us see him if we have not what follows but to make such a treaty as in which the balance of europe may be secured and such powers erected as may reciprocally prevent either the house of bourbon or austria overrunning europe and this i shall call a good peace let who will find out the medium to bring it to pass   the first thing i shall hint from this obsevation is  this makes me easy and i believe if considered would make us all easy on the subject of a treaty  let who will be the agents let what will be the proposals the nature of the thing is such no party can suggest that we should not have a regard to the balance of europe no peace can be treated on but upon this foot the establishing some rule of power some generals for the boundaries of national interest such as may limit the princes of europe and prevent future encroachments one upon another  for this reason i cannot but think we should all be willing to come to talk of these things  certainly to treat of them can be of no prejudice nor can i allow it to be a good argument to say that the french always gain upon us by a treaty this is to call all the confederates fools and say they do not know what they would have that they make war for they know not what that they have generals to fight but no states men to treat that they have hands but no heads and that all europe are not able to maintain their arguments against five frenchmen plenipotentiaries  the french make proposals they would put by the way of treating by preliminaries and come to a general treaty at once and why should we not venture them at a treaty we can insist upon every thing at a general treaty as well as at a particular and can stand to all the necessary points of the grand alliance as well there as at another time  the treating brings us not the nearer if france does not come up to reasonable things we are where we were the war goes on nothing is abated of the vigor of our armies or of the needful preparations the war indeed may influence the treaty thus it was at the treaty of westphalia which held at least eight years thus it was at the treaty of nimeguen which lasted two campaigns yet both at last came to a conclusion and so may this perhaps if it does not we are never the farther off of victory nor the enemy ever the nearer the end they aim at  it seems therefore something wonderful to me that people should be alarmed at a proposal to treat we may treat without a peace but we can never have a peace without treating all that we are alarmed at hitherto is the suggestion or suspicion of a private treaty to bring it then to an open fair public treaty is the most effectually way both to remove the suspicions of such a treaty on one hand and to take away the pretensions for it on the other  some allege a party among us are against peace are for perpetuating the war and have their private ends in view to be pursued at the public expense i am in hopes there are no such people among us however those people opposing a treaty give the best argument that those that think so can wish for to support that allegation it is alleged on the other hand that clandestine negotiations are on foot and those that say so fill the people with suspicions and apprehensions of such things as i hope are not in any ones head to attempt a treaty would effectually remove all those jealousies and clear up the reputation of both parties  at a treaty all the allies will be present by their plenipotentiaries every thing will be fully fairly and openly discussed if any member of the confederates are easier and willinger to be imposed upon than they ought to be they will be set to rights in judgment or overruled in vote by the other if any member of the confederacy is more rigid or more backward harder to be satisfied with reason or forwarder to continue the war than consists with the general interest he will be reduced to reason by the persuasions or overruled by the voices of the other  the french are not so considerable an enemy that we should be afraid to engage with them any farther in the war or so inconsiderable that we should think it below us to treat a treaty takes off all objections though they do not propose enough to form a good peace yet in a treaty we may bring them to it i can see many objections against their proposals indeed but i cannot see one against a treaty  in a treaty a thousand things may occur and be said that may in the end happily issue this great affair in a good peace as i said in the beginning i find every one joining in their desire to have a good peace but how shall they obtain it without a treaty a treaty takes it out of the hands of those you may suspect and puts it into the hands of the confederates in general if any concessions are made to france which you are afraid of there they will be discussed there they will be examined the plenipotentiaries of the allies on every side will be watchful that the distribution of the dominions be not partial and unequal to one or to another that every one has justice and that no advantage be given more on one hand than another the plenipotentiaries of all the parties are arbitrators of every particular interest respectively  certainly a treaty would end all this strife if the french are sincere in their offers and in their proposals for a general peace it will appear if they are not they will be detected the securities they will offer will be here disputed the validity of them determined if they are rejected the reasons for rejecting them will appear and if we must carry on the war again the necessity will appear so that people will be satisfied with it and the more cheerfully bear the expense moreover the scandal of designing to perpetuate the war will be removed and every one will see for themselves why the treaty broke off and why the war is carried on if a peace ensues it is not the less likely to be a good peace for having the whole body of the confederate ministers consenting to it and coming into it  i cannot imagine upon what foot any one can pretend to be backward to a treaty and i am the freer to put this notion of mine in here at this length because i think it is the only method to bring the variety of opinions now among us to a point to reconcile us to one another a little and to establish our private peace by putting an end to the present disputes among us a thing every good man wishes for and a thing none can deny we extremely want  i cannot but think those people very much mistaken both on one side or other who oppose a treaty some say a treaty will be to no purpose and will but amuse us and all europe that it is plain the confederates will insist on the surrendering all the spanish monarchy to the house of austria and that the french will not part with it and therefore the war must go on till the french find themselves in such circumstances as to be obliged to quit that sweet morsel to save the rest that a treaty in the mean time is but amusing us and is a particular service to the king of france as it buoys up his people in hopes of a peace and urges them to exert their utmost for awhile longer upon a prospect of a speedy issue of all their troubles on the other hand some say a treaty is designed only to bring the confederates into some confusion about the spanish monarchy and that some appearing less tenacious on that head than others will make them jealous of one another divide them in opinion and that the french have more room in a treaty to lay hold of and make advantages from those differences and so a treaty may be a means to destroy the good harmony of the confederates rather than to issue in a good peace  as to the first it seems to have no strength of reasoning at all in it it is begging the question to say the confederates will insist upon the evacuating the whole spanish dominions to the house of austria it is evident as before the confederates did appear inclined at the last treaty to yield some point to france and to allow king philip to keep possession of some part of that monarchy rather than continue the desolations of europe and this when there was a distinct branch of the house of austria to possess the rest it seems probable they may be inclined to make larger concessions now the consideration of europes desolations being as strong as before and the house of austria having now but one head to receive the rest to which head there cannot be equal reason for giving the rest to what there was before and of which head there may be so many just fears of the danger of his possessing it  the notion then of the confederates being resolved to insist positively upon the evacuation of the spanish monarchy without any reserve is not well grounded and therefore not a just way of arguing  as to a treaty being a help to france as it buoys up the spirits of his people by so much as he reaps an advantage by that momentary imaginary aid  by so much if it fails will he suffer then in the despair he will find his people reduced to when they shall see those hopes vanish and that their miseries are like still to be continued by the obstinacy of their king in hazarding their ruin to preserve not themselves as france but the possession of the whole spanish monarchy by which they can propose to receive little or no benefit when it is obtained and will be exposed to the utmost desolation in the disappointment  this digression brings me back to the notion of the confederates upon such a treaty making concessions to france of some part of the spanish monarchy  and this the people who object say cannot consist with a good peace  this point must be cleared up as we go and therefore i resume it now it is apparent that as before two accidents make the circumstances differ    that there was even at the last treaty an apparent willingness in the confederates to have made some concessions to king philip which nevertheless were thought to be consistent with a good peace   that there is not now as there then was a branch of the house of austria whom there was no danger to europe in establishing on the spanish throne and that therefore farther concessions perhaps may not only be found consistent with but may be essential to a good peace it needs not that i should embarrass my self here with that ensnaring party making question what and how much of the spanish monarchy may and should upon a treaty be given to the present possessor but to keep to the text viz the explanation of the general term a good peace i shall lay down some heads which without partiality or respect to parties in the least but speaking really and bona fide with all possible indifference seem to me to be natural deductions from the present state of affairs in europe and by which if cooly considered we may come to understand what is the true and genuine meaning of the thing we are upon  viz what we may call a good peace    that if on a treaty france should consent entirely to evacuate the spanish monarchy and the confederates should give up that monarchy to the emperor the balance of power in europe would be entirely destroyed and therefore such a conclusion could not be allowed to be a good peace   that although some part  god forbid i should say what part i have nothing to do with that of the spanish monarchy should be conceded to king philip upon a treaty yet such parts of it might be also given to the emperor as might be an equitable and reasonable satisfaction to his imperial majesty for his pretensions to the spanish succession according to the very words of the treaty of the grand alliance quoted before   that although some part of the spanish succession should by a treaty remain to king philip v yet such fitting security may be given by the king of france and by king philip respectively as may be sufficient and satisfactory to the queen of great britain and the states general and their allies for their kingdoms and provinces and for the navigation and commerce of their subjects   that such treaty as shall end in obtaining such equitable and reasonable satisfaction to the empreror and such security to the rest of the allies may issue in a firm lasting safe honorable and good peace although some part of the spanish monarchy should remain to the present king philip v this i think may be allowed according to my title to be a full and plain exposition of the word a good peace and may tell us all what we are to understand by it nor may it be altogether useless to us in helping us to judge calmly and coolly of the steps that are or shall be taken toward it either by us or by our allies  by this we may determine when these are too forward and yield too much to france or those too backward or refractory as not to see when good terms may be obtained both which will prevent the mutual reproaches which pass now on either side with so much ill nature  i know we have some who fill our ears with clamours against our enemies and answer all arguments with telling us that the king of france is sincere in nothing that he designs to keep no treaty any farther or longer than till he is in a condition to break it  that he visibly designed from the beginning to annex the spanish monarchy to the kingdom of france and does so still and the consequence of this is by their own confession that we should neither treat of security or evacuation or any thing else but that our only safety consists in reducing the king of france  to what we must reduce him how and when it shall be done and when we shall be allowed to have reduced him enough they do not undertake to determine indeed these are gentlemen i cannot join with and i doubt it is such as these that give some people so much ground to say that there are a party who are for perpetuating the war  i am as willing to be sanguine upon the war as any body and if it were continued should be as willing to be hopeful of success  but to say that the king of france cannot put us into such a case by a peace as may effectually prevent him ever annexing spain to france and that this is his avowed design in this and in all treaties is such a confirmation of what has been all along offered by others viz that a few years would make king philip as much a spaniard and as much an enemy to france as any king of spain before him that i wonder to hear men of sense bring it for an argument and a man can hardly refrain telling such men that they are arguing for our giving up spain to king philip  lewis xiv has set up philip duke of anjou upon the spanish throne and has fought hard to keep him in possession in gratitude and duty to his grandfather i doubt not but philip v would on all occasions do any thing for his grandfather that lay in his power but if now after a peace should be made supposing for argument sake that peace were to give spain to king philip let us bring in the king of france writing such a letter as this to his grandson  mons my grandson i have set you up upon the spanish throne and caused you to be established in that kingdoms by all the confederates in a general treaty of peace but as my design in setting you up was only to annex the crown of spain to my kingdom of france so i expect that now you will resign all those dominions to me and come hither to versailles where you shall be received with all paternal care and affection  louis   will any man say that philip will immediately obey resign his crown and kingdom to the king of france though he is his grandfather or had been his immediate father or were a thousand times nearer if that could be  would not king philip rather write a submissive letter to him acknowledging his favor in preferring him to so great a dignity and his kindness in maintaining him therein unto a general peace professing his zeal for his majestys interest and his readiness to hazard himself and all his kingdoms in his majestys service but that he is now so endeared to his subjects whose fidelity has been so manifest and they are so endeared to him that he is become the father of his people and that he hopes his grandfather will not put him to such an extremity to quit those kingdoms and the spanish nation who have spent so much blood to keep him in possession and so in short excuse himself that is make a decent refusal  if upon this the king of france went about to invade him would he not say to him that his spanish subjects would by no means consent to his abandoning them etc and that they are resolyd to defend themselves and would he not rather fight his grandfather after all he has done for him than quit his possession and i am sure you will all say he would be in the right to do so  and what would be the consequence of such fighting but that very king philip joining with the allies and seeking to them for help against france  and if this would be so under his grandfather let any man tell us what it would probably be in half an age after to his elder brother if he being king of france should make such a demand would not he philip laugh at him and bid him do his worst and in both cases fly to the confederates viz to england holland and to the empire for help  this is so natural and so unanswerably just to suppose  that let these people but make it out that this is the king of frances design and that he is only making a show of king philip but really resolves to annex spain to the kingdom of france i say let them but make this good and they have brought on the stage the strongest reason that ever was yet given or ever will be why all the spanish monarchy should be given to king philip and i challenge them to answer it if they can  let any one but ensure the confederates that the king of france will endeavor to annex spain to the crown of france after a peace i dare say none of the confederates would scruple leaving king philip upon that throne  but this is so wild a notion that i think it merits to have no more notice taken of it  two things this discourse tends to   to remove that notion gotten among us that all is lost and given up if king philip is not entirely deposed and unkingd and the whole spanish monarchy taken out of his hands by the confederates a thing i must confess however i acquiesce in the opinion of our superiors i never saw either rational to be so strictly limited or possible to be brought to practice and a thing which those who adhered to yet tacitly owned themselves wrong in by keeping the houses by short adjournments just at hand to alter as they saw occasion   to allarm us and that with great reason too to consider suppose we could take it from king philip what the danger of giving it now to the same person to whom we would have given it before will be and lastly to convince us all how reasonable it is that the powers of europe should in general congress meet treat and debate of these great affairs that if possible out of all those interfering interests some happy medium may be found to reestablish the tranquillity of europe in a good peace  finis
