a bickerstaffs burying or work for the upholders a farce as it is acted at the theaters with applause by his majestys servants  written by mrs susanna centlivre author of the gamester a comedy  dublin printed by s powell for george risk at the corner of castlelane in damestreet near the horse guard mdccxxiv  dramatis personae men mezro captain boatswain   st sailor   d sailor women lady mezro isabinda her niece a lady officer servants lucy to the magnificent company of upholders etc cvstom has made some things absolutely necessary and two sheets without a dedication or a preface by way of excuse would be an unpardonable indecency to avoid which i was considering at whose feet to lay these following scenes first i thought of offering it to all those young wives who had sold themselves for money and been interred with misery from the first day of their marriage but supposing their chief pleasure to consist in pride and that they had rather gratify their ambition in the arms of a fool or fourscore than wed a man of sense of narrower fortunes i concluded em unworthy of my notice  then the race of old men presented themselves in my mind who despising women of their own years marry girls of fifteen by which they keep open house for all the young fellows in town in order to encrese their families and make their tables flourish like the vine but my aversion to fools of all kinds made me decline them too  at last casting my eyes upon the title of the frce i found it could justly belong to none but the magnificent company of upholders whom the judicious censor of great britain has so often condescended to mention to you then worthy sirs whose solemn train keeps up the pompous state of beauty beyond the limits of a gasp of breath and draws the gazing world to admire even after death to you this piece i dedicate it is but reason that you should receive some tribute from us living who so truly mourn us dead what does not mankind owe to you all ranks and conditions are obliged to you the aged and the young the generous and the miser the well descended and the boser born the escutcheons garnish out the hearse the streamers and wax lights let  into the name of a man which all his life had been hi in obscurity and many a right honorable would fall unlamented wee it not for your decent cloaks and dismal faces that look as sorrowful as the creditors the leave unpaid what an immense sum might be raised from your art to carry on the war would you like true briton exert your power the people being fond of sights wh might not be gtherd at a funeral when the rooms a clad in sable the body dressd out with all your skilfu care the tapers burning in their silver sockes the weeping virgins fixed like statues round and aromat gums persume the chambers i think it preferable to the puppet show and a penny a head for all the curiou would i dare be positive amount to more than the candl tax and so make death subservient to the living  but this gentlemen i leave to your superior judgme in politic principles and only beg leave to remind yo that in this crowded town there are a prodigious numb of mr bickerstaffs dead men that swarm about streets therefore for the sakes of the most ingenious part of man kind you ought to take care to interr them out of  way since he that does no good in his generation should not be reckoned among the living  and now to conclude gentlemen i hope you will pard this liberty i have taken and accept this as a token  the respect i bear your noble society i honor you though have no desire of falling into your hands but i thi we poets are in no danger of that since our real estalies in the brain and our personal consists in two or th loose scenes a few couplets for the tag of an act and slight sketch for a ong and as i take it you are  overfond of papercredit where there is no probabili of recovering the debt so wishing you better custome i expect no return but am proud of subscribing  self  gentlemen your most
