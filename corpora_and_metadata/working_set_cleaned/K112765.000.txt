train appear danger whose limbs of giant mold what mortal eye can fixed behold who stalks his round an hideous form howling amidst the midnight storm or throws him on the ridgy steep of some loose hanging rock to sleep and with him thousand phantoms joined who prompt to deeds accursed the mind and those the fiends who near allied over natures wounds and wrecks preside whilst vengeance in the

amazement hung yet he the bard aeschylus who first invoked thy name disdained in marathon its power to feel for not alone he nursed the poets flame but reached from virtues hand the patriots steel but who is he whom later garlands grace who left awhile over hyblas dews to rove with trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace where thou and furies shared the baleful grove wrapped in thy cloudy veil the

pure and sweetly strong who first on mountains wild in fancy loveliest child thy babe or pleasures nursed the powers of song   thou who with hermit heart disdainst the wealth of art and gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall but come a decent maid in attic robe arrayed o chaste unboastful nymph to thee i call   by all the honeyd store on hyblas thymy shore by all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear by her the  or nightingale for which sophocle seems to have entertained a peculiar fondness  whose loveborn woe in evening musings slow soothed sweetly sad electras poets ear   by old cephisus deep who spread his wavy sweep in warbled wandrings round thy green retreat on whose enameled side when holy freedom died no equal haunt allured thy future feet   o sister meek of truth to my admiring youth thy sober aid and native charms infuse the flowers that sweetest breathe though beauty culled the wreath still ask thy hand to range their ordered hues   while rome could none esteem

visions wild and feel unmixed her flame   the band as fairy legends say was wove on that creating day when he who called with thought to birth yon tented sky this laughing earth and dressed with springs and forests tall and poured the main engirting all long by the loved enthusiast wooed himself in some diviner mood retiring sat with her alone and placed her on his sapphire throne the whiles the vaulted shrine around seraphic wires were heard to sound now sublimest triumph swelling now on love and mercy dwelling and she from out the veiling cloud breathed her magic notes aloud and thou thou richhaird youth of morn and all thy subject life was born the dangerous passions kept aloof far from the sainted growing woof but near it sat ecstatic wonder listening the deep applauding thunder

becoming enamored of a young man of extraordinary beauty took an opportunity of meeting him one day as he walked on the shore and opened her passion to him but was received with a coldness occasioned by his horror and surprise at her appearance this however was so misconstrued by the sealady that in revenge for his treatment of her she punished the whole island by covering it with a mist so that all who attempted to carry on any commerce with it either never arrived at it but wandered up and down the sea or were on a sudden wrecked upon its cliffs  once hid from those who search the main

when thy folding star arising shows his paly circlet at his warning lamp the fragrant hours and elves who slept in buds the day and many a nymph who wreaths her brows with sedge and sheds the freshning dew and lovelier still the pensive pleasures sweet prepare thy shadowy car then let me rove some wild and heathy scene or find some ruin midst its dreary dells whose walls more awful nod by thy religious gleams or if chill blustering winds or driving rain prevent my willing feet be mine the hut that from the mountains side views wilds and swelling floods and hamlets brown and dimdiscoverd spires and hears their simple bell and marks over all thy dewy fingers draw the gradual dusky veil while spring shall pour his showers as often he wont and bathe thy breathing tresses meekest eve while summer loves to sport beneath thy lingering light while sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves or winter yelling through the troublous air affrights thy shrinking train and rudely rends thy robes so long regardful of thy quiet rule shall fancy friendship science smiling peace thy gentlest influence own and love thy favorite name ode to peace o thou who badst thy turtles bear swift from his grasp thy golden hair and soughtst thy native skies when war by vultures drawn from far to britain bent his iron car and bad his storms arise   tired of his rude tyrannic sway our youth shall fix some festive day his sullen shrines to burn but thou who hearst the turning spheres what sounds may charm thy partial ears and gain thy blessed return   o peace thy injured robes upbind o rise and leave not one behind of all thy beamy train the british lion goddess sweet lies stretched on earth to kiss thy feet and own thy holier reign   let others court thy transient smile but come to grace thy western isle by warlike honor led and while around her ports rejoice while all her sons adore thy choice with him for ever wed the manners an ode farewell for clearer ken designed the dimdiscoverd tracts of mind truths which from actions paths retired my silent search in vain required no more my sail that deep explores no more i search those magic shores what regions part the world of soul or whence thy streams opinion roll if ever i round such fairy field some power impart the spear and shield at which the wizzard passions fly by which the giant follies die farewell the porch

his bloodstained sword in thunder down and with a withering look the wardenouncing trumpet took and blew a blast so loud and dread were never prophetic sounds so full of woe and ever and anon he beat the doubling drum with furious heat and though fometimes each dreary pause between dejected pity at his side her soulsubduing voice applied yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien while each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head thy numbers jealousy to naught were fixed sad proof of thy distressful state of differing themes the veering song was mixed and now it courted love
