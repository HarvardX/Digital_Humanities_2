illumination or the glaziers conspiracy a prelude as it is performed with universal applause at the theater royal in covent garden by f pilon  london printed for g kearsley at no    in fleet street mdcclxxix  entered at stationers hall  advertisement to the reader the author of the following trifle is as fully satisfied of the small claim it has to public attention as the best critical anatomist in town could make him  but as the country managers procure copies of every piece played with success in london that is not published he is unwilling to have the number of his faults increased through the blunders and inaccuracies of an ignorant shorthand writer he therefore presents his little offspring to the reader as it came into the world for though a parent may find no great beauty in a child few i fancy are so unnatural as so stand by and see one knocked of the head or get a broken limb without making some effort to prevent the accident  dramatis personae men skylight a master glazier mr
