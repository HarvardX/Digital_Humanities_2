deigned to call thy light o liberty to shine on all bright intellectual sun why does thy ray to earth distribute only partial day since no resisting cause from spirit flows thy penetrating essence to oppose no obstacles by natures hand impressed thy subtle and ethereal beams arrest nor motions laws can speed thy active course nor strong repulsions powers obstruct thy force since there is no convexity in mind why are thy genial beams to parts confined while the chill north with thy bright ray is blessed why should fell darkness half the south invest was it decreed fair freedom at thy birth that thou shoudst never irradiate all the earth while britain basks in thy full blaze of light why lies sad afric quenched in total night thee only sober goddess i attest in smiles chastisd and decent graces dressed not that unlicensd monster of the crowd whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud deafning the ear of peace fierce factions tool of rash sedition born and mad misrule whose stubborn mouth rejecting reasons rein no strength can govern and no skill restrain whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw to spurn at order and to outrage law to tread on grave authority and power

astonished land clamouring for peace she rends the air with noise and to reform a part the whole destroys o plaintive southern author of the tragedy of oronoko whose impassioned strain so often has waked my languid muse in vain now when congenial themes her cares engage she burns to emulate thy glowing page her failing efforts mock her fond desires she shares thy feelings not partakes thy fires strange power of song the strain that warms the heart seems the same inspiration to impart touched by the kindling energy alone we think the flame which melts us is our own deceived for genius we mistake delight charmed as we read we fancy we can write though not to me sweet bard thy powers belong fair truth a hallowed guide inspires my song here art would weave her gayest flowers in vain for truth the bright invention would disdain for no fictitious ills these numbers flow but living anguish and substantial woe no individual griefs my bosom melt for millions feel what oronoko felt fired by no single wrongs the countless host i mourn by rapine dragged from africs coast perish the illiberal thought which would debase the native genius of the sable race perish the proud philosophy which sought to rob them of the powers of equal thought does then the immortal principle within change with the casual color of a skin does matter govern spirit or is mind degraded by the form to which it is joined no they have heads to think and hearts to feel and souls to act with firm though erring zeal for they have keen affections kind desires love strong as death and active patriot fires all the rude energy the fervid flame of highsould passion and ingenuous shame strong but luxuriant virtues boldly shoot from the wild vigor of a savage root nor weak their sense of honors proud control for pride is virtue in a pagan soul a sense of worth a conscience of desert a high unbroken haughtiness of heart that selfsame stuff which erst proud empires swayed of which the conquerors of the world were made capricious fate of man that very pride in afric scourged in rome was deifyd no muse o it is a point of honor among negroes of a high spirit to die rather than to suffer their glossy skin to bear the mark of the whip quashi had somehow offended his master a young planter with whom he had been bred up in the endearing intimacy of a playfellow his services had been faithful his attachment affectionate the master resolved to punish him and pursued him for that purpose in trying to escape quashi stumbled and fell the master fell upon him they wrestled long with doubtful victory at length quashi got uppermost and being firmly seated on his masters breast he secured his legs with one hand and with the other drew a sharp knife then said master i have been bred up with you from a child i have loved you as myself in return you have condemned me to a punishment of which i must ever have borne the marks thus only i can avoid them so saying he drew the knife with all his strength across his own throat and sell down dead without a groan on his masters body ramsays essay on the treatment of african slaves quashi shall thy deeds relate no statue snatch thee from oblivious fate for thou wast born where never gentle muse on valors grave the flowers of genius strews and thou wast born where no recording page plucks the fair deed from times devouring rage had fortune placed thee on some happier coast where polished souls heroic virtue boast to thee who soughtst a voluntary grave the uninjurd honors of thy name to save whose generous arm thy barbarous master spared altars had smokd and temples had been reared whenever to asrics shores i turn my eyes horrors of deepest deadliest guilt arise i see by more than fancys mirror shown the burning village and the blazing town see the dire victim torn from social life the shrieking babe the agonizing wife she wretch forlorn is dragged by hostile hands to distant tyrants sold in distant lands transmitted miseries and successive chains the sole sad heritage her child obtains even this last wretched boon their foes deny to weep together or together die by felon hands by one relentless stroke see the fond links of feeling nature broke the fibers twisting round a parents heart torn from their grasp and bleeding as they part hold murderers hold nor aggravate distress respect the passions you yourselves possess even you of ruffian heart and ruthless hand love your own offspring love your native land ah leave them holy freedoms cheering smile the heavntaught fondness for the parent soil revere affections mingled with our frame in every nature every clime the same in all these feelings equal sway maintain in all the love of home and freedom reign and tempes vale and parched angolas sand one equal fondness of their sons command the unconquered savage laughs at pain and toil basking in freedoms beams which gild his native soil does thirst of empire does desire of fame for these are specious crimes our rage inflame no sordid lust of gold their fate controls the basest appetite of basest souls gold better gained by what their ripening sky their fertile fields their arts besides many valuable productions of the soil cloths and carpets of exquisite manufacture are brought from the coast of guinea and mines supply what wrongs what injuries does oppression plead to smooth the horror of the unnatural deed what strange offense what aggravated sin they stand convicted  of a darker skin barbarians hold the opprobrious commerce spare respect his sacred image which they bear though dark and savage ignorant and blind they claim the common privilege of kind let malice strip them of each other plea they still are men and men should still be free insulted reason loathes the inverted trade  dire change the agent is the purchase made perplexed the baffled muse involves the tale nature confounded well may language fail the outragd goddess with abhorrent eyes sees man the traffic souls the merchandise plead not in reasons palpable abuse their sense of nothing is more frequent than this cruel and stupid argument that they do not feel the miseries inflicted on them as europeans would do feeling callous and obtuse from heads to hearts lies natures plain appeal though few can reason all mankind can feel though wit may boast a livelier dread of shame a loftier sense of wrong refinement claim though polished manners may fresh wants invent and nice distinctions nicer souls torment though these on finer spirits heavier fall yet natural evils are the same to all though wounds there are which reasons force may heal there needs no logic sure to make us feel the nerve however untutored can sustain a sharp unutterable sense of pain as exquisitely fashioned in a slave as where unequal fate a scepter gave sense is as keen where congos sons preside as where proud tiber rolls his classic tide rhetoric or verse may point the feeling line they do not whet sensation but define did ever slave less feel the galling chain when zeno proved there was no ill in pain their miseries philosophic quirks deride slaves groan in pangs disowned by stoic pride when the fierce sun darts vertical his beams and thirst and hunger mix their wild extremes when the sharp iron this is not said figuratively the writer of these lines has seen a complete set of chains fitted to every separate limb of these unhappy innocent men together with instruments for wrenching open the jaws contrived with such ingenious cruelty as would shock the humanity of an inquisitor wounds his inmost soul and his strained eyes in burning anguish roll will the parched negro find ere he expire no pain in hunger and no heat in fire for him when fate his tortured frame destroys what hope of present fame or future joys for this have heroes shortened natures date for that have martyrs gladly met their fate but him forlorn no heros pride sustains no martyrs blissful visions sooth his pains sullen he mingles with his kindred dust for he has learned to dread the christians trust to him what mercy can that power display whose servants murder and whose sons betray savage thy venial error i deplore they are not christians who infest thy shore o thou sad spirit whose preposterous yoke the great deliverer death at length has broke released from misery and escaped from care go meet that mercy man denied thee here in thy dark home sure refuge of the oppressed the wicked vex not and the weary rest and if some notions vague and undefind of future terrors have assailed thy mind if such thy masters have presumed to teach as terrors only they are prone to preach for should they paint eternal mercys reign where were the oppressors rod the captives chain if then thy troubled soul has learned to dread the dark unknown thy trembling footsteps tread on him who made thee what thou art depend he who withholds the means accepts the end not thine the reckoning dire of light abused knowledge disgraced and liberty misused on thee no awful judge incensed shall sit for parts perverted and dishonored wit where ignorance will be found the surest plea how many learned and wise shall envy thee and thou white savage whether lust of gold or lust of conquest rule thee uncontrold hero or robber  by whatever name thou plead thy impious claim to wealth or fame whether inferior mischiefs be thy boast a petty tyrant rifling gambias coast or bolder carnage track thy crimson way kings dispossessed and provinces thy prey panting to tame wide earths remotest bound all cortez murdered all columbus found over plundered realms to reign detested lord make millions wretched and thyself abhorred  in reasons eye in wisdoms fair account your sum of glory boasts a like amount the means may differ but the ends the same conquest is pillage with a nobler name who makes the sum of human blessings less or sinks the stock of general happiness no solid same shall grace no true renown his life shall blazon or his memory crown had those adventurous spirits who explore through oceans trackless wastes the farsought shore whether of wealth insatiate or of power conquerors who waste or ruffians who devour had these possessed o cook thy gentle mind thy love of arts thy love of humankind had these pursued thy mild and liberal plan discoverers had not been a curse to man then blessed philanthropy thy social hands had linked disseverd worlds in brothers bands careless if color or if clime divide then loved and loving man had lived and died the purest wreaths which hang on glorys shrine for empires founded peaceful penn are thine no bloodstained laurels crowned thy virtuous toil no slaughtered natives drenched thy fairearnd soil still thy meek spirit in thy the quakers have emancipated all their slaves throughout america flock survives consistent still their doctrines rule their lives thy followers only have effaced the shame inscribed by slavery on the christian name shall britain where the soul of freedom reigns forge chains for others she herself disdains forbid it heaven o let the nations know the liberty she loves she will bestow not to herself the glorious gift confined she spreads the blessing wide as humankind and scorning narrow views of time and place bids all be free in earths extended space what page of human annals can record a deed so bright as human rights restored o may that godlike deed that shining page redeem our fame and consecrate our age and see the cherub mercy from above descending softly quits the sphere of love on feeling hearts she sheds celestial dew and breathes her spirit over the enlightened few from soul to soul the spreading influence steals till every breast the soft contagion feels she bears exulting to the burning shore the loveliest office angel ever bore to vindicate the power in heaven adored to still the clank of chains and sheathe the sword to cheer the mourner and with soothing hands from bursting hearts unbind the oppressors bands to raise the luster of the christian name and clear the foulest blot that dims its fame as the mild spirit hovers over the coast a fresher hue the withered landscapes boast her healing smiles the ruined scenes repair and blasted nature wears a joyous air she spreads her blessed commission from above stamped with the sacred characters of love she tears the banner stained with blood and tears and liberty thy shining standard rears as the bright ensigns glory she displays see pale oppression faints beneath the blaze the giant dies no more his frown appalls the chain untouched drops off the fetter falls astonished echo tells the vocal shore oppressions fallen and slavery is no more the dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain and hail that mercy long invoked in vain victorious power she bursts their twofold bands and faith and freedom spring from mercys hands finis
