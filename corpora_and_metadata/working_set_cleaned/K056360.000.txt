the strand mdcclxvi price one shilling and sixpence  advertisement to the public the author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his obligation to the public for their favorable reception of the earl of warwick he flatters himself that the license so necessary to his plan which he has taken in common with other writers in deviating from historical truth especially in a period so distant and obscure will meet with indulgence  for the many faults  of this piece he can only plead that title to  is generally extended in favor of a first essay and  that the same candor which approved on the stage will accompany it to the closet  he cannot without the most manifest injustice forbear to add that the more than ordinary exertion of dramatic powers displayed by the principal actors concerned in it contributed in a great measure to the success of the performance  errata for the blush of virgin modesty read the crimson glow of modesty  prologue written by george colman esquire spoken by mr bensley severe each poets lot but sure most hard is the condition of the playhouse bard doomed to hear all that woudbe critics talk and in the gocart of dull rules to walk yet authors multiply you say it is true but what a numerous crop of critics too scholars alone of old durst judge and write but now each journalist turns stagyrite quintilians in each coffeehouse you meet and many a longinus walks the street in shakespeares days when his adventurous muse a muse of fire durst each bold license use her noble ardour met no critics phlegm to check wild fancy or her flights condemn ariels and calibans unblamd she drew or goblins ghosts and witches brought to view if to historic truth she shaped her verse a nations annals freely she would rehearse bring romes or englands story on the stage and run in three short hours through half an age our bard all terrorstruck and filled with dread in shakespeares awful footsteps dares not tread through the wide field of history fears to stray and builds upon one narrow spot his play steps not from realm to realm whole feas between but barely changes twice or thrice his scene while shakespeare vaults on the poetic wire and pleased spectators fearfully admire our bard a critic pole between his hands on the tightrope scarce balanced trembling stands slowly and cautiously his way he makes and fears to fall at every step he takes while then fierce warwick he before you brings that setterup and pullerdown of kings with british candor dissipate his sear an english story fits an english ear though harsh and crude you deem his first essay a

often flattered and as often betrayed thee what have thou gained by all its promises what is the reward of all thy toils  margaret experience  yes clifford i have read the instructive volume of human nature there long since have learned the way to conquer men is by their passions catch but the ruling foible of their hearts and all their boasted virtues shrink before you edward and warwick those detested names too well thou know united to destroy me  clifford that was indeed a fatal league  margaret but mark me if we could break this adamantine chain we might again be free this mighty warrior this dread of kings the unconquerable warwick is plighted to the fair elizabeth  clifford the lady gray you mean the beauteous widow whose husband fell in arms for lancaster  margaret the same my

and offer her the throne of england  clifford what if she refuse the golden bribe  margaret no matter all i wish is but to make them foes the generous warwick is fiery and impatient of reproof he will not brook a rival in his love though seated on a throne besides thou know the haughty earl looks down with scorn on edward as the mere work of his allpowrful hand the baby monarch of his own creation  clifford believe me madam edward still reveres and loves him still as conscious of the debt pays him with trust and confidence their souls are linked together in the strictest bonds of sacred friendship  margaret that but serves my cause where ties are close and interests united the slightest injries are severely felt offended friendship never can forgive  clifford now the full prospect opens to my view i see thy distant aim and trace the paths of vengeance england soon will be a scene of blood and horror discords fatal torch once lit up it in this devoted land what power shall ever extinguish it alas i tremble at the consequence  margaret and i enjoy it  o twill be a noble contest of pride against pride oppression against oppression rise but the storm and let the waves beat high the wreck may be our own in the warm struggle who knows but one or both of them may fall and margret rise triumphant on their ruin it must be so and see the king approaches this way he passes from the council  mark his downcast eye he is a stricken deer the arrows in his side  he cannot scape well meet and speak to him  clifford what mean you madam  margaret to ask him  what i know he will refuse that gives me fair pretext to break with him and join the man i hate vindictive warwick but soft he comes   scene ii king edward margaret clifford officer edward is suffolk yet returned to an officer  officer no my good liege  edward go wait and bring him to me ex of i will to my closet pardon me fair lady i saw you not  margaret perhaps it is beneath a conquror to look down upon his slave but i have a boon to ask  edward whatever it is within the limits of fair courtesy which honor can bestow i will not refuse thee  margaret there was a time when margaret of anjou would not have deigned to ask of edward ought nor was there ought which edward dared refuse her but that is past great warwicks arm prevailed and i am now your prisoner  edward since the hour when fortune smiled propitious on the cause of justice and gave victory to our arms you have been treated with all due respect all your condition or your sex could claim served like a queen and lodged within our palace is there ought more you can with reason ask or i in prudence grant you  margaret give me back the liberty i lost restore my son and i may then perhaps be reconciled to un usurper may withold my vengeance and let thee fit unpunished on  my throne  edward you talk too proudly madam but to show you i cannot fear you have your liberty letters this morning i received from france have offered noble ransom for your person without that ransom  for the soul of edward is far above the sordid lust of gold i grant it  from this moment you are free but for your son  i cannot part with him  margaret i scorn your bounties scorn your proffered freedom what is liberty to me without my child but fate will place us soon above thy reach thy shortlived tyranny is almost past the storm is gathering round thee and will burst with tenfold vengeance on thy guilty head  edward i am not to be talked into submission nor dread the menace of a clamorous woman  margaret thou may have cause to dread a womans power the time may come  mark my prophetic word  when wayward beauty shall repay with scorn thy fruitless vows and vindicate my wrongs the friend thou leanst on like a broken reed shall pierce thy side and fill thy soul with anguish keen as the pangs i feel yorks perjured house shall sink to rise no more and lancaster with added luster reassume the throne hear this and tremble  give me back my son  or dread the vengeance of a desperate mother  scene iii edward imperious woman but the voice of woe is ever clamorous it is the privilege the charter of affliction to complain  this tardy suffolk how i long to know yet dread to hear my fate elizabeth on thee the color of my future life depends for thou alone can make me blessed or cursed for ever  o this cruel doubt is worse than all my tortures but he comes the ambassador of love  scene iv edward earl of suffolk edward what news my suffolk shall i be happy o i am on the rack of expectation did thou tell my tale as if it were thy own and may i hope   suffolk my royal liege  edward good suffolk lay aside the forms of dull respect be brief and tell me speak have thou seen her will she be my queen quick tell me every circumstance each word each look each gesture did thou mark them suffolk  suffolk i did and will recount it all  last night by your command in secret i repaired to graftons tufted bower the happy seat of innocence and beauty there i found thy souls best hope the fair elizabeth never did these eyes behold such sweet perfection i found her busied in the pious office of filial duty tending her sick father  edward that was a lucky moment to prefer my humble suit touch but the tender string of soft compassion in the heart and love will quickly vibrate to its kindred passion you urged our royal purpose then  suffolk i did with all the warmth of friendship dwelt with pleasure on every princely virtue that adorns your noble heart she listened with attention and echoed back your praises  edward was not that a kind propitious omen  suffolk such indeed hoping to find it i called in the powers of flattery to my aid and gazed upon her as if confounded by her dazzling beauties  conscious she smiled but when at length i spoke of englands monarch sighing at her feet  the blush of virgin modesty overspread her cheek and gave new luster to her charms she turned aside and as she silent bowed her doubtful thanks i marked the pearly tear steal down its secret track and from her breast heard a deep sigh she struggled to conceal if i have any judgment or can trace the hidden feelings of a womans heart here is is already fixed i fear my liege with all that england all that thou coudst give the crown would fit but heavy on her brow  edward not heavier suffolk than it sits on mine my throne is irksome to me who would wish to be a sovereign when elizabeth presers a subject  then the impetuous warwick his awful virtue will chastise my weakness i dread his censure dread his keen reproaches and dread them more because they will be just i have promised lewis to espouse his daughter to strengthen our alliance would to heaven i had not if i seek this coy refuser and break with france warwick will take the alarm if once offended he is inexorable  suffolk i know him well  believe me sir the high and haughty spirit when it meets rebuke is easiest checked and sinks into submission let him my liege who ventures to arraign his masters conduct look into his own there ever is a corner in the heart open to folly warwick is not free from human frailties  edward no ambition fires his noble breast love triumphs over mine but well thou know our eyes are ever open to others faults and shut against our own we seldom pity woes we never experienced or pardon weakness which we do not feel he is a hero  suffolk heros are but men i have some cause to think so  but of that well talk another time mean while my liege i think lord warwick is a useful friend  edward aye and a dangerous foe the people love to adoration love him if he falls from his allegiance crowds will follow him england has long been rent by civil broils and fain would rest her in the arms of peace her wounds scarce closed shall edward open them and bid them bleed afresh believe me suffolk i would not be the cause of new divisions amongst my people for a thousand kingdoms  suffolk it is nobly said and may thy grateful subjects revere thy virtues and reward thy love  edward o suffolk did they know but half the cares that wait on royalty they would not grudge their wretched master a few private hours of social happiness  if france consents i am undone and warwick has ever this enslaved me curse on this state policy that binds us thus to love at second hand who knows but he may link me to a wretch wed me to folly ignorance and pride ill nature sickness or deformity and when i am chained to misery coldly tell me to sooth my griefs twas for the public good  suffolk how far you have commissioned him i know not but were i worthy to advise my liege i would not be the dupe of his ambition but follow natures dictates and be happy england has charms besides elizabeths and beauties that   edward no more my heart is fixed on her alone find out this powerful rival i charge thee suffolk yet why wish to find what found will make me wretched were he bound in cords of tenderest friendship round my heart dearer than warwick dearer than thyself forgive me but i fear i should abhor him o think on something that may yet be done to win her to my heart ever warwick comes  suffolk i hear he is expected every hour  edward grant heaven some friendly storm may yet retard him i dread his presence here  scene iv messenger edward suffolk messenger my liege the earl of warwick is arrived  edward ha when how where would he were buried in the rapid waves that brought him hither comes he here to night  messenger my liege ever now he might have reaohd the palace but that the shouting multitudes press hard on every side and seem to worship him  scene v suffolk edward suffolk such adoration but ill befits the idol that receives it  edward what is to be done i cannot must not see him till all is fixed once more my bestlovd suffolk try the soft arts of thy persuasive tongue what method can thou think on to evade this promised marriage with ambitious france  suffolk summon your council lay your thoughts before them meet warwick there and urge a sovreigns right to please himself in that which should concern himself alone  firm buckingham and i will plead your cause against the haughty warwick whom i would treat with cold civility and distant state which ever angers more resentful spirits than the warmth of passion  edward it is well advised  meantime if possible i will compose my troubled thoughts to rest suffolk adieu if warwick asks for me i am not well i am hunting in the forest  i am busy  stay  remember what i told you touching the earldom which i mean to give her father that may bring her to the court you understand me suffolk  fare thee well  scene vi edward why should i dread to see the man i love  the man i reverence  warwick is not changed but edward is  suffolk i know abhors him  a favorite must be hated  if he urges this dreadful contract i shall hate him too i cannot live without elizabeth i will think no more  if i must sacrifice my friendship or my love  the choice is made  end of the first act act ii scene i warwick speaking to an officer warwick it is well i shall attend his highness pleasure comes forward meet me in the council warwick might have claimed a private audience  after all my toils my perils in his service it is a cold unkind reception some base whisperer some needy sycophant perhaps has poisoned my royal masters ear  or do i judge too rashly as my embassy concerns the public welfare he would honor me with public thanks  elizabeth will chide me for this unkind delay  but honor calls and duty to my king that task performed i haste my love to happiness and thee  scene ii the council chamber king edward dukes of clarence and buckingham earls of suffolk pembroke etc edward good buckingham i thank thee for thy counsel nor blame thy honest warmth i love this freedom  is the birthright of an englishman and does become thee what says noble suffolk  suffolk i would not cross my royal masters will but on my soul i think this nuptial league with france prepostrous and impolitic it cannot last we are by nature foes and naught but mutual poverty and weakness can ever make us friends  she wants our aid against the powerful burgundy and therefore throws out this lure of beauty to ensnare you that purpose gained she turns her arms against us  pembroke why let her if she comes with hostile arm england thank heaven is ready to receive her i love my country and revere my king as much perhaps as honest buckingham or my good fearful lord of suffolk here who knows so well or would be thought to know what france will do hereafter yet i think the faith of nations is a thing so sacred it ought not to be trifled with  i hate as much as you the unnatural forced alliance and yet my lords if warwick is empowrd for so i hear he is to treat with lewis i know not how in honor you can swerve from his conditions shouting hark the hero comes those shouts proclaim him near the joyful people will usher in their great deliverer as he deserves  scene iii king edward clarence suffolk buckingham pembroke warwick edward thrice welcome noble warwick welcome to all to clarence pembroke etc suffolk you have had my lord i fear an arduous task which few could execute but warwick in the council and the field a like distinguished and a like successful  edward what says our cousin france  warwick by me my liege he greets you well and hopes in closer ties united soon to wear a dearer name at length thank heaven the iron gates of war are closed and peace displays her silken banners over the contending nations every doubt is now removed and confidence established i hope to last for ages  edward peace my lord is ever welcome it is the gift of heaven the nurse of science arts fair patroness and merits best protector but if france would chain us down to ignominious terms cramp our free commerce and infringe the rights of our liege subjects england may repent too late her rash credulity and peace with all her blessings may be bought too dear  warwick the shame would then be his who made the purchase if any doubt my faith my honest zeal for thee and for my country let him speak and i will answer punish me just heaven if in the task i have consulted ought but englands honor and my sovreigns glory  edward mistake me not good warwick well i know thy spotless truth thy honor and thy love but glory has no further charms for me raised by thy powerful aid to englands throne i ask no more  already i am great as fame and fortune with their smiles can make me and all i wish for now is  to be happy  warwick that too my liege has been thy warwicks care happy thou shall be if the fairest form that ever caught a gazing lovers eye joined to the sweetest most engaging virtues can make thee so  bona accepts with joy thy proffered hand she is indeed a gem fit to adorn the brightest crown to see is to admire her trust me englands self the seat of beauty and the throne of love boasts not a fairer  edward beauty good my lord is all ideal it is the wayward child of fancy shifting with the changeful wind of fond opinion what to you appears the model of perfection may disgust my strange capricious taste  warwick such charms would fix inconstancy itself  her winning virtues even if her beauty failed would soon subdue the rebel heart and you would learn to love her  edward is passion to be learned then would thou make a science of affection guide the heart and teach it where to fix impossible it is strange philosophy rises and comes forward my lord of warwick your zeal in englands and in edwards cause merits our thanks but for the intended marriage with frances daughter  it may never be  warwick not be it must your sacred word is passed and cannot be recalled but three days since i signed the contract and my honors pledged for the performance heavens whilst fickle france is branded midst the nations of the earth for breach of public faith shall we my liege practice ourselves the vices we condemn pass over a rival nations every virtue and imitate their persidy alone  edward you will pardon me my lord i thought it part of a kings power to have a will to see with his own eyes and in lifes little feast to cater for himself but it is it seems a privilege his servants can refuse him  warwick and so they ought  the king who cannot conquer his private interest for the public welfare knows not his duty  edward kings my lord are born with passions feelings hearts  like other men nor see i yet why edwards happiness must fall a sacrifice to warwicks honor  warwick my honor sir is yours my cause your own who sent me and whose image did i bear the image of a great and glorious king or of a weak and wavering boy  henceforth choose from the herd of fawning sycophants some needy slave for your mock ambassys to do your work and stain the name of england with foul reproach  edward i blush for thee and for my country from this hour expect from injured france contempt with deep resentment for broken faith and enmity eternal  edward eternal be it then for as i prize my inward peace beyond the pomp of state and all the tinsel glare of fond ambition i will not wed her gracious heaven what am i the meanest peasant in my realm may choose his rustic bride and share with her the sweets of mutual friendship and domestic bliss why should my happier subjects then deny me the common rights the privilege of nature and in a land of freedom thus conspire to make their king the only slave amongst em  warwick the worst of slaves is he whom passion rules uncheckd by reason and the powerful voice of friendship which i fear is heard no more by thoughtless edward  it is the curse of kings to be surrounded by a venal herd of flatterers that sooth his darling vices and rob their master of his subjects love nay frown not sirs supported as ye are i fear you not  which of this noble train these wellbeloved counselors and friends assembled here to witness my disgrace have urged to this base unmanly falsehood shame on you all to stain the spotless mind of uncorrupted youth undo the work of warwicks friendly hand and give him back a sovereign so unlike the noble edward  suffolk my lord we thank you for the kind suggestion however illfounded and when next we meet to give our voice in ought that may concern the public weal no doubt shall ask your leave ever we proceed  pembroke my lord of suffolk speak but for yourself warwick has too much cause to be offended in my poor opinion whatever you courtiers think the best support of englands throne are equity and truth nor will i hold that man my sovreigns friend who shall exhort him to forsake his word and play the hypocrite what tie shall bind the subject to obedience when his king bankrupt in honor gives the royal sanction to perfidy and falsehood  buckingham it becomes but ill the earl of pembroke   edward good my lords  let us have no dissentions here we met for other purposes  some few days hence we shall expect your counsel in affairs of moment  for the present urge no further this matter  fare ye well the council break up and disperse edward comes up to warwick lord warwick keep in narrower bounds that proud impetuous temper it may be fatal there are private reasons  when time befits we shall impart them to you meanwhile  if you have friendship love or duty no more of bona  i am determined  scene iv warwick so it is well it is very well i have deserved it i have borne this callow eagle on my wing and now he spurns me from him it is a change i little looked for and sits heavy on me alas how doubly painful is the wound when it is inflicted by the hand we love cruel ungrateful edward  ha who is here the captive queen if she has ought to ask of me she comes in luckless hour for i am powrless now  scene v margaret of anjou warwick warwick will margaret of anjou thus deign to visit her acknowledged foe  margaret alas my lord inured to wretchedness as i am and familiar with misfortune i harbor no resentment have long since forgot that ever warwick was my foe and only wish to prove myself his friend  warwick talk not of friendship it is an empty name and lives but in idea once indeed i thought i had a friend   margaret whose name was  edward read i aright my lord and am i not a shrewd diviner yes that downcast eye and gloomy aspect say i am you look as if the idol made by your own hands had fallen upon and crushed you is it not so  warwick amazement naught escapes thy piercing eye and penetrating judgment it is too true i am a poor dishonored slave not worth thy seeking leave me for the tide of court preferment flows another way  margaret the feast perhaps you have provided suits not with edwards nicer palate he disdains how sweet soever to taste a foreign banquet and relishes no dainties but his own am i again mistaken  warwick sure thou dealst with some allknowing spirit who imparts each secret purpose to thee else how knewst thou that edward refused to wed the princess  margaret o it requires no supernatural aid to trace his actions nor has margret trod the paths of life with unobserving eye i could have told you this long since  for know the choice is made the nuptial rites prepared which but for your return as unexpected as undesired had been ever this complete and as in duty bound you then had paid your due obedience to our  english queen  warwick determined say thou gracious heaven it is well i am returned  margaret indeed my lord you came a little out of season twas unkind to interrupt your masters happiness to blast so fair a passion in its bloom and check the rising harvest of his love  warwick margret i thank thee  yes it must be so his blushes his confusion all confirm it and yet i am amazed astonished  margaret wherefore  is it so strange a youthful prince should love is it so strange a mind unfraught with wisdom and lifted high with proud prosperity should follow pleasure through the crooked paths of falsehood should forsake a useless friend for the warm joys of animating beauty  warwick no but it is strange that he who knows how much he owed to warwick he who every hour tastes the rich stream of bounty should forget the fountain whence it flowed  margaret alas my lord had you been chastend in afflictions school as i have been and taught by sad experience to know mankind you had not fallen a prey to such delusion  warwick was it like a friend was it like edward to conceal his love some base insinuating artful woman with borrowed charms perhaps   margaret hold hold my lord be not too rash who fights in darkness often may wound a bosom friend perhaps you wrong the best and most accomplished of her sex  warwick know you the lady  margaret but as fame reports of peerless beauty and transcendent charms but for her virtues  i must ask of  you   warwick of me what virtues whose  margaret elizabeths  warwick amazement no it must not it cannot be elizabeth he could not dare not do it confusion i shall soon discover all aside but what have i to do with edwards choice whoever she be if he refuses mine  margaret dissimulation sits but ill my lord on minds like yours i am a poor weak woman and so it seems you think me but suppose that same allknowing spirit which you raised who condescends so kindly to instruct me should whisper  warwick knows the power of love as well as edward that elizabeth was his first wish the idol of his soul what say you  might i venture to believe it  warwick margret you might for it is in vain to hide a thought from thee it might have told you too if it be so there is not such a wretch on earth as warwick give me but the proof   margaret lord suffolk was last night dispatched to grafton to offer her a share in edwards throne  warwick which she refused did she not margret say she did  margaret i know not that my lord but crowns are dazzling meteors in a womans eye such strong temptations few of us i fear have virtue to resist  warwick elizabeth has every virtue i will not doubt her faith  margaret edward is young and handsome  warwick curses on him think thou he knew my fond attachment there  margaret o passing well my lord and when twas urged how deeply twoud affect you swore by heaven imperious warwick never should be the master of charms like hers twas happiness he said beyond a subjects merit to deserve beyond his hope to wish for or aspire to  warwick but for that warwick edwards self had been a subject still  and  may be so  hereafter thou smilst at my misfortunes  margaret i must smile when i behold a subtle statesman thus duped and deluded by a shallow boy sent on a fruitless errand to expose his country and himself  it was indeed a master stroke of policy beyond one should have thought the reach of years so green as edwards to dispatch the weeping lover and seize the glorious opportunity of tampring with his mistress here at home  warwick did nevil rutland clifford bleed for this  margaret for this does henry languish in a dungeon and wretched margret live a life of woe for this you gave the crown to pious edward and thus he thanks you for his kingdom  warwick crowns are baubles fit for children like himself to play with i have scattered many of them but thus to cross me in my dearest hope the sweet reward of all my toils for him and for his country if i suffer it if i forgive him may i live the scorn of men a branded coward and old age without or love or reverence be my portion henceforth good margret know me for thy friend we will have noble vengeance  are there not still left amongst the lazy sons of peace some busy spirits who wish well to thee and to thy cause  margaret there are resentment sleeps but is not dead beneath the hollow cover of loyalty the slumbering ashes lie unheeded warwicks animating breath will quickly light them into flames again  warwick then edward from this moment i abjure thee o i will make thee ample recompense for all the wrongs that i have done the house of lancaster  go summon all thy friends be quick good margret haste ever i repent and yield my soul to perjured york again the king i think gives you free liberty to range abroad  margaret he does and i will use it as i would ever use the gift of foes to his destruction  warwick that archpandar suffolk that minister of vice  but time is precious tomorrow margret we will meet in private and have some further conference meantime devise consult use every means against our common foe remember from this hour warwicks thy friend  be secret and be happy  scene vi margaret what easy fools these cunning statesmen are with all their policy when once they fall into a womans power this gallant leader this blustering warwick how the hero shrunk and lessened to my sight  elizabeth i thank thee for thy wonderworking charms the time perhaps may come when i shall stand indebted to them for  the throne of england proud york beware for lancasters great name shall rise superior in the lists of fame fortune that long had frowned shall smile at last and make amends for all my sorrows past  end of the second act act iii scene i margaret clifford attendants margaret to a gentleman dispatch these letters strait to scotland  this to the french envoy  these to the earl of pembroke turning to lady clifford thus far my friend has fortune favored us beyond our hopes the soul of haughty warwick is all on fire and puling edward loves with most romantic ardour  o my clifford you would have smiled to see how artfully i played upon him flattered soothed provoked and wrought him to my purpose we are linked in firmest bonds of amity and love  clifford has warwick then so soon forgot his edward think thou the frantic earl will ever exert his illdirected powers to pull down the royal structure which himself had raised never  margaret what is there disappointed love and unrestrained ambition will not do i tell thee we are sworn and cordial friends  clifford thou know he hates the house of lancaster  margaret no matter  he has mavelous good skill in making kings and i  have business for him  clifford and can thou then forget the cruel wrongs the deepfelt injries of oppressive warwick to join the hand that forged thy husbands chains and robbed thee of a crown  margaret but what  my clifford if the same hand that ravished should restore it it is a court friendship and may last as long as interest shall direct i have not forgot no nor forgiven i hate abhor detest him but i will use him as my instrument my necessary tool i will make him draw his traitorous sword to sheath it in the breast of him he loves then point it to his own yes clifford i have twined me round his heart like the fell serpent crept into his bosom that i might sting more surely he shall perish i keep him for the last dear precious morsel to crown the glorious banquet of revenge  clifford it is what he merits from us yet the attempt were dangerous he is still the peoples idol  margaret and so perhaps shall margret be applause waits on success the fickle multitude like the light straw that floats along the stream glide with the current still and follow fortune our prospect brightens every hour  the people are ripe for a revolt by civil wars long time inured to savage scenes of plunder and desolation they delight in war these english heroes when once fleshed with slaughter like the keen mastiff lose not soon the track of vengeance nor forget the taste of blood  clifford what further succors have we to depend on beside earl warwicks  margaret o his name alone will be an army to us  clifford if we have it resentment is a shortlived passion  what if warwick should relent and turn again to edward  margaret then i have a bosom friend that shall be ready to reward him for it  but i have better hopes without his aid we are not friendless scotlands hardy sons who smile at danger and defy the storm will leave their barren mountains to defend that liberty they love add too the aid of gallant pembroke and the powers which france will send to vindicate her injured honor ever edward can collect his force and take the field we shall be thirty thousand strong  clifford but what becomes of the young prince  margaret aye there i am indeed unhappy o my child how shall i set him free  hear nature hear a mothers prayer o guide me with thy counsel and teach me how to save my darling boy  aye now i have it monitress divine i thank thee  yes i wait but for the means of his escape then fly this hated palace nor will return till i can call it mine  scene ii edward suffolk edward i fear we have gone too far the indignant warwick ill brookd our steady purpose marked you suffolk with what an eye of scorn he turned him from us and lowrd defiance  that prophetic woman half of her curse already is fulfilled and i have lost my friend  suffolk some friends perhaps are better lost you will pardon me my liege but were it fitting i could tell a tale would soon convince you  warwick is as weak   edward as edward thou would say  suffolk but twill distress thy noble heart too much i dare not sir yet one day you must know it  edward then by thee let it be told me suffolk thy kind hand will best administer the bitter draught go on my suffolk speak i charge thee speak  suffolk that rival whom you wished me to discover   edward aye what of him quick tell me have thou found the happy traitor give me but to know that i may wreak my speedy vengeance on him  suffolk suppose that rival were the man whom most you loved the man perhaps whom most you feared suppose twere  warwick  edward ha it cannot be i would not think it for a thousand worlds  warwick in love with her impossible now suffolk do i fear thou speak from envy and jealous hatred at the noble warwick not from the love of justice or of edward where did thou learn this falsehood  suffolk from the lips of truth from one whose honor and whose word you will not question from  elizabeth  edward from her nay then i fear  it must be so  suffolk when last i saw her for again i went by your command though hopeless of success with all the little eloquence that i was master of i urged your ardent passion told her how much how tenderly you loved her and pressed with eagerness to know the cause of her unkind refusal till at length reluctantly with blushes she confessed there was a cause  she thanked you for your goodness twas more she said much more than she deserved she ever should revere her king and if she had a heart to give it should be  edwards  edward so kind and yet so cruel well go on  suffolk then told me all the story of her love that warwick long had wooed her  that her hand was promised soon as he returned from france though once her father cruelly opposed it they were by his consent to be united  edward o never suffolk may i live to see that dreadful hour designing hypocrite are these his arts is this the friend i loved by heaven she shall be mine i will assert a sovreigns right and tear her from him  what if he rebel  another civil war it is terrible  o that i could shake off this cumbrous garb of majesty that clings so close around me meet him man to man and try who best deserves her but when kings grow mad their guiltless subjects pay the forfeit horrible thought  good suffolk for a while i would be private  therefore wait without let me have no intruders above all keep warwick from my sight   scene iii warwick edward warwick behold him here no welcome guest it seems unless i ask my lord of suffolks leave  there was a time when warwick wanted not his aid to gain admission here  edward there was a time perhaps when warwick more desired and more  deserved it  warwick never i have been a foolish faithful slave all my best years the morning of my life has been devoted to your service what are now the fruits disgrace and infamy my spotless name which never yet the breath of calumny had tainted made the mock for foreign fools to carp at but it is fit who trust in princes should be thus rewarded  edward i thought my lord i had full well repaid your services with honors wealth and power unlimited thy alldirecting hand guided in secret every latent wheel of government and moved the whole machine warwick was all in all and powrless edward stood like a cipher in the great account  warwick who gave that cipher worth and seated thee on englands throne thy undistinguished name had rotted in the dust from whence it sprang and moulderd in oblivion had not warwick dug from its sordid mine the useless ore and stamped it with a diadem thou know this wretched country doomed perhaps like rome to fall by its own selfdestroying hand tossed for so many years in the rough sea of civil discord but for me had perished in that distressful hour i seized the helm bade the rough waves subside in peace and steered your shattered vessel safe into the harbor you may despise perhaps that useless aid which you no longer want but know proud youth he who forgets a friend deserves a foe  edward know too reproach for benefits received pays every debt and cancels obligation  warwick why that indeed is frugal honesty a thrifty saving knowledge when the debt grows burdensome and cannot be discharged a sponge will wipe out all and cost you nothing  edward when you have counted over the numerous train of mighty gifts your bounty lavished on me you may remember next the injries which i have done you let me know em all and i will make you ample satisfaction  warwick thou can not thou have robbed me of a jewel it is not in thy power to restore i was the first shall future annals say that broke the sacred bond of public trust and mutual confidence ambassadors in after times mere instruments perhaps of venal statesmen shall recall my name to witness that they want not an example and plead my guilt to sanctify their own amidst the herd of mercenary slaves that haunt your court could none be found but warwick to be the shameless herald of a lie  edward and would thou turn the vile repoach on me if i have broke my faith and stained the name of england thank thy own pernicious counsels that urged me to it and extorted from me a cold consent to what my heart abhorred  warwick i have been abused insulted and betrayed my injured honor cries aloud for vengeance her wounds will never close  edward these gusts of passion will but inflame them if i have been right informed my lord besides these dangerous scars of bleeding honor you have other wounds as deep though not so fatal such perhaps as none but fair elizabeth can cure  warwick elizabeth  edward nay start not i have cause to wonder most i little thought indeed when warwick told me i might learn to love he was himself so able to instruct me but i have discovered all   warwick and so have i too well i know thy breach of friendship there thy fruitless base endeavors to supplant me  edward i scorn it sir  elizabeth has charms and i have equal right with you tadmire them nor see i ought so godlike in the form so allcommanding in the name of warwick that he alone should revel in the charms of beauty and monopolize perfection i knew not of your love  warwick by heaven it is false you knew it all and meanly took occasion whilst i was busied in the noble office your grace thought fit to honor me withal to tamper with a weak unguarded woman to bribe her passions high and basely steal a treasure which your kingdom could not purchase  edward how know you that but be it as it may i had a right nor will i tamely yield my claim to happiness the privilege to choose the partner of my throne and bed it is a branch of my prerogative  warwick prerogative  what is that the boast of tyrants a borrowed jewel glittering in the crown with specious luster lent but to betray you had it sir and hold it  from the people  edward and therefore do i prize it i would guard their liberties and they shall strengthen mine but when proud faction and her rebel crew insult their sovereign trample on his laws and bid defiance to his power the people in justice to themselves will then defend his cause and vindicate the rights they gave  warwick go to your darling people then for soon if i mistake not twill be needful try their boasted zeal and see if one of them will dare to lift his arm up in your cause if i forbid them  edward is it so my lord then mark my words i have been your slave too long and you have ruled me with a rod of iron but henceforth know proud peer i am thy master and will be so the king who delegates his power to others hands but ill deserves the crown he wears  warwick look well then to your own it sits but loosely on your head for know the man who injured warwick never passed unpunished yet  edward nor he who threatened edward  you may repent it sir  my guards there  seize this traitor and convey him to the tower there let him learn obedience guards enter seize warwick and endeavor to disarm him warwick slaves stand off if i must yield my sword i will give it him whom it so long has served there is not a part in this old faithful steel that is not stained with english blood in grateful edwards cause give me my chains they are the bands of friendship of a kings friendship for his sake a while i will wear them  edward hence away with him   warwick it is well exert your power it may not last you long for know though edward may forget his friend that england will not  now sir i attend you exit warwick edward presumptuous rebel  ha who is here  scene iv messenger edward messenger my liege queen margret with the prince her son are fled in a few hours she hopes for so we learn from those who have pursued her to be joined by the earl of warwick in his name it seems she has already raised three thousand men  edward warwick in league with her o heaven it is well we have crushed the serpent ever his poison spread throughout our kingdom  guard the palace gates keep double watch summon my troops together where is my brother clarence buckingham and pembroke we must check this foul rebellion   scene v edward suffolk suffolk my liege the duke of clarence   edward what of him  suffolk has left the court this moment i beheld him in confrence deep with pembroke who it seems is margrets firmest friend it is whispered both will join the queen  edward well  it is no matter i have deeper cause for grief he cannot feel a brothers falsehood who has lost a friend a friend like warwick  suffolk thou beholdst me betrayed deserted by the man i loved treated with cold indifference by her whom i adored forsaken by my brother and threatened by the subjects i protect oppressed on every side but thou shall see i have a soul superior to misfortunes though rebel clarence wrings my tortured heart and faithless warwick braves me we will yet maintain our right  come on my friend thou know without his boasted aid i could have gained the crown without him now i will preserve it  end of the third act act iv scene the tower warwick mistaken mortals plan delusive schemes of bliss and call futurity their own yet are not masters of a moment  this was the appointed time the very day which should have joined me to elizabeth in nuptial bonds  o cruel memory do not torment me  if there be a crime of deeper dye than all the guilty train of human vices it is  ingratitude it is now two years since henry lost the crown and here he is even in this very prison a fellow captive now disgraceful thought how will he smile to meet his conquror here o for that stoic apathy which lulls the drowsy soul to sweet forgetfulness but twill not be  elizabeth where art thou perhaps with edward  o that thought distracts me it is i fear as margret said she is false but when i look on these can i expect to find one virtue left in human kind my pembroke too am i so soon forgotten o no he comes   scene ii pembroke warwick pembroke my friend  warwick my pembroke welcome thee i have ever found most just and kind but in the darkness of adversity the jewel friendship shines with double luster  pembroke i am not of the infect train that bask in fortunes sunshine and when evening damps arise are seen no more no warwick what i speak i mean you have been hardly treated  warwick o pembroke did thou know but half the wrongs that i have suffered thou would pity me  pembroke i would do more much more my warwick he who only pities but insults the wretched i come with nobler views i come to tell thee that i have felt thy injries as my own and will revenge them too  warwick how kind thou art to feel for warwick  pembroke every honest breast must feel the injries that a good man suffers thine is the common cause of all adieu to english freedom when our liberty shall be dependent on a sovreigns nod when years of honest service shall be paid with infamy and chains  warwick i have not deserved them  pembroke nor shall thou wear them long for thou have great and powerful friends  the noble duke of clarence behold his signet  this my warwick gained me admission here  we must be secret  warwick then i am not forsaken clarence  ha  pembroke yes the gallant youth with honest zeal declared he loved his brother much but justice more  warwick then edward i defy thee generous clarence thou know the man who thus could treat a friend would soon forget a brother  but say pembroke how stands the duke of buckingham  pembroke fast bound to edward he and that smooth courtier suffolk are the two rotten pillars that support his tottering throne but margret   warwick aye how fares my new ally has she escaped the tyrant  pembroke she has and by some wondrous means contrived to free her captive son  warwick though i abhor i must admire that enterprising woman her active mind is ever on the wing in search of fresh expedients to recover the crown she lost  pembroke already she has raised a powerful army all the secret foes of yorks ambitious line rush forth in crowds and join her standard ever tomorrows sun shall dawn upon us she will set thee free  warwick o pembroke nothing wounds the generous mind so deep as obligations to a foe is there no way to liberty my friend but through the bloody paths of civil war  pembroke i fear there is not  warwick then it must be so i could have wished  but freedom and revenge on any terms are welcome  pembroke here then join we our hands   warwick our hearts  pembroke now warwick be thou firm in thy resolves let no unmanly fears no foolish fond remembrance of past friendship unnerve thy arm or shake thy steady purpose  warwick no by my wrongs it shall not once thou know i loved him but too well and these vile chains are my reward  o give me but the use of this once powerful arm and thou shall see how it shall punish falsehood  are thy forces prepared  pembroke they are and wait but for my orders clarence will join us soon our first great end is to secure thy liberty that done we haste to seize the palace and redeem the fair elizabeth  warwick redeem her ha is she a captive too  pembroke a willing slave a gay state prisoner left to roam at large over the young monarchs palace  warwick aye my pembroke that is more inviting than a prison  o she is false she is false  who sent her there  pembroke she came it seems to thank him for his royal bounties to her good father the new earl of rivers who will no doubt persuade her to accept   warwick of edwards hand  distraction fly my friend haste thee to margret tell her if she hopes for warwicks aid she must release him now ever edwards illtimed mercy shall prevent her  pembroke i go my friend adieu when next we meet i hope to bring thee liberty  warwick farewell she is lost she is gone that base seducer edward has wrought on her weak mind it must be so  scene iii messenger warwick messenger my lord the lady elizabeth  warwick amazement sure it cannot be admit her sir  why what exit mess could bring her here edward has sent her hither to see if i will crouch to him for pardon be still my jealous heart   scene iv elizabeth warwick elizabeth my warwick  warwick it is a grace i looked not for that a fair favorite who so late had tasted the pleasures of a court should condescend to visit thus a poor abandoned captive  elizabeth i come to take my portion of misfortune to pour the balm of comfort in and heal if possible the wounds which i had made too well i know i was the fatal cause of all thy sorrows  but the noble edward for so indeed he is   warwick and art thou come to plead the cause of him who sent me hither  elizabeth i came to be the messenger of peace to calm thy troubled soul and give thee rest to teach my warwick to forget his wrongs  warwick forget my wrongs was that thy errand here to teach me low submission to a tyrant to ask forgiveness kneel and deprecate the wrath of blustering edward if thou come on terms like these to bring me freedom know it will not be accepted now i see through all your arts by heaven i would rather lose a thousand lives than owe one to his bounty  elizabeth either my warwick is much changed and so i fear he is or he would never talk thus coldly to me never would despise a life so precious if he knew how much elizabeth had suffered to preserve it the gallant edward won by my entreaties   warwick entreaties did thou then descend so low as to entreat him for me  elizabeth had thou seen when i implored him to forgive my warwick how kind he looked how his repenting heart heaved with the pangs of agonizing friendship thou woudst have pitied him  warwick deceitful woman i see thy falsehood now i am betrayed and thou art leagued with edward to destroy me go to your royal lover and unite those only fit companions for each other a broken friendship and a perjured love give up discarded warwick and to make the compact firm cement it with my blood  elizabeth i thought the soul of warwick far above such mean suspicions  shall the man whose truth whose constancy and love have been so long my bright example shall he stoop so low as thus to listen to an idle tale told by some prating courtier if indeed thou coudst believe it i should pity thee  warwick where is your father the new earl of rivers why sends he not his forces to our aid  elizabeth he cannot honor gratitude forbid that he should lift up his rebellious arm against his benefactor well thou know of late when civil discord reigned amongst us he fought with henry and with henry fell when injured edward genrously forgave restored his forfeit lands and late advanced him to rank and title  warwick infamy and shame the common nets which fearful knavry spreads to catch ambitions fools mean sordid bribes we know the treasure they were meant to purchase  elizabeth unkind suggestion how have i deserved it have i for this refused a youthful monarch and spurned his offered scepter at my feet to be reproached at last by cruel warwick had i once listened to him had these eyes been dazzled with the splendour of a court i need not thus have changed it for a dungeon but since i am suspected witness heaven and witness warwick to my vows henceforth dear as thou art i cast thee from my love elizabeth will never wed  a traitor  warwick am i awake and did elizabeth say she would never wed her faithful warwick then bear me witness too all judging heaven here yield i up all visionary dreams of future bliss of liberty or life even the sweet hope of vengeance that alone sustained my spirit loses all its charms i wished for freedom but to purchase thine for life but to enjoy it with my love and she disclaims me  warwick heaven forbid o warwick let not the tide of passion thus overwhelm thy reason  warwick can thou pardon me thou know the unguarded warmth the weakness of my nature i would not wrong thee but i have been so often so cruelly deceived  elizabeth i know thou have but never by elizabeth  warwick o no it is impossible that perfidy should wear a form like thine looking at her i wonder not that edward loved no when i look on thee all beauteous all enchanting as thou art by heaven i think i could almost forgive him  elizabeth then wherefore not be reconciled  warwick to whom the author of my wrongs it cannot be know i have promised margret to destroy him  elizabeth destroy thy friend ungenrous cruel warwick is it not enough that thou have triumphed here already we have pierced his noble heart with the keen pangs of disappointed love and would thou wound his breast with added sorrows would thou involve a nation in his ruin  warwick elizabeth no more alas too well thou know there is a powerful advocate in warwicks breast that pleads for perjured edward  elizabeth cherish the soft emotion o my warwick   warwick that angel form can never plead in vain but then my friends  where is my solemn vow to margret and to pembroke there is the tie my honors dearer to me   elizabeth than thy love dearer much dearer than elizabeth but i have done farewell my lord i see thy deep resentment is not to be moved by my weak influence over thee going warwick stay i charge thee  elizabeth what is this phantom honor this proud idol that tramples thus on every humble virtue this cruel bloody molock that delights in human sacrifice o would to heaven i were its only victim but with me you offer up your country and your king  warwick think on my vow think on my promise given  elizabeth thy league with margret must be fatal grant we should succeed and lancaster once more assume the throne how dear the victory that is purchased with our fellow subjects blood alas such triumphs make the conquror weep but if we fail   warwick impossible  elizabeth o think betimes what dreadful punishments await the vanquished rebel thou perhaps my love shall then be doomed on the ignominious block to fall inglorious and when thou art gone who shall defend thy poor elizabeth  warwick alarming thought it staggers my firm purpose and makes me half a villain  scene v warwick elizabeth an officer officer madam the king demands your presence i have orders to convey you to the palace  warwick and will thou leave me  elizabeth this my warwick this is the decisive moment now determine accept of mercy ever it be too late ever hasty edward  shall i say thou will return to thy obedience and receive thy pardon shall i speak my love  warwick perhaps i may accept it if it is brought by thee  elizabeth then we shall meet in happiness   warwick farewell  scene vi warwick now to those worst companions in affliction my own sad thoughts again they are gloomy all and like my habitation full of horror i like not edwards message  if he hears my league with margaret he still has power to make me feel his rage i have deserved it  a trampling heard without methought i heard a noise  this way they come perhaps it is the messenger of death   scene vii pembroke warwick pembroke the messenger of vengeance  see her sword accept it and be free offers the sword warwick first let me know to whom i am indebted for it  pembroke to me soon as the rumor of thy foul disgrace had reached the public ear the impatient people uncertain of thy fate tumultuous thronged around the palace and demanded thee give us our warwick give us back they cried our hero our delivrer  i stepped forth and bade them instant if they wished to save the best of men from infamy and death to follow me transported they obeyed i led them hither forced the prison gates and brought thee this  direct it as thou will gives the sword warwick welcome once more thou dearest gift of heaven immortal liberty my friend i thank thee o pembroke would thou had been here my love my dear elizabeth is true  pembroke at least you think so  warwick she has told me such sweet truths edward repents him sorely he is grieved at his ingratitude  pembroke and well he may i fear thou art betrayed alas my warwick thy open generous unsuspecting virtue thinks every heart as honest as thy own thou know not edward  nor elizabeth the kingdom is in arms and every hour it is expected france will join the queen england will want its great protectors aid edward and rivers have conspired to cheat thy credulous ear and who so fit to spread the flimsy web as thy elizabeth their fair ambassadress i see you are caught  warwick by heaven it may be so i am the sport of fortune and of fraud  pembroke away my friend it is not now a time to think of her margret supported by thy powerful name and joined by clarence waits us at the head of fifteen thousand men who eager all to crush a tyrant and pull down oppression attend thy wished for presence not a soldier will act or move till warwick shall direct them edward and englands fate depend on thee  warwick away my friend i will follow thee exit pembroke yet stop a moment  let not passion hurry me to base dishonor  if my country calls for warwicks aid shall i not hear her voice and save her pembroke may have private views and subtle margret too  elizabeth i must not lose thee  o direct me heaven  end of the fourth act act v scene i elizabeth the royal pardon came too late and pembroke already has released him he is gone  elizabeth may never see him more a thousand terrors haunt me a fond father a guiltless sovereign a distracted lover fame fortune friends and country all depend on one eventful moment  hark the sound of distant groans perhaps the king  perhaps my warwick bleeds o agonizing thought great god of armies whose allguiding hand directs the fate of nations o look down on thy own image let not cruel discord divide their kindred souls in pity hear pour thy benignant spirit over their hearts and once more knit them in the bonds of peace  scene ii elizabeth suffolk suffolk the prayer of innocence is always heard  elizabeth ha suffolk whither hastst thou art thou come   suffolk i come to heal thy sorrows lovely fair one to tell thee edward and thy muchloved warwick once more are friends  elizabeth indeed o welcome news my joys too great for uttrance tell me suffolk how was it speak is warwick safe o heaven  suffolk a moments patience and i will tell thee all margret thou know had raised a powerful force that doubled edwards troops elate with pride and almost sure of victory she urged the tardy spearmen on they rushed as if secure of conquest the unhappy king stood nobly firm and seemed to brave his fate when warwick like a guardian god appeared his noble mien and allcommanding look struck deep attention every eye was bent upon him and an awful silence reigned over either host he raised his voice on high and stop he cried your sacrilegious hands nor touch my friend who pierces edwards breast must pass through mine i raised him to the throne and will support him there to you i gave from you my fellow soldiers i expect him however his cruel wrongs have wounded me he never injured you and i  forgive him he spoke and instant through the gazing crowd a murmur ran down dropped their nerveless arms as if enchanted by some magic power and with one voice they cried long live king edward  elizabeth how powerful is the tongue of eloquence when in the cause of virtue  well what sollowd  suffolk encouraged by the shouting soldiers edward on like a modest virgin wishing came yet fearful warwick with a bridegrooms speed to meet him flew into each others arms they ran with speechless joy the tender scene affected every heart and the rough soldier unused to melting sympathy forgot his ruthless nature and dissolved in tears  elizabeth sweet reconcilement then elizabeth thou did not plead in vain but say how brookd the haughty queen this unexpected change  suffolk abashed confounded for a while she strove to stem the torrent but in vain then fled precipitate  elizabeth but where o where is my warwick  suffolk with a few chosen squadrons he pursues the disappointed margret  elizabeth o my fears i know not why but at that hateful name i tremble ever my foreboding heart presages something dreadful  suffolk do not vex thy tender mind with visionary dangers  elizabeth o would to heaven that he were sheltered here and safe within these arms  suffolk be not alarmed he is the care of heaven all good men love all bad ones fear him  elizabeth such superior merit must have a thousand foes the constant mark of envys poisoned darts  suffolk there suffolk feels the keen reproach with blushes i confess there was a time when urged by fond ambition i looked on warwick with a jealous eye but this last noble deed has won my heart and i am now a convert to his virtues but see the king approaches  scene iii edward elizabeth edward health and peace and happiness

all subduing love in aftertimes thy name shall be enrolled amongst the great delivrers of their country  elizabeth i have no title to the lavish praise thy generous heart bestows i only said what duty prompted and what love inspired indulgent heaven has crowned it with success  edward thou have done all i am indebted to thee for more much more than i can ever repay long time with shame i own has warwick soared above me but i will not be outdone for ever by this proud aspiring rival poor as i am there yet is one way left to pay the debt of gratitude i owe him one great reward for such exalted virtues thyself elizabeth  elizabeth what means my lord my royal master  edward yes when next we meet i will bestow it on him will resign all my fond claim to happiness and thee though thy dear image never can be effaced from edwards breast though still i dote upon thee though i could hang for ever on thy beauties yet will i yield them to their rightful lord warwick has earned warwick alone
