arminius or the champion of liberty a tragedy with an historical preface  by arthur murphy esquire  arminius liberator haud dubie germaniae et qui non primordia populi romani sicut alii reges ducesque

price  s  d  where may be had the authors other works  preface the following poem was written in the course of the last summer why it was not offered to the stage it is unnecessary to mention if it could in any degree answer the purpose for which it was originally designed it would not be as perhaps now is the case a mere trifle offered to the public the author is conscious that his powers are neither equal to the subject nor to the zeal with which he undertook it removed though he is from the political world he could not in his private retreat be altogether inattentive to the various events which in the last seven years have changed the face of europe and under the savage conduct of a nation of professed atheists counteracted the order of providence in the formation of civil society nihil est illi principi deo qui omnem hunc mundum regit quod quidem in terris fiat acceptius quam concilia coetus que hominum jure sociati quoe civitates appellantur somn scip s iii  he saw the monarchy of france overturned by the fury of a democratic faction who have since reduced their whole nation to a state of slavery not to be paralelled in the records of history five men called the directory have silenced the legislature of their country they transported seventy of the members to perish on a foreign shore and from that time have not suffered their national assembly to enter into a debate or to pass a single law  the usurpers at first covered their ambition with the mask of patriots struggling for liberty and as soon as they found themselves possessed of power they destroyed liberty itself with men of their stamp the practice has been uniformly the same from the days of tacitus to the present hour ut imperium evertant libertatem praeferunt sr everterint libertatem ipsam aggrediuntur annal lib xvi s      when the revolution began in france the people of england did not look much deeper than the surface the love of innovation was for some time thought to be zeal for civil liberty and by great politicians and eminent orators it was called the fabric of human wisdom that doctrine was spread far and wide and honest men were deceived by appearances in the mean time a jacobin party was formed in various parts of england by constitutional clubs and corresponding societies republicans in their hearts they pretended to act with ardour for the constitution they talked of the rights of man of reform of parliament and universal suffrage while in secret they wished for nothing so much as to see the horrors of french anarchy introduced into this kingdom they knew that in a thunderstorm the dregs of the barrel rise to the top they had read in the fable that when the oak and the cedar were felled to the ground the bramble reigned over the forest having nothing to lose they hoped in a convulsion of the state that they should find their private advantage the same views and principles in every age and country have been the motives of all pernicious citizens the english jacobins as well as the french may find their picture drawn by the masterly pencil of tacitus falso libertatis nomen obtendi ab us qui privatim degeneres in publicum exitiosi nihil spei nisi per discordias habeant ann lib xi s      while our homebred factions were employed at sheffield norwich manchester london and other places in laying the seedplots of rebellion this country was on a sudden involved in a just a necessary an unavoidable war unavoidable it must be called since the regicides thought fit to be the aggressors this point has been warmly controverted and much ink has been lavished on the subject the present writer does not mean to enter the lists with any person whatever he only claims a right to think for himself and with all possible brevity to exhibit the light in which things appeared to him  it has been said that great britain provoked the war by the recall of her ambassador but that event took place after the  0th of august      when the king of france was suspended from all the functions of his office and sent with the royal family a prisoner to the temple the credentials of the ambassador were then no longer valid with whom was he to transact business was it to be matter of indifference whether he negotiated with the king to whom he was sent or with the brissots the marats the robespieres and the rest of that pandaemonium would such a conduct have been suited to the honor of the british nation it would have been nothing short of a decided part in the internal affairs of france had lord gower remained at paris he would have been in a precarious situation he had seen the massacre of the  0th of august was he to wait for that of the  d of september when no less than three thousand men women and children were most barbarously murdered the french have lately shown that they can trample on the rights of ambassadors they confined the ambassador of portugal in a prison and might have behaved with equal insolence to lord gower in such a juncture his majesty thought it became his dignity to send letters of recall declaring at the same time that he would not interfere in the internal government of that kingdom if the french who are now affiliating that is enslaving geneva will enquire for the works of burlamaqui they will find that the recall of an ambassador or a refusal to receive one may proceed from various causes without being deemed a sufficient provocation of war it should seem that the french themselves were of that opinion since it appears that m le brun at that time minister for foreign affairs in his answer to the communication made to him by lord gower expressed his wish that a full reciprocity of justice and good will might subsist between the two countries  with what sincerity the republican anarchists acted on that occasion may be inferred from their decree of the   th november      by which they promised fraternity and support to the people of every country who wished to overturn their government it is almost superfluous to add that in answer to frost and joel barlow the president of the convention hoped the day was not far distant when he should send congratulations to a similar national convention in england  it is well known that an inundation of french jacobins whom their oercloyd country vomited forth to propagate their detestable principles infested every part of london in such a period the alien bill was a wife and necessary measure and it may now well be a question whether it ought not to be declared perpetual whenever a peace shall be concluded a banditti of frenchmen under the pretext of trade and commerce will be sent over to wage a war of principles against the government  in the latter end of the year      the demagogues of paris were resolved on two grand objects namely the murder of their king and a war with great britain the former was executed on the   st of january      on the   th of the same month m chauvelin received orders to depart though it was well known that long before that time he had renounced his king who had sent him hither and sworn fidelity to his new masters and though his machinations in this country were well known he was notwithstanding suffered to remain as long as lewis xvi was permitted to live his credentials expired with his martyred sovereign his character of ambassador was terminated by the fatal murder of his most christian majesty to have received him with new credentials from the regicides would have been incompatible with the moral dignity of the british nation  the rulers of paris having destroyed their king proceeded to their longprojected war against great britain in their debate on that subject on the  st of february      it was asserted by one of their orators that the watchful conduct of the british ministers their fears and jealousies afforded proofs of the progress of the opinions and principles of the french revolution see debretts collection of addresses from english clubs published in the year      is not that avowal from the mouth of an enemy a full justification of the alien bill it was further asserted by brissot that the british ministers for the sake of the trade and commerce of england observed a strict neutrality if corroborating proof of this pacific disposition were necessary we have the authority of the marquis de bouille that great officer known and respected throughout europe informs us that he attended the king of prussia and the emperor leopold at pilnitz on the   d of august      when these two powers formed a treaty of alliance and in the month of september following he was received in the cabinet at vienna and there the emperor told him that he had been waiting for answers from the courts of russia spain england and the principal sovereigns of italy and had at length received them and was assured of the assistance and cooperation of all those powers except england which had expressed its determination to observe a strict neutrality see the marquis de bouilles memoirs of the french revolution page       what in the mean time was the real disposition of the french toward great britain mr harper one of the representatives in the american congress has laid open the intrigues the stratagems and overbearing insolence of the french from the very beginning of the revolution he tells us in express terms that their grand object was to destroy the trade of great britain and this was to be effected by setting fire to the four corners of europe and exciting the people in every quarter to insurrection against their government a project so atrocious in its end and so abominable in its means has never been conceived before and while all this was going on the convention in order to hoodwink england was making to her the most solemn assurances of pacific intentions it even carried its dissimulation to the almost incredible length of requesting the mediation of england to bring about a peace with prussia and the emperor in the mean time their instructions to genet their envoy to america showed that it was their manifest object to draw the united states into a war with great britain those instructions were dated january  d      supplementary instructions were delivered by the same person january   th      louis xvi was guillotined january   st      chauvelin was ordered to quit england january   th      and war was declared against england on the  st of february following if the dismissal of chauvelin was the occasion of the war as france alleged why those instructions on the  d of january so long before the dismissal the leaders of opposition in england have long persisted in the error of regarding only the declarations of france and wholly overlooking her actions see harpers pamphlet page         if the war was at first unavoidable it is now just and necessary as appears from the behavior of the directory to lord malmesbury that nobleman invested with the character of plenipotentiary offered in the very outset of the negotiation at lisle the terms of peace drawn up in the form of a treaty which the enemy had they been in earnest might have embraced with little or no delay but contrary to all precedent they recalled at the end of near three months the plenipotentiaries who possessed the thread of the whole negotiation and sent two new agents to lisle with a settled design in the most abrupt manner to end all further treaty those new agents by a note dated the   th of september desired to know whether lord malmesbury had powers to give up to france and her allies all places conquered by great britain they were told by his lordship that a decisive answer in the negative had been given on the   th of july preceding this was of no weight a peer of great britain and a plenipotentiary ambassador was ordered in the most insolent manner to go and return that is to fetch and carry for an insolent directory who have emerged from obscurity to be the tyrants of their country this demand of a general restitution is the more extravagant because after the three great and glorious victories unparalleled in the british annals by lord how over the french by lord st vincent over the spaniards and lastly by lord duncan over the dutch it is not in their power to retake any one place that has been conquered from them rafts and gunboats will not be able to cope with the british navy  it has been asked in the house of commons are we to persist in the war for the possession of the cape of good hope the island of ceylon and trincomale the following extract from the marquis de bouilles memoirs will be a sufficient answer to the question in the summer of      says that great general when i was preparing to set out from berlin to russia i received an order from government to return to paris on my arrival there the minister acquainted me with a project relative to the east indies the object was to unite the french and dutch forces in an attack upon the english possessions to restore to the princes of the country the provinces conquered from them by the english and to obtain and secure for the two nations factories and commercial establishments which were to be free to the whole world the means employed to secure success to this enterprise were an army of   000 men independent of the garrisons already in that country twenty millions of livres in specie and a naval force able to oppose that of the english in the east indies trincomale in the island of ceylon was the place destined for the rendezvous of the troops and the repository of the military magazines one third of the forces as well as of the sums necessary and the stores and provisions of every kind were to be furnished by the dutch who requested that i should have the command of the expedition in      the revolution broke out in holland but was suppressed pressed by the entry of a prussian army under the command of the duke of brunswick all the bonds which united france and holland were dissolved the former basely abandoning her ally and thus the vast project of the conquest of the indies vanished into air the marquis de bouilles memoirs page      it is to be observed that the above project was in      not more than a year after a general peace when nothing had occurred that could give umbrage to france the same rooted aversion to this country still subsists and is openly avowed by the directory and after this statement is trincomale an object of importance to this country shall it be given up to be the rendezvous of the enemys troops and the repository of their magazines to do it were to be felo de se  ever since the return of lord malmesbury the directory have waged a war of billinsgate against this country with scurrility calumny and the grossest falsehoods they have attempted to traduce and vilify a great nation celebrated throughout europe for its humanity no less than its valor they have declared that the english are a generous people laboring under a bad government and they are determined to give them on the the royal exchange a better constitution infatuated men they had in the beginning of their revolution the british constitution as a model to imitate but they preferred anarchy as montesquieu expresses it they had byzantium before their eyes and they built chalcedon they have affiliated holland belgium the states of italy and geneva and they have robbed and plundered them all it now remains for them to destroy the commerce of great britain and to erect their tricoloured flag on the royal exchange for this purpose they have solicited subscriptions in their own exhausted country but by that measure they rouzed the spirit of the british nation all degrees and ranks of men have conspired with emulation to strengthen the hands of government and from the contributions paid in at the bank three things are manifest first that the people are united with one mind one heart one hand against the attempts of a french banditti secondly that this is an opulent country ready and willing to strengthen the hands of government and thirdly the voluntary subscriptions show that all ranks and orders of men repose entire confidence in his majestys councils and his present ministers the consequence of this unanimity and firmness it is hoped will be the support of the extensive commerce of this country and the empire of the sea  quicunque mundi terminus obstitit hunc tangat armis visere g stiens qua part debacchentur ignes qua nebulae pluviique rores horace lib iii ode    the situation it must be granted forms an awful period and requires collected vigor nothing less than the whole force of the community and yet at the same time we still hear a clamor for radical reform that men of eminence in the state should at length join in such a cry is not a little surprising it may therefore not be improper to remind them that on the trial of hardy at the old baily a letter to him from the society at norwich was produced containing the following passage whether it is the private design of the several societies to rip up monarchy by the roots and place democracy in its stead what was the answer the committee offer you every assistance in their power but request that your questions for the future may relate chiefly to reform of parliament hardys trial by gurney vol i page         this the corresponding society avow as their ostensible object but conceal their intention with regard to monarchy when men of rank and ability allow themselves after all their efforts to adopt the same clamor they run the risk of being thought to follow hardys advice whose advice they follow when their voice is raised against every measure of government it is impossible to say the suspension of the habeas corpus act is called a violent step nothing less than a violation of the constitution an encroachment on the liberty of the subject and in short a manifest prelude to the reign of terror the reason assigned for this intemperate language is that no proof of existing plots against the state has been produced in parliament but that the jacobins at manchester and other places have been engaged in a conspiracy against this country is evident beyond the possibility of a doubt and surely the power of providing for the safety of a whole people is inherent in the frame and spirit of the constitution let us hear what a whig of the old school has said upon the subject it is an absurdity to imagine that those who have the authority of making laws cannot suspend any particular law when they think it expedient for the public when therefore any law does not conduce to this great end the very observation of it would endanger the community and that law ought to be laid asleep for a limited time by proper authority every government must in its nature be armed with such a power there cannot be a greater instance of this than in the old commonwealth of rome who flattered themselves with an opinion that their government had in it a due temper of the regal noble and popular power represented by the consuls the senators and the tribunes nevertheless in this government when the republic was threatened with danger they thought fit for the common safety to appoint a temporary dictator invested with the whole power of the three branches who when the danger was over retired again into the community and left the government in its natural situation the habeas corpus act was passed toward the end of charles ii and since that time has been suspended twice under the reign of william and mary once under king william and once in the reign of queen anne and again in the year      and besides every unprejudiced man will consider how mildly and equitably this power has been used the persons confined have been treated with all possible humanity and abridged of nothing but the liberty of ruining themselves and their families see the freeholder no    what mr addison has said of the ministers of george i may be applied to the councils of his present majesty when the habeas corpus act was suspended four years ago the whole body of the people have equal confidence on the present occasion but after all addison it may be said was a party writer montesquieu was neither whig nor tory his words are si la puissance legislative se croyoit en danger par quelque conjuration secrette contre letat ou quelque intelligence avec les enemis du dehors elle pourroit pour un tems court et limite permettre a a puisance executrice de fair arreter les citoyens suspects qui ne perdroient leur liberte pour un tems que pour la conserver pour toujours lesprit des loix lib xi cap vi   the clamor of a few against the present suspension of the law is not the only mischief of the times a monster in politics has lately stalked forth as formidable as that described by lucretius  horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans  this phantom is the sovereign majesty of the people a fourth estate set up in a country that has been for ages governed by the legislative authority of three if there is such a new order it is of course paramount to king lords and commons and by consequence there is an end of our boasted constitution but where has this sovereign majesty of the people ever existed at athens the people had a share in the government and the citizens of rome by their tribunes assumed and exercised enormous influence but they had no sovereign majesty in process of time they both wrought their own ruin the subjects of great britain are much wiser they delegate their whole authority to their representatives and beyond that power they claim no authority if the sovereign majesty of the people ever existed in any part of the known world it must have been in a pure unmixed and persect democracy and where can such a government be traced polybius says rust is the inbred bane of iron and worms of wood and as those substances at last fall a prey to the evils that are congenial to their nature in the same manner every single kind of government breeds within itself some certain vice which soon causes its destruction thus royalty degenerates into tyranny aristocracy into oligarchy and democracy into savage violence see polybius book vi chap i  such is the natural progress of the simple forms of government a mixed limited monarchy has in its well tempered contexture the means within itself of checking every mischief and till a wild democracy has overturned all wholesome laws the sovereign majesty of the people is gigantic nonsense full of sound and fury signifying nothing  the reform projected by the jacobins of this country would beyond all doubt rip up the constitution by the roots at such a time the author of the following scenes thought if he could recall the minds of men to the origin and antiquity of the constitution under which the people have enjoyed their rights their property and their liberty for above five hundred years his labors might have some tendency to stop the progress of the new philosophy and check the spirit of innovation our form of government as motesquieu has truly observed came to this country from the woods of germany lesprit des loix book  gaul was reduced to a state of slavery while germany displayed a spirit of independance arminius was the great hero of germany tacitus tells us that he fought with alternate vicissitudes of fortune a man of warlike genius and beyond all question the deliverer of germany he had not like the kings and generals of a former day the infancy of rome to cope with he had to struggle with a great and flourishing empire he attacked the romans in the meridian of their glory he stood at bay for a number of years with equivocal success sometimes victorious often defeated but in the issue of the war still unconquered annal lib ii s    it was from that northern hive that our saxon ancestors brought with them the same spirit of liberty and a plan of civil government they had experienced in their own country the disadvantages of the general suffrage of the people in a mass they had occasionally tried the more practicable mode of representation ut missis legatis in commune consultarent libertas an pax placeret they had recourse to the same expedient in england the wittenagemot was accordingly established consisting of the king the barons and the saxon freemen the inferior orders of the people were still in bondage but the remedy was soon applied letters of enfranchisement were granted not only to individuals but to the inhabitants of towns and cities who were admitted by their representatives to a voice in the great council of the nation the consequence was that the kingly power the privileges of the nobility and clergy and the rights of the commons were so happily blended that i believe says montesquieu so happy a form of government never presented itself to the mind of man lesprit des loix lib xi cap vi viii  the great council of the nation called under the anglo saxon government the wittenagemot in process of time took the name of parliament and from that period has been the palladium of british liberty a noble fabric which our internal enemies would fain demolish by what they call a radical reform  it is however to be hoped that a veneration for the antiquity of so glorious a constitution and a due sense of the blessings which mankind have enjoyed under it will animate all true englishmen against their enemies whether foreign or domestic  the author of arminius has had the pleasure of working under a great master and in the notes annexed to the tragedy he has cited the passages which he has imitated because he knows that the sentiments will come with weight and authority from the great writer of political history that he has not been able to execute up to his own ideas and wishes he is too conscious but for a wellmeant endeavor no apology can be required  published by barker and son great

powerful motives that urge me to the war  arminius and by that war is slavery the boon you mean to grant to your devoted country for those bright those noble motives does that burnished helm display its luster  flavius this high plumed helmet taking it off germanicus with his own warlike hand placed on my brow  arminius and that unseemly scar that marks your forehead and deforms your visage what generous hand bestowed it  flavius on the banks of the adrana now the eder in the landgravate of hesse  where the cattian nation after a battle obstinately fought gave way at length to the undaunted valor of veteran troops i saw a roman pressed by a fierce german with his lifted sabre when instantly i flew to his relief and then received this honorable wound but saved a roman citizen from death  arminius for that exploit that great heroic deed what was your recompense  flavius a civic crown f a military chain and other honors that grace the romans valor  arminius did those honors glare in your eye and lure you from your country  flavius they are my noblest pride   arminius with a sneering laugh  you have the wages of a slave cheaply bought g  flavius control this violence i have not merited this keen reproach  arminius and do those baubles pay you for your treason contempt and laughter mix with indignation thou base deserter  flavius brother if you knew the roman character   arminius full well i know it the nations of the world too long have groaned beneath their iron rod and shall your caesars your caesars deified and for their crimes enrolled among the gods of rome shall they who trample on their senate and their people demand the homage of a freeborn race and bid the northern world embrace the yoke  flavius germanicus is loved wherever he is known he leads the armies of imperial rome to fame and victory where now the spirit of the tubantes and the cattian state they have submitted and the roman chief ensures his conquest by the arts of peace he wins all hearts he calls the wandering savage from fens from forests and from hills of snow to settled mansions teaches them to form new laws new cities to enjoy the sweets of civil union and of polished life  arminius their arts of polished life are roman vices the baits of luxury the balefull charm that mingles in the cup delicious poison to sweeten slavery  flavius no more i will bear this torrent of abuse  arminius with patience hear me i now descend to humble supplications i now conjure you by the sacred ties of honor by the love h you owe your country atone for what is past renounce your treason by me your mother prays implores beseeches you not to betray your family and friends think of the vast renown of leading armies to serve your country to that glorious conduct will you prefer

slopes his western wheels and deepning into gloom the lazy clouds promise a night to veil the face of things the troops designed to circle round the hills and lie in ambush there are they drawn up and ready for their enterprise  inguiomer they are all eager for the march yet ere they start they wish to hear your animating voice and from yourself receive their final orders  arminius my gallant

we see the godlike spirit of those ancient worthies who toiled or bled for liberty and laws  inguiomer years have elapsed since by his patriot ardour expelled exterminated the romans fled beyond the rhine their boasted emperor their deified augustus dared no more invade the land his schemes of wild ambition by one great overthrow he saw defeated he passed his days in misery of heart wept for his loss and like a puny infant cried varus varus f give me back my legions  veleda oh may tiberius who usurps the name of caesar may that fell that savage tyrant that monster of iniquity and fraud before

inguiomer this very night we storm the roman camp our plan is formed our measures are concerted your brother will lead on a chosen band a brave battalion there the generous youth may by his deeds immortalize his name  veleda i doubt him not within his bosom glows the hero and the patriot since the gods restored me to my friends this very day i saw my brother busy at his post i paused and listened to him then i heard the language of his heart a train of bards with fervent zeal in flow procession came chaunting their heavenly strains my brother cried come see me fighting in my countrys cause if victory attends me g to your annals add a young warrior if i fall in battle record my memory  inguiomer he gives an earnest of matchless worth the rival of arminius  scene vi to them gothmund

him straight  exit gothmund ere this the deputy has reached our camp think you he brings such equitable terms as may conciliate peace between the nations and close the scene of carnage and destruction  inguiomer it is fit he should have audience but in vain i fear he comes our frantic foes enured to war with mad ambition fired and flushed with hope of universal empire will never agree to give the world a peace on the broad base of justice and the laws that bind consenting nations  scene vii the back scene draws in the middle a throne raised with turf a warlike march soldiers walk forward and line the stage on both sides arminius following and takes his seat arminius at length the roman general sees the streights to which his scanty numbers are reduced destruction hovers over him in despair which he calls lenity and roman virtue by his ambassador he offers terms but what ambassador  that hoary traitor segestes is his delegate by him he hopes to grace his cause that vile deserter that foe to liberty that friend of rome brings his insidious overtures he comes to varnish over the slavery he loves conduct him hither let the traitor enter  scene viii enter soldiers bearing ensigns and eagles and after them segestes arminius ere now segestes we have often met on better terms together we have sought the embattled foe our hearts with equal ardour panting for glory and our pointed javelins thirsting for hostile blood but now that bond of generous union is dissolved for ever  segestes judge not too rashly still this bosom glows with social love still feels the sympathy of kind affections anger and resentment for my lost daughter now subside in peace foes in the field in private we are friends  arminius friendship is founded on the noblest basis on generous sentiment and public virtue on truth on honor and congenial minds treason and honor never can embrace now speak your embassy i long to hear the orator of rome  segestes my embassy aims at the peace of germany and rome wide wasting war too long has made the land a scene of desolation helpless widows afflicted virgins and unhappy orphans are bathed in tears your fields are covered over with the unburied limbs of slaughtered soldiers romans and germans all your sacred groves are levelled in the dust and all your rivers surcharged with blood run purple to the sea  arminius but whence those horrors say with truth declare who were the authors of that wild destruction  segestes to trace our mutual errors to their source and on the roman or cheruscan name to fix the cause is not within my province i come the harbinger of peace i come to state the message of the roman chief it is his wish by justice and by mercy not by the sword to win consenting hearts to call the wandering german to the arts of polished manners and of social life it is on this basis he would raise his trophies his truest glory  arminius still i am lost in darkness wherefore this torrent of superslous speech if your new masters call it eloquence and roman oratory still to us it is the mere pomp of words and vain parader you come to offer peace declare your terms  segestes thus then caecina by my voice informs you let the visurgis be the western boundary of the cheruscan state from thence the country far as the albis now the elbe  whose impetuous course empties its current in the northern sea shall be your vast domain  arminius yet tell me more the extensive region from the western bank   segestes far as the rhine the nations shall submit to the mild sway the wisdom and the laws by which the glory of imperial rome means to reform and humanize the world  arminius  rising is this the boasted justice of your masters and is it thus they humanize the world  segestes wherever they penetrate fair order dawns   arminius wherever they penetrate oppression follows   segestes the whole cheruscan state is granted to you you wage no war for conquest  arminius the cheruscans wish for no conquest conquest is the aim of murdrers flushed with insolence and pride the fell ambition of the haughty romans gave us in evil hour between the rhine and the visurgis to behold their eagles their lictors tribunes  h and their vile collectors exactions tributes cruelty and lust rapine and murder  these are their exploits a band of robbers  are the nations rich happy and thriving  i roman avarice becomes their foe do they endure distress and pine in want roman ambition still aims at new victory to them alike the wealth and poverty of nations all must fall before your sovreigns of the world to rob and ravage is their art of war and when they have made a solitude around them they call it peace  segestes their offer now imports a firm a lasting peace within your limits live safe and uninvaded rome is willing on terms to grant a vast extensive region  arminius  rising think you i mean to merchandise  k the war to barter part of germany by sale and vile exchange to traffic for our own go tell your general my last resolve coming forward let him give back my country let him give to freeborn men their unmolested rights their plan of laws their temples and their gods from the visurgis let him call his legions repass the rhine and on the side of gaul enjoy the bank which your divine augustus vainly called germany there let him dwell in sullen majesty and let his eagles no more like vultures hover over our heads let him do this arminius grants him peace  segestes this haughty answer with redoubled fury will light the flame of war and once again wide wasting slaughter shall stalk over the land

judged tomorrows orient sun shall see his legions overwhelmed in ruin  inguiomer since then an officer has brought this letter it is addressed to you  arminius to me a letter give it let me see it

assassin be upon your guard against clandestine enemies farewell if this be true i can almost allow a roman still may have a sense of honor if any gauls are lurking in our army   gothmund their number is not great but i have watched them with an observant eye  arminius they are a traitorous race had they made head against the roman arms like men who knew the value of their liberty the imperial eagles soon had winged their flight to their italian realms and slavery repassed their alpine hills to dwell at rome and with their senate kneel at caesars feet  inguiomer they fought in parties and the whole was conquered   arminius all civil union was to them unknown strangers to liberty and now subdued to crouch in bondage the ambitious slaves would raise the tree of tyranny and overturn in every state in all the nations round them the laws that hold society in peace  inguiomer we must be wary gothmund we must look with circumspective eyes watch every motion all secret meetings and by due attention mar this detested project  arminius for his conduct caecina claims both gratitude and praise but has he sent that false perfidious gaul back to our camp  gothmund the traitor still is there   arminius let a well chosen officer be sent to tell caecina that his generous action reflects a luster on his name but still to crown the deed with glory the assassin must be delivered up to justice tell him it is my request  inguiomer soon as the slave arrives a strict enquiry will afford a clue to guide us through the maze of their designs and trace the gauls who tampered in the treason  arminius gothmund do you select some trusty officer to bear our message let him strait depart   exit gothmund inguiomer caecina will comply   arminius and if he does i in my turn will act a generous part his little army shall have leave to march free unmolested to the distant rhine i will sheath the sword and for such splendid merit spare the effusion oen of roman blood how wears the night  inguiomer it is now the second watch   arminius are the troops all arrangd as i directed   inguiomer they are under arms and at their several posts all watchful stand impatient to renew the charge and though repulsed with joy they find they have sustained no loss  arminius they have sustained a loss we all must feel and long must mourn that brave heroic youth the gallant segimund whose early
