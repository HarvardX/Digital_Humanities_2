wives as they were and maids as they are a comedy in five acts performed at the theater royal covent garden  by mrs inchbald  dublin printed for p wogan oldbridge       prologue by a friend spoken by mr waddy i come not to announce a bashful maid who never has tried the dramas doubtful trade who sees with fluttering hope the curtain rise and scans with timid glance your critic eyes my client is a more experienced dame though not a veteran not unknown to fame who think your favors are an honest boast yet fears to forfeit what she values most who has she trusts some character to lose even though the woman did not aid the muse who courts with modest aim the public smile that stamp of merit and that meed of toil at athens once our author has been told the comic muse irregularly bold with living calumny profaned her stage and forged the frailties of the faultless sage such daring ribaldry you need not fear we have no socrates to libel here ours are the follies of an humbler flight offspring of manners volatile and light our general satire keeps more knaves in awe our court of conscience comes in aid of law here scourged by wit and pilloried by fun ten thousand coxcombs blush instead of one if scenes like these could make the guilty shrink could teach unfeeling folly how to think check affectations voluble career and from cold fashion force the struggling tear our author would our loudest praise forego content to feel within what passes show but since she says such hopes cannot be mine such bold pretensions i must needs resign tell these great judges of dramatic laws their reformation were my best applause yet if the heart my proud appeal withstands i ask the humbler suffrage of their hands  dramatis personae men lord priory mr quick sir william dorrillon mr munden sir

servants etc  scene london  wives as they were and maids as they are act i scene i an apartment at mr norberrys enter sir william dorrillon and mr norberry mr norberry why blame me  why blame me  my sister had the sole management of your daughter by your own authority from the age of six years till within eight months of the present time when in consequence of my sisters death she was transferred to my protection   sir will your sister mr norberry was a prudent good woman  she never could instruct her in all this vice   mr nor depend upon it my dear friend that miss dorrillon your daughter came to my house just the same heedless woman of fashion you now see her   sir will impatiently very well  it is very well  but when i think on my disappointment    mr nor there is nothing which may not be repaired maria with you for a guide    sir will me she turns me into ridicule  laughs at me this morning as she was enumerating some of her frivolous expenses she observed me lift up my hands and sigh on which she named fifty other extravagances she had no occasion to mention merely to enjoy the pang which every solly of her sends to my heart   mr nor but do not charge this conduct of your daughter to the want of filial love  did she know you were sir william dorrillon did she know you were her father every word you uttered every look you glanced would be received with gentleness and submission  but your present rebukes from mr mandred as you are called from a perfect stranger as she supposes she considers as an impertinence which she has a right to resent   sir will i wish i had continued abroad and yet the hope of beholding her and of bestowing upon her the riches i acquired was my sole support through all the toils by which i gained them   mr nor and considering her present course of life your riches could not come more opportunely   sir will she shall never have a farthing of them do you think i have encountered the perils of almost every climate to squander my hardearned fortune upon the paltry vicious pleasures in which she delights no  i have been now in your house exactly a month  i will stay but one day longer  and then without telling her who i am i will leave the kingdom and her for ever  nor shall she know that this insignificant merchant whom she despises was her father till he is gone never to be recalled   mr nor you are offended with some justice but as i have often told you your excessive delicacy and respect for the conduct of the other sex degenerate into rigor   sir will true  for what i see so near perfection as woman i want to see perfect we mr norberry can never be perfect but surely women women might easily be made angels   mr nor and if they were we should soon be glad to make them into women again   sir william inattentive to mr norberry  she sets the example she gives the fashion  and now your whole house and all your visitors in imitation of her treat me with levity or with contempt  but i will go away tomorrow   mr nor can you desert your child in the moment she wants your protection that exquisite beauty just now become mature    sir will there is my difficulty  there is my struggle  if she were not so like her mother i could leave her without a pang  cast hey off and think no more of her  but that shape that face those speaking looks yet how reversed  where is the diffidence the humility  where is the simplicity of my beloved wife buried in her grave   mr nor and in all this great town you may never see even its apparition   sir will i rejoice however at the stratagem by which i have gained a knowledge of her heart deprived by the means of searching it in her early years had i at present come as her father she might have deceived me with counterfeit manners till time disclosed the imposition  now at least i am not imposed upon   enter servant ser lord priory exit   sir will lord priory   mr nor an old acquaintance of mine though we seldom meet he has some singularities and yet perhaps    enter lord priory mr nor my dear lord i am glad to see you mr mandred introducing sir willian my lord i hope i see you in perfect health   lord pri yes but in very ill humor i came to london early this morning with my family for the winter and found my house after going through only a slight repair so damp that i dare not sleep in it and so i am now sending and going all over the town to seek for lodgings   mr nor then seek no farther but take up your lodgings here   lord pri to be plain with you i called in hopes you would ask me for i am so delicately scrupulous in respect to lady priory that i could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel   mr nor then pray return home and bring her hither immediately with all your luggage   lord pri i am most extremely obliged to you very fervently for into no one house belonging to any of my acquaintance would i take my wife so soon as into yours i have now been married eleven years and during all that time i have made it a rule never to go on a visit so as to domesticate in the house of a married man   sir will may i enquire the reason of that   lord pri it is because i am married myself and having always treated my wife according to the ancient mode of treating wives i would rather she should never be an eyewitness to the modern household management   sir will the ancients i believe were very affectionate to their wives   lord pri and they had reason to be so for their wives obeyed them the ancients seldom gave them the liberty to do wrong but modern wives do as they like   mr nor and dont you suffer lady priory to do as she likes   lord pri yes when it is what i like too but never never else   sir will does not this draw upon you the character of an unkind husband   lord pri that i am proud of did you never observe that seldom a breach of fidelity in a wise is exposed where the unfortunate husband is not said to be the best creature in the world poor man so goodnatured  doatingly fond of his wife  indulged her in every thing  how cruel in her to serve him so now if i am served so it shall not be for my goodnature   mr nor but i hope you equally disapprove of every severity   lord pri rapidly what do you mean by severity   mr nor you know you used to be rather violent in your temper   lord pri so i am still  apt to be hasty and passionate  but that is rather of advantage to me as a husband  it causes me to be obeyed without hesitation  no liberty for contention tears or repining i insure conjugal sunshine by now and then introducing a storm while some husbands never see any thing but a cloudy sky and all for the want of a little domestic thunder to clear away the vapors   sir will i have long conceived indulgenee to be the bane of female happiness   lord pri and so it is  i know several women of fashion who will visit six place of different amusement on the same night have company at home besides and yet for want of something more they will be out of spirits my wife never goes to a public place has scarce ever company at home and yet is always in spirits   sir will never visits operas or balls or routs   lord pri how should she she goes to bed every night exactly at ten   mr nor in the name of wonder how have you been able to bring her to that   lord pri by making her rise every morning at five   mr nor and so she becomes tired before night   lord pri tired to death or if i see her eyes completely open at bedtime and she asks me to play one game more at piquet the next morning i jog her elbow at half after four   mr nor but suppose she does not reply to the signal   lord pri then i turn the key of the door when i leave the chamber and there i find her when i come home in the evening   sir will and without her having seen a creature all day   lord pri this is in my favor for not having seen a single soul she is rejoiced even to see me   mr nor and will she speak to you after such usage   lord pri if you only considered how much a woman longs to speak after being kept a whole day silent you would not ask that question   mr nor well this is the most surprising method   lord pri not at all in ancient days when manners were simple and pure did not wives wait at the table of their husbands and did not angels witness the subordination i have taught lady priory to practice the same humble docile obedience  to pay respect to her husband in every shape and every form no careless inattention to me  no smiling politeness to others in preference to me   no putting me up in a corner  in all assemblies she considers her husband as the first person   sir will i am impatient to see her   lord pri but dont expect a fine lady with high feathers and the et caetera of an eastern concubine you will see a modest plain english woman with a cap on her head a handkerchief on her neck and a gown of our own manufacture   sir will my friend norberry what a contrast must there be between lady priory and the ladies in this house   lord pri starting have you ladies in this house   mr nor dont be alarmed they are both single and can give lady priory no ideas concerning the marriage state   lord pri are you sure of that some single women are more informed than their friends believe   mr nor for these ladies notwithstanding a few what you would call excesses i will answer   lord pri well then i and my wife will be with you about nine in the evening you know we go tobed at ten   mr nor but remember you bring your own servants to wait on you at five in the morning   lord pri i shall bring but one  my old servant oliver who knows all my customs so well that i never go any where without him   mr nor and is that old servant your valet still   lord pri no he is now a kind of gentleman in waiting i have had no employment for a valet since i married  my wife for want of dissipation has not only time to attend upon herself but upon me do you think i could suffer a clumsy man to tie on my neckcloth or comb out my hair when the soft delicate and tender hands of my wife are at my command exit   sir will after this amiable description of a woman how can i endure to see her whom reasons bids me detest but whom nature still    mr nor here she comes and her companion in folly along with her   sir will there is another woman that lady mary raffle how can you suffer such people in your house   mr nor she is only on a visit for a few months  she comes every winter as her family and mine have long been intimately connected   sir will let us go let us go i cannot bear the sight of them going   mr nor stay and for once behave with politeness and good humor to your daughter  do  and i dare venture my life she will neither insult nor treat you with disrespect you know you always begin first   sir will have not i a right to begin first   mr nor but that is a right of which she is ignorant   sir will and deserves to be so and ever shall be so i stay and treat her with politeness and good humor no  rather let her kneel and implore my pardon   mr nor suffer me to reveal who you are and so she will   sir will if you expose me only by the insinuation to her knowledge our friendship is that moment at an end   mr nor firmly i have already given you my promise on that subject and you may rely upon it   sir will i thank you  i believe you  and i thank you   exeunt sir william and mr norberry enter lady mary raffle and miss dorrillon miss dor stealing on as mr norberry and sir william leave the stage they are gone thank heaven they are gone out of this room for i expect a dozen visiters and mr norberry looks so gloomy upon me he puts me out of spirits while that mandreds peevishness is not to be borne   lady m be satisfied for you were tolerably severe upon him this morning in your turn   miss dor why i am vexed  and i dont like to be found fault with in my best humor much less when i have so many things to tease me   lady m what are they   miss dor i have now lost all my money and all my jewels at play it is almost two years since i have received a single remittance from my father and mr norberry refuses to advance me a shilling more  what i shall do to discharge a debt which must be paid either today or tomorrow heaven knows  dear lady mary you could lend me a small sum could you   lady m who i with surprise  my dear creature it was the very thing i was going to ask of you for when you have money i know no one so willing to disperse it among her friends   miss dor am not i  i protest i love to part with my money for i know with what pleasure i receive it myself and i like to see that joy sparkle in anothers eye which has so often brightened my own but last night ruined me  i must have money somewhere  as you cannot assist me i must ask mr norberry for his carriage and immediately go in search of some friend that can lend me four or five or six or seven hundred pounds but the worst is i have lost my credit  is not that dreadful   lady m yes yes i know what it is shaking her head   miss dor what will become of me   lady m why dont you marry and throw all misfortunes upon your husband   miss dor why dont you marry for you have as many to throw   lady m but not so many lovers who would be willing to receive the load i have no sir george evelyn with ten thousand pounds a year  no mr bronzely   miss dor if you have not now you once had for i am sure bronzely once paid his addresses to you   lady m and you have the vanity to suppose you took him from me   miss dor silence  reserve your anger to defend and not to attack me we should be allies by the common ties of poverty and it is time to arm for here is the enemy   enter sir william with mr norberry sir will they are here full aside to mr norberry and offering to go back   mr nor preventing him no no   miss dor i have been waiting here mr norberry to ask a favor of you he and sir william come forward will you be so kind as to lend me your carriage for a couple of hours   mr nor mr mandred pointing to sir william asked me for it to take him into the city   lady m oh mr mandred will give it up to miss dorrillon i am sure he can defer his business till tomorrow   sir will no madam she may as well put off hers i have money to receive and i cannot do it   miss dor i have money to pay and i cannot do it   lady m if one is going to receive and the other to pay money i think the best way is for you to go together and then what deficiency there is on one side the other may supply   miss dor will you consent mr mandred  come do and i will be friends with you   sir will she will be friends with me   miss dor will you   sir will no   miss dor well i certainly can ask a favor of mr mandred better than i can of any person in the world   mr nor why so maria   miss dor because instead of pain i can see it gives him pleasure to refuse me   sir will i never confer a favor of the most trivial kind where i have no esteem   miss dor proudly nor would i receive a favor of the most trivial kind from one who has not liberality to esteem me   mr nor come miss dorrillon do not grow serious laugh as much as you please but say nothing that    sir will to her impatiently from whom then can you ever receive favors except from the vain the idle and the depraved  from those whose lives are passed in begging them of others   miss dor they are the persons who know best how to be on them for my part had i not sometimes felt what it was to want a friend i might never have had humanity to be the friend of another   enter servant ser sir george evelyn   mr nor and pray my dear whose friend have you ever been  enter sir george evelyn  not sir george evelyns i am sure and yet he of all others deserves your friendship most   miss dor but friendship will not content him as soon as he thought he had gained that    sir geo he aspired to the supreme happiness of your love   miss dor now you talk of supreme happiness have you provided tickets for the fete on thursday   sir geo i have provided you have obtained mr norberrys leave to go   mr nor that i cannot grant   miss dor nay my dear sir do not force me to go without it   sir will with violence would you dare   miss dor looking with surprisewould i dare mr mandred  and what have you to say if i do   sir will recollecting himself i was only going to say that if you did and i were mr norberry    miss dor and if you were mr norberry and treated me in the manner you now do depend upon it i should not think your approbation or disapprobation your pleasure or displeasure of the slightest consequence   sir will greatly agitated i dare say not  i dare say not good morning sir george  i dare say not  good morning mr norberry going   mr nor stop a moment  maria you have offended mr mandred   miss dor he has offended me   sir will at the door going

 lady m no no apology   miss dor no no apology but i will tell you what i will do goes up to sir william   if mr mandred likes i will shake hands with him  and well be good friends for the future but then dont find fault with me  i cannot bear it you dont like to be found fault with yourself  you look as cross as any thing every time i say the least word against you come shake hands and dont let us see one anothers failings for the future   sir will there is no future for the trial   miss dor how do you mean   mr nor mr mandred sets off again for india tomorrow   miss dor indeed i thought he was come to live in england i am sorry you are going   sir will with earnestness why sorry   miss dor because we have so frequently quarrelled i am always unhappy when i am going to be parted from a person with whom i have disagreed i often think i could part with less regret from a friend   sir g not i suppose if the quarrel is forgiven   miss dor ah but mr mandred does not forgive no in his looks i can always see resentment  sometimes indeed i have traced a spark of kindness and have gently tried to blow it to a little flame of friendship when with one hasty puff i have put it out   sir will you are right it is  i believe  extinguished   exit mr norberry following sir geo a very singular man   lady m oh if he was not rich there would be no bearing him  indeed he seems to have lost all his friends for during the month he has been here i never found he had any one acquaintance out of this house   miss dor and what is very strange he has taken an aversion to me  but it is still more strange that although i know he has yet in my heart i like him he is morose to an insufferable degree but then when by chance he speaks kind you cannot imagine how it soothes me  he wants compassion and all the tender virtues and yet i frequently think that if any serious misfortune were to befall me he would be the first person to whom i should fly to complain   lady m then why dont you fly and tell him of your misfortune last night   sir geo starting what misfortune   miss dor to lady mary hush   lady m a loss at play  to miss dor  i beg your pardon but it was out before you said hush   sir geo ah maria will you still risk your own and my happiness   miss dor your happiness and mine sir  i beg you will not place them so near to each other   sir geo mine is so firmly fixed on you it can only exist in yours   lady m then when she is married to mr bronzely you will be happy because she will be so   sir geo bronzely has he dared   miss dor have not you dared sir   lady m but i believe mr bronzely is the most daring of the two  aside to sir geo  take care of him exit   sir geo miss dorrillon i will not affront you by supposing that you mean seriously to receive the addresses of mr bronzely but i warn you against giving others who know you less than i do occasion to think so   miss dor i never wish to deceive any one  i do admit of mr bronzelys addresses   sir geo why he is the professed lover of your friend lady mary or granting he denies it and that i even pass over the frivolity of the coxcomb still he is unworthy of you   miss dor he says the same of you and half a dozen more say exactly the same of each other if you like i will discard every one of you as unworthy but if i retain you i will retain the rest which do you choose   sir geo i submit to any thing rather than the total loss of you  but remember that your felicity    miss dor felicity felicity  ah that is a word not to be found in the vocabulary of my sensations  sighing   sir geo i believe you and have always regarded you with a compassion that has augmented my love in your infancy deprived of the watchful eye and anxious tenderness of a mother the manly caution and authority of a father misled by the brilliant vapor of fashion surrounded by enemies in the garb of friends  ah do you weep blessed blessed be the sign  suffer me to dry those tears i have caused and to give you a knowledge of true felicity   miss dor recovering i am very angry with myself  dont i beg tell mr norberry or mr mandred you saw me cry  they will suppose i have been move indiscreet stifling her tears than i really have for in reality i have nothing    sir geo do not endeavor to conceal from me what my tender concern for you has given me the means to become acquainted with i know you are plunged in difficulties by your father neither sending nor coming as you once expected i know you are still deeper plunged by your fondness for play   miss dor very well sir proceed   sir geo thus then  suffer me to send my steward to you this morning he shall regulate your accounts and place them in a state that shall protect you from further embarrassment till your father sends to you or protect you from his reproaches should he arrive   miss dor sir george i have listened to your detail of vices which i acknowledge with patience with humility  but your suspicion of those which i have not i treat with pride with indignation   sir geo how suspicion   miss dor what part of my conduct sir has made you dare to suppose i would extricate myself from the difficulties that surround me by the influence i

of your mind   mr norberry goes off  lord priory and sir william come forward lady m oh my lord priory i really find all the accounts i have heard of your education for a wife to be actually true  and i cannot help laughing to think if you and i had chanced to have married together what a different creature you most likely would have made of me to what i am at present   lord pri yes and what a different creature you most likely would have made of me to what i am at present   sir will lady priory i am not accustomed to pay compliments or to speak my approbation even when praise is a just tribute but your virtues compel me to an eulogium that wise submission to a husband who loves you that cheerful smile so expressive of content and that plain dress which indicates the elegance as well as the simplicity of your mind are all symbols of a heart so unlike to those which the present fashion of the day has misled      miss dor why look so steadfastly on me mr mandred do you pretend to see my heart   sir will have you any   miss dor yes one large enough to hold  even my enemy   enter servant ser mr bronzely   miss dor show him into the other room exit servant come lady priory we must introduce you to mr bronzely he is one of the most fashionable agreeable pleasant whimsical unthinking and spirited creatures in all the world you will be charmed    lady pri i dare say it is

lady m upon my word my lord your plan of management has made your wife unfit for company   lord pri so much more sit to be a wife   lady m she is absolutely fatigued with hard labor  for shame  how does household drudgery become her hand   lord pri much better than cards and dice do yours   exit lady mary followed by lord priory  sir william is left on the stage alone sir will she has a heart large enough to receive her enemy  and by that enemy she means her father he sits down and shows marks of inquietude   enter sir george evelyn sir geo i beg your pardon mr mandred  i hope i dont interrupt you  i only wished to speak to miss dorrillon   sir will she is just gone into the next room   sir geo to the concert   sir will are not you invited   sir geo yes but before i go in i wish to know who are the company  can you tell whether  a mr bronzeley is there   sir will i know he is   sir geo are you acquainted with him   sir will i have met him here frequently   sir geo and are you certain he is here at present   sir will i have reason to be certain   sir geo any particular reason   sir will your mistress when his name was announced went out to him exclaiming he was the most charming and accomplished man in the world   sir geo greatly agitated she loves him sir  i have reason to believe  to know she loves him thus she gives up my happiness and her own to gratify the vanity of a man who has no real regard for her but whose predominant passion is to enjoy the villainous name of a general seducer   sir will rising why do you suffer it   sir geo hush dont repeat what i have said or i lose her for ever i am at present under her resentment and have just sent into the next room to ask if she were there to speak with her   enter miss dorrillon miss dor and is it possible i was sent for by you   sir geo dont be offended that i should be uneasy and come to atone    miss dor i cannot forgive you sir it is impossible going   sir geo you pardon those maria who offend you more   sir will but an ungrateful mind always prefers the unworthy   miss dor ah mr mandred are you there playfully and have you undertaken to be sir georges counsel if you have i believe he must lose his cause to sit you for the tender task of advocate in love  have you ever been admitted an honorable member of that court have you with all that solemn wisdom of which you are master studied ovid as our great lawyers study blackstone if you have  show cause  why plaintiff has a right to defendants heart   sir will a man of fortune of family and of character ought at least be treated with respect and with honor   miss dor you mean to say that if a is beloved by b why should not a be constrained to return bs love counselor for defendant  because moreover and besides b who has a claim on defendants heart there are also c d e f and g all of whom put in their separate claims  and what in this case can poor a do she is willing to part and divide her love share and share alike but b will have all or none so poor a must remain a by herself a   sir geo do you think i would accept a share of your heart   miss dor do you think i could afford to give it you all besides says defendants counselor i will prove that plaintiff b has no heart to give defendant in return  he has indeed a pulsation on the left side but as it never beat with any thing but suspicion and jealousy in the laws of love it is not termed admitted or considered a heart going   sir geo where are you going   miss dor to the musicroom to be sure and if you follow me it shall be to see me treat every person there better than yourself  and mr bronzely whom you hate to see me treat him best of all exit   sir geo i must follow you though to death exit   sir will fool and yet am i nearly as weak as he is else why do i linger in this house why feed my hopes with some propitious moment to waken her to repentance why still anxiously wish to ward off some dreaded fate  if we would marry sir george now  if she would give me only one proof of discretion i think i would endeavor to take her to my heart   enter mr bronzely in great haste bron my dear sir will you do me the greatest favor in the world  you must do it in an instant too do my dear sir ask no question but lend me your coat for a single moment and take mine  only for a moment  i cannot explain my reasons now my impatience is so great  but the instant you have complied i will inform you of the whole secret and you will for ever rejoice that you granted my request pulling off his coat   sir will aside with great scorn and this very contemptible fellow is the favored lover of my daughter  i will  after a struggle  yes  i will make myself master of his secret  it may possibly concern her  my child  my childs safety may depend upon it   bron dear mr mandred no time is to be lost   sir will this is rather a strange request mr bronzely however your fervency convinces me you must have some very forcible reason  there is my coat sir gives it him   bron thank you dear sir  a thousand times  this goodness i shall ever remember  this binds me to you for ever  putting it on thank you sir a thousand times bowing dressed and composed   sir will after putting on the other coat and now sir explain the cause of this metamorphosis  let me have the satisfaction to know what advantage will accrue from it and in what i have to rejoice   bron will you promise me not to reveal the secret if i trust you with it   sir will would you add conditions after the bargain is made i must know your secret instantly   threatening bron then i will disclose it to you voluntarily and rely on your honor to keep it   sir will attentively well sir   bron hark i thought i heard somebody coming   offers to go sir will i insist upon the information laying hold of him   bron well then sir  well  you shall  you shall  then sir  in the small gallery which separates the musicroom from the rest of these apartments  in that little gallery the lamp is just unfortunately gone out  i was as unfortunately coming along when the whisking of a womans gown made me give a sudden start  i found a person was in the gallery with me and in the dark   sir will well sir   bron and so confidently assuring myself that it was miss dorrillons waitingmaid or lady marys waitingmaid i most unluckily clasped my arms around her and took one kiss   sir will only one   bron thre might be half a dozen i wnt  end to swear  dozen before i knew who she was my rapidity would not let her breathe at first and she was fairly speechless  but the moment she recovered her breath she cried villian whoever you are you shall repent this  i found it was the voice of a lady to whom i had just been introduced in the concertroom one lady priory it seems she  to bed at the tune we unhappily met   sir will but what has this to do with your coat   bron a great deal sir  you will find a great deal  as i perceived she did not know me i carefully held my tongue  but she with her prudish notions called help and murder on which i flew to the door to get away before the lights could be brought  she slew after me and as i went out exclaimed dont hope to conceal yourself i shall know you among the whole concertroom for i carry scissors hanging at my side and i have cut a piece off your coat sir william looks hastily at his coal  on which bronzely holds up the part cut  and sure enough so she had   sir will in anger and what sir am i to have the disgrace     bron either you or i must   sir will and do you dare    bron consider my dear sir how much less the fault is if perpetrated by you than by me this is the first offense of the kind which i dare say you have committed this many a year and it will be overlooked in you but i have been suspected of two or three things of the same sort within a very short time and i should never be forgiven   sir will nor ought you to be forgiven  it would be scandalous in me to connive    bron but would it not be more scandalous to reveal the secret of a person who confided in you  who flew to you in distress as his friend the partner of his cares   sir will your impertinence to me but more your offense to a woman of virtue deserves punishment yet i think the punishment of death in the way that a man of my lord priorys temper might inflict it much too honorable for you deserts so i save your life for some less creditable end i lend you my coat to disgrace you by existence and will go to my chamber and put on another myself passes bronzely in order to retire to his chamber   enter lord priory meeting him sir william starts bron going up to lord priory ah my lord is the concert over charming music that solo was divine   sir william steals to a chair and sits down to hide his coat lord priory after looking inquisitively at bronzelys dress it is time the concert should be over  it had been better it had never begun for there have been very improper persons admitted in great anger   bron affecting surprise indeed   lord pri trembling with rage i am at a loss how to act draws a chair with violence and places himself down by sir william  sir william appears disconcerted and uneasy but if i could find the man to whom this piece of cloth belongs    bron what this small piece of woollen cloth   lord pri yes then i should know how to act in the mean time mr mandred as i know you are a great admirer of my wife sir william starts and a grave prudent man of honor i come to ask your advice how i am the most likely to find out the villain who has dared to insult her for a gross insult she has received from one of mr norberrys visitors wearing a coat of which this is a part   bron the villain no doubt stole out of the house immediately   lord pri i ordered the street door to be guarded that instant  and you mr bronzely are now the last man whose habit i have examined   bron and you see i am perfectly whole turning round   lord pri i do see  i do see sir william moves about on his chair and appears greatly embarrassed lord priory starts up in a violent passion  sir william starts up with him   lord pri i will find him out if he is on earth  i will find him out if  my passion carries me away  i have not coolness to detect him myself  i will employ another  i will send oliver in search oliver calling oliver here oliver why dont you answer when you are called you stupid dull idle

put both my lord and my lady priory in the greatest terror grief and rage   sir will rising i am out of all patience the malicious depravity of persons in a certain sphere of life is not to be borne with firmness and solemnity lady mary  mr bronzely    bron in a half whisper to him go away  dont expose yourself  steal out the room  take my advice and go tobed  hide yourself so great is my respect for you i would not have you detected for the world   sir will i am going to retire sir i would not throw my friends house into confusion and broils therefore i am as well pleased not to be detected as you can be goes to the door then turns but before i quit the room i am irresistibly impelled to say  mr bronzely lady mary while you continue to ridicule all that is virtuous estimable dignified your vices most assuredly will plunge you into that very disgrace    enter oliver and places the piece of cloth against sir william s coat oli it is as exact a match as ever was  it fits to a thread

were the offender   bron i i indeed  no if i could have been tempted to offend any woman in this house in a similar manner it could have been none but you   bowing lady m no bronzely no i have been too partial to you to have any remaining claims  hark dont i hear lord priorys voice in a dreadful rage   bron then oliver has accused him what shall i do to prevent mischief dear lady mary as it is not proper for me to stay here any longer uninvited do you run and try to pacify my lord priory tell him mandred does not sleep here tonight and in the morning you are sure he will make an apology   lady m i will do as you desire  but i know mr mandred so well that i am sure he will not   exit bron then i will for him early in the morning i will wait on lady priory and beg pardon in his name without his knowing it yes i have got poor mandred into a difficulty and it is my duty to get him out of it and then i shall not only serve him but have one interview more with that heavenly woman exit   act iii scene i an apartment at mr norberrys enter mr bronzely followed by a servant bronzely looking at his watch i am early i know but lady priory is the only person i wish to see is my lord

pray heaven she may bless me with her sight never was so enchanted by a woman in my life and never was played such a trick in my life i am half inflamed by love and half by spite once more to attempt her   enter lady priory  he bows most respectfully  she curtsies bron lady priory i am come  i am come upon rather an awkward yet a very serious business it was my misfortune to be among that company yesterday evening where an unworthy member of it had the insolence to offer an affront to your resplendent virtue    lady pri   i have some household accounts to arrange and breakfast to make for my lord as soon as he leaves his chamber therefore if you please sir proceed to the business on which you came without thinking it necessary to interrupt it by any compliment to me   bron i will be concise madam  in a word i wait upon you from mr mandred with the most humble apology for his late conduct which he acknowledges to have been indecorous and unwarrantable but he trusts that in consequence of the concession which i now make for him the whole matter will from this hour be buried in oblivion   lady pri going to the side of the scene and speaking if my lord is at leisure tell him there is a gentleman would be glad to speak with him  to bronzely i am sorry sir you should know so little of the rules of our family as to suppose that i could give an answer upon any subject in which my husband condescends to be concerned going   bron lady priory stop you can at least use your power to soften lord priorys resentment and unless this apology is accepted a challenge must follow and possibly he may fall   lady pri possibly sighing   bron you are interested for your husbands life   lady pri certainly but i set equal value on his reputation going   bron hear me one sentence more  i cannot part from her aside oh i have something of such importance to communicate to you  and yet  i know not how   lady pri then tell it to my husband   bron hem hem aside oh lady priory if the insult of last night has given you offense should you not wish to be informed of a plan laid for yet greater violence she starts   lady pri good heaven   bron this is neither time nor place to disclose what i wish to say  nor do i know how to find an opportunity to speak with you alone free from the possibility of intrusion where i could reveal a secret to you which is connected with your happiness with your future peace   lady pri you alarm me beyond expression i am going to my own house about twelve oclock for a couple of hours  follow me there   bron and i shall be admitted   lady pri certainly  for you have excited my curiosity and i am all impatience to hear what you have to communicate that so much concerns me   bron promise then no person but yourself shall ever know of it she hesitates unless you promise this i dare not trust you   lady pri after a second hesitation i do promise i promise faithfully   bron your word is sacred i rely   lady pri most sacred   bron and you promise that no one but yourself shall know of the appointment we have made now at your house nor of the secret which i will then disclose to you   lady pri i promise faithfully that no one but myself shall ever know of either   bron remember then to be there alone exactly    lady pri at one oclock   bron and that your servants have orders to show me to you   lady pri i am too much interested to forget one circumstance   bron go now then to lord priory with mr mandreds apology  and urge his acceptance of it with all that persuasion by which you are formed to govern while you appear to obey   lady pri i will present the apology as i received it from you but do not imagine i dare give my opinion upon it unless i am desired   bron but if you are desired you will then say    lady pri exactly what i think exit   bron i will do a meritorious act this very day this poor woman lives in slavery with her husband i will give her an opportunity to run away from him when we meet i will have a postchaise waiting a few doors from her house boldly tell her that i love her and  enter miss dorrillon  my dear miss dorrillon i could not sleep all night but am come thus early on purpose to complain of your treatment of me during the whole of yesterday evening not one look did you glance toward me  and there i sat in miserable solitude up in one corner the whole time of the concert   miss dor i protest i did not see you  and stranger still never thought of you   bron you then like another better than you do me   miss dor i do   bron do you tell him so   miss dor no   bron you tell him you like me the best   miss dor yes   bron then i will believe what you say to him not what you say to me  and though you charge me with inconstancy yet i swear to you my beloved maria taking her hand that no woman no woman but yourself    enter sir william and starts at seeing his daughter in such close conversation with bronzely sir will aside how familiar  my eyes could not be shocked with a sight half so wounding to my heart as this   bron apart to miss dorrillon hush you have heard the story but dont laugh at him now he is in a devilish ill humor and it will all fall on me go away  it is a very good story but laugh at him another time   miss dor i dont believe a word of the story yet as a received opinion it is a charming weapon for an enemy and i long to use it   bron not now not now  because i have some business with him and twill put him out of temper he hands her to the door exit miss dorrillon   sir will looking steadfastly after her poor girl poor girl i am not yet sufficiently enraged against her not to compassionate her for her choice  is this the man who is to be for life her companion her protector   bron well mr mandred i believe i have settled it   sir will settled what anxiously   bron at least i have done all in my power to serve you perhaps you dont know that mr oliver divulged the whole affair but i have waited on my lady priory and i do believe i have settled it with her to manage it so with my lord that every thing shall be hushed up you may expect a few jests among your female acquaintance and a few epigrams in the newspapers but i verily believe every thing material is safe  is there any farther satisfaction which you demand from me   sir will not at present  a man is easily satisfied who possesses both courage and strength to do himself right whenever he feels his wrongs oppressive i have as yet found but little inconvenience from the liberties you have taken with me and what just at this time far more engages my attention than revenge is an application to you for intelligence without farther preface do you pay your addresses to the young lady who lives in this house   bron yes i do sir  i do   sir will you know i suppose which of the two ladies i mean   bron which ever you mean sir it is all the same for i pay my addresses to them both   sir w starting to them both   bron i always do   sir will and pray which of them do you love   bron both sir   upon my word both  i assure you both   sir will but you dont intend to marry both   bron i dont intend to marry either and indeed the woman whom i love best in the world has a husband already do you suppose i could confine my affections to lady mary or miss dorrillon after lady priory appeared do you suppose i did not know who it was i met last night in the dark wherever i visit mr mandred i always make love to every woman in the house and i assure you they all expect it  i assure you sir they all expect it   sir william walks about in anger bron have you any further commands for me   sir will yes one word more  and you really have no regard for this girl who parted from you as i came in   bron oh yes pardon me  i admire i adore i love her to distraction and if i had not been so long acquainted with my lady mary nor had seen my lady priory last night i should certainly call sir george evelyn to an account for being so perpetually with her   sir will anxiously do you think he loves her   bron yes i dare say as well as i do   sir will do you think she likes him   bron i think she likes me   sir will but with your method of affection she may like him too   bron she may she may  in short there is no answering for what she likes  all whim and flightiness  acquainted with every body  coquetting with every body  and in debt with every body her mind distracted between the claims of lovers and the claims of creditors  the anger of mr norberry and the want of intelligence from he father   sir will she is in a hopeful way   bron oh it would be impossible to think of marrying her in her present state  for my part i cannot  and i question whether sir george would  but if her father comes home and gives her the fortune that was once expected why then i may possibly marry her myself   sir will firmly she will never have any fortune  i come from india lately you know and you may take my word her father is not coming over nor will he ever come   bron are you sure of that   sir will very sure   bron then keep it a secret  dont tell her so  poor thing it would break her heart she is doatingly fond of her father   sir will hah how  oh no she can have no remembrance of him   bron not of his person perhaps but he has constantly corresponded with her sent her presents and affectionate letters  and you know a womans heart is easily impressed   sir will i never heard her mention her father   bron not to you  but to us who are kind to her she talks of him continually she cried bitterly the other day when the last ship came in and there was no account of him   sir will did she did she eagerly aye i suppose she is alarmed lest he should be dead and all his fortune lost   bron no i believe her affection for him is totally unconnected with any interested views i have watched her upon that head and i believe she loves her father sincerely   sir will wiping a tear from his eye i believe it does not matter whom she loves   bron by the bye she hates you   sir will i thought so   bron yes you may be satisfied of that yes she even quarrelled with me the other day for speaking in your favor you had put her in a passion and she said no one that loved her ought to have any respect for you   sir will i am much obliged to her  very much obliged to her did she say nothing more   bron only that you were illnatured dogmatic cruel and insolent nothing more  and say what she will against you you know you can be even with her   sir will yes i can be even with her and i will be even with her   enter lord priory and takes bronzely on one side lord pri i have accepted this mans apology  i will not call him to a serious account but he shall not escape every kind of resentment  i am resolved to laugh at him to turn the whole affair into mirth and good humor at the same time to gall him to the heart good morning mr mandred  let me go violently to bronzely i must joke with him   bron but neither your voice nor your looks agree with your words   lord pri mr mandred i did intend to be angry  but it would give too respectable an air to a base act on  and so i am come to laugh at you enter lady mary and i am sure lady mary will join even me in laughing at this man of gallantry   lady m oh i am absolutely afraid to come near the tarquin   sir will you need not lady mary for there can be no tarquin without a lucretia   lord pri however mr mandred it is proper i should tell you i accept the apology you have made but at the same time    sir will hastily what do you mean my lord i have made no apology   bron yes yes you have  i called and made one for you   sir will made an apology for me you have just gone one step too far then i insist    bron drawing sir william on one side i will  i will  i will set every thing to rights it would be base in me if i did not and i will turns to lord priory and lady mary yes mr mandred i will retrieve your character at the expense of my own i am more able to contend with the frenzy of a jealous husband than you are  enter miss dorrillon and sir george evelyn  i am happy to see you  you are just come in time to hear me clear the grave the respectable character of my friend mr mandred and to stigmatize my own  my lord vent all your anger and your satire upon me it was i pray believe me i beg you will dont doubt my word it was i who committed the offense of which my friend the man i respect and reverence stands accused  it was i who offended my lady priory and then    lord pri it cannot be   i will not believe you   lady m but how generous and noble in him to take it upon himself   bron to sir william there what can i do more you see they will not believe me  tell me what i can do more can i do any thing more  my feelings are wounded on your account more than on my own and compel me though reluctantly to quit the room exit   sir geo i am at a loss which to admire most the warmth of mr bronzelys friendship or the coldness of mr mandreds gratitude   lady m oh if it were not for that happy steadiness of feature he could not preach rectitude of conduct as he does   lord pri going up to sir william eloquent admonisher of youth   miss dor going to him indeed my rigid monitor i cannot but express admiration that under those austere looks and that sullen brow there still should lurk    sir will have a care  dont proceed  stop where you are  dare not you complete a sentence that is meant to mock me  i have borne the impertinence of this whole company with patience with contempt but dare you to breathe an accent suspicious of my conduct and i will instantly teach you how to respect me and to shrink with horror from yourself she stands motionless in surprise   lord pri what a passion he is in compose yourself mr mandred   miss dor i protest mr mandred    sir will raising his voice dare not to address yourself to me   lady m did you ever hear the like  and i vow she looks awed by him   lord pri how strange that a man cannot command his temper   sir geo mr mandred permit me to say i have ever wished to treat you with respect  nor would i be rash in laying that wish aside  yet i must now take upon me to assure you that if you think to offend every lady in this house with impunity you are mistaken   sir will sir george if you mean to frighten me by your threats i laugh at you  but if your warmth is really kindled and by an attachment to that unworthy object pointing to miss dorrillon i only pity you   sir geo insufferable  going up to him  instantly make an atonement for what you have said or expect the consequence   sir will and pray sir george what atonement does your justice demand   sir geo retract your words  acknowledge you were grossly deceived when you said miss dorrillon was unworthy   sir will retract my words   sir geo were they not unjust  is it a reproach that enveloped in the maze of fashionable life she has yet preserved her virtue unsuspected that encumbered with the expenses consequent to her connections she has proudly disdained even from me the honorable offer of pecuniary aid that her fond hope still fixes on the return of an absent parent whose blessing she impatiently expects and that i should have watched her whole conduct with an eye of scrutinizing jealousy and yet have only beheld that which makes me aspire as the summit of earthly happiness to become her husband   sir will young man i admire your warmth with great fervor and affection there is much compassion and benevolence and charity in sometimes mistaking the vicious for the virtuous and if in the heat of contention i have said a word reflecting on your character i am ready to avow my error and before this company to beg your pardon   sir geo that is not enough sir  taking miss dorrillon by the hand and leading her forward  you must ask this ladys pardon   sir william starts and turns his face away strongly impressed sir will ask her pardon though i forgive some insults i will not this  ask her pardon    miss dor nay nay sir george you have no business with mr mandreds quarrels and mine  reserve your heroic courage for some nobler purpose than a poor womans reputation   sir geo point out a nobler and i will give up this   lady m there is none so noble and i wish sir george you would undertake to vindicate mine   lord pri come lady mary let us retire and leave these two irritable men to themselves   lady m come maria let us leave them alone he will teach mr mandred to be civil for the future   miss dor in great agitation dear madam i would not leave them alone for the world   lady m then my lord you and i will they have no offensive weapons so we may venture to leave them   lord pri this comes of being too warm in conversation this comes of being in a passion   exeunt lord priory and lady mary sir geo while there is a female present i have only to say  good morning mr mandred going   miss dor catching hold of him for once i give up my pride to soften yours come do not look thus determined  i am sure mr mandred did not mean to offend me the words he made use of fell from his lips by accident   sir will they did not  i meant them  i mean them still  and i repeat them   miss dor to sir william now how can you be so provoking  nay hold sir george he offers to go you shall not go away with that frowning brow she draws him gently toward sir william then takes sir william s hand nor you with yours  come shake hands for my sake  now as i live sir george mr mandreds hand feels warmer and kinder than yours  he tries to draw it back but he has not the heart sir william snatches it away as by compulsion  thou art a strange personage  thou will not suffer me either to praise or dispraise thee  come sir george make up this difference  for if you were to fight and mr mandred was to fall    sir will what then   miss dor why i could better spare a better man   sir will how   miss dor i see you are both sullen both obstinate and i have but one resource  sir george if you aspire to my hand dare not to lift yours against mr mandred he and i profess to be enemies but if i may judge of his feelings by my own we have but passing enmities  i bear him no malice nor he me i dare be sworn therefore sir lift but your arm against him or insult him with another word and our intercourse is for ever at an end   exit sir george and sir william stand for some time silent sir geo why is it in the power of one woman to make two men look ridiculously   sir will i am at a loss to know sir whether you and i part friends or enemies  however call on me in the way you best like and you will find me ready to meet you either as an enemy or as a friend exeunt separately   act iv scene i a hall in lord priorys two servants discovered sitting  another enters first servant do you hear mr porter you are to admit no person but mr bronzely     d ser mr bronzely  very well  a loud rapping  and there i suppose he is     st ser looking through the window yes that i believe is his carriage  to third ser  let my lady know exit third sir   enter bronzely bron you are sure lady priory is at home     st ser yes sir and gave orders to admit nobody but you   bron has she been some time at home     st ser yes sir i dare say my lady came from mr norberrys half an hour ago   bron waiting for me half an hour  aside  show me to her instantly   exit following the servant hastily scene ii an apartment at lord priorys enter bronzely and lady priory on opposite sides bron my dear lady priory how kind you are not to have forgotten your promise   lady pri how was it possible i should i have been so anxious for the intelligence you have to communicate that it was pain to wait till the time arrived   bron thus invited encouraged to speak i will speak boldly  and i call heaven to witness that what i am going to say     lady pri no stay a moment longer  dont tell me just yet  listening toward the side of the scenes  for i wish him to hear the very beginning   bron who hear the very beginning   enter lord priory  bronzely starts lord pri i have not kept you waiting i hope my lawyer stopped me on business or i should have been here sooner  my dear mr bronzely  going up to him  i thank you a thousand times for the interest you take in my concerns and i come prepared with proper coolness and composure to hear the secret with which you are going to entrust us   bron the secret  yes sir  the secret which i was going to disclose to my lady priory  ha ha ha  but my lord i am afraid it is of too frivolous a nature for your attention   lord pri i account nothing frivolous which concerns my wife   bron certainly my lord certainly not   lord pri besides she told me it was of the utmost importance did not you angrily   lady pri he said so   bron and so it was  it was of importance then  just at the very time i was speaking to lady priory on the subject   lady pri you said so but this very moment   lord pri come come tell it immediately whatever it is come let us hear it  after waiting some time why sir you look as if you were ashamed of it what can be the meaning of this   bron to be plain my lord my secret will disclose the folly of a person for whom i have a sincere regard   lord pri no matter  let every fool look like a fool and every villain be known for what he is  tell your story   lady pri how can you deprive me of the pleasure you promised you said it would prevent every future care   lord pri explain sir i begin to feel myself not quite so composed as i expected you never perhaps saw me in a passion  she has  and if you were once to see me really angry    bron then my lord i am apt to be passionate too  and i boldly tell you that what i had to reveal though perfectly proper was meant for lady priory alone to hear i entreated your ladyship not to mention to my lord that i had any thing to communicate and you gave me a solemn promise you would not   lady pri upon my honor during our whole conversation upon that subject you never named my lord priorys name   bron i charged you to keep what i had to tell you a profound secret   lady pri yes but i thought you understood could have no secrets from my husband   bron you promised no one should know it but yourself   lady pri he is myself   lord pri how mr bronzely did you suppose she and i were two perhaps you did and that we wanted a third well i quite forgive you for your silly mistake and laugh at you ha ha ha as i did at mandred  seriously  did you suppose sir we lived like persons of fashion of the modern time did you imagine that a woman of her character could have a wish a desire even a thought a secret from her husband   bron it is amazing to find so much fidelity the reward of tyranny   lady pri sir  i speak with humility  i would not wish to give offense  timidly  but to the best of my observation and understanding your sex in respect to us are all tyrants i was born to be the slave of some of you  i make the choice to obey my husband   lord pri yes mr bronzely and i believe it is more for her happiness to be my slave than your friend  to live in fear of me than in love with you  lady priory leave the room   exit lady priory lord pri do you see  did you observe the glow of truth and candor which testifies that womans faith and do you not blush at having attempted it call me a tyrant where are the signs oh if every married man would follow my system in the management of his wife every impertinent lover would look just as foolish as you   bron this is all boasting my lord  you live in continual fear  for without meaning any offense to lady priorys honor you know you dare not trust her for one hour alone with any man under sixty   lord pri i dare trust her at any time with a coxcomb   bron that is declaring i am not one  for i am certain you dare not trust her alone with me   lord pri in a passion yes with fifty such   bron but not with one  you are right  it might be dangerous   lord pri angrily no it would not   bron significantly yes it would   lord pri have not you had a trial   bron but you were present you constantly follow all her steps watch all she says and does but i believe you are right  wives are not to be trusted   lord pri mine is   bron no my dear lord priory you must first become gentle before you can positively confide in her affection  before you can trust her in a house or in any place alone   lord pri hastily to prove you are mistaken i will instantly go back to my friend norberrys and leave you here to tell her the secret you boasted pay your addresses to her if that is the secret  you have my free consent   bron my dear friend i will accept it   lord pri ay i see you have hopes of supplanting me by calling me your friend  but can you conceive now that she will men to you   bron you have given me leave to try and cannot recall it   lord pri but depend upon it you will meet with some terrible humiliation   bron either you or i shall   lord pri i shall laugh to hear you tumbled down stairs   bron you are not to remain on the watch here you are to return to mr norberrys   lord pri was that the bargain   bron dont you remember you said so   lord pri well if that will give you any satisfaction    bron  it will give me great satisfaction   lord pri heaven forgive me but your confidence makes me laugh ha ha ha   bron and yours makes me laugh ha ha ha   enter oliver lord pri hah what brings you here oliver lady priory and i are only come home for a few hours   oli i know it my lord i thought nevertheless i might be wanted   bron and so you are good mr oliver your lord desires you to conduct me to your lady in the next room and acquaint her it is with his permission i am come to conclude the conversation which was just now interrupted  is not that right my lord are not those words exactly corresponding with your kind promise   lord pri i believe they are   oli i am to take mr bronzely to my lady and tell her you sent him exit oliver   bron now this is a perfect fashion and while i step to lady priory do you go and comfort my intended wife lady mary   lord pri i hate the fashion  and were i not sure you would now be received in a very unfashionable manner    bron no rough dealings i hope   lord pri oh you begin to be afraid do you   bron no   but i have met with an accident or two lately  and i am not so well acquainted with ancient usages as to know in

prove in what contempt i held the accusation i left them together and bid him make love to her   lady m is that possible   lord pri i cannot say i would have done so rash an action had i been married to some women  to you for instance  but i have not a doubt of lady priorys safety her mind i know is secure and i have servants in the house to protect her from personal outrage the only fear is lest he should have received one for it is now near two hours looking at his watch since i came away and i have neither seen nor heard any thing of either of them  but to your ladyships concerns   lady m i

that  i love you   lady pri do you assert lord priory sent you to me for this   bron i assert that in triumph at your betraying to him our private appointment he gave me leave to have a second trial

by heaven she looks so respectable in that employment i am afraid to insult her after a struggle with himself ah dont you fear me   lady pri no  for your fears will protect me  i have no occasion for my own   bron what have i to fear   lady pri you fear to lounge no more at routs at balls at operas in bondstreet no more to dance in circles chat in side boxes or roar at taverns for you have observed enough upon the events of life to know  that an atrocious offense like violence to a woman never escapes condign punishment   bron oh for once let your mind be feminine as your person  hear

your folly then and take me home hastily   bron can you wish to go back to the man who has made this trial of your fidelity and not resent his conduct   lady pri most assuredly i wish to return but if you deliver me safe perfectly safe from farther insult it will be impossible for me not to show resentment to lord priory   bron why only in that case   lady pri because only in that case you will make an impression on my heart  and i will resent his having exposed me to such a temptation   bron oh ill take you home directly   this moment  i make an impression on your heart william  calling  i

mind   ser the chaise is ready now sir for the postboy was going back without unharnessing his horses   bron then tell him he must perform his journey in half an hour  if he is a moment longer my resolution will stop on the road exit servant i feel my good designs stealing away already  now they are flying rapidly take lady priorys hand  please to look another way  i shall certainly recant if

have known it was in vain to send for me have not i repeatedly declared that till i heard from your father you should receive nothing more from me than a bare subsistence i promise to allow you thus much even in this miserable place but do not indulge a hope that i can release you from it she weeps  he goes to the door  then returns i forgot to mention that mr mandred goes on board tomorrow for india and little as you may think of his sensibility he seems concerned at the thought of quitting england without just bidding you farewell he came with me hither  shall i send him up   miss dor oh no for heavens sake deliver me from his asperity as you would save me from distraction   mr nor nay it is for the last time  you had better see him you may be sorry perhaps you did not when he is gone   miss dor no no i shall not be sorry  go and excuse me  go and prevent his coming i cannot see him exit mr norberry this would be aggravation of punishment to shut me in a prison and yet not shelter me from the insults of the world   enter sir william  she starts sir will  i know you have desired not to be troubled with my visit and i come with all humility  i do not come be assured to reproach you   miss dor unexpected mercy   sir will no though i have watched your course with anger yet i do not behold its end with triumph   miss dor it is not to your honor that you think it necessary to give this statement of your mind   sir will may be  but i never boasted of perfection though i can boast of grief that i am so far beneath it i can boast too that though i frequently give offense to others i could never part with any one for ever as i now shall with you without endeavoring to make some atonement   miss dor you acknowledge then your cruelty to me   sir will i acknowledge i have taken upon me to advise beyond the liberty allowed by custom to one who has no apparent interest or authority  but not to repeat what has passed i come with the approbation of your friend mr norberry to make a proposal to you for the future he draws chairs and they sit   miss dor what proposal  what is it eagerly   sir will mr norberry will not give either his money or his word to release you  but as i am rich  have lost my only child  and wish to do some good with my fortune i will instantly lay down the money of which you are in want upon certain conditions   miss dor do i hear right is it possible i can find a friend in you  a friend to relieve me from the depth of misery oh mr mandred   sir will before you return thanks hear the conditions on which i make the offer   miss dor any conditions  what you please   sir will you must promise never never to return to your former follies and extravagancies she looks down do you hesitate do you refuse  will not you promise   miss dor i would willingly  but for one reason   sir will and what is that   miss dor the fear i should not keep my word   sir will you will if your fear be real   miss dor it is real  it is even so great that i have no hope   sir will you refuse my offer then and dismiss me rises   miss dor rising also with much reluctance  but i cannot indeed i cannot make a promise unless i were to feel my heart wholly subdued and my mind entirely convinced that i should never break it  sir i am most sincerely obliged to you for the good which i am sure you designed me but do not tempt me with the proposal again  do not place me in a situation that might add to all my other afflictions the remorse of having deceived you   sir will after a pause well i will dispense with this condition  but there is another i must substitute in its stead  resolve to pass the remainder of your life some few ensuing years at least in the country she starts do you start at that   miss dor i do not love the country i am always miserable while i am from london besides there are no follies or extravagancies in the country  dear sir this is giving me up the first condition and then forcing me to keep it   sir will there madam taking out his pocketbook i scorn to hold out hopes and then destroy them there is a thousand pounds free of all conditions she takes it  extricate yourself from this situation and be your own mistress to return to it when you please going   miss dor oh my benefactor bid me farewell at parting  do not leave me in anger   sir will how will you dictate terms to me while you reject all mine   miss dor then only suffer me to express my gratitude    sir will i will not heat you going   miss dor then hear me on another subject a subject of much importance  indeed it is   sir will well   miss dor you are going to india immediately  it is possible that there or at some place you will stop at on your way you may meet with my father   sir will well   miss dor you have heard that i have expected him home for some time past and that i still live in hopes    sir will well  anxiously   miss dor if you should see him and should be in his company  dont mention me   sir will not mention you   miss dor at least not my indiscretions  oh i should die if i thought he would ever know of them   sir will do you think he would not discover them himself should he ever see you   miss dor but he would not discover them all at once  i should be on my guard when he first came  my ill habits would steal on him progressively and not be half so shocking as if you were to vociferate them all in a breath   sir will to put you out of apprehension at once  your father is not coming home  nor will he ever return to his own country   miss dor starting you seem to speak from certain knowledge  oh heavens is he not living   sir will yes living  but under severe affliction  fortune has changed and all his hopes are blasted   sir will fortune changed  in poverty  my father in poverty  weeping  oh

search out my father and let him be the object of your beneficence  forces it into his hand  i shall be happy in this prison indeed i shall so i can but give a momentary relief to my dear dear father  sir william takes out his handkerchief  you weep  this present perhaps would be but poor alleviation of his sufferings  perhaps he is in sickness or a prisoner oh if he is release me instantly and take me with you to the place of his confinement   sir will what quit the joys of london   miss dor on such an errand i would quit them all without a sigh  and here i make a solemn promise to you

better then my carriage is at the door you will follow us   exeunt leading off miss dorrillon sir will follow you  yes and i perceive that in spite of philosophy justice or resolution i could follow

lady from grosvenorstreet  my compliments to sir george i am that lady intimately acquainted with him and entreat he will walk up exit the man this is a most fortunate incident in my tragedy sir george no doubt takes me for miss dorrillon yet i am sure he is too much the man of gallantry and good breeding to leave me in this place although he visits me by mistake   sir george evelyn speaking as he enters sir geo madam you are free  the doors of the prison are open  my word is passed for the  he stops in surprise   lady m curtsying sir george i am under the most infinite obligation words are too poor to convey the sense i have of this act of friendship  but i trust my gratitude will for ever    sir geo confused madam  really  i ought to apologize for the liberty i have taken   lady m no liberty at all sir george  at least no apology is necessary  i insist on hearing no excuses a virtuous action requires no preface no prologue no ceremony  and surely if one action be more noble and generous than another it must be that one where an act of benevolence is conferred and the object an object of total indifference to the liberal benefactor  generous man good evening call me a coach going   sir geo stay madam  i beg leave to say    lady m  not a word  i will not hear a word  my thanks shall drown whatever you have to say   enter the former man sir geo pray sir did not you tell me you had a very young lady under your care   man yes sir so i had  but she it seems has just been released and is gone away with the gentleman who paid the debt   lady m do you mean miss dorrillon   man i mean the other lady from grosvenor street   sir geo who can have released her   lady m some friend of mine i dare say by mistake  well if it is so she is extremely welcome to the good fortune which was designed for me for my part i could not submit to an obligation from every one  scarcely from any one  and from no one with so little regret as i submit to it from sir george evelyn exit curtsying   sir geo distraction the first disappointment is nothing to this second to the reflection that miss dorrillon has been set at liberty by any man on earth except myself exit   scene iv an apartment at mr norberrys enter lord priory lord pri what a situation is mine i cannot bear solitude and am ashamed to see company i cannot bear to think on the ungrateful woman and yet i can think of nothing else it was her conduct which i imagined had alone charmed me but i perceive her power over my heart though that conduct is changed   enter mr norberry sir william and miss dorrillon mr nor my dear lord priory exert your spirits to receive and congratulate a friend of mine sir william dorrillon presenting him father to this young woman whose failings he has endeavored to correct under the borrowed name of mandred   sir will and with that fictitious name i hope to disemburthen myself of the imputation of having ever offered an affront to my lord priory he takes lord priory aside and they talk together   enter sir george evelyn sir geo is it possible what i have heard is true was it mr mandred who has restored miss dorrillon to the protection of mr norberry   sir will coming

will teach him humility   lord pri i am humble lady mary and own i have had a better opinion of your sex than i ought to have had   lady m you mean of your management of us of your instructions restrictions and corrections   enter servant ser lady priory and mr bronzely   lady m what of them   ser they are here   lord pri i said she would preserve her fidelity did not i always say so have i wavered once did i not always tell you all that she was only making game of bronzely did i not tell you all so   enter bronzely and lady priory bron then indeed my lord you said truly for i return the arrantest blockhead    lord pri i always said you would but how is it where have you been what occasion for a postchaise instantly explain or i shall forfeit that dignity of a husband to which in those degenerate times i have almost an exclusive right   bron to reinstate you my lord in those honors i accompany lady priory and beg public pardon for the opinion i once publicly professed of your want of influence over her affections   lord pri do you hear do you all hear lady mary do you hear   bron taking advantage of your permission to call on her by stratagem i induced her to quit your house lest restraint might there act as my enemy  but your authority your prerogative your honor attached to her under my roof she has held those rights sacred and compelled even me to revere them   lord pri do you all hear i was sure it would turn out so   lady m this is the first time i ever knew the gallants word taken for a womans honor   lord pri i will take her own word  the tongue which for eleven years has never in the slightest instance deceived me i will believe upon all occasions my dear wife boldly pronounce before this company that you return to me with the same affection and respect and the selfsame contempt for this man  to bronzely  you ever had a short pause   lady m she makes no answer   lord pri hush hush she is going to speak  another pause  why why dont you speak   lady pri because i am at a loss what to say   lady m hear hear hear  do you all hear   lord pri can you be at a loss to declare you hate mr bronzely   lady pri i do not hate him   lady m i was sure it would turn out so   lord pri can you be at a loss to say you love me   she appears embarrassed lady m she is at at a loss   lord pri how dont you fear me   lady pri yes   lady m she speaks plainly to that question   lord pri you know i love truth  speak plainly to all their curiosity requires   lady pri since you command it then my lord  i confess that mr bronzelys conduct toward me has caused a kind of sentiment in my heart     lord pri hah what   lady m you must believe her  she has told you truth for eleven years   lady pri a sensation which    lord pri stop  any truth but this i could have borne  reflect on what you are saying  consider what you are doing  are these your primitive manners   lady pri i should have continued those manners had i known none but primitive men but to preserve ancient austerity while by my husbands consent i am assailed by modern gallantry would be the task of a stoic and not of his female slave   lady m do you hear do you all hear my lord do you hear   lord pri i do  i do  and though the sound distracts me i cannot doubt her word   lady pri it gives me excessive joy to hear you say so because you will not then doubt me when i add that gratitude for his restoring me so soon to you is the only sentiment he has inspired   lord pri then my management of a wise is right after all   mr nor mr bronzely as your present behavior has in great measure atoned for your former actions i will introduce to your acquaintance my friend sir william dorrillon   bron mandred sir william dorrillon   sir will and considering sir that upon one or two occasions i have been honored with your confidence  you will not be surprised if the first command i lay upon my daughter is  to take refuge from your pursuits in the protection of sir george
