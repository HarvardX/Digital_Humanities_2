the royal vision in an ode to peace by henry jones author of the earl of essex kew garden etc  dublin printed for william watson bookseller at the poets heads in capelstreet  m dcc lxiii  the royal vision the mighty god of armies bows his ear to wailing mankinds moan the lord of hosts from heaven looks down no more with awful eye severe he hears the bleeding nations groan he sees the vanquished fall the victor frown he turns aside his face by pity touched and godlike grace he calls britannias guardian angel loud go quell the sanguine and assuage the proud thy glorious lot on yonder orb below that globe shall rule my laurel there shall grow arrest the rapid bolt beat down the mortal steel for man laid waste my tender mercies feel he said and pointed to the blessed around the gasping soldier and the gushing wound with human nature fainting on the ground the blessed themselves seemed sad that space and begged that mankind might have peace go forth my strength thy mighty wings outspread yon crimson guilty banners tread beneath the foot of peace he said and sheath oh sheath the murderous sword this olive from thy radiant wing that near my mercyseat still grows in georges breast make joyful spring and with it wast my world creating word let famine pestilence and slaughter cease it is my command give weeping europe peace and let her angry kings no more be foes with loud hosannas heavens eternal concave rung and halleluiahs to the god of peace were sung the obedient angel cleaves the ethereal skies to georges downy pillow straight he flies when balmy slumbers closed his happy eyes and on the organs of his fancy wrought the inmost fibers of his feeling heart with mystic sketch divine angelic trace before his melting mental eye he spread the sick the wounded dying and the dead the burning city sacked the raging battle fought in hideous groupes by form creating art with all the barbarous mischiefs that deface the works of god since cain his brother slew he placed before his visionary view the infant sprawling on the soldiers spear or clinging to the murdered mothers breast whose face retains a tenderness in death what heart of flesh a sight like this can bear see for her babe she looks even now distressed her swelling sorrows seem to give her breath how agonizing fear her features fix lest with her flowing blood her milk should mix the venerable sire see by the hoary hairs athwart the pavement dragged that floats in blood the dagger through the matrons bosom thrust who twixt the murderer and her husband stood the screaming daughter mad her tresses tears when ravished at her gasping mothers feet whilst fury blood and lust polute each guilty street as if some fiend had snatched the love of kind and hell itself was lodged within the human mind there mines and caves of death their entrails burst at one infernal blast one horrid blow accursed see limbs and heads of men and bodies fly like whirling feathers scattered through the frighted sky there wrapped in smoke in sulphur stench and fire whole armies in the astonished air expire but those alas are scenes of single woe behold vast empires fall at one destructive blow  the king lamented inly as he slept with tender throbs for murdered mankind wept when straight before his eye the angel placed those human fiends that lay all nature waste ambition in the guilty front was there who tortures heaven and earth and sea and air and tyranny with smiling frown whose iron rod seems decked in down discord in human gore deep died with fire and water at her side her hostile visage with itself at war inverted eyes that glare and horrid brows that jar and bigotry in meek disguise with daggerd hand and upcast eyes and envy daughter of despair with palid lip and ghastly air who copies from tormented fiends her face the pest of hell and bane of human race and pride that parent of the infernal crew with haughty eye askance and sanguine hue all these were martiald in their dread array and horrid attributes before his eye the monarch startled as in sleep he lay and from his inmost soul upheavd a sigh the angel now with power serene all gracious changed the horrid scene a milder vision gently drew the kings of europe in his view with lifted hands and bended knees imploring peace he pitying sees the christian virtues all around were kneeling near him on the ground religion mounted mild up to her sacred place sublime she rose awful with heavenly grace that whiterobd queen of sweet command still near his bestlovd throne and heart would stand the cross erect in one seraphic hand she held before the royal eye his love immense that would for mankind die a precious crown by purest virtue won richer than rubies brighter than the sun where twice ten thousand various gems unite their trembling rays in one celestial light her other hand divine holds up to view the horrid vices dazzled at the glorious sight sunk down at once to hells eternal night whilst ravaged realms and sea and air look new bid mankind smile whom heaven ordains to bind europas bleeding veins religion said bid discord cease and open wide the gates of peace call back that precious dove my son proceed complete the god like work behold thy glorious meed with seraphs throned thy diadem shall shine this crown to all eternity is thine let christian kings in christian leagues agree and give the human heart to god and me  the king bid europes prostrate monarchs rise whilst tears of pity from his flowing eyes ran trickling down his crimson cheek religion made him mild and meek and half his soul consented he bad the weeping world rejoice with intellectual voice and every manly faculty relented caesar himself might now give over conquest has her fill a christian monarch should do more forbear the christian blood to spill let glory hide her guilty rays be mercy now my highest praise let me my foes forgive arise ye vanquished monarchs rise  and live  the social angel when by pity pressed that moment lodged the heavenly olive in his breast and filled his heart with clemency and grace the king awoke he willed and all was peace  henry jones
