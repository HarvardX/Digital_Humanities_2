the riot or half a loaf is better than no bread in a dialogue between jack anvil and tom hod to the tune of a cobbler there was etc tom come neighbors no longer be patient and quiet come let us go kick up a bit of a riot i am hungry my lads but i have little to eat so well pull down the mills and seize all the meat i will give you good sport boys as ever  saw so a fig for the justice a fig for the law derry down  then his pitchfork tom seized  hold a moment says jack i will show thee thy blunder brave boy in a crack and if i dont prove we had better be still i will assist thee straitway to pull down every mill i will show thee how passion thy reason does cheat or i will join thee in plunder for bread and for meat derry down what a whimsey to think thus our bellies to fill for we stop all the grinding by breaking the mill what a whimsey to think we shall get more to eat by abusing the butchers who get us the meat what a whimsey to think we shall mend our spare diet by breeding disturbance by murder and riot derry down because i am dry twould be foolish i think to pull out my tap and to spill all my drink because i am hungry and want to be fed that is sure no wise reason for wasting my bread and just such wise reasons for mending their diet are used by those blockheads who rush into riot derry down i would not take comfort from others distresses but still i would mark how god our land blesses for though in old england the times are but sad abroad i am told they are ten times as bad in the land of the pope there is scarce any grain and it is still worse they say both in holland and spain derry down let us look to the harvest our wants to beguile see the lands with rich crops how they every where smile mean time to assist us by each western breeze some corn is brought daily across the salt seas well drink little tea no whisky at all but patiently wait and the prices will fall derry down but if we are not quiet then let us not wonder if things grow much worse by our riot and plunder and let us remember whenever we meet the more ale we drink boys the less we shall eat on those days spent in riot no bread you brought home had you spent them in labor you must have had  derry down a dinner of herbs says the wise man with quiet is better than beef amid discord and riot if the thing cannot be helped i am a foe to all strife and pray for a peace every night of my life but in matters of state not an inch will i budge because i conceive i am no very good judge derry down but though poor i can work my brave boys with the best let the king and the parliament manage the rest i lament both the war and the taxes together though i verily think they dont alter the weather the king as i take it with very good reason may prevent a bad law but cannot help a bad season derry down the parliament men although great is their power yet they cannot contrive us a bit of a shower and i never yet heard though our rulers are wise that they know very well how to manage the skies for the best of them all as they found to their cost were not able to hinder last winters hard frost derry down besides i must share in the wants of the times because i have had my full share in it is crimes and i am apt to believe the distress which is sent is to punish and cure us of all discontent  but harvest is coming  potatoes will come our prospect clears up ye complainers be dumb derry down and though i have no money and though i have no lands i have a head on my shoulders and a pair of good hands so i will work the whole day and on sundays i will seek at church how to bear all the wants of the week the gentlefolks too will afford us supplies they will subscribe  and they will give up their puddings and pies derry down then before i am induced to take part in a riot i will ask this short question  what shall i get by it so i will even wait a little till cheaper the bread for a mittimus hangs over each rieters head and when of two evils i am asked which is best i would rather be hungry than be hanged i protest derry down quoth tom thou art right if i rise i am a turk so he threw down his pitchfork and went to his work z  pth printed by r
