page  0  the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire chap xvii foundation of constantinople  political system of constantine and his successors  military discipline  the palace  the finances the unfortunate licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness and the last captive who adorned the triumph of constantine after a tranquil and prosperous reign the conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the roman empire a new capital a new policy and a new religion and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations the age of the great constantine and his sons is filled with important events but the historian must be oppressed by their number and variety unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time he will describe the political institutions that gave strength and stability to the empire before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline he will adopt the division unknown to the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs the victory of the christians and their intestine discord will supply copious and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal  after the defeat and abdication of licinius design of a new capital his victorious rival proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in future times a d     the mistress of the east and to survive the empire and religion of constantine the motives whether of pride or of policy which first induced diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of government had acquired additional weight by the example of his successors and the habits of forty years rome was insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her supremacy and the country of the caesars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince born in the neighborhood of the danube educated in the courts and armies of asia and invested with the purple by the legions of britain the italians who had received constantine as their deliverer submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people of rome but they were seldom honored with the presence of their new sovereign during the vigor of his age constantine according to the various exigencies of peace and war moved with slow dignity or with active diligence along the frontiers of his extensive dominions and was always prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy but as he gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne in the choice of an advantageous situation he preferred the confines of europe and asia to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between the danube and the tanais to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the persian monarch who indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty with these views diocletian had selected and embellished the residence of nicomedia but the memory of diocletian was justly abhorred by the protector of the church and constantine was not insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name during the late operations of the war against licinius he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate both as a soldier and as a statesman the incomparable position of byzantium and to situation of byzantium observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against an hostile attack whilst it was accessible on every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse many ages before constantine one of the most judicious historians of antiquity polybius l iv p     edit casaubon he observes that the peace of the byzantines was frequently disturbed and the extent of their territory contracted by the inroads of the wild thracians had described the advantages of a situation from whence a feeble colony of greeks derived the command of the sea and the honors of a flourishing and independent republic the navigator byzas who was styled the son of neptune founded the city     years before the christian era his followers were drawn from argos and megara byzantium was afterward rebuilt and fortified by the spartan general pausanias see scaliger animadvers ad eusebius p    ducange constantinopolis l i part i cap       with regard to the wars of the byzantines against philip the gauls and the kings of bithynia we should trust none but the ancient writers who lived before the greatness of the imperial city had excited a spirit of flattery and fiction   if we survey byzantium in the extent which it description of constantinople acquired with the august name of constantinople the figure of the imperial city may be represented under that of an unequal triangle the obtuse point which advances toward the east and the shores of asia meets and repels the waves of the thracian bosphorus the northern side of the city is bounded by the harbor and the southern is washed by the propontis or sea of marmara the basis of the triangle is opposed to the west and terminates the continent of europe but the admirable form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot without a more ample explanation be clearly or sufficiently understood  the winding channel through which the waters the bolphorus of the euxine flow with a rapid and incessant course toward the mediterranean received the appellation of bosphorus a name not less celebrated in the history than in the fables of antiquity the bosphorus has been very minutely described by dionysius of byzantium who lived in the time of domitian hudson geograph minor tom iii and by gilles or gyllius a french traveller of the xvith century tournefort lettre xv seems to have used his own eyes and the learning of gyllius  a crowd of temples and of votive altars profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks attested the unskilfulness the terrors and the devotion of the grecian navigators who after the example of the argonauts explored the dangers of the inhospitable euxine on these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of phineus infested by the obscene harpies there are very few conjectures so happy as that of le clerc bibliotheque universelle tom i p     who supposes that the harpies were only locusts the syriac or phaenician name of those insects their noisy flight the stench and devastation which they occasion and the north wind which drives them into the sea all contribute to form this striking resemblance  and of the sylvan reign of amycus who defied the son of leda to the combat of the cestus the residence of amycus was in asia between the old and the new castles at a place called laurus insana that of phineus was in europe near the village of mauromole and the black sea see gyllius de bosph l ii c    tournefort lettre xv  the streights of the bosphorus are terminated by the cyanean rocks which according to the description of the poets had once floated on the face of the waters and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the euxine against the eye of profane curiosity the deception was occasioned by several pointed rocks alternately covered and abandoned by the waves at present there are two small islands one toward either shore that of europe is distinguished by the column of pompey  from the cyanean rocks to the point and harbor of byzantium the winding length of the bosphorus extends about sixteen miles the ancients computed one hundred and twenty stadia or fifteen roman miles they measured only from the new castles but they carried the streights as far as the town of chalcedon  and its most ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half the new castles of europe and asia are constructed on either continent upon the foundations of two celebrated temples of serapis and of jupiter urius the old castles a work of the greek emperors command the narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite banks advance within five hundred paces of each other these fortresses were restored and strengthened by mahomet the second when he meditated the siege of constantinople ducas hist c    leunclavius hist turcia musulmanica l xv p     under the greek empire these castles were used as state prisons under the tremendous name of lethe or towers of oblivion  but the turkish conqueror was most probably ignorant that near two thousand years before his reign darius had chosen the same situation to connect the two continents by a bridge of boats darius engraved in greek and assyrian letters on two marble columns the names of his subjectnations and the amazing numbers of his land and sea forces the byzantines afterward transported these columns into the city and used them for the altars of their tutelar deities herodotus l iv c     at a small distance from the old castles we discover the little town of chrysopolis or scutari which may almost be considered as the asiatic suburb of constantinople the bosphorus as it begins to open into the propontis passes between byzantium and chalcedon the latter of those cities was built by the greeks a few years before the former and the blindness of its founders who overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast has been stigmatized by a proverbial expression of contempt namque artissimo inter europam asiamque divortio byzantium in extrema europa posuere graeci quibus pythium apollinem consulentibus ubi conderent urbem redditum oraculum est quaererent sedem caecorum terris adversam ea ambage chalcedonii monstrabantur quod priores illuc advecti praevisa locorum utilitate pejora legissent tacit annal xii      the harbor of constantinople which may be the port considered as an arm of the bosphorus obtained in a very remote period the denomination of the golden horn the curve which it describes might be compared to the horn of a stag or as it should seem with more propriety to that of an ox strabo l x p     most of the antlers are now broke off or to speak less figuratively most of the recesses of the harbor are filled up see gyllius de bosphoro thracio l i c    the epithet of golden was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of constantinople the river lycus formed by the conflux of two little streams pours into the harbor a perpetual supply of fresh water which serves to cleanse the bottom and to invite the periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess as the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas the constant depth of the harbor allows goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats and it has been observed that in many places the largest vessels may rest their prows against the houses while their sterns are floating in the water procopius de aedificiis l i c   his description is confirmed by modern travelers see thevenot part i l i c    tournefort lettre xii niebuhr voyage darabie p     from the mouth of the lycus to that of the harbor this arm of the bosphorus is more than seven miles in length the entrance is about five hundred yards broad and a strong chain could be occasionally drawn across it to guard the port and city from the attack of an hostile navy see ducange c p l i part i c    and his observations sur villehardouin p     the chain was drawn from the acropolis near the modern kiosk to the tower of galata and was supported at convenient distances by large wooden piles   between the bosphorus and the hellespont the the propontis shores of europe and asia receding on either side enclose the sea of marmara which was known to the ancients by the denomination of propontis the navigation from the issue of the bosphorus to the entrance of the hellespont is about one hundred and twenty miles those who steer their westward course through the middle of the propontis may at once descry the high lands of thrace and bithynia and never lose sight of the lofty summit of mount olympus covered with eternal snows thevenot voyages au levant part i l i c    contracts the measure to     small greek miles belon observations l ii c   gives a good description of the propontis but contents himself with the vague expression of one day and one nights sail when sandys travels p    talks of   0 furlongs in length as well as breadth we can only suppose some mistake of the press in the text of that judicious traveller  they leave on the lest a deep gulf at the bottom of which nicomedia was seated the imperial residence of diocletian and they pass the small islands of cyzicus and proconnesus before they cast anchor at gallipoli where the sea which separates asia from europe is again contracted into a narrow channel  the geographers who with the most skilful the hellespont accuracy have surveyed the form and extent of the hellespont assign about sixty miles for the winding course and about three miles for the ordinary breadth of those celebrated streights see an admirable dissertation of m danville upon the hellespont or dardanelles in the memoires de lacademie des inscriptions tom xxviii p          yet even that ingenious geographer is too fond of supposing new and perhaps imaginary measures for the purpose of rendering ancient writers as accurate as himself the stadia employed by herodotus in the description of the euxine the bosphorus etc l iv c    must undoubtedly be all of the same species but it seems impossible to reconcile them either with truth or with each other  but the narrowest part of the channel is sound to the northward of the old turkish castles between the cities of cestus and abydus it was here that the adventurous leander braved the passage of the flood for the possession of his mistress the oblique distance between sestus and abydus was thirty stadia the improbable tale of hero and leander is exposed by m mahudel but is defended on the authority of poets and medals by m de la nauze see the academie des inscriptions tom vii hist p    mem p   0  it was here likewise in a place where the distance between the opposite banks cannot exceed five hundred paces that xerxes imposed a stupendous bridge of boats for the purpose of transporting into europe an hundred and seventy myriads of barbarians see the seventh book of herodotus who has erected and elegant trophy to his own fame and to that of his country the review appears to have been made with tolerable accuracy but the vanity first of the persians and afterward of the greeks was interested to magnify the armament and the victory i should much doubt whether the invaders have ever outnumbered the men of any country which they attacked  a sea contracted within such narrow limits may seem but ill to deserve the singular epithet of broad which homer as well as orpheus has frequently bestowed on the hellespont but our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature the traveller and especially the poet who sailed along the hellespont who pursued the windings of the stream and contemplated the rural scenery which appeared on every side to terminate the prospect insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea and his fancy painted those celebrated streights with all the attributes of a mighty river flowing with a swift current in the midst of a woody and inland country and at length through a wide mouth discharging itself into the aegean or archipelago see woods observations on homer p   0 i have with pleasure selected this remark from an author who in general seems to have disappointed the expectation of the public as a critic and still more as a traveller he had visited the banks of the hellespont he had read strabo he ought to have consulted the roman itineraries how was it possible for him to confound ilium and alexandria troas observations p   0     two cities which were sixteen miles distant from each other  ancient troy demetrius of scepsis wrote sixty books on thirty lines of homers catalogue the xiiith book of strabo is sufficient for our curiosity  seated on an eminence at the foot of mount ida overlooked the mouth of the hellespont which scarcely received an accession of waters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the simois and scamander the grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore from the sigaean to the rhaetean promontory and the flanks of the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of agamemnon the first of those promontories was occupied by achilles with his invincible myrmidons and the dauntless ajax pitched his tents on the other after ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride and to the ingratitude of the greeks his sepulcher was erected on the ground where he had defended the navy against the rage of jove and of hector and the citizens of the rising town of rhaeteum celebrated his memory with divine honors strabo l xiii p     the disposition of the ships which were drawn upon dry land and the posts of ajax and achilles are very clearly described by homer see iliad ix   0  before constantine gave a just preference to the situation of byzantium he had conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated spot from whence the romans derived their fabulous origin the extensive plain which lies below ancient troy toward the rhaetean promontory and the tomb of ajax was first chosen for his new capital and though the undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed through the streights of the hellespont zosim l ii p  0  sozomen l ii c   theophanes p    nicephorus callistus l vii p    zonaras tom ii l xiii p   zosimus places the new city between ilium and alexandria but this apparent difference may be reconciled by the large extent of its circumference before the foundation of constantinople thessalonica is mentioned by cedrenus p     and sardica by zonaras as the intended capital they both suppose with very little probability that the emperor if he had not been prevented by a prodigy would have repeated the mistake of the blind chalcedonians   we are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of constantinople which appears to have been formed by nature for the advantages of constantinople center and capital of a great monarchy situated in the fortyfirst degree of latitude the imperial city commanded from her seven hills pococks description of the east vol ii part ii p     his plan of the seven hills is clear and accurate that traveller is seldom so satisfactory  the opposite shores of europe and asia the climate was healthy and temperate the soil fertile the harbor secure and capacious and the approach on the side of the continent was of small extent and easy defense the bosphorus and the hellespont may be considered as the two gates of constantinople and the prince who possessed those important passages could always shut them against a naval enemy and open them to the fleets of commerce the preservation of the eastern provinces may in some degree be ascribed to the policy of constantine as the barbarians of the euxine who in the preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the mediterranean soon desisted from the exercise of piracy and despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier when the gates of the hellespont and bosphorus were shut the capital still enjoyed within their spacious enclosure every production which could supply the wants or gratify the luxury of its numerous inhabitants the seacoasts of thrace and bithynia which languish under the weight of turkish oppression still exhibit a rich prospect of vineyards of gardens and of plentiful harvests and the propontis has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible store of the most exquisite fish that are taken in their stated seasons without skill and almost without labor see belon observations c      among a variety of different species the pelamides a sort of thunnies were the most celebrated we may learn from polybius strabo and tacitus that the profits of the fishery constituted the principal revenue of byzantium  but when the passages of the streights were thrown open for trade they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches of the north and south of the euxine and of the mediterranean whatever rude commodities were collected in the forests of germany and scythia as far as the sources of the tanais and the borysthenes whatsoever was manufactured by the skill of europe or asia the corn of egypt and the gems and spices of the farthest india were brought by the varying winds into the port of constantinople which for many ages attracted the commerce of the ancient world see the eloquent description of busbequius epistol i p    est in europa habet in conspectu asiam aegyptum africamque a dextra quae tametsi contiguae non sunt maris tamen navigandique commoditate veluti junguntur a sinistra vero pontus est euxinus etc   the prospect of beauty of safety and of foundation of the city wealth united in a single spot was sufficient to justify the choice of constantine but as some decent mixture of prodigy and fable has in every age been supposed to reflect a becoming majesty on the origin of great cities datur haec venia antiquitati ut miscendo humana divinis primordia urbium augustiora faciat t live in proem  the emperor was desirous of ascribing his resolution not so much to the uncertain counsels of human policy as to the infallible and eternal decrees of divine wisdom in one of his laws he has been careful to instruct posterity that in obedience to the commands of god he laid the everlasting foundations of constantinople he says in one of his laws pro commoditate urbis quam aeterno nomine jubente deo donavimus cod theodos l xiii tit v leg    and though he has not condescended to relate in what manner the celestial inspiration was communicated to his mind the defect of his modest silence has been liberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding writers who describe the nocturnal vision which appeared to the fancy of constantine as he slept within the walls of byzantium the tutelar genius of the city a venerable matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities was suddenly transformed into a blooming maid whom his own hands adorned with all the symbols of imperial greatness the greeks theophanes cedrenus and the author of the alexandrian chronicle confine themselves to vague and general expressions for a more particular account of the vision we are obliged to have recourse to such latin writers as william of malmsbury see ducange c p l i p        the monarch awoke interpreted the auspicious omen and obeyed without hesitation the will of heaven the day which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the romans with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a generous superstition see plutarch in romul tom i p    edit bryan among other ceremonies a large hole which had been dug for that purpose was filled up with handfuls of earth which each of the settlers brought from the place of his birth and thus adopted his new country  and though constantine might omit some rites which savoured too strongly of their pagan origin yet he was anxious to leave a deep impression of hope and respect on the minds of the spectators on foot with a lance in his hand the emperor himself led the solemn procession and directed the line which was traced as the boundary of the destined capital till the growing circumference was observed with astonishment by the assistants who at length ventured to observe that he had already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city i shall still advance replied constantine till he the invisible guide who marches before me thinks proper to stop philostorgius l ii c   this incident though borrowed from a suspected writer is characteristic and probable  without presuming to investigate the nature or motives of this extraordinary conductor we shall content ourselves with the more humble task of describing the extent and limits of constantinople see in the memoirs de lacademie tom xxxv p          a dissertation of m danville on the extent of constantinople he takes the plan inserted in the imperium orientale of banduri as the most complete but by a series of very nice observations he reduces the extravagant proportion of the scale and instead of   00 determines the circumference of the city as consisting of about   00 french toises   in the actual state of the city the palace and extent gardens of the seraglio occupy the eastern promontory the first of the seven hills and cover about one hundred and fifty acres of our own measure the seat of turkish jealousy and despotism is erected on the foundations of a grecian republic but it may be supposed that the byzantins were tempted by the convenience of the harbor to extend their habitations on that side beyond the modern limits of the seraglio the new walls of constantine stretched from the port to the propontis across the enlarged breadth of the triangle at the distance of fifteen stadia from the ancient fortification and with the city of byzantium they enclosed five of the seven hills which to the eyes of those who approach constantinople appear to rise above each other in beautiful order codinus antiquitat constable p    he assigns the church of st antony as the boundary on the side of the harbor it is mentioned in ducange l iv c   but i have tried without success to discover the exact place where it was situated  about a century after the death of the founder the new buildings extending on one side up the harbor and on the other along the propontis already covered the narrow ridge of the sixth and the broad summit of the seventh hill the necessity of protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the barbarians engaged the younger theodosius to surround his capital with an adequate and permanent enclosure of walls the new wall of theodosius was constructed in the year     in     it was thrown down by an earthquake and rebuilt in three months by the diligence of the prefect cyrus the suburb of the blachernae was first taken into the city in the reign of heraclius ducange constable l i c  0     from the eastern promontory to the golden gate the

patricians had once been the first of the romans to form a body of nobles whose influence may restrain while it secures the authority of the monarch would have been very inconsistent with the character and policy of constantine but had he seriously entertained such a design it might have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify by an arbitrary edict an institution which must expect the sanction of time and of opinion he revived indeed the title of patricians but he revived it as a personal not as an hereditary distinction they yielded only to the transient superiority of the annual consuls but they enjoyed the preeminence over all the great officers of state with the most familiar access to the person of the prince this honorable rank was bestowed on them for life and as they

proconsuls thirtyseven by consulars five by correctors and seventyone by presidents the appellations of these magistrates were different they ranked in successive order the ensigns of their dignity

their respective districts the ponderous volumes of the codes and pandects among the works of the celebrated ulpian there was one in ten books concerning the office of a proconsul whose duties in the most essential articles were the same as those of an ordinary governor of a province would furnish ample materials for a minute enquiry into the system of provincial government as in the space of six centuries it was improved by the wisdom of the roman statesmen and lawyers it may be sufficient for the historian to select two singular and salutary provisions intended to restrain the abuse of authority   for the preservation of peace and order the governors of the provinces were armed with the sword of justice they inflicted corporal punishments and they exercised in capital offenses the power of life and death but they were not authorized to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most honorable kind of exile

independent of the authority of the magistrates about the same time that constantine gave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order he instituted in the roman empire the nice balance of the civil

consequences it was seldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province should either conspire for the disturbance or should unite for the service of their country while the one delayed to offer the assistance which the other disdained to solicit the troops very frequently remained without orders or without supplies the public safety was betrayed and the defenseless

pride of the legions whose victorious camps had so often been the scene of rebellion was nourished by the memory of their past exploits and the consciousness of their actual strength as long as they maintained their ancient establishment of six thousand men they subsisted under the reign of diocletian each of them singly a visible and important object in the military history of the roman empire a

inhabitants of both sexes and the peasants of the deserted country did not exceed the number of twenty thousand persons ammian l xix c   he observes c   that the desperate sallies of two gallic

veterans appeared with a horse they had a right to serve in the cavalry two horses gave them some valuable privileges  but as the annual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small proportion to the demands of the service levies of men were frequently required from the provinces and every proprietor was obliged either to take up arms or to procure a substitute or to purchase his exemption

any military talents were advanced without exception to the most important commands and the names of the tribunes of the counts and dukes and of the generals themselves betray a foreign origin which they no longer condescended to disguise they were often entrusted with the conduct of a war against their countrymen and though most of them preferred the ties of allegiance to those of blood they did

germany or britain had been the object of his choice the revolution of three centuries had produced so remarkable a change in the prejudices of the people that with the public approbation constantine

court diffused their delegated authority over the provinces and armies the emperor conferred the rank of illustrious on seven of his more immediate servants to whose fidelity he entrusted his safety or his counsels or his treasures   the private apartments of the palace were governed by a favorite eunuch who in the language of that age was styled the praepositus the chamberlain or prefect of the sacred bedchamber his duty was to attend the emperor in his hours of state or in those of amusement and to perform about his person all those menial services which can only derive their splendour from the influence of royalty under a prince who deserved to reign the great chamberlain for such we may call him was an useful and humble domestic but an artful domestic who improves every occasion of

history before the reign of constantine  the master of the offices he was the supreme magistrate of the palace inspected the discipline of the civil and military schools and received appeals from all parts of the empire in the causes which related to that numerous army of privileged persons who as the servants of the court had obtained for themselves and families a right to decline the authority of the ordinary judges the correspondence between the prince and his subjects was managed by the four scrinia or offices of this minister of state the first was appropriated to memorials the second to epistles the third to petitions and the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind each of these was directed by an inferior master of respectable dignity and the whole business was dispatched by an hundred and fortyeight secretaries chosen for the most part from the profession of the law on account of the variety of abstracts of reports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise of their several functions from a condescension which in former ages would have been esteemed unworthy of the roman majesty a particular secretary was allowed for the greek language and interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the barbarians but the department of foreign affairs which constitutes so essential a part of modern policy seldom diverted the attention of the master of the offices his mind was more seriously engaged by the general direction of the posts and arsenals of the empire there were thirtyfour cities fifteen in the east and nineteen in the west in which regular companies of workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive armor offensive weapons of all sorts and military engines which were deposited in the arsenals and occasionally delivered for the service of the troops   in the course of nine centuries the office of the quaestor quaestor had experienced a very singular revolution in the infancy of rome two inferior magistrates were annually elected by the people to relieve the consuls from the invidious management of the public treasure tacitus annal xi    says that the first quaestors were elected by the people sixtyfour years after the foundation of the republic but he is of opinion that they had long before that period been annually appointed by the consuls and even by the kings but this obscure

several hundred persons distributed into eleven different offices which were artfully contrived to examine and control their respective operations the multitude of these agents had a natural tendency

previous to the first day of september and by a very easy connection of ideas the word indiction was transferred to the measure of tribute which it prescribed and to the annual term which it allowed for the payment this general estimate of the supplies was proportioned to the real and imaginary wants of the state but as often as the expense exceeded the revenue or the revenue fell short of the computation an additional tax under the name of superindiction was imposed on the people and the most valuable attribute of sovereignty was communicated to the praetorian praefects who on some occasions were permitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exigencies of the public service the execution of these laws which it would be tedious to pursue in their minute and intricate detail consisted of two distinct operations the resolving the general imposition into its constituent parts which were assessed on the provinces the cities and the individuals of the roman world and the collecting the separate contributions of the individuals the cities and the provinces till the accumulated sums were poured into the imperial treasuries but as the account between the monarch and the subject was perpetually open and as the renewal of the demand anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding obligation the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution whatever was honorable or important in the administration of the revenue was committed to the wisdom of the praefects and their provincial representatives the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers some of whom depended on the treasurer others on the governor of the province and who in the inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction had frequent opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the people the laborious offices which could be productive only of envy and reproach of expense and danger were

pasture or vineyards or woods was distinctly reported and an estimate was made of their common value from the average produce of five years the numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an essential

were occasionally distributed for the use of the court of the army and of the two capitals rome and constantinople the commissioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make considerable purchases that they were strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation or from receiving in money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind in the primitive simplicity of small communities this method may be well adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude and of the utmost strictness which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud some precautions were taken see cod theod l xi tit ii and cod justinian l x tit xxvii leg       to restrain the magistrates from the abuse of their authority either in the exaction or in the purchase of corn but those who had learning enough to read the orations of cicero against verres iii de frumento might instruct themselves in all the various arts of oppression with regard to the weight the price the quality and the carriage the avarice of an unlettered governor would supply the ignorance of precept or precedent  the agriculture of the roman provinces was insensibly ruined and in the progress of despotism which tends to disappoint its own purpose the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts or the remission of tributes which their subjects were utterly incapable of paying according to the new division of italy the fertile and happy province of campania the scene of the early victories and of the delicious retirements of the citizens of rome extended between the sea and the appenine from the tyber to the silarus within sixty years after the death of constantine and on the evidence of an actual survey an exemption was granted in favor of three hundred and thirty thousand english acres of desert and uncultivated land which amounted to oneeighth of the whole surface of the province as the footsteps of the barbarians had not yet been seen in italy the cause of this amazing desolation which is recorded in the laws can be ascribed only to the administration of the roman emperors cod theod l xi tit xxviii leg   published the   th of march a d     by the emperor honorius only two months after the death of his father theodosius he speaks of     0   roman jugera which i have reduced to the english measure the jugerum contained    00 square roman feet   either from design or from accident the mode assessed in the form of a capitation of assessment seemed to unite the substance of a land tax with the forms of a capitation godefroy cod theod tom vi p     argues with weight and learning on the subject of the capitation but while he explains the caput as a share or measure of property he too absolutely excludes the idea of a personal assessment  the returns which were sent of every province or district expressed the number of tributary subjects and the amount of the public impositions the latter of these sums was divided by the former and the estimate that such a province contained so many capita or heads of tribute and that each head was rated at such a price was universally received not only in the popular but even in the legal computation the value of a tributary head must have varied according to many accidental or at least fluctuating circumstances but some knowledge has been preserved of a very curious fact the more important since it relates to one of the richest provinces of the roman empire and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the european kingdoms the rapacious ministers of constantius had exhausted the wealth of gaul by exacting twentyfive pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head the humane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to seven pieces quid profuerit julianus anhelantibus extrema penuria gallis hinc maxim claret quod primitus parts eas ingressus pro capitibus singulis tributi nomine vicenos quinos aureos reperit flagitari discedens vero septenos tantum munera universa complentes ammian l xvi c    a moderate proportion between these opposite extremes of extraordinary oppression and of transient indulgence may therefore be fixed at sixteen pieces of gold or about nine pounds sterling the common standard perhaps of the impositions of gaul in the calculation of any sum of money under constantine and his successors we need only refer to the excellent discourse of mr greaves on the denarius for the proof of the following principles   that the ancient and modern roman pound containing      grains of troy weight is about one twelfth lighter than the english pound which is composed of    0 of the same grains   that the pound of gold which had once been divided into fortyeight aurei was at this time coined into seventytwo smaller pieces of the same denomination   that five of these aurei were the legal tender for a pound of silver and that consequently the pound of gold was exchanged for fourteen pounds eight ounces of silver according to the roman or about thirteen pounds according to the english weight   that the english pound of silver is coined into sixtytwo shillings from these elements we may compute the roman pound of gold the usual method of reckoning large sums at forty pounds sterling and we may fix the currency of the aureus at somewhat more than eleven shillings  but this calculation or rather indeed the facts from whence it is deduced cannot fail of suggesting two difficulties to a thinking mind who will be at once surprised by the equality and by the enormity of the capitation an attempt to explain them may perhaps reflect some light on the interesting subject of the finances of the declining empire    it is obvious that as long as the immutable constitution of human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division of property the most numerous part of the community would be deprived of their subsistence by the equal assessment of a tax from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling revenue such indeed might be the theory of the roman capitation but in the practice this unjust equality was no longer felt as the tribute was collected on the principle of a real not of a personal imposition several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single head or share of taxation while the wealthy provincial in proportion to his fortune alone represented several of those imaginary beings in a poetical request addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the roman princes who reigned in gaul sidonius apollinaris personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster the geryon of the grecian fables and entreats the new hercules that he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting off three of his heads geryones nos esse puta monstrumque tributum hic capita ut vivam tu mihi toll tria sidon apollinar carm xiii  the reputation of father sirmond led me to expect more satisfaction than i have found in his note p     on this remarkable passage the words suo vel suorum nomine betray the perplexity of the commentator    the fortune of sidonius far exceeded the customary wealth of a poet but if he had pursued the allusion he must have painted many of the gallic nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly hydra spreading over the face of the country and devouring the substance of an hundred families ii the difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds sterling even for the average of the capitation of gaul may be rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same country as it is now governed by the absolute monarch of an industrious wealthy and affectionate people the taxes of france cannot be magnified either by fear or by flattery beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions sterling which ought perhaps to be shared among fourandtwenty millions of inhabitants this assertion however formidable it may seem is founded on the original registers of births deaths and marriages collected by public authority and now deposited in the control general at paris the annual average of births throughout the whole kingdom taken in five years from    0 to      both inclusive is         boys and         girls in all         children the province of french hainault alone furnishes   0  births and we are assured by an actual numeration of the people annually repeated from the year      to the year      that upon an average hainault contains    0   inhabitants by the rules of fair analogy we might infer that the ordinary proportion of annual births to the whole people is about   to    and that the kingdom of france contains            persons of both sexes and of every age if we content ourselves with the more moderate proportion of   to    the whole population will amount to          0 from the diligent researches of the french government which are not unworthy of our own imitation we may hope to obtain a still greater degree of certainty on this important subject  seven millions of these in the capacity of fathers or brothers or husbands may discharge the obligations of the remaining multitude of women and children yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money instead of a proportion almost four times as considerable which was regularly imposed on their gallic ancestors the reason of this difference may be found not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver as in the different state of society in ancient gaul and in modern france in a country where personal freedom is the privilege of every subject the whole mass of taxes whether they are levied on property or on consumption may be fairly divided among the whole body of the nation but the far greater part of the lands of ancient gaul as well as of the other provinces of the roman world were cultivated by slaves or by peasants whose dependent condition was a less rigid servitude cod theod l v tit ix x xi cod justinian l xi tit lxiii coloni appellantur qui conditionem debent genitali solo propter agriculturam sub dominio possessorum augustine de civitate dei l x c    in such a state the poor were maintained at the expense of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their labor and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an honorable or at least of a decent subsistence the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the high rate of their capitation the truth of this assertion may be illustrated by the following example the aedui one of the most powerful and civilized tribes or cities of gaul occupied an extent of territory which now contains above five hundred thousand inhabitants in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of autun and nevers the ancient jurisdiction of augustodunum autun in burgundy the capital of the aedui comprehended the adjacent territory of noviodunum nevers see danville notice de lancienne gaul p     the two dioceses of autun and nevers are now composed the former of   0 and the latter of   0 parishes the registers of births taken during eleven years in     parishes of the same province of burgundy and multiplied by the moderate proportion of    see messance recherches sur la population p     may authorize us to assign an average number of     persons for each parish which being again multiplied by the   0 parishes of the dioceses of nevers and autun will produce the sum of  0    0 persons for the extent of country which was once possessed by the aedui  and with the probable accession of those of chalons and macon we might derive an additional supply of  0    0 inhabitants from the dioceses of chalons cabillonum and of macon matisco since they contain the one  00 and the other   0 parishes this accession of territory might be justified by very specious reasons   chalons and macon were undoubtedly within the original jurisdiction of the aedui see danville notice p           in the notitia of gaul they are enumerated not as civitates but merely as costra   they do not appear to have been episcopal seats before the fifth and sixth centuries yet there is a passage in eumenius panegyr vet viii   which very forcibly deters me from extending the territory of the aedui in the reign of constantine along the beautiful banks of the navigable saone  the population would amount to eight hundred thousand souls in the time of constantine the territory of the aedui afforded no more than twentyfive thousand heads of capitation of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tribute eumenius in panegyr vet viii     a just analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious historian labbe du bos hist critique de la m f tom i p      that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the number of half a million and if in the ordinary administration of government their annual payments may be computed at about four millions and a half of our money it would appear that although the share of each individual was four times as considerable a fourth part only of the modern taxes of france was levied on the imperial province of gaul the exactions of constantius may be calculated at seven millions sterling which were reduced to two millions by the humanity or the wisdom of julian  but this tax or capitation on the proprietors of land would have suffered a rich and numerous class of free citizens to escape with the view capitation on trade and industry of sharing that species of wealth which is derived from art or labor and which exists in money or in merchandise the emperors imposed a distinct and personal tribute on the trading part of their subjects see cod theod l xiii tit i and iv  some exemptions very strictly confined both in time and place were allowed to the proprietors who disposed of the produce of their own estates some indulgence was granted to the profession of the liberal arts but every other branch of commercial industry was affected by the severity of the law the honorable merchant of alexandria who imported the gems and spices of india for the use of the western world the usurer who derived from the interest of money a silent and ignominious profit the ingenious manufacturer the diligent mechanic and even the most obscure retailer of a sequestered village were obliged to admit the officers of the revenue into the partnership of their gain and the sovereign of the roman empire who tolerated the profession consented to share the infamous salary of public prostitutes as this general tax upon industry was collected every fourth year it was styled the lustral contribution and the historian zosimus zosimus l ii p     there is probably as much passion and prejudice in the attack of zosimus as in the elaborate defense of the memory of constantine by the zealous dr howell hist of the world vol ii p  0 laments that the approach of the fatal period was announced by the tears and terrors of the citizens who were often compelled by the impending scourge to embrace the most abhorred and unnatural methods of procuring the sum at which their property had been assessed the testimony of zosimus cannot indeed be justified from the charge of passion and prejudice but from the nature of this tribute it seems reasonable to conclude that it was arbitrary in the distribution and extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting the secret wealth of commerce and the precarious profits of art or labor are susceptible only of a discretionary valuation which is seldom disadvantageous to the interest of the treasury and as the person of the trader supplies the want of a visible and permanent security the payment of the imposition which in the case of a land tax may be obtained by the seizure of property can rarely be extorted by any other means than those of corporal punishments the cruel treatment of the insolvent debtors of the state is attested and was perhaps mitigated by a very humane edict of constantine who disclaiming the use of racks and of scourges allots a spacious and airy prison for the place of their confinement cod theod l xi tit vii leg     these general taxes were imposed and levied by the absolute authority of the monarch but the free gifts occasional offerings of the coronary gold still retained the name and semblance of popular consent it was an ancient custom that the allies of the republic who ascribed their safety or deliverance to the success of the roman arms and even the cities of italy who admired the virtues of their victorious general adorned the pomp of his triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold which after the ceremony were consecrated in the temple of jupiter to remain a lasting monument of his glory to future ages the progress of zeal and flattery soon multiplied the number and increased the size of these popular donations and the triumph of caesar was enriched with two thousand eight hundred and twentytwo massy crowns whose weight amounted to twenty thousand four hundred and fourteen pounds of gold this treasure was immediately melted down by the prudent dictator who was satisfied that it would be more serviceable to his soldiers than to the gods his example was imitated by his successors and the custom was introduced of exchanging these splendid ornaments for the more acceptable present of the current gold coin of the empire see lipsius de magnitud romana l ii c   the tarragonese spain presented the emperor claudius with a crown of gold of seven and gaul with another of nine hundred pounds weight i have followed the rational emendation of lipsius  the spontaneous offering was at length exacted as the debt of duty and instead of being confined to the occasion of a triumph it was supposed to be granted by the several cities and provinces of the monarchy as often as the emperor condescended to announce his accession his consulship the birth of a son the creation of a caesar a victory over the barbarians or any other real or imaginary event which graced the annals of his reign the peculiar free gift of the senate of rome was fixed by custom at sixteen hundred pounds of gold or about sixtyfour thousand pounds sterling the oppressed subjects celebrated their own felicity that their sovereign should graciously consent to accept this feeble but voluntary testimony of their loyalty and gratitude cod theod l xii tit xiii the senators were supposed to be exempt from the aurum coronarium but the auri oblatio which was required at their hands was precisely of the same nature   a people elated by pride or soured by discontent conclusion are seldom qualified to form a just estimate of their actual situation the subjects of constantine were incapable of discerning the decline of genius and manly virtue which so far degraded them below the dignity of their ancestors but they could feel and lament the rage of tyranny the relaxation of discipline and the increase of taxes the impartial historian who acknowledges the justice of their complaints will observe some favorable circumstances which tended to alleviate the misery of their condition the threatening tempest of barbarians which so soon subverted the foundations of roman greatness was still repelled or suspended on the frontiers the arts of luxury and literature were cultivated and the elegant pleasures of society were enjoyed by the inhabitants of a considerable portion of the globe the forms the pomp and the expense of the civil administration contributed to restrain the irregular license of the soldiers and although the laws were violated by power or perverted by subtlety the sage principles of the roman jurisprudence preserved a sense of order and equity unknown to the despotic governments of the east the rights of mankind might derive some protection from religion and philosophy and the name of freedom which could no longer alarm might sometimes admonish the successors of augustus that they did not reign over a nation of slaves or barbarians the great theodosius in his judicious advice to his son claudian in iv consulat honorii     etc distinguishes the station of a roman prince

of constantine is considered even in the present age as an object either of satire or of panegyric by the impartial union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest admirers and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his most implacable enemies we might hope to delineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man which the truth and candor of history should adopt without a blush on

vain attempt to blend such discordant colors and to reconcile such inconsistent qualities must produce a figure monstrous rather than human unless it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights by a careful separation of the different periods of the reign of constantine  the person as well as the mind of constantine his virtues had been enriched by nature with her choicest endowments his stature was lofty his countenance majestic his deportment graceful his strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise and from his earliest youth to a very advanced season of life he preserved the vigor of his constitution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance he delighted in the social intercourse of familiar conversation and though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him the sincerity of his friendship has been suspected yet he showed on some occasions that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment the disadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just estimate of the value of learning and the arts and sciences derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of constantine in the dispatch of business his diligence was indefatigable and the active powers of his mind were almost continually exercised in reading writing or meditating in giving audience to ambassadors and in examining the complaints of his subjects even those who censured the propriety of his measures were compelled to acknowledge that he possessed magnanimity to conceive and patience to execute the most arduous designs without being checked either by the prejudices of education or by the clamours of the multitude in the field he infused his own intrepid spirit into the troops whom he conducted with the talents of a consummate general and to his abilities rather than to his fortune we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of the republic he loved glory as the reward perhaps as the motive of his labors the boundless ambition which from the moment of his accepting the purple at york appears as the ruling passion of his soul may be justified by the dangers of his own situation by the character of his rivals by the consciousness of superior merit and by the prospect that his success would enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire in his civil wars against maxentius and licinius he had engaged on his side the inclinations of the people who compared the undissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and justice which seemed to direct the general tenor of the administration of constantine the virtues of constantine are collected for the most part from eutropius and the younger victor two sincere pagans who wrote after the extinction of his family even zosimus and the emperor julian acknowledge his personal courage and military achievements   had constantine fallen on the banks of the his vices tyber or even in the plains of hadrianople such is the character which with a few exceptions he might have transmitted to posterity but the conclusion of his reign according to the moderate and indeed tender sentence of a writer of

raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimulation the general peace which he maintained during the last fourteen years of his reign a d          was a period of apparent splendour rather than of real prosperity and the old age of constantine was disgraced by the opposite yet reconcilable vices of rapaciousness and prodigality the accumulated treasures found in the palaces of maxentius and

effeminacy in the person of constantine he is represented with false hair of various colors laboriously arranged by the skilful artists of the times a diadem of a new and more expensive fashion a profusion of gems and pearls of collars and bracelets and a variegated flowing robe of silk most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold in such apparel scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of elagabalus we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged monarch and the simplicity of a roman veteran julian in the caesars attempts to ridicule his uncle his suspicious testimony is

deaths of maximian and licinius may perhaps be justified by the maxims of policy as they are taught in the schools of tyrants but an impartial narrative of the executions or rather murders which sullied the declining age of constantine will suggest to our most candid thoughts the idea of a prince who could sacrifice without reluctance the laws of justice and the feelings of nature to the dictates either of his passions or of his interest  the same fortune which so invariably followed his family the standard of constantine seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his domestic life those among his predecessors who had enjoyed the longest and most prosperous reigns augustus trajan and diocletian had been disappointed of posterity and the frequent revolutions had never allowed sufficient time for any imperial family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple but the royalty of the flavian line which had been first ennobled by the gothic claudius descended through

empress fausta that the modern greeks who adore the memory of their founder are reduced to palliate the guilt of a parricide which the common feelings of human nature forbade them to justify they pretend that as soon as the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of the accusation by which his credulity had been so fatally misled he published to the world his repentance and remorse that he mourned forty days during which he abstained from the use of the bath and all the ordinary comforts of life and that for the lasting instruction of posterity he erected a golden statue of crispus with

less exceptionable authority but if we consult the more ancient and authentic writers they will inform us that the repentance of constantine was manifested only in acts of blood and revenge and that he atoned for the murder of an innocent son by the execution perhaps of a guilty wife they ascribe the misfortunes of crispus to the arts of his stepmother fausta whose implacable hatred or whose disappointed love renewed in the palace of constantine the ancient tragedy of hippolitus and of phaedra zosimus l ii p  0  may be considered as our original the ingenuity of the moderns assisted by a

chastity of his fathers wife and easily obtained from the jealousy of the emperor a sentence of death against a young prince whom she considered with reason as the most formidable rival of her own children but helena the aged mother of constantine lamented and revenged the untimely fate of her grandson crispus nor was it long before a real or pretended discovery was made that fausta herself entertained a criminal connection with a slave belonging to the imperial stables philostorgius l ii c   zosimus l ii p  0      imputes to constantine the death of two wives of the innocent fausta and of an adulteress who was the mother of his three successors according to jerome three or four years elapsed between the death of crispus and that of fausta the elder victor is prudently silent  her condemnation and punishment were the instant consequences of the charge and the adulteress was suffocated by the steam of a bath which for that purpose had been heated to an extraordinary degree if fausta was put to death it is reasonable to believe that the private apartments of the palace were the scene of her execution the orator chrysostom indulges his fancy by exposing the naked empress on a desert mountain to be devoured by wild beasts  by some it will perhaps be thought that the remembrance of a conjugal union of twenty years and the honor of their common offspring the destined heirs of the throne might have softened the obdurate heart of constantine and persuaded him to suffer his wife however guilty she might appear to expiate her offenses in a solitary prison but it seems a superfluous labor to weigh the propriety unless we could ascertain the truth of this singular event which is attended with some circumstances of doubt and perplexity those who have attacked and those who have defended the character of constantine have alike disregarded two very remarkable passages of two orations pronounced under the succeeding reign the former celebrates the virtues the beauty and the fortune of the empress fausta the daughter wife sister and mother of so many princes julian orat i he seems to call her the mother of crispus she might assume that title by adoption at least she was not considered as his mortal enemy julian compares the fortune of fausta with that of parysatis the persian queen a roman would have more naturally recollected the second agrippina et moi qui sur le trone ai suivi mes ancetres moi fille femme soeur et mere de vos maitres   the latter asserts in explicit terms that the mother of the younger constantine who was slain three years after his fathers death survived to weep over the fate of her son monod in constantin jun c   ad calcem eutrop edit havercamp the orator styles her the most divine and pious of queens  notwithstanding the positive testimony of several writers of the pagan as well as of the christian religion there may still remain some reason to believe or at least to suspect that fausta escaped the blind and suspicious cruelty of her husband the deaths of a son and of a nephew with the execution of a great number of respectable and perhaps innocent friends interfecit numerosos amicos eutrop xx    who were involved in their fall may be sufficient however to justify the discontent of the roman people and to explain the satirical verses affixed to the palacegate comparing the splendid and bloody reigns of constantine and nero saturni aurea saecula quis requirat sunt haec gemmea sed neroniana sidon apollinar v    it is somewhat singular that these satirical lines should be attributed not to an obscure libeller or a disappointed patriot but to ablavius prime minister and favorite of the emperor we may now perceive that the imprecations of the roman people were dictated by humanity as well as by superstition zosim l ii p  0      by the death of crispus the inheritance of the the sons and nephews of constantine empire seemed to devolve on the three sons of fausta who have been already mentioned under the names of constantine of constantius and of constans these young princes were successively invested with the title of caesar and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth the twentieth and the thirtieth years of the reign of their father eusebius orat in constantin c   these dates are sufficiently correct to justify the orator  this conduct though it tended to multiply the future masters of the roman world might be excused by the partiality of paternal affection but it is not easy to understand the motives of the emperor when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people by the unnecessary elevation of his two nephews dalmatius and hannibalianus the former was raised by the title of caesar to an equality with his cousins in favor of the latter constantine invented the new and singular appellation of nobilissimus zosim l ii p     under the predecessors of constantine nobilissimus was a vague epithet rather than a legal and determined title  to which he annexed the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold but of the whole series of roman princes in any age of the empire hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title of king a name which the subjects of tiberius would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny the use of such a title even as it appears under the reign of constantine is a strange and unconnected fact which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of imperial medals and contemporary writers adstruunt nummi veteres ac singulares spanheim de usu numismat dissertat

invited by the liberality of the emperor who reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal youths in the science of government and the knowledge of mankind but the genius of constantine himself had been formed by adversity and experience in the free intercourse of private life and amidst the dangers of the court of galerius he had learned to command his own passions to encounter those of his equals and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct his destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the imperial purple incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the expectation of a throne nor would the dignity of their rank permit them to descend from that elevated station from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect the indulgence of constantine admitted them at a very tender age to share the administration of the empire and they studied the art of reigning at the expense of the people entrusted to their care the younger constantine was appointed to hold his court in gaul and his brother constantius exchanged that department the ancient patrimony of their father for the more opulent but less martial countries of the east italy the western illyricum and africa were accustomed to revere constans the third of his sons as the representative of the great constantine he fixed dalmatius on the gothic frontier to which he annexed the government of thrace macedonia and greece the city of caesarea was chosen for the residence of hannibalianus and the provinces of pontus cappadocia and the lesser armenia were designed to form the extent of his new kingdom for each of these princes a suitable establishment was provided a just proportion of guards of legions and of auxiliaries was allotted for their respective dignity and defense the ministers and generals who were placed about their persons were such as constantine could trust to assist and even to control these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power as they advanced in years and experience the limits of their authority were insensibly enlarged but the emperor always reserved for himself the title of augustus and while he showed the caesars to the armies and provinces he maintained every part of the empire in equal obedience to its supreme head eusebius l iv c       with a design of exalting the authority and glory of constantine affirms that he divided the roman empire as a private citizen might have divided his patrimony his distribution of the provinces may be collected from eutropius the two victors and the valesian fragment  the tranquillity of the last fourteen years of his reign was scarcely interrupted by the contemptible insurrection of a cameldriver in the island of cyprus calocerus the obscure leader of this rebellion or rather tumult was apprehended and burnt alive in the marketplace of tarsus by the vigilance of dalmatius see the elder victor the chronicle of jerome and the doubtful traditions of theophanes and cedrenus  or by the active part which the policy of constantine engaged him to assume in the wars of the goths and sarmatians  among the different branches of the human manners of the sarmatians race the sarmatians form a very remarkable shade as they seem to unite the manners of the asiatic barbarians with the figure and complexion of the ancient inhabitants of europe according to the various accidents of peace and war of alliance or conquest the sarmatians were sometimes confined to the banks of the tanais and they sometimes spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the vistula and the

moveable camps or cities the ordinary residence of their wives and children consisted only of large wagons drawn by oxen and covered in the form of tents the military strength of the nation was composed of cavalry and the custom of their warriors to lead in their hand one or two spare horses enabled them to advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence which surprised the security and eluded the pursuit of a distant enemy ammian l xvii c    the sarmatian horses were castrated to prevent the mischievous accidents which might happen from the noisy and ungovernable passions of the males  their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a sort of cuirass which was capable of resisting a sword or javelin though it was formed only of horses hoofs cut into thin and polished slices carefully laid over each other in the manner of scales or feathers and strongly sewed upon an undergarment of coarse linen pausanias l i p  0 edit kuhn that inquisitive traveller had carefully examined a sarmatian cuirass which was preserved in the temple of aesculapius at athens  the offensive arms of the sarmatians were short daggers long lances and a weighty bow with a quiver of arrows they were reduced to the necessity of employing fishbones for the points of their weapons but the custom of dipping them in a venomous liquor that poisoned the wounds which they inflicted is alone sufficient to prove the most savage manners since a people impressed with a sense of humanity would have abhorred so cruel a practice and a nation skilled in the arts of war would have disdained so

  he describes in the most lively colors the dress and manners the arms and inroads of the getae and sarmatians who were associated for the purposes of destruction and from the accounts of history there is some reason to believe that these sarmatians were the jazygae one of the most numerous and warlike tribes of the nation the allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a permanent establishment on the frontiers of the empire soon after the reign of augustus they obliged the dacians who subsisted by fishing on the banks of the river teyss or tibiscus to retire into the hilly country and to abandon to the victorious sarmatians the fertile plains of the upper hungary which are bounded by the course of the danube and the semicircular enclosure of the carpathian mountains the sarmatians jazygae were settled on the banks of the pathissus or tibiscus when pliny in the year    published his natural history see l iv c    in the time of strabo and ovid sixty or seventy years before they appear to have inhabited beyond the getae along the coast of the euxine  in this advantageous position they watched or suspended the moment of attack as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons and although the sarmatians did not illustrate their name by any memorable exploits they occasionally assisted their eastern and western neighbors the goths and the germans with a formidable body of cavalry they lived under the irregular aristocracy of their chieftains principes sarmatarum jazygum penes quos civitatis regimen plebem quoque et vim equitum qua sola valent offerebant tacit hist iii   this offer was made in the civil war between vitellius and vespasian  but after they had received into their bosom the fugitive vandals who yielded to the pressure of the gothic power they seem to have chosen a king from that nation and from the illustrious race of the astingi who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the northern ocean this hypothesis of a vandal king reigning over sarmatian subjects seems necessary to reconcile the goth jornandes with the greek and latin historians of constantine it may be observed that isidore who lived in spain under the dominion of the goths gives them for enemies not the vandals but the sarmatians see his chronicle in grotius p  0    this motive of enmity must have inflamed the subjects of contention which perpetually arise on the gothic war the confines of warlike and independent nations a d     the vandal princes were stimulated by fear and revenge the gothic kings aspired to extend their dominion from the euxine to the frontiers of germany and the waters of the maros a small river which falls into the teyss were stained with the blood of the contending barbarians after some experience of the superior strength and numbers of their adversaries the sarmatians implored the protection of the roman monarch who beheld with pleasure the discord of the nations but who was justly alarmed by the progress of the gothic arms as soon as constantine had declared himself in favor of the weaker party the haughty araric king of the goths instead of expecting the attack of the legions boldly passed the danube and spread terror and devastation through the province of maesia to oppose the inroad of this destroying host the aged emperor took the field in person but on this occasion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so many foreign and domestic wars he had the mortification of seeing his troops fly before an inconsiderable detachment of the barbarians who pursued them to the edge of their fortified camp and obliged him to consult his safety by a precipitate and ignominious retreat the event of a second and more successful action retrieved the honor of the roman name and the powers of art and discipline prevailed after an obstinate contest over the efforts of irregular valor the broken army of the goths abandoned the field of battle the wasted province and the passage of the danube and although the eldest of the sons of constantine was permitted to supply the place of his father a d     april  0 the merit of the victory which diffused universal joy was ascribed to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself  he contributed at least to improve this advantage by his negociations with the free and warlike people of chersonesus i may stand in need of some apology for having used without scruple the authority of constantine porphyrogenitus in all that relates to the wars and negociations of the chersonites i am aware that he was a greek of the tenth century and that his accounts of ancient history are frequently confused and fabulous but on this occasion his narrative is for the most part consistent and probable nor is there much difficulty in conceiving that an emperor might have access to some secret archives which had escaped the diligence of meaner historians for the situation and history of chersone see peyssonel des peuples barbares qui ont habit les bords du danube c xvi p      0  whose capital situate on the western coast of the tauric or crimaean peninsula still retained some vestiges of a grecian colony and was governed by a perpetual magistrate assisted by a council of senators emphatically styled the fathers of the city the chersonites were animated against the goths by the memory of the wars which in the preceding century they had maintained with unequal forces against the invaders of their country they were connected with the romans by the mutual benefits of commerce as they were supplied from the provinces of asia with corn and manufactures which they purchased with their only productions salt wax and hides obedient to the requisition of constantine they prepared under the conduct of their magistrate diogenes a considerable army of which the principal strength consisted in crossbows and military chariots the speedy march and intrepid attack of the chersonites by diverting the attention of the goths assisted the operations of the imperial generals the goths vanquished on every side were driven into the mountains where in the course of a severe campaign above an hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold and hunger peace was at length granted to their humble supplications the eldest son of araric was accepted as the most valuable hostage and constantine endeavored to convince their chiefs by a liberal distribution of honors and rewards how far the friendship of the romans was preferable to their enmity in the expressions of his gratitude toward the faithful chersonites the emperor was still more magnificent the pride of the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal decorations bestowed on their magistrate and his successors a perpetual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the black sea a regular subsidy was promised of iron corn oil and of every supply which could be useful either in peace or war but it was thought that the sarmatians were sufficiently rewarded by their deliverance from impending ruin and the emperor perhaps with too strict an economy deducted some part of the expenses of the war from the customary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation  exasperated by this apparent neglect the sarmatians expulsion of the sarmatians soon forgot with the levity of barbarians the services which they had so lately received a d     and the dangers which still threatened their safety their inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the indignation of constantine to leave them to their fate and he no longer opposed the ambition of geberic a renowned warrior who had recently ascended the gothic throne wisumar the vandal king whilst alone and unassisted he defended his dominions with undaunted courage was vanquished and slain in a decisive battle which swept away the flower of the sarmatian youth the remainder of the nation embraced the desperate expedient of arming their slaves a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen by whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat and expelled the invader from their confines but they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy more dangerous and more implacable enraged by their former servitude elated by their present glory the slaves under the name of limigantes claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had saved their masters unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of the populace preferred the hardships of exile to the tyranny of their servants some of the fugitive sarmatians solicited a less ignominious dependence under the hostile standard of the goths a more numerous band retired beyond the carpathian mountains among the quadi their german allies and were easily admitted to share a superfluous waste of uncultivated land but the far greater part of the distressed nation turned their eyes toward the fruitful provinces of rome imploring the protection and forgiveness of the emperor they solemnly promised as subjects in peace and as soldiers in war the most inviolable fidelity to the empire which should graciously receive them into its bosom according to the maxims adopted by probus and his successors the offers of this barbarian colony were eagerly accepted and a competent portion of lands in the provinces of pannonia thrace macedonia and italy were immediately assigned for the habitation and subsistence of three hundred thousand

and illuminated the forms of the court were strictly maintained every day at the appointed hours the principal officers of the state the army and the household approaching the person of their

death and funeral of constantine is contained in the fourth book of his life by eusebius   but this reign could subsist only in empty pageantry factions of the court and it was soon discovered that the will of the most absolute monarch is seldom obeyed when his subjects have no longer any thing to hope from his favor or to dread from his resentment the same ministers and generals who bowed with such reverential awe before the inanimate corpse of their deceased sovereign were engaged in secret consultations to exclude his two nephews dalmatius and hannibalianus from the share which he had assigned them in the succession of the empire we are too imperfectly acquainted with the court of constantine to form any judgment of the real motives which influenced the leaders of the conspiracy unless we should suppose that they were actuated by a spirit of jealousy and revenge against the prefect ablavius a proud favorite who had long directed the counsels and abused the confidence of the late emperor the arguments by which they solicited the concurrence of the soldiers and people are of a more obvious nature and they might with decency as well as truth insist on the superior rank of the children of constantine the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic from the discord of so many rival princes who were not connected by the tender sympathy of fraternal affection the intrigue was conducted with zeal and secrecy till a loud and unanimous declaration was procured from the troops that they would suffer none except the sons of their lamented monarch to reign over the roman empire eusebius l iv c   terminates his narrative by this loyal declaration of the troops and avoids all the invidious circumstances of the subsequent massacre  the younger dalmatius who was united with his collateral relations by the ties of friendship and interest is allowed to have inherited a considerable share of the abilities of the great constantine but on this occasion he does not appear to have concerted any measures for supporting by arms the just claims which himself and his royal brother derived from the liberality of their uncle astonished and overwhelmed by the tide of popular fury they seem to have remained without the power of flight or of resistance in the hands of their implacable enemies their fate was suspended till the arrival of constantius the second the character of dalmatius is advantageously though concisely drawn by eutropius x   dalmatius caesar prosperrima indole neque patruo absimilis haud multo post oppressus est factione militari as both jerome and the alexandrian chronicle mention the third year of the caesar which did not commence till the   th or   th of september a d     it is certain that these military factions continued above four months  and perhaps the most favored of the sons of constantine  the voice of the dying emperor had recommended massacre of the princes the care of his funeral to the piety of constantius and that prince by the vicinity of his eastern station could easily prevent the diligence of his brothers who resided in their distant government of italy and gaul as soon as he had taken possession of the palace of constantinople his first care was to remove the apprehensions of his kinsmen by a solemn oath which he pledged for their security his next employment was to find some specious pretense which might release his conscience from the obligation of an imprudent promise the arts of fraud were made subservient to the designs of cruelty and a manifest forgery was attested by a person of the most sacred character from the hands of the bishop of nicomedia constantius received a fatal scroll affirmed to be the genuine testament of his father in which the emperor expressed his suspicions that he had been poisoned by his brothers and conjured his sons to revenge his death and to consult their own safety by the punishment of the guilty i have related this singular anecdote on the authority of philostorgius l ii c    but if such a pretext was ever used by constantine and his adherents it was laid aside with contempt as soon as it had served their immediate purpose athanasius tom i p     mentions the oath which constantius had taken for the security of his kinsmen  whatever reasons might have been alleged by these unfortunate princes to defend their life and honor against so incredible an accusation they were silenced by the furious clamours of the soldiers who declared themselves at once their enemies their judges and their executioners the spirit and even the forms of legal proceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuous massacre which involved the two uncles of constantius seven of his cousins of whom dalmatius and hannibalianus were the most illustrious the patrician optatus who had married a sister of the late emperor and the prefect ablavius whose power and riches had inspired him with some hopes of obtaining the purple if it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody scene we might add that constantius himself had espoused the daughter of his uncle julius and that he had bestowed his sister in marriage on his cousin hannibalianus these alliances which the policy of constantine regardless of the public prejudice conjugia sobrinarum diu ignorata tempore addito percrebuisse tacit annal xii   and lipsius ad loc the repeal of the ancient law and the practice of five hundred years were insufficient to cradicate the prejudices of the romans who still considered the marriages of cousinsgerman as a species of imperfect incest augustine de civitate de xv   and julian whose mind was biassed by superstition and resentment stigmatizes these unnatural alliances

confessed the superiority of the roman power although sapor was in the thirtieth year of his long reign he was still in the vigor of youth as the date of his accession by a very strange fatality had preceded that of his birth the wife of hormouz remained pregnant at the time of her husbands death and the uncertainty of the sex as well as of the event excited the ambitious hopes of the princes of the house of sassan the apprehensions of civil war were at length removed by the positive assurance of the magi that the widow of hormouz had conceived and would safely produce a son obedient to the

education of a persian haram the royal youth could discover the importance of exercising the vigor of his mind and body and by his personal merit deserved a throne on which he had been seated while he was yet unconscious of the duties and temptations of absolute power his minority was exposed to the almost inevitable calamities of domestic discord his capital was surprised and plundered by their a powerful king of yemen or arabia and the majesty of the royal family was degraded by the captivity of a princess the sister of the deceased king but as soon as sapor attained the age of manhood the

the patience of the imperial court the death of constantine was the signal of war sextus rufus c    who on this occasion is no contemptible authority affirms that the persians sued in vain for peace

massacres of the palace diffused a spirit of licentiousness and sedition among the troops of the east who were no longer restrained by their habits of obedience to a veteran commander by the prudence of constantius who from the interview with his brothers in pannonia immediately hastened to the banks of the euphrates the legions were gradually restored to a sense of duty and discipline but the

armenia was attached to the empire by the double ties of policy and of religion but as many of the armenian nobles still refused to abandon the plurality of their gods and of their wives the public tranquillity was disturbed by a discontented faction which insulted the feeble age of their sovereign and impatiently expected the hour of his death he died at length after a reign of a d     fiftysix

rebellious satraps but the romans derived more honor than advantage from this revolution chosroes was a prince of a puny stature and a pusillanimous spirit unequal to the fatigues of war averse to the society of mankind he withdrew from his capital to a retired palace which he built on the banks of the river eleutherus and in the center of a shady grove where he consumed his vacant hours in the rural sports of hunting and hawking to secure this inglorious ease he submitted to the conditions of peace which sapor condescended to impose the payment of an annual tribute and the restitution of

recantation of both those orators after the death of constantius while it restores us to the possession of the truth degrades their own character and that of the emperor the commentary of spanheim on

adverse to the romans but in the battle of singara their imprudent valor had almost achieved a signal and decisive victory the stationary troops of singara retired on the approach of sapor who passed the tigris over three bridges and occupied near the village of hilleh an advantageous camp which by the labor of his numerous pioneers he surrounded in one day with a deep ditch and a lofty rampart his formidable host when it was drawn out in order of battle covered the banks of the river the adjacent heights and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles which separated the two armies both were alike impatient to engage but the barbarians after a slight resistance fled in disorder unable to resist or desirous to weary the strength of the heavy legions who fainting with heat and thirst pursued them across the plain and cut in pieces a line of cavalry clothed in complete armor which had been posted before the gates of the camp to protect their retreat constantius who was hurried along in the pursuit attempted without effect to restrain the ardour of his troops by representing to them the dangers of the approaching night and the certainty of completing their success with the return of day as they depended much more on their own valor than on the experience or the abilities of their chief they silenced by their clamours his timid remonstrances and rushing with fury to the charge filled up the ditch broke down the rampart and dispersed themselves through the tents to recruit their exhausted strength and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labors but the prudent sapor had watched the moment of victory his army of which the greater part securely posted on the heights had been spectators of the action advanced in silence and under the shadow of the night and his persian archers guided by the illumination of the camp poured a shower of arrows on a disarmed and licentious crowd the sincerity of history acerrima nocturna concertatione pugnatum est

the legions was exposed to the most intolerable hardships even the tenderness of panegyric confessing that the glory of the emperor was sullied by the disobedience of his soldiers chooses to draw a veil over the circumstances of this melancholy retreat yet one of those venal orators so jealous of the fame of constantius relates with amazing coolness an act of such incredible cruelty as in the judgment of posterity must imprint a far deeper stain on the honor of the imperial name the son of sapor the heir of his crown had been made a captive in the persian camp the unhappy youth who might

resistance of count lucilianus and his garrison was seconded by the desperate courage of the people the citizens of nisibis were animated by the exhortations of their bishop the miracles which theodoret l ii c  0 ascribes to st james bishop of edessa were at least performed in a worthy cause the defense of his country he appeared on the walls under the figure of the roman emperor and sent an army of gnats to sting the trunks of the elephants and to discomfit the host of the new senacherib  inured to arms by the presence of danger and convinced of the intentions of sapor to plant a persian colony in their room and to lead them away into distant and barbarous captivity the event of the two former sieges elated their confidence and exasperated the haughty spirit of the great king who advanced a third time toward nisibis at the head of the united forces of persia and india the ordinary machines invented to batter or undermine the walls were rendered ineffectual by the superior skill of the romans and many days had vainly elapsed when sapor embraced a resolution worthy of an eastern monarch who believed that the elements themselves were subject to his power at the stated season of the melting of the snows in armenia the river mygdonius which divides the plain and the city of nisibis forms like the nile julian orat i p    though niebuhr tom ii p  0  allows a very considerable swell to the mygdonius over which he saw a bridge of twelve arches it is difficult however to understand this parallel of a trifling rivulet with a mighty river there are many circumstances obscure and almost unintelligible in the description of these stupendous waterworks  an innundation over the adjacent country by the labor of the persians the course of the river was stopped below the town and the waters were confined on every side by solid mounds of earth on this artificial lake a fleet of armed vessels filled with soldiers and with engines which discharged stones of five hundred pounds weight advanced in order of battle and engaged almost upon a level the troops which defended the ramparts the irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties till at length a portion of the walls unable to sustain the accumulated pressure gave way at once and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet the persians were instantly driven to the assault and the fate of nisibis depended on the event of the day the heavyarmed cavalry who led the van of a deep column were embarrassed in the mud and great numbers were drowned in the unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters the elephants made furious by their wounds increased the disorder and trampled down thousands of the persian archers the great king who from an exalted throne beheld the misfortunes of his arms sounded with reluctant indignation the signal of the retreat and suspended for some hours the prosecution of the attack but the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the night and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in height rising every moment to fill up the interval of the breach notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes and the loss of more than twenty thousand men sapor still pressed the reduction of nisibis with an obstinate firmness which could have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern provinces of persia against a formidable invasion of the massagetae we are obliged to zonaras tom ii l xiii p    for this invasion of the massagetae which is perfectly consistent with the general series of events to which we are darkly led by the broken history of ammianus  alarmed by this intelligence he hastily relinquished the siege and marched with rapid diligence from the banks of the tigris to those of the oxus the danger and difficulties of the scythian war engaged him soon afterward to conclude or at least to observe a truce with the roman emperor which was equally grateful to both princes as constantius himself after the deaths of his two brothers was involved by the revolutions of the west in a civil contest which required and seemed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his undivided strength  after the partition of the empire three years civil war and death of constantine had scarcely elapsed before the sons of constantine seemed impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting themselves a d   0 march with the dominions which they were unqualified to govern the eldest of those princes soon complained that he was defrauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered kinsmen and though he might yield to the superior guilt and merit of constantius he exacted from constans the cession of the african provinces as an equivalent for the rich countries of macedonia and greece which his brother had acquired by the death of dalmatius the want of sincerity which constantine experienced in a tedious and fruitless negotiation exasperated the fierceness of his temper and he eagerly listened to those favorites who suggested to him that his honor as well as his interest was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel at the head of a tumultuary band suited for rapine rather than for conquest he suddenly broke into the dominions of constans by the way of the julian alps and the country round aquileia felt the first effects of his resentment the measures of constans who then resided in dacia were directed with more prudence and ability on the news of his brothers invasion he detached a select and disciplined body of his illyrian troops proposing to follow them in person with the remainder of his forces but the conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the unnatural contest by the artful appearances of flight constantine was betrayed into an ambuscade which had been concealed in a wood where the rash youth with a few attendants was surprised surrounded and slain his body after it had been found in the obscure stream of the alsa obtained the honors of an imperial sepulcher but his provinces transferred their allegiance to the conqueror who refusing to admit his elder brother constantius to any share in these new acquisitions maintained the undisputed possession of more than twothirds of the roman empire the causes and the events of this civil war are related with much perplexity and contradiction i have chiefly followed zonaras and the younger victor the monody ad calcem eutrop edit havercamp pronounced on the death of constantine might have been very instructive but prudence and false taste engaged the orator to involve himself in vague declamation   the fate of constans himself was delayed about ten years longer and the revenge of his brothers death was reserved for the more ignoble hand of murder of constans a domestic traitor the pernicious tendency of a d   0 february the system introduced by constantine was displayed in the feeble administration of his sons who by their vices and weakness soon lost the esteem and affections of their people the pride assumed by constans from the unmerited success of his arms was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application his fond partiality toward some german captives distinguished only by the charms of youth was an object of scandal to the people quarum gentium obsides pretio quaesitos pueros venustiores quod cultius habuerat libidine hujusmodi arsisse pro certo habetur had not the depraved taste of constans been publicly avowed the elder victor who held a considerable office in his brothers reign would not have asserted it in such positive terms  and magnentius an ambitious soldier who was himself of barbarian extraction was encouraged by the public discontent to assert the honor of the roman name julian orat i and ii zosim l ii p     victor in epitome there is reason to believe that magnentius was born in one of those barbarian colonies which constantius chlorus had established in gaul see this history vol ii p     his behavior may remind us of the patriot earl of leicester the famous simon de montfort who could persuade the good people of england that he a frenchman by birth had taken arms to deliver them from foreign favorites  the chosen bands of jovians and herculians who acknowledged magnentius as their leader maintained the most respectable and important station in the imperial camp the friendship of marcellinus count of the sacred largesses supplied with a liberal hand the means of seduction the soldiers were convinced by the most specious arguments that the republic summoned them to break the bonds of hereditary servitude and by the choice of an active and vigilant prince to reward the same virtues which had raised the ancestors of the degenerate constans from a private condition to the throne of the world as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution marcellinus under the pretense of celebrating his sons birthday gave a splendid entertainment to the illustrious and honorable persons of the court of gaul which then resided in the city of autun the intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very late hour of the night and the unsuspecting guests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of conversation on a sudden the doors were thrown open and magnentius who had retired for a few moments returned into the apartment invested with the diadem and purple the conspirators instantly saluted him with the titles of augustus and emperor the surprise the terror the intoxication the ambitious hopes and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly prompted them to join their voices to the general acclamation the guards hastened to take the oath of fidelity the gates of the town were shut and before the dawn of day magnentius became master of the troops and treasure of the palace and city of autun by his secrecy and diligence he entertained some hopes of surprising the person of constans who was pursuing in the adjacent forest his favorite amusement of hunting or perhaps some pleasures of a more private and criminal nature the rapid progress of fame allowed him however an instant for flight though the desertion of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of resistance before he could reach a seaport in spain where he intended to embark he was overtaken near helena this ancient city had once flourished under the name of illiberis pomponius mela ii   the munificence of constantine gave it new splendour and his mothers name helena it

this easy but important revolution the example of the court of autun was imitated by the provinces of the west the authority of magnentius was a d   0 march   acknowledged through the whole extent of the two great praefectures of gaul and italy and the usurper prepared by every act of oppression to collect a treasure which might discharge the obligation of an immense donative and supply the expenses of a civil war the martial countries of illyricum from the danube to the extremity of greece had long obeyed the government of vetranio an aged general beloved for the simplicity of his manners and who had acquired some reputation by his experience and services in war eutropius x  0 describes vetranio with more temper and probably with more truth than either of the two victors vetranio was born of obscure parents in the wildest parts of maesia and so much had his education been neglected that after his elevation he sludied the alphabet  attached by habit by duty and by gratitude to the house of constantine he immediately gave the strongest assurances to the only surviving son of his late master that he would expose with unshaken fidelity his person and his troops to inflict a just revenge on the traitors of gaul but the legions of vetranio were seduced rather than provoked by the example of rebellion their leader soon betrayed a want of firmness or a want of sincerity and his ambition derived a specious pretense from the approbation of the princess constantina that cruel and aspiring woman who had obtained from the great constantine her father the rank of augusta placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of the illyrian general and seemed to expect from his victory the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes of which she had been disappointed by the death of her husband hannibalianus perhaps it was without the consent of constantina that the new emperor formed a necessary though dishonorable alliance with the usurper of the west whose purple was so recently stained with her brothers blood the doubtful fluctuating conduct of vetranio is described by julian in his first oration and accurately explained by spanheim who discusses the situation and behavior of constantina   the intelligence of these important events constantius refuses to treat which so deeply affected the honor and safety of the imperial house recalled the arms of constantius a d   0 from the inglorious prosecution of the persian war he recommended the care of the east to his lieutenants and afterward to his cousin gallus whom he raised from a prison to a throne and marched toward europe with a mind agitated by the conflict of hope and fear of grief and indignation on his arrival at heraclea in thrace the emperor gave audience to the ambassadors of magnentius and vetranio the first author of the conspiracy marcellinus who in some measure had bestowed the purple on his new master boldly accepted this dangerous commission and his three colleagues were selected from the illustrious personages of the state and army these deputies were instructed to soothe the resentment and to alarm the fears of constantius they were empowered to offer him the friendship and alliance of the western princes to cement their union by a double marriage of constantius with the daughter of magnentius and of magnentius himself with the ambitious constantina and to acknowledge in the treaty the preeminence of rank which might justly be claimed by the emperor of the east should pride and mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equitable conditions the ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which must attend his rashness if he ventured to provoke the sovereigns of the west to exert their superior strength and to employ against him that valor those abilities and those legions to which the house of constantine had been indebted for so many triumphs such propositions and such arguments appeared to deserve the most serious attention the answer of constantius was deferred till the next day and as he had reflected on the importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the people he thus addressed his council who listened with real or affected credulity last night said he after i retired to rest the shade of the great constantine embracing the corpse of my murdered brother rose before my eyes his wellknown voice awakened me to revenge forbade me to despair of the republic and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would crown the justice of my arms the authority of such a vision or rather of the prince who alleged it silenced every doubt and excluded all negotiation the ignominious terms of peace were rejected with disdain one of the ambassadors of the tyrant was dismissed with the haughty answer of constantius his colleagues as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations were put in irons and the contending powers prepared to wage an implacable war see peter the patrician in the excerpta legationum p      such was the conduct and such perhaps was the duty of the brother of constans toward the perfidious usurper of gaul the situation and deposes vetranio character of vetranio admitted of milder measures a d   0 dec    and the policy of the eastern emperor was directed to disunite his antagonists and to separate the forces of illyricum from the cause of rebellion it was an easy task to deceive the frankness and simplicity of vetranio who fluctuating some time between the opposite views of honor and interest displayed to the world the insincerity of his temper and was insensibly engaged in the snares of an artful negotiation constantius acknowledged him as a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire on condition that he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with magnentius and appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective provinces where they might pledge their friendship by mutual vows of fidelity and regulate by common consent the future operations of the civil war in consequence of this agreement vetranio advanced to the city of sardica zonaras tom ii l xiii p    the position of sardica near the modern city of sophia appears better suited to this interview than the situation of either naissus or sirmium where it is placed by jerome socrates and sozomen  at the head of twenty thousand horse and of a more numerous body of infantry a power so far superior to the forces of constantius that the illyrian emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his rival who depending on the success of his private negociations had seduced the troops and undermined the throne of vetranio the chiefs who had secretly embraced the party of constantius prepared in his favor a public spectacle calculated to discover and inflame the passions of the multitude see the two first orations of julian particularly p    and zosimus l ii p     the distinct narrative of the historian serves to illustrate the diffuse but vague descriptions of the orator  the united armies were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city in the center according to the rules of ancient discipline a military tribunal or rather scaffold was erected from whence the emperors were accustomed on solemn and important occasions to harangue the troops the wellordered ranks of romans and barbarians with drawn swords or with erected spears the squadrons of cavalry and the cohorts of infantry distinguished by the variety of their arms and ensigns formed an immense circle round the tribunal and the attentive silence which they preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamor or of applause in the presence of this formidable assembly the two emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public affairs the precedence of rank was yielded to the royal birth of constantius and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts of rhetoric he acquitted himself under these difficult circumstances with firmness dexterity and eloquence the first part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant of gaul but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of constans he insinuated that none except a brother could claim a right to the succession of his brother he displayed with some complacency the glories of his imperial race and recalled to the memory of the troops the valor the triumphs the liberality of the great constantine to whose sons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity which the ingratitude of his most favored servants had tempted them to violate the officers who surrounded the tribunal and were instructed to act their parts in this extraordinary scene confessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence by saluting the emperor constantius as their lawful sovereign the contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank till the plain of sardica resounded with the universal acclamation of away with these upstart usurpers long life and victory to the son of constantine under his banners alone we will fight and conquer the shout of thousands their menacing gestures the fierce clashing of their arms astonished and subdued the courage of vetranio who stood amidst the defection of his followers in anxious and silent suspense instead of embracing the last refuge of generous despair he tamely submitted to his fate and taking the diadem from his head in the view of both armies fell prostrate at the feet of his conqueror constantius used his victory with prudence and moderation and raising from the ground the aged suppliant whom he affected to style by the endearing name of father he gave him his hand to descend from the throne the city of prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the abdicated monarch who lived six years in the enjoyment of ease and affluence he often expressed his grateful sense of the goodness of constantius and with a very amiable simplicity advised his benefactor to resign the scepter of the world and to seek for content where alone it could be found in the peaceful obscurity of a private condition the younger victor assigns to his exile the emphatical appellation of voluptarium otium socrates l ii c    is the voucher for the correspondence with the emperor which would seem to prove that vetranio was indeed prope ad stultitiam simplicissimus   the behavior of constantius on this memorable makes war against magnentius occasion was celebrated with some appearance of justice and his courtiers compared the studied orations which a pericles or a demosthenes a d     addressed to the populace of athens with the victorious eloquence which had persuaded an armed multitude to desert and depose the object of their partial choice eum constantius facundiae vi dejectum imperio in privatum otium removit quae gloria post natum imperium soli processit eloquio clementiaque etc aurelius victor julian and themistius orat iii and iv adorn this exploit with all the artificial and gaudy coloring of their rhetorie  the approaching contest with magnentius was of a more serious and bloody kind the tyrant advanced by rapid marches to encounter constantius at the head of a numerous army composed of gauls and spaniards of franks and saxons of those provincials who supplied the strength of the legions and of those barbarians who were dreaded as the most formidable enemies of the republic the fertile plains busbequius p     traversed the lower hungary and sclavonia at a time when they were reduced almost to a desert by the reciprocal hostilities of the turks and christians yet he mentions with

with attention and received with caution  constantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of cibalis a name that would animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory which on the same auspicious ground had been obtained by the arms of his father constantine yet by the impregnable fortifications with which the emperor encompassed his camp he appeared to decline rather than to invite a general engagement it was the object of magnentius to tempt or to compel his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position and he employed with that view the various marches evolutions and stratagems which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest to an experienced officer he carried by assault the important town of siscia made an attack on the city of sirmium which lay in the rear of the imperial camp attempted to force a passage over the save into the eastern provinces of illyricum and cut in pieces a numerous detachment which he had allured into the narrow passes of adarne during the greater part of the summer the tyrant of gaul showed himself master of the field the troops of constantius were harassed and dispirited his reputation declined in the eye of the world and his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace which would have resigned to the assassin of constans the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the alps these offers were enforced by the eloquence of philip the imperial ambassador and the council as well as the army of magnentius were disposed to accept them but the haughty usurper careless of the remonstrances of his friends gave orders that philip should be detained as a captive or at least as a hostage while he dispatched an officer to reproach constantius with the weakness of his reign and to insult him by the promise of a pardon if he would instantly abdicate the purple that he should confide in the justice of his cause and the protection of an avenging deity was the only answer which honor permitted the emperor to return but he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to his representative the negotiation of philip was not however ineffectual since he determined sylvanus the frank a general of merit and reputation to desert with a considerable body of cavalry a few days before the battle of mursa  the city of mursa or essek celebrated in modern times for a bridge of boats five miles in length over the river drove and the adjacent battle of mursa morasses this remarkable bridge which is flanked with towers

walls of the town the vigilance of the garrison extinguished the flames the approach of constantius left him no time to continue the operations of the siege and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could embarrass his motions by forcing a body of troops which had taken post in an adjoining amphitheatre the field of battle round mursa was a naked and level plain on this ground the army of constantius formed with the drove on their right while their left either from the nature of their disposition or from the superiority of their cavalry extended far beyond the right slank of magnentius this position and the subsequent evolutions are clearly though concisely described by julian orat i p     the troops on both sides remained under arms in anxious expectation during the

battle m de tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p    0 very properly remarks the silence of julian with regard to the personal prowess of constantius in the battle of mursa the silence of flattery is sometimes equal to the most positive and authentic evidence  they deserved his confidence by the valor and military skill which they exerted they wisely began the action upon the left and advancing their whole wing of cavalry in an oblique line they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank of the enemy which was unprepared to resist the impetuosity of their charge but the romans of the west soon rallied by the habits of discipline and the barbarians of germany supported the renown of their national bravery the engagement soon became general was maintained with various and singular turns of fortune and scarcely ended with the darkness of the night the signal victory which constantius obtained is attributed to the arms of his cavalry his cuirassiers are described as so many massy statues of steel glittering with their scaly armor and breaking with their ponderous lances the firm array of the gallic legions as soon as the legions gave way the lighter and more active squadrons of the second line rode sword in hand into the intervals and completed the disorder in the mean while the huge bodies of the germans were exposed almost naked to the dexterity of the oriental archers and

of military affairs materially contributed to the victory of constantius  the number of the slain was computed at fiftyfour thousand men and the slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that of the vanquished according to zonaras constantius out of  0000 men lost  0000 and magnentius lost   000 out of   000 the other articles of this account seem probable and authentic but the numbers of the tyrants army must have been mistaken either by the author or his transcribers magnentius had collected the whole force of the west romans and barbarians into one formidable body which cannot fairly be estimated at less than  00000 men julian orat i p        a circumstance which proves the obstinacy of the contest and justifies the observation of an ancient writer that the forces of

difficulty from the pursuit of the light horse who incessantly followed his rapid flight from the banks of the drove to the foot of the julian alps on this occasion we must prefer the unsuspected testimony of zosimus and zonaras to the flattering assertions of julian the younger victor paints the character of magnentius in a singular light sermonis acer animi tumidi et immodice timidus artifex

display the banners of constantius on their walls the grateful veterans enriched by the liberality of the father signalized their gratitude and loyalty to the son the cavalry the legions and the auxiliaries of italy renewed their oath of allegiance to constantius and the usurper alarmed by the general desertion was compelled with the remains of his faithful troops to retire beyond the alps into the provinces of gaul the detachments however which were ordered either to press or to intercept the flight of magnentius conducted themselves with the usual imprudence of success and allowed him

although the practice of castration might tame their ungovernable fierceness it did not diminish their strength or spirit and he persuaded himself that those who were separated from the rest of human kind would be more firmly attached to the person of their benefactor but a long experience has contradicted the judgment of cyrus some particular instances may occur of eunuchs distinguished by their fidelity their valor and their abilities but if we examine the general history of persia india and china we shall find that the power of the eunuchs has uniformly marked the decline and fall of every

of age and as the eldest was thought to be of a sickly constitution they obtained with the less difficulty a precarious and dependent life from the affected pity of constantius who was sensible that the execution of these helpless orphans would have been esteemed by all mankind an act of the most deliberate cruelty gregory nazianzen orat iii p  0 reproaches the apostate with his ingratitude

sanctuary of a church  different cities of ionia and bithynia were assigned for the places of their exile and education but as soon as their growing years excited the jealousy of the emperor he judged it more prudent to secure those unhappy youths in the strong castle of macellum near caesarea the treatment which they experienced during a six years confinement was partly such as they could hope from a careful guardian and partly such as they might dread from a suspicious tyrant the most authentic account of the education and adventures of julian is contained in the epistle or manifesto which he himself addressed to the senate and people of athens libanius orat parentalis on the side of the pagans and socrates l iii c   on that of the christians have preserved several interesting

of their birth but they could not disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune of freedom and of safety secluded from the society of all whom they could trust or esteem and condemned to pass their melancholy hours in the company of slaves devoted to the commands of a tyrant who had already injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation at length however the emergencies of the state compelled the emperor or rather his eunuchs to invest gallus in the twentyfifth year of his age with the title of caesar and to cement this political gallus declared caesar connection by his marriage with the princess constantina after a formal interview in which a d     march   the two princes mutually engaged their faith never to undertake any thing to the prejudice of each other they repaired without delay to their respective stations constantius continued his march toward the west and gallus fixed his residence at antioch from whence with a delegated authority he administered the five great dioceses of the eastern praefecture for the promotion of gallus see idatius zosimus and the two victors according to philostorgius l iv c   theophilus an arian bishop was the witness and as it were the guarantee of this solemn engagement he supported that character with generous firmness but m de tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p    0 thinks it very improbable that an heretic should

ample patrimony julian was at first permitted to pursue his studies at constantinople but the reputation which he acquired soon excited the jealousy of constantius and the young prince was advised to

to cast a veil over the frailties of his brother are obliged to confess that the caesar was incapable of reigning transported from a prison to a throne he possessed neither genius nor application nor docility to compensate for the want of knowledge and experience a temper naturally morose and violent instead of being corrected was soured by solitude and adversity the remembrance of what he had endured disposed him to retaliation rather than to sympathy and the ungoverned sallies of his rage were often fatal to those who approached his person or were subject to his power see julian ad s p q

  the sincerity of ammianus would not suffer him to misrepresent facts or characters but his love of ambitious ornaments frequently betrayed him into an unnatural vehemence of expression  instead of employing her influence to insinuate the mild counsels of prudence and humanity she exasperated the fierce passions of her husband and as she retained the vanity though she had renounced the gentleness of her sex a pearl necklace was esteemed an equivalent price for the murder of an innocent and virtuous nobleman his name was clematius of alexandria and his only crime was a refusal to gratify the desires of his motherinlaw who solicited his death because she had been disappointed of his love ammian l xiv c    the cruelty of gallus was sometimes displayed in the undissembled violence of popular or military executions and was sometimes disguised by the abuse of law and the forms of judicial proceedings the private houses of antioch and the places of public resort were besieged by spies and informers and the caesar himself concealed in a plebeian habit very frequently condescended to assume that odious character every apartment of the palace was adorned with the instruments of death and torture and a general consternation was diffused through the capital of syria the prince of the east as if he had been conscious how much he had to fear and how little he deserved to reign selected for the objects of his resentment the provincials accused of some imaginary treason and his own courtiers whom with more reason he suspected of incensing by their secret correspondence the timid and suspicious mind of constantius but he forgot that he was depriving himself of his only support the affection of the people whilst he furnished the malice of his enemies with the arms of truth and afforded the emperor the fairest pretense of exacting the forfeit of his purple and of his life see in ammianus l xiv c     a very ample detail of the cruelties of gallus his brother julian p     insinuates that a secret conspiracy had been formed against him and zosimus names l ii p     the persons engaged in it a minister of considerable rank and two obscure agents who were resolved to make their fortune   as long as the civil war suspended the fate of massacre of the imperial ministers the roman world constantius dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel administration to which his choice had subjected the east and a d     the discovery of some assassins secretly dispatched to antioch by the tyrant of gaul was employed to convince the public that the emperor and caesar were united by the same interest and pursued by the same enemies zonaras l xiii tom ii p       the assassins had seduced a great number of legionaries but their designs were discovered and revealed by an old woman in whose cottage they lodged  but when the victory was decided in favor of constantius his dependent colleague became less useful and less formidable every circumstance of his conduct was severely and suspiciously examined and it was privately resolved either to deprive gallus of the purple or at least to remove him from the indolent luxury of asia to the hardships and dangers of a german war the death of theophilus consular of the province of syria who in a time of scarcity had been massacred by the people of antioch with the connivance and almost at the instigation of gallus was justly resented not only as an act of wanton cruelty but as a dangerous insult on the supreme majesty of constantius two ministers of illustrious rank domitian the oriental prefect and montius quaestor of the palace were empowered by a special commission to visit and reform the state of the east they were instructed to behave toward gallus with moderation and respect and by the gentlest arts of persuasion to engage him to comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague the rashness of the prefect disappointed these prudent measures and hastened his own ruin as well as that of his enemy on his arrival at antioch domitian passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace and alleging a slight pretense of indisposition continued several days in sullen retirement to prepare an inflammatory memorial which he transmitted to the imperial court yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of gallus the prefect condescended to take his seat in council but his first step was to signify a concise and haughty mandate importing that the caesar should immediately repair to italy and threatening that he himself would punish his delay or hesitation by suspending the usual allowance of his household the nephew and daughter of constantine who could ill brook the insolence of a subject expressed their resentment by instantly delivering domitian to the custody of a guard the quarrel still admitted of some terms of accommodation they were rendered impracticable by the imprudent behavior of montius a statesman whose art and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his disposition in the present text of ammianus we read asper quidem sed ad lenitatem propensior which forms a sentence of contradictory nonsense with the aid of an old manuscript valesius has rectified the first of these corruptions and we perceive a ray of light in the substitution of the word vafer if we venture to change lenitatem into levitatem this alteration of a single letter will render the whole passage clear and consistent  the quaestor reproached gallus in haughty language that a prince who was scarcely authorized to remove a municipal magistrate should presume to imprison a praetorian prefect convoked a meeting of the civil and military officers and required them in the name of their sovereign to defend the person and dignity of his representatives by this rash declaration of war the impatient temper of gallus was provoked to embrace the most desperate counsels he ordered his guards to stand to their arms assembled the populace of antioch and recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and revenge his commands were too fatally obeyed they rudely seized the prefect and the quaestor and tying their legs together with ropes they dragged them through the streets of the city inflicted a thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims and at last precipitated their mangled and lifeless bodies into the stream of the orontes instead of being obliged to collect scattered and imperfect hints from various sources we now enter into the full stream of the history of ammianus and need only refer to the seventh and ninth chapters of his fourteenth book philostorgius however l iii c    though partial to gallus should not be entirely overlooked   after such a deed whatever might have been dangerous situation of gallus the designs of gallus it was only in a field of battle that he could assert his innocence with any hope of success but the mind of that prince was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weakness instead of assuming the title of augustus instead of employing in his defense the troops and treasures of the east he suffered himself to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of constantius who leaving him the vain pageantry of a court imperceptibly recalled the veteran legions from the provinces of asia but as it still appeared dangerous to arrest gallus in his capital the slow and safer arts of dissimulation were practiced with success the frequent and pressing epistles of constantius were filled with professions of confidence and friendship exhorting the caesar to discharge the duties of his high station to relieve his colleague from a part of the public cares and to assist the west by his presence his counsels and his arms after so many reciprocal injuries gallus had reason to fear and to distrust but he had neglected the opportunities of flight and of resistance he was seduced by the flattering assurances of the tribune scudilo who under the semblance of a rough soldier disguised the most artful insinuation and he depended on the credit of his wife constantina till the unseasonable death of that princess completed the ruin in which he had been involved by her impetuous passions she had preceded her husband but died of a fever on the road at a little place in bithynia called coenum gallicanum   after a long delay the reluctant caesar set forwards his disgrace and death on his journey to the imperial court from antioch to hadrianople he traversed the wide a d     december extent of his dominions with a numerous and stately train and as he labored to conceal his apprehensions from the world and perhaps from himself he entertained the people of constantinople with an exhibition of the games of the circus the progress of the journey might however have warned him of the impending danger in all the principal cities he was met by ministers of confidence commissioned to seize the offices of government to observe his motions and to prevent the hasty sallies of his despair the persons dispatched to secure the provinces which he left behind passed him with cold salutations or affected disdain and the troops whose station lay along the public road were studiously removed on his approach lest they might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil war the thebaean legions which were then quartered at hadrianople sent a deputation to gallus with a tender of their services ammian l xiv c    the notitia s    0    edit labb mentions three several legions which bore the name of thebaean the zeal of m de voltaire to destroy a despicable though celebrated legend has tempted him on the slightest grounds to deny the existence of a thebaean legion in the roman armies see oeuvres de voltaire tom xv p     quarto edition  after gallus had been permitted to repose himself a few days at hadrianople he received a mandate expressed in the most haughty and absolute style that his splendid retinue should halt in that city while the caesar himself with only ten postcarriages should hasten to the imperial residence at milan in this rapid journey the profound respect which was due to the brother and colleague of constantius was insensibly changed into rude familiarity and gallus who discovered in the countenances of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his guards and might soon be employed as his executioners began to accuse his fatal rashness and to recollect with terror and remorse the conduct by which he had provoked his fate the dissimulation which had hitherto been preserved was laid aside at petovio in pannonia he was conducted to a palace in the suburbs where the general barbatio with a select band of soldiers who could neither be moved by pity nor corrupted by rewards expected the arrival of his illustrious victim in the close of the evening he was arrested ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of caesar and hurried away to pola in istria a sequestered prison which had been so recently polluted with royal blood the horror which he felt was soon increased by the appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch eusebius who with the assistance of a notary and a tribune proceeded to interrogate him concerning the administration of the east the caesar sunk under the weight of shame and guilt confessed all the criminal actions and all the treasonable designs with which he was charged and by imputing them to the advice of his wife exasperated the indignation of constantius who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination the emperor was easily convinced that his own safety was incompatible with the life of his cousin the sentence of death was signed dispatched and executed and the nephew of constantine with his hands tied behind his back was beheaded in prison like the vilest malefactor see the complete narrative of the journey and death of gallus in ammianus l xiv c    julian complains that his brother was put to death without a trial attempts to justify or at least to excuse the cruel revenge which he had inflicted on his enemies but seems at last to acknowledge that he might justly have been deprived of the purple  those who are inclined to palliate the cruelties of constantius assert that he soon relented and endeavored to recall the bloody mandate but that the second messenger entrusted with the reprieve was detained by the eunuchs who dreaded the unforgiving temper of gallus and were desirous of reuniting to their empire the wealthy provinces of the east philostorgius l iv

reigning emperor julian alone the danger and escape of julian survived of all the numerous posterity of constantius chlorus the misfortune of his royal birth involved him in the disgrace of gallus from his retirement in the happy country of ionia he was conveyed under a strong guard to the court of milan where he languished above seven months in the continual apprehension of suffering the same ignominious death which was daily inflicted almost before his eyes on the friends and adherents of his persecuted family his looks his gestures his silence were scrutinized with malignant curiosity and he was perpetually assaulted by enemies whom he had never offended and by arts to which he was a stranger see ammianus marcellin l xv c       julian himself in his epistle to the athenians draws a very lively and just picture of his own danger and of his sentiments he shows however a tendency to exaggerate his sufferings by insinuating though in obscure terms that they lasted above a year a period which cannot be reconciled with the truth of chronology  but in the school of adversity julian insensibly acquired the virtues of firmness and discretion he defended his honor as well as his life against the ensnaring subtleties of the eunuchs who endeavored to extort some declaration of his sentiments and whilst he cautiously suppressed his grief and resentment he nobly disdained to flatter the tyrant by any seeming approbation of his brothers murder julian most devoutly ascribes his miraculous deliverance to the protection of the gods who had exempted his innocence from the sentence of destruction pronounced by their justice against the impious house of constantine julian has worked the crimes and misfortunes of the family of constantine into an allegorical fable which is happily conceived and agreeably related it forms the conclusion of the seventh oration from whence it has been detached and translated by the abbe de la bleterie vie de jovien tom ii p       0   as the most effectual instrument of their providence he gratefully acknowledges the steady and generous friendship of the empress eusebia she was a native of thessalonica in macedonia of a noble family

collected by tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p   0       a woman of beauty and merit who by the ascendant which she had gained over the mind of her husband counterbalanced in some measure the powerful conspiracy of the eunuchs by the intercession of his patroness julian was admitted into the imperial presence he pleaded his cause with a decent freedom he was heard with favor and notwithstanding the efforts of his enemies who urged the danger of sparing an avenger of the blood of gallus the milder sentiment of eusebia prevailed in the council but the effects of a second interview were dreaded by the eunuchs and julian was advised to withdraw for a while into the neighborhood of milan till the emperor thought he is sent to athens proper to assign the city of athens for the place a d     may of his honorable exile as he had discovered from his earliest youth a propensity or rather passion for the language the manners the learning and the religion of the greeks he obeyed with pleasure an order so agreeable to his wishes far from the tumult of arms and the treachery of courts he spent six months amidst the groves of the academy in a free intercourse with the philosophers of the age who studied to cultivate the genius to encourage the vanity and to inflame the devotion of their royal pupil their labors were not unsuccessful and julian inviolably preserved for athens that tender regard which seldom fails to arise in a liberal mind from the recollection of the place where it has discovered and exercised its growing powers the gentleness and affability of manners which his temper suggested and his situation imposed insensibly engaged the affections of the strangers as well as citizens with whom he conversed some of his fellowstudents might perhaps examine his behavior with an eye of prejudice and aversion but julian established in the schools of athens a general prepossession in favor of his virtues and talents which was soon diffused over the roman world libanius and gregory nazianzen have exhausted the arts as well as the powers of their eloquence to represent julian as the first of heroes or the worst of tyrants gregory was his fellowstudent at athens and the symptoms which he so tragically describes of the future wickedness of the apostate amount only to some bodily imperfections and to some peculiarities in his speech and manner he protests however that he then foresaw and foretold the calamities of the church and state greg nazianzen orat iv p           whilst his hours were passed in studious retirement recalled to milan the empress resolute to atchieve the generous design which she had undertaken was not unmindful of the care of his fortune the death of the late caesar had left constantius invested with the sole command and oppressed by the accumulated weight of a mighty empire before the wounds of civil discord could be healed the provinces of gaul were overwhelmed by a deluge of barbarians the sarmatians no longer respected the barrier of the danube the impunity of rapine had increased the boldness and numbers of the wild isaurians those robbers descended from their craggy mountains to ravage the adjacent country and had even presumed though without success to besiege the important city of seleucia which was defended by a garrison of three roman legions above all the persian monarch elated by victory again threatened the peace of asia and the presence of the emperor was indispensably required both in the west and in the east for the first time constantius sincerely acknowledged that his single strength was unequal to such an extent of care and of dominion succumbere tot necessitatibus tamque crebris unum se quod nunquam fecerat aperte demonstrans ammian l xv c   he then expresses in their own words the flattering assurances of the courtiers  insensible to the voice of flattery which assured him that his allpowerful virtue and celestial fortune would still continue to triumph over every obstacle he listened with complacency to the advice of eusebia which gratified his indolence without offending his suspicious pride as she perceived that the remembrance of gallus dwelt on the emperors mind she artfully turned his attention to the opposite characters of the two brothers which from their infancy had been compared to those of domitian and of titus tantum a temperatis moribus juliani differens fratris quantum inter vespasiani filios fuit domitianum et titum ammian l xiv c    the circumstances and education of the two brothers were so nearly the same as to afford a strong example of the innate difference of characters  she accustomed her husband to consider julian as a youth of a mild unambitious disposition whose allegiance and gratitude might be secured by the gift of the purple and who was qualified to fill with honor a subordinate station without aspiring to dispute the commands or to shade the glories of his sovereign and benefactor after an obstinate though secret struggle the opposition of the favorite eunuchs submitted to the ascendency of the empress and it was resolved that julian after celebrating his nuptials with helena sister of constantius should be appointed with the title of caesar to reign over the countries beyond the alps ammianus l xv c   zosimus l iii p           although the order which recalled him to court was probably accompanied by some intimation of his approaching greatness he appeals to the people of athens to witness his tears of undissembled sorrow when he was reluctantly torn away from his beloved retirement julian ad s p q a p         libanius orat x p     julian did not yield till the gods had signified their will by repeated visions and omens his piety then forbade him to resist  he trembled for his life for his fame and even for his virtue and his sole confidence was derived from the persuasion that minerva inspired all his actions and that he was protected by an invisible guard of angels whom for that purpose she had borrowed from the sun and moon he approached with horror the palace of milan nor could the ingenuous youth conceal his indignation when he found himself accosted with false and servile respect by the assassins of his family eusebia rejoicing in the success of her benevolent schemes embraced him with the tenderness of a sister and endeavored by the most soothing caresses to dispel his terrors and reconcile him to his fortune but the ceremony of shaving his beard and his awkward demeanor when he first exchanged the cloak of a greek philosopher for the military habit of a roman prince amused during a few days the levity of the imperial court julian himself relates p     with some humor the circumstances of his own metamorphosis his downcast looks and his perplexity at being thus suddenly transported into a new world where every object appeared strange and hostile   the emperors of the age of constantine no longer deigned to consult with the senate in the choice of a colleague but they were anxious that their nomination should be ratified by the consent of the army on this solemn occasion the guards with the other troops whose stations were in the neighborhood of milan appeared under arms and constantius ascended his lofty tribunal holding by the hand his cousin julian who entered the same day into the twentyfifth year of his age see ammian marcellin l xv c   zosimus l iii p     aurelius victor victor junior in epitom eutrop x     in a studied speech conceived and delivered with dignity the emperor represented the various dangers which threatened the prosperity of the republic the necessity of naming a caesar for the administration of the west and his own intention if it was agreeable to their wishes of rewarding with the honors of the purple the promising virtues of the nephew of constantine the approbation of the soldiers was testified by a respectful murmur they gazed on the manly countenance of julian and observed with pleasure that the fire which sparkled in his eyes was tempered by a modest blush on being thus exposed for the first time to the public view of mankind as soon as the ceremony of his investiture had been performed constantius addressed him with the tone of authority which his superior age and station permitted him to assume and exhorting the new caesar to deserve by heroic deeds that sacred and immortal name the emperor gave his colleague the strongest assurances of a friendship which should never be impaired by time nor interrupted by their separation into the most distant climates as soon as the speech was ended the troops as a token of applause clashed their shields against their knees militares omnes horrendo fragore scuta genibus illidentes quod est prosperitatis indicium plenum nam contra cum hastis clypei feriuntur irae documentum est et doloris ammianus adds with a nice distinction eumque ut potiori reverentia servaretur nec supra modum laudabant nec infra quam decebat  while the officers who surrounded the tribunal expressed with decent reserve their sense of the merits of the representative of constantius  the two princes returned to the palace in the and declared caesar same chariot and during the slow procession julian repeated to himself a verse of his favorite a d     nov   homer which he might equally apply to his fortune and to his fears  the word purple which homer had used as a vague but common epithet for death was applied by julian to express very aptly the nature and object of his own apprehensions  the fourandtwenty days which the caesar spent at milan after his investiture and the first months of his gallic reign were devoted to a splendid but severe captivity nor could the acquisition of honor compensate for the loss of freedom he represents in the most pathetic terms p     the distress of his new situation the provision for his table was however so elegant and sumptuous that the young philosopher rejected it with disdain quum legeret libellum assidue quem constantius ut privignum ad studia mittens manu sua conscripserat praelicenter disponens quid in convivio caesaris impendi deberet phasianum et vulvam et sumen exigi vetuit et inferri ammian marcellin l xvi c    his steps were watched his correspondence was intercepted and he was obliged by prudence to decline the visits of his most intimate friends of his former domestics four only were permitted to attend him two pages his physician and his librarian the last of whom was employed in the care of a valuable collection of books the gift of the empress who studied the inclinations as well as the interest of her friend in the room of these faithful servants an household was formed such indeed as became the dignity of a caesar but it was filled with a crowd of slaves destitute and perhaps incapable of any attachment for their new master to whom for the most part they were either unknown or suspected his want of experience might require the assistance of a wise counsel but the minute instructions which regulated the service of his table and the distribution of his hours were adapted to a youth still under the discipline of his praeceptors rather than to the situation of a prince entrusted with the conduct of an important war if he aspired to deserve the esteem of his subjects he was checked by the fear of displeasing his sovereign and even the fruits of his marriage bed were blasted by the jealous artifices of eusebia if we recollect that constantine the father of helena died above eighteen years before in a mature old age it will appear probable that the daughter though a virgin could not be very young at the time of her marriage she was soon afterward delivered of a son who died immediately quod obstetrix corrupta mercede mox natum praesecto plusquam convenerat umbilico necavit she accompanied the emperor and empress in their journey to rome and the latter quaesitum venenum bibere per fraudem illexit ut quotiescunque concepisset immaturum abjiceret partum ammian l xvi c  0 our physicians will determine whether there exists such a poison for my own part i am inclined to hope that the public malignity imputed the effects of accident as the guilt of eusebia herself who on this occasion alone seems to have been unmindful of the tenderness of her sex and the generosity of her character the memory of his father and of his brothers reminded julian of his own danger and his apprehensions were increased by the recent and unworthy fate of sylvanus in the summer which fatal end of sylvanus preceded his own elevation that general had been chosen to deliver gaul from the tyranny of the a d     september barbarians but sylvanus soon discovered that he had left his most dangerous enemies in the imperial court a dexterous informer countenanced by several of the principal ministers procured from him some recommendatory letters and erazing the whole of the contents except the signature filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high and treasonable import by the industry and courage of his friends the fraud was however detected and in a great council of the civil and military officers held in the presence of the emperor himself the innocence of sylvanus was publicly acknowledged but the discovery came too late the report of the calumny and the hasty seizure of his estate had already provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was so unjustly accused he assumed the purple at his headquarters of cologne and his active powers appeared to menace italy with an invasion and milan with a siege in this emergency ursicinus a general of equal rank regained by an act of treachery the favor which he had lost by his eminent services in the east exasperated as he might speciously allege by injuries of a similar nature he hastened with a few followers to join the standard and to betray the confidence of his too credulous friend after a reign of only twentyeight days sylvanus was assassinated the soldiers who without any criminal intention had blindly followed the example of their leader immediately returned to their allegiance and the flatterers of constantius celebrated the wisdom and felicity of the monarch who had extinguished a civil war without the hazard of a battle ammianus xv   was perfectly well informed of the conduct and fate of sylvanus he himself was one of the few followers who attended ursicinus in his dangerous enterprise   the protection of the rhaetian frontier and constantius visits rome the persecution of the catholic church detained constantius in italy above eighteen months after a d     april    the departure of julian before the emperor returned into the east he indulged his pride and curiosity in a visit to the ancient capital for the particulars of the visit of constantius to rome see ammianus l xvi c  0 we have only to add that themistius was appointed deputy from constantinople and that he composed his fourth oration for this ceremony  he proceeded from milan to rome along the aemilian and flaminian ways and as soon as he approached within forty miles of the city the march of a prince who had never vanquished a foreign enemy assumed the appearance of a triumphal procession his splendid train was composed of all the ministers of luxury but in a time of profound peace he was encompassed by the glittering arms of the numerous squadrons of his guards and cuirassiers their streaming banners of silk embossed with gold and shaped in the form of dragons waved round the person of the emperor constantius sat alone in a lofty car resplendent with gold and precious gems and except when he bowed his head to pass under the gates of the cities he affected a stately demeanor of inflexible and as it might seem of insensible gravity the severe discipline of the persian youth had been introduced by the eunuchs into the imperial palace and such were the habits of patience which they had inculcated that during a slow and sultry march he was never seen to move his hand toward his face or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left he was received by the magistrates and senate of rome and the emperor surveyed with attention the civil honors of the republic and the consular images of the noble families the streets were lined with an innumerable multitude their repeated acclamations expressed their joy at beholding after an absence of thirtytwo years the sacred person of their sovereign and constantius himself expressed with some pleasantry his affected surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on the same spot the son of constantine was lodged in the ancient palace of augustus he presided in the senate harangued the people from the tribunal which cicero had so often ascended assisted with unusual courtesy at the games of the circus and accepted the crowns of gold as well as the panegyrics which had been prepared for this ceremony by the deputies of the principal cities his short visit of thirty days was employed in viewing the monuments of art and power which were scattered over the seven hills and the interjacent valleys he admired the awful majesty of the capitol the vast extent of the baths of caracalla and diocletian the severe simplicity of the pantheon the massy greatness of the amphitheatre of titus the elegant architecture of the theater of pompey and the temple of peace and above all the stately structure of the forum and column of trajan acknowledging that the voice of fame so prone to invent and to magnify had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the world the traveller who has contemplated the ruins of ancient rome may conceive some imperfect idea of the sentiments which they must have inspired when they reared their heads in the splendor of unsullied beauty  the satisfaction which constantius had received from this journey excited him to the generous emulation of bestowing on the romans some memorial a new obelisk of his own gratitude and munificence his first idea was to imitate the equestrian and colossal statue which he had seen in the forum of trajan but when he had maturely weighed the difficulties of the execution hormisdas a fugitive prince of persia observed to the emperor that if he made such a horse he must think of preparing a similar stable the forum of trajan another saying of hormisdas is recorded that one thing only had displeased him to find that men died at rome as well as elsewhere if we adopt this reading of the text of ammianus displicuisse instead of placuisse we may consider it as a reproof of roman vanity the contrary sense would be that of a misanthrope  he chose rather to embellish the capital by the gift of an egyptian obelisk in a remote but polished age which seems to have preceded the invention of alphabetical writing a great number of these obelisks had been erected in the cities of thebes and heliopolis by the ancient sovereigns of egypt in a just confidence that the simplicity of their form and the hardness of their substance would resist the injuries of time and violence when germanicus visited the ancient monuments of thebes the eldest of the priests explained to him the meaning of these hieroglyphics tacit annal ii c  0 but it seems probable that before the useful invention of an alphabet these natural or arbitrary signs were the common characters of the egyptian nation see warburtons divine legation of moses vol iii p          several of these extraordinary columns had been transported to rome by augustus and his successors as the most durable monuments of their power and victory see plin hist nature l xxxvi c        but there remained one obelisk which from its size or sanctity escaped for a long time the rapacious vanity of the conquerors it was designed by constantine to adorn his new city ammian marcellin l xvii c   he gives us a greek interpretation of the hieroglyphics and his commentator lindenbrogius adds a latin inscription which in twenty verses of the age of constantius contain a short history of the obelisk  and after being removed by his order from the pedestal where it stood before the temple of the sun at heliopolis was floated down the nile to alexandria the death of constantine suspended the execution of his purpose and this obelisk was destined by his son to the ancient capital of the empire a vessel of uncommon strength and capaciousness was provided to convey this enormous weight of granite at least an hundred and fifteen feet in length from the banks of the nile to those of the tyber the obelisk of constantius was landed about three miles from the city and elevated by the efforts of art and labor in the great circus of rome see donat roma antiqua l iii c    l iv c    and the learned though confused dissertation of bargaeus on obelisks inserted in the fourth volume of graeviuss roman antiquities p            this dissertation is dedicated to pope sixtus v who erected the obelisk of constantius in the square before the patriarchal church of st john lateran   the departure of constantius from rome was the quadian and sarmatian war hastened by the alarming intelligence of the distress and danger of the illyrian provinces the distractions of civil war and the irreparable a d             loss which the roman legions had sustained in the battle of mursa exposed those countries almost without defense to the light cavalry of the barbarians and particularly to the inroads of the quadi a fierce and powerful nation who seem to have exchanged the institutions of germany for the arms and military arts of their sarmatian allies the events of this quadian and sarmatian war are related by ammianus xvi  0 xvii       xix     the garrisons of the frontier were insufficient to check their progress and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to assemble from the extremities of his dominions the flower of the palatine troops to take the field in person and to employ a whole campaign with the preceding autumn and the ensuing spring in the serious prosecution of the war the emperor passed the danube on a bridge of boats cut in pieces all that encountered his march penetrated into the heart of the country of the quadi and severely retaliated the calamities which they had inflicted on the roman province the dismayed barbarians were soon reduced to sue for peace they offered the restitution of his captive subjects as an atonement for the past and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future conduct the generous courtesy which was shown to the first among their chieftains who implored the clemency of constantius encouraged the more timid or the more obstinate to imitate their example and the imperial camp was crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant tribes who occupied the plains of the lesser poland and who might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the carpathian mountains while constantius gave laws to the barbarians beyond the danube he distinguished with specious compassion the sarmatian exiles who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their slaves and who formed a very considerable accession to the power of the quadi the emperor embracing a generous but artful system of policy released the sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating dependence and restored them by a separate treaty to the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king the friend and ally of the republic he declared his resolution of asserting the justice of their cause and of securing the peace of the provinces by the extirpation or at least the banishment of the limigantes whose manners were still infected with the vices of their servile origin the execution of this design was attended with more difficulty than glory the territory of the limigantes was protected against the romans by the danube against the hostile barbarians by the teyss the marshy lands which lay between those rivers and were often covered by their inundations formed an intricate wilderness pervious only to the inhabitants who were acquainted with its secret paths and inaccessible fortresses on the approach of constantius the limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers of fraud and of arms but he sternly rejected their supplications defeated their rude stratagems and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of their irregular valor one of their most warlike tribes established in a small island toward the conflux of the teyss and the danube consented to pass the river with the intention of surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable conference they soon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated encompassed on every side trampled down by the cavalry slaughtered by the swords of the legions they disdained to ask for mercy and with an undaunted countenance still grasped their weapons in the agonies of death after this victory a considerable body of romans was landed on the opposite banks of the danube the taifalae a gothic tribe engaged in the service of the empire invaded the limigantes on the side of the teyss and their former masters the free sarmatians animated by hope and revenge penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient possessions a general conflagration revealed the huts of the barbarians which were seated in the depth of the wilderness and the soldier fought with confidence on marshy ground which it was dangerous for him to tread in this extremity the bravest of the limigantes were resolved to die in arms rather than to yield but the milder sentiment enforced by the authority of their elders at length prevailed and the suppliant crowd followed by their wives and children repaired to the imperial camp to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror after celebrating his own clemency which was still inclined to pardon their repeated crimes and to spare the remnant of a guilty nation constantius assigned for the place of their exile a remote country where they might enjoy a safe and honorable repose the limigantes obeyed with reluctance but before they could reach at least before they could occupy their destined habitations they returned to the banks of the danube exaggerating the hardships of their situation and requesting with fervent professions of fidelity that the emperor would grant them an undisturbed settlement within the limits of the roman provinces instead of consulting his own experience of their incurable perfidy constantius listened to his flatterers who were ready to represent the honor and advantage of accepting a colony of soldiers at a time when it was much easier to obtain the pecuniary contributions than the military service of the subjects of the empire the limigantes were permitted to pass the danube and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large plain near the modern city of buda they surrounded the tribunal and seemed to hear with respect an oration full of mildness and dignity when one of the barbarians casting his shoe into the air exclaimed with a loud voice marha marha a word of defiance which was received as the signal of the tumult they rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands but the faithful defense of his guards who died at his feet allowed him a moment to mount a fleet horse and to escape from the confusion the disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous surprise was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the romans and the combat was only terminated by the extinction of the name and nation of the limigantes the free sarmatians were reinstated in the possession of their ancient seats and although constantius distrusted the levity of their character he entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence their future conduct he had remarked the lofty stature and obsequious demeanor of zizais one of the noblest of their chiefs he conferred on him the title of king and zizais proved that he was not unworthy to reign by a sincere and lasting attachment to the interest of his benefactor who after this splendid success received the name of sarmaticus from the acclamations of his victorious army genti sarmatarum magno decori considens apud eos regem dedit aurelius victor in a pompous oration pronounced by constantius himself he expatiates on his own exploits with much vanity and some truth   while the roman emperor and the persian the persian negotiation monarch at the distance of three thousand miles defended their extreme limits against the barbarians a d     of the danube and of the oxus their intermediate frontier experienced the vicissitudes of a languid war and a precarious truce two of the eastern ministers of constantius the praetorian prefect musonian whose abilities were disgraced by the want of truth and integrity and cassian duke of mesopotamia a hardy and veteran soldier opened a secret negotiation with the satrap tamsapor ammian xvi   these overtures of peace translated into the servile and flattering language of asia were transmitted to the camp of the great king who resolved to signify by an ambassador the terms which he was inclined to grant to the suppliant romans narses whom he invested with that character was honorably received in his passage through antioch and constantinople he reached sirmium after a long journey and at his first audience respectfully unsolded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his sovereign sapor king of kings and brother of the sun and moon such were the lofty titles affected by oriental vanity expressed his satisfaction that his brother constantius caesar had been taught wisdom by adversity as the lawful successor of darius hystaspes sapor asserted that the river strymon in macedonia was the true and ancient boundary of his empire declaring however that as an evidence of his moderation he would content himself with the provinces of armenia and mesopotamia which had been fraudulently extorted from his ancestors he alleged that without the restitution of these disputed countries it was impossible to establish any treaty on a solid and permanent basis and he arrogantly threatened that if his ambassador returned in vain he was prepared to take the field in the spring and to support the justice of his cause by the strength of his invincible arms narses who was endowed with the most polite and amiable manners endeavored as far as was consistent with his duty to soften the harshness of the message ammianus xvii   transcribes the haughty letter themistius orat iv p    edit petav takes notice of the silk covering idatius and zonaras mention the journey of the ambassador and peter the patrician in excerpt legate p    has informed us of his conciliating behavior  both the style and substance were maturely weighed in the imperial council and he was dismissed with the following answer constantius had a right to disclaim the officiousness of his ministers who had acted without any specific orders from the throne he was not however averse to an equal and honorable treaty but it was highly indecent as well as absurd to propose to the sole and victorious emperor of the roman world the same conditions of peace which he had indignantly rejected at the time when his power was contracted within the narrow limits of the east the chance of arms was uncertain and sapor should recollect that if the romans had sometimes been vanquished in battle they had almost always been successful in the event of the war a few days after the departure of narses three ambassadors were sent to the court of sapor who was already returned from the scythian expedition to his ordinary residence of ctesiphon a count a notary and a sophist had been selected for this important commission and constantius who was secretly anxious for the conclusion of the peace entertained some hopes that the dignity of the first of these ministers the dexterity of the second and the rhetoric of the third ammianus xvii   and valesius ad loc the sophist or philosopher in that age these words were almost synonymous was eustathius the cappadocian the disciple of jamblichus and the friend of

antoninus ammian xviii       the decent and respectful behavior of antoninus toward the roman general sets him in a very interesting light and ammianus himself speaks of the traitor with some compassion and esteem  a roman subject of syria who had fled from oppression and was admitted into the councils of sapor and even to the royal table where according to the custom of the persians the most important business was frequently discussed this circumstance as it is noticed by ammianus serves to prove the veracity of herodotus l i c     and the permanency of the persian manners in every

the palatine troops were employed with the emperor in a distant war on the danube he pressed sapor to invade the exhausted and defenseless provinces of the east with the numerous armies of persia now fortified by the alliance and accession of the fiercest barbarians the ambassadors of rome retired without success and a second embassy of a still more honorable rank was detained in strict confinement and threatened either with death or exile  the military historian ammian l xviii        0  who was himself dispatched to observe the army of the persians as they were preparing to

and selected from the bravest nations of asia the roman deserter who in some measure guided the councils of sapor had prudently advised that instead of wasting the summer in tedious and difficult sieges he should march directly to the euphrates and press forwards without delay to seize the feeble and wealthy metropolis of syria but the persians were no sooner advanced into the plains of mesopotomia than they discovered that every precaution had been used which could retard their progress or defeat their design the inhabitants with their cattle were secured in places of strength the green forage throughout the country was set on fire the fords of the river were fortified by sharp stakes military engines were planted on the opposite banks and a seasonable swell of the waters of the euphrates deterred the barbarians from attempting the ordinary passage of the bridge of thapsacus their skilful guide changing his plan of operations then conducted the army by a longer circuit but through a fertile territory toward the head of the euphrates where the infant river is reduced to a shallow and accessible stream sapor overlooked with prudent disdain the strength of nisibis but as he passed under the walls of amida he resolved to try whether the majesty of his presence would not awe the garrison into immediate submission the sacrilegious insult of a random dart which glanced against the royal tiara convinced him of his error and the indignant monarch listened with impatience to the advice of his ministers who conjured him not to sacrifice the success of his ambition to the gratification of his resentment the following day grumbates advanced toward the gates with a select body of troops and required the instant surrender of the city as the only atonement which could be accepted for such an act of rashness and insolence his proposals were answered by a general discharge and his only son a beautiful and valiant youth was pierced through the heart by a javelin shot from one of the balistae the funeral of the prince of the chionites was celebrated according to the rites of his country and the grief of his aged father was alleviated by the solemn promise of sapor that the guilty city of amida should serve as a funeral pile to expiate the death and to perpetuate the memory of his son  the ancient city of amid or amida for the description of amida see dherbelot

appellation of diarbekir diarbekir which is styled amid or karaamid in the public writings of the turks contains above   000 houses and is the residence of a pasha with three tails the epithet of kara is derived from the blackness of the stone which composes the strong and ancient wall of amida  is advantageously situate in a fertile plain watered by the natural and artificial channels of the tigris of which the least inconsiderable stream bends in a semicircular form round the eastern part of the city the emperor constantius had recently conferred on amida the honor of his own name and the additional fortifications of strong walls and lofty towers it was provided with an arsenal of military engines and the ordinary garrison had been reinforced to the amount of seven legions when the place was invested by the arms of sapor the operations of the siege of amida are very minutely described by ammianus xix      who acted an honorable part in the defense and escaped with difficulty when the city was stormed by the persians  his first and most sanguine hopes depended on the success of a general assault to the several nations which followed his standard their respective posts were assigned the south to the vertae the north to the albanians the east to the chionites inflamed with grief and indignation the west to the segestans the bravest of his warriors who covered their front with a formidable line of indian elephants of these four nations the albanians are too well known to require any description the segestans inhabited a large and level country which still preserves their name to the south of khorasan and the west of hindostan see geographia nubiensis p     and dherbelot bibliotheque orientale p     notwithstanding the boasted victory of bahram vol i p   0 the segestans above fourscore years afterward appear as an independent nation the ally of persia we are ignorant of the situation of the vertae and chionites but i am inclined to place them at least the latter toward the confines of india and scythia see ammian xvi    the persians on every side supported their efforts and animated their courage and the monarch himself careless of his rank and safety displayed in the prosecution of the siege the ardor of a youthful soldier after an obstinate combat the barbarians were repulsed they incessantly returned to the charge they were again driven back with a dreadful slaughter and two rebel legions of gauls who had been banished into the east signalized their undisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into the heart of the persian camp in one of the fiercest of these repeated assaults amida was betrayed by the treachery of a deserter who indicated to the barbarians a secret and neglected staircase scooped out of the rock that hangs over the stream of the tigris seventy chosen archers of the royal guard ascended in silence to the third story of a lofty tower which commanded the precipice they elevated on high the persian banner the signal of confidence to the assailants and of dismay to the besieged and if this devoted band could have maintained their post a few minutes longer the reduction of the place might have been purchased by the sacrifice of their lives after sapor had tried without success the efficacy of force and of stratagem he had recourse to the slower but more certain operations of a regular siege in the conduct of which he was instructed by the skill of the roman deserters the trenches were opened at a convenient distance and the troops destined for that service advanced under the portable cover of strong hurdles to fill up the ditch and undermine the foundations of the walls wooden towers were at the same time constructed and moved forwards on wheels till the soldiers who were provided with every species of missile weapons could engage almost on level ground with the troops who defended the rampart every mode of resistance which art could suggest or courage could execute was employed in the defense of amida and the works of sapor were more than once destroyed by the fire of the romans but the resources of a besieged city may be exhausted the persians repaired their losses and pushed their approaches a large breach was made by the batteringram and the strength of the garrison wasted by the sword and by disease yielded to the fury of the assault the soldiers the citizens their wives their children all who had not time to escape through the opposite gate were involved by the conquerors in a promiscuous massacre  but the ruin of amida was the safety of the of singara etc roman provinces as soon as the first transports of victory had subsided sapor was at leisure to a d   0 reflect that to chastise a disobedient city he had lost the flower of his troops and the most favorable season for conquest ammianus has marked the chronology of this year by three signs which do not perfectly coincide with each other or with the series of the history   the corn was ripe when sapor invaded mesopotamia cum jam stipula flavente turgerent a circumstance which in the latitude of aleppo would naturally refer us to the month of april or may see harmers observations on scripture vol i p    shaws travels p     edit   to   the progress of sapor was checked by the overflowing of the euphrates which generally happens in july and august plin hist not v    viaggi di pietro della valle tom i p       when sapor had taken amida after a siege of seventythree days the autumn was far advanced autumno precipiti haedoruinque improbo sidere extoto to reconcile these apparent contradictions we must allow for some delay in the persian king some inaccuracy in the historian and some disorder in the seasons  thirty thousand of his veterans had fallen under the walls of amida during the continuance of a siege which lasted seventythree days and the disappointed monarch returned to his capital with affected triumph and secret mortification it is more than probable that the inconstancy of his barbarian allies was tempted to relinquish a war in which they had encountered such unexpected difficulties and that the aged king of the chionites satiated with revenge turned away with horror from a scene of action where he had been deprived of the hope of his family and nation the strength as well as spirit of the army with which sapor took the field in the ensuing spring was no longer equal to the unbounded views of his ambition instead of aspiring to the conquest of the east he was obliged to content himself with the reduction of two fortified cities of mesopotamia singara and bezabde the account of these sieges is given by ammianus xx      the one situate in the midst of a sandy desert the other in a small peninsula surrounded almost on every side by the deep and rapid stream of the tigris five roman legions of the diminutive size to which they had been reduced in the age of constantine were made prisoners and sent into remote captivity on the extreme confines of persia after dismantling the walls of singara the conqueror abandoned that solitary and sequestered place but he carefully restored the fortifications of bezabde and fixed in that important post a garrison or colony of veterans amply supplied with every means of defense and animated by high sentiments of honor and fidelity toward the close of the campaign the arms of sapor incurred some disgrace by an unsuccessful enterprise against virtha or tecrit a strong or as it was universally esteemed till the age of tamerlane an impregnable fortress of the independent arabs for the identity of virtha and tecrit see danville geographie ancienne tom ii p  0  for the siege of that castle by timur bec or tamerlane see cherefeddin l iii c    the persian biographer exaggerates the merit and difficulty of this exploit which delivered the caravans of bagdad from a formidable gang of robbers   the defense of the east against the arms of sapor required and would have exercised the abilities of the most consummate general and it conduct of the romans seemed fortunate for the state that it was the actual province of the brave ursicinus who alone deserved the confidence of the soldiers and people in the hour of danger ursicinus ammianus xviii     xix   xx   represents the merit and disgrace of ursicinus with that faithful attention which a soldier owed to his general some partiality may be suspected yet the whole account is consistent and probable was removed from his station by the intrigues of the eunuchs and the military command of the east was bestowed by the same influence on sabinian a wealthy and subtle veteran who had attained the infirmities without acquiring the experience of age by a second order which issued from the same jealous and inconstant counsels ursicinus was again dispatched to the frontier of mesopotamia and condemned to sustain the labors of a war the honors of which had been transferred to his unworthy rival sabinian fixed his indolent station under the walls of edessa and while he amused himself with the idle parade of military exercise and moved to the sound of flutes in the pyrrhic dance the public defense was abandoned to the boldness and diligence of the former general of the east but whenever ursicinus recommended any vigorous plan of operations when he proposed at the head of a light and active army to wheel round the foot of the mountains to intercept the convoys of the enemy to harass the wide extent of the persian lines and to relieve the distress of amida the timid and envious commander alleged that he was restrained by his positive orders from endangering the safety of the troops amida was at length taken its bravest defenders who had escaped the sword of the barbarians died in the roman camp by the hand of the executioner and ursicinus himself after supporting the disgrace of a partial enquiry was punished for the misconduct of sabinian by the loss of his military rank but constantius soon experienced the truth of the prediction which honest indignation had extorted from his injured lieutenant that as long as such maxims of government were suffered to prevail the emperor himself would find it no easy task to defend his eastern dominions from the invasion of a foreign enemy when he had subdued or pacified the barbarians of the danube constantius proceeded by slow marches into the east and after he had wept over the smoking ruins of amida he formed with a powerful army the siege of bezabde the walls were shaken by the reiterated efforts of the most enormous of the batteringrams the town was reduced to the last extremity but it was still defended by the patient and intrepid valor of the garrison till the approach of the rainy season obliged the emperor to raise the siege and ingloriously to retreat into his winter quarters at antioch ammian xx    omisso vano incepto hiematurus antiochiae redit in syriam aerumnosam perpessus et ulcerum sed et atrocia diuque deflenda it is thus that james gronovius has restored an obscure passage and he thinks that this correction alone would have deserved a new edition of his author whose sense may now be darkly perceived i expected some additional light from the recent labors of the learned ernestus lipsiae       the pride of constantius and the ingenuity of his courtiers were at a loss to discover any materials for panegyric in the events of the persian war while the glory of his cousin julian to whose military command he had entrusted the provinces of gaul was proclaimed to the world in the simple and concise narrative of his exploits  in the blind fury of civil discord constantius invasion of gaul by the germans had abandoned to the barbarians of germany the countries of gaul which still acknowledged the authority of his rival a numerous swarm of franks and alemanni were invited to cross the rhine by presents and promises by the hopes of spoil and by a perpetual grant of all the territories which they should be able to subdue the ravages of the germans and the distress of gaul may be collected from julian himself orat ad s p q athen p     ammian xv    libanius orat x zosimus l iii p   0 sozomen l iii c    but the emperor who for a temporary service had thus imprudently provoked the rapacious spirit of the barbarians soon discovered and lamented the difficulty of dismissing these formidable allies after they had tasted the richness of the roman soil regardless of the nice distinction of loyalty and rebellion these undisciplined robbers treated as their natural enemies all the subjects of the empire who possessed any property which they were desirous of acquiring fortyfive flourishing cities tongres cologne treves worms spires strasburgh etc besides a far greater number of towns and villages were pillaged and for the most part reduced to ashes the barbarians of germany still faithful to the maxims of their ancestors abhorred the confinement of walls to which they applied the odious names of prisons and sepulchers and fixing their independent habitations on the banks of rivers the rhine the moselle and the meuse they secured themselves against the danger of a surprise by a rude and hasty fortification of large trees which were felled and thrown across the roads the alemanni were established in the modern countries of alsace and lorraine the franks occupied the island of the batavians together with an extensive district of brabant which was then known by the appellation of toxandria ammianus xvi   this name seems to be derived from the toxandri of pliny and very frequently occurs in the histories of the middle age toxandria was a country of woods and morasses which extended from the neighborhood of tongres to the conflux of the vahal and the rhine see valesius notit galliar p      and may deserve to be considered as the original seat of their gallic monarchy the paradox of p daniel that the franks never obtained any permanent settlement on this side of the rhine before the time of clovis is refuted with much learning and good sense by m biet who has proved by a chain of evidence their uninterrupted possession of toxandria one hundred and thirty years before the accession of clovis the dissertation of m biet was crowned by the academy of soissons in the year      and seems to have been justly preferred to the discourse of his more celebrated competitor the abbe le boeuf an antiquarian whose name was happily expressive of his talents  from the sources to the mouth of the rhine the conquests of the germans extended above forty miles to the west of that river over a country peopled by colonies of their own name and nation and the scene of their devastations was three times more extensive than that of their conquests at a still greater distance the open towns of gaul were deserted and the inhabitants of the fortified cities who trusted to their strength and vigilance were obliged to content themselves with such supplies of corn as they could raise on the vacant land within the enclosure of their walls the diminished legions destitute of pay and provisions of arms and discipline trembled at the approach and even at the name of the barbarians  under these melancholy circumstances an unexperienced conduct of julian youth was appointed to save and to govern the provinces of gaul or rather as he expresses it himself to exhibit the vain image of imperial greatness the retired scholastic education of julian in which he had been more conversant with books than with arms with the dead than with the living left him in profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and government and when he awkwardly repeated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to learn he exclaimed with a sigh o plato plato what a task for a philosopher yet even this speculative philosophy which men of business are too apt to despise had filled the mind of julian with the noblest precepts and the most shining examples had animated him with the love of virtue the desire of fame and the contempt of death the habits of temperance recommended in the schools are still more essential in the severe discipline of a camp the simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sleep rejecting with disdain the delicacies provided for his table he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers during the rigor of a gallic winter he never suffered a fire in his bedchamber and after a short and interrupted slumber he frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread on the floor to dispatch any urgent business to visit his rounds or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his favorite studies the private life of julian in gaul and the severe discipline which he embraced are displayed by ammianus xvi   who professes to praise and by julian himself who affects to ridicule misopogon p   0 a conduct which in a prince of the house of constantine might justly excite the surprise of mankind  the precepts of eloquence which he had hitherto practiced on fancied topics of declamation were more usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed multitude and although julian from his early habits of conversation and literature was more familiarly acquainted with the beauties of the greek language he had attained a competent knowledge of the latin tongue aderat latin quoque disserenti sufficiens sermo ammianus xvi   but julian educated in the schools of greece always considered the language of the romans as a foreign and popular dialect which he might use on necessary occasions  since julian was not originally designed for the character of a legislator or a judge it is probable that the civil jurisprudence of the romans had not engaged any considerable share of his attention but he derived from his philosophic studies an inflexible regard for justice tempered by a disposition to clemency the knowledge of the general principles of equity and evidence and the faculty of patiently investigating the most intricate and tedious questions which could be proposed for his discussion the measures of policy and the operations of war must submit to the various accidents of circumstance and character and the unpractised student will often be perplexed in the application of the most perfect theory but in the acquisition of this important science julian was assisted by the active vigor of his own genius as well as by the wisdom and experience of sallust an officer of rank who soon conceived a sincere attachment for a prince so worthy of his friendship and whose incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of insinuating the harshest truths without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear we are ignorant of the actual office of this excellent minister whom julian afterward created prefect of gaul sallust was speedily recalled by the jealousy of the emperor and we may still read a sensible but pedantic discourse p   0      in which julian deplores the loss of so valuable a friend to whom he acknowledges himself indebted for his reputation see la bleterie preface a la vie de jovien p  0   immediately after julian had received the his first campaign in gaul purple at milan he was sent into gaul with a feeble retinue of three hundred and sixty soldiers a d     at vienna where he passed a painful and anxious winter in the hands of those ministers to whom constantius had entrusted the direction of his conduct the caesar was informed of the siege and deliverance of autun that large and ancient city protected only by a ruined wall and pusillanimous garrison was saved by the generous resolution of a few veterans who resumed their arms for the defense of their country in his march from autun through the heart of the gallic provinces julian embraced with ardour the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage at the head of a small body of archers and heavy cavalry he preferred the shorter but the more dangerous of two roads and sometimes eluding and sometimes resisting the attacks of the barbarians who were masters of the field he arrived with honor and safety at the camp near rheims where the roman troops had been ordered to assemble the aspect of their young prince revived the drooping spirit of the soldiers and they marched from rheims in search of the enemy with a confidence which had almost proved fatal to them the alemanni familiarized to the knowledge of the country secretly collected their scattered forces and seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day poured with unexpected fury on the rearguard of the romans before the inevitable disorder could be remedied two legions were destroyed and julian was taught by experience that caution and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war in a second and more successful action he recovered and established his military fame but as the agility of the barbarians saved them from the pursuit his victory was neither bloody nor decisive he advanced however to the banks of the rhine surveyed the ruins of cologne convinced himself of the difficulties of the war and retreated on the approach of winter discontented with the court with his army and with his own success ammianus xvi     appears much better satisfied with the success of this first campaign than julian himself who very fairly owns that he did nothing of consequence and that he fled before the enemy  the power of the enemy was yet unbroken and the caesar had no sooner separated his troops and fixed his own quarters at sens in the center of gaul than he was surrounded and besieged by a numerous host of germans reduced in this extremity to the resources of his own mind he displayed a prudent intrepidity which compensated for all the deficiencies of the place and garrison and the barbarians at the end of thirty days were obliged to retire with disappointed rage  the conscious pride of julian who was indebted his second campaign only to his sword for this signal deliverance was embittered by the reflection that he a d     was abandoned betrayed and perhaps devoted to destruction by those who were bound to assist him by every tie of honor and fidelity marcellus mastergeneral of the cavalry in gaul interpreting too strictly the jealous orders of the court beheld with supine indifference the distress of julian and had restrained the troops under his command from marching to the relief of sens if the caesar had dissembled in silence so dangerous an insult his person and authority would have been exposed to the contempt of the world and if an action so criminal had been suffered to pass with impunity the emperor would have confirmed the suspicions which received a very specious color from his past conduct toward the princes of the flavian family marcellus was recalled and gently dismissed from his office ammian xvi   libanius speaks rather more advantageously of the military talents of marcellus orat x p     and julian insinuates that he would not have been so easily recalled unless he had given other reasons of offense to the court p      in his room severus was appointed general of the cavalry an experienced soldier of approved courage and fidelity who could advise with respect and execute with zeal and who submitted without reluctance to the supreme command which julian by the interest of his patroness eusebia at length obtained over the armies of gaul severus non discors non arrogans sed longa militiae frugalitate compertus et eum recta praeeuntem secuturus ut ductorem morigerus miles ammian xvi    zosimus l iii p   0  a very judicious plan of operations was adopted for the approaching campaign julian himself at the head of the remains of the veteran bands and of some new levies which he had been permitted to form boldly penetrated into the center of the german cantonments and carefully reestablished the fortifications of saverne in an advantageous post which would either check the incursions or intercept the retreat of the enemy at the same time barbatio general of the infantry advanced from milan with an army of thirty thousand men and passing the mountains prepared to throw a bridge over the rhine in the neighborhood of basil it was reasonable to expect that the alemanni pressed on either side by the roman arms would soon be forced to evacuate the provinces of gaul and to hasten to the defense of their native country but the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity or the envy or the secret instructions of barbatio who acted as if he had been the enemy of the caesar and the secret ally of the barbarians the negligence with which he permitted a troop of pillagers freely to pass and to return almost before the gates of his camp may be imputed to his want of abilities but the treasonable act of burning a number of boats and a superfluous stock of provisions which would have been of the most essential service to the army of gaul was an evidence of his hostile and criminal intentions the germans despised an enemy who appeared destitute either of power or of inclination to offend them and the ignominious retreat of barbatio deprived julian of the expected support and left him to extricate himself from a hazardous situation where he could neither remain with safety nor retire with honor on the design and failure of the cooperation between julian and barbatio see ammianus xvi    and libanius orat x p       as soon as they were delivered from the fears of invasion the alemanni prepared to chastise the battle of strasburgh roman youth who presumed to dispute the possession a d     august of that country which they claimed as their own by the right of conquest and of treaties they employed three days and as many nights in transporting over the rhine their military powers the fierce chnodomar shaking the ponderous javelin which he had victoriously wielded against the brother of magnentius led the van of the barbarians and moderated by his experience the martial ardour which his example inspired ammianus xvi    describes with his inflated eloquence the figure and character of chnodomar audax et fidens ingenti robore lacertorum ubi ardor proelii sperabatur immanis equo spumante sublimior erectus in jaculum formidandae vastitatis armorumque nitore conspicuus antea strenuus et miles et utilis praeter caeteros ductor decentium caesarem superavit aequo mart congressus  he was followed by six other kings by ten princes of regal extraction by a long train of highspirited nobles and by thirtyfive thousand of the bravest warriors of the tribes of germany the confidence derived from the view of their own strength was increased by the intelligence which they received from a deserter that the caesar with a feeble army of thirteen thousand men occupied a post about oneandtwenty miles from their camp of strasburgh with this inadequate force julian resolved to seek and to encounter the barbarian host and the chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of separately engaging the dispersed parties of the alemanni the romans marched in close order and in two columns the cavalry on the right the infantry on the left and the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the enemy that julian was desirous of deferring the battle till the next morning and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhausted strength by the necessary refreshments of sleep and food yielding however with some reluctance to the clamours of the soldiers and even to the opinion of his council he exhorted them to justify by their valor the eager impatience which in case of a defeat would be universally branded with the epithets of rashness and presumption the trumpets sounded the military shout was heard through the field and the two armies rushed with equal fury to the charge the caesar who conducted in person his right wing depended on the dexterity of his archers and the weight of his cuirassiers but his ranks were instantly broken by an irregular mixture of light horse and of lightinfantry and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of six hundred of his most renowned cuirassiers after the battle julian ventured to revive the rigor of ancient discipline by exposing these fugitives in female apparel to the derision of the whole camp in the next campaign these troops nobly retrieved their honor zosimus l iii p      the fugitives were stopped and rallied by the presence and authority of julian who careless of his own safety threw himself before them and urging every motive of shame and honor led them back against the victorious enemy the conflict between the two lines of infantry was obstinate and bloody the germans possessed the superiority of strength and stature the romans that of discipline and temper and as the barbarians who served under the standard of the empire united the respective advantages of both parties their strenuous efforts guided by a skilful leader at length determined the event of the day the romans lost four tribunes and two hundred and fortythree soldiers in this memorable battle of strasburgh so glorious to the caesar julian himself ad s p q athen p     speaks of the battle of strasburgh with the modesty of conscious merit  zosimus compares it with the victory of alexander over darius and yet we are at a loss to discover any of those strokes of military genius which six the attention of ages on the conduct and success of a single day  and so salutary to the afflicted provinces of gaul six thousand of the alemanni were slain in the field without including those who were drowned in the rhine or transfixed with darts whilst they attempted to swim across the river ammianus xvi    libanius adds  000 more to the number of the slain orat x p     but these trifling differences disappear before the  0000 barbarians whom zosimus has sacrificed to the glory of his hero l iii p     we might attribute this extravagant number to the carelessness of transcribers if this credulous or partial historian had not swelled the army of   000 alemanni to an innumerable multitude of barbarians  it is our own fault if this detection does not inspire us with proper distrust on similar occasions  chnodomar himself was surrounded and taken prisoner with three of his brave companions who had devoted themselves to follow in life or death the fate of their chieftain julian received him with military pomp in the council of his officers and expressing a generous pity for the fallen state dissembled his inward contempt for the abject humiliation of his captive instead of exhibiting the vanquished king of the alemanni as a grateful spectacle to the cities of gaul he respectfully laid at the feet of the emperor this splendid trophy of his victory chnodomar experienced an honorable treatment but the impatient barbarian could not long survive his defeat his confinement and his exile ammian xvi    libanius orat x p       after julian had repulsed the alemanni from julian subdues the franks the provinces of the upper rhine he turned his arms against the franks who were seated nearer a d     to the ocean on the confines of gaul and germany and who from their numbers and still more from their intrepid valor had ever been esteemed the most formidable of the barbarians libanius orat iii p     draws a very lively picture of the manners of the franks  although they were strongly actuated by the allurements of rapine they professed a disinterested love of war which they considered as the supreme honor and felicity of human nature and their minds and bodies were so completely hardened by perpectual action that according to the lively expression of an orator the snows of winter were as pleasant to them as the flowers of spring in the month of december which followed the battle of strasburg julian attacked a body of six hundred franks who had thrown themselves into two castles on the meuse ammianus xvii   libanius orat x p     the greek orator by misapprehending a passage of julian has been induced to represent the franks as consisting of a thousand men and as his head was always full of the peloponnesian war he compares them to the lacedaemonians who were besieged and taken in the island of sphacteria  in the midst of that severe season they sustained with inflexible constancy a siege of fiftyfour days till at length exhausted by hunger and satisfied that the vigilance of the enemy in breaking the ice of the river left them no hopes of escape the franks consented for the first time to dispense with the ancient law which commanded them to conquer or to die the caesar immediately sent his captives to the court of constantius who

spirit of this passage  rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroes to the choicest troops of his domestic guards the obstinate resistance of this handful of franks apprised julian of the difficulties of the expedition which he meditated for the ensuing spring against the whole body of the nation his rapid diligence surprised and astonished the active barbarians ordering his soldiers to provide themselves with biscuit for twenty days he suddenly pitched his camp near tongres while the enemy still supposed him in his winter quarters of paris expecting the slow arrival of his convoys from aquitain without allowing the franks to unite or to deliberate he skilfully spread his legions from cologne to the ocean and by the terror as well as by the success of his arms soon reduced the suppliant tribes to implore the clemency and to obey the commands of their conqueror the chamavians submissively retired to their former habitations beyond the rhine but the salians were permitted to possess their new establishment of toxandria as the subjects and auxiliaries of the roman empire ammian xvii   zosimus l iii p        0 his narrative is darkened by a mixture of fable and julian ad s p q athen p   0 his expression  this difference of treatment confirms the opinion that the salian franks were permitted to retain the settlements in toxandria  the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and perpetual inspectors were appointed to reside among the franks with the authority of enforcing the strict observance of the conditions an incident is related interesting enough in itself and by no means repugnant to the character of julian who ingeniously contrived both the plot and the catastrophe of the tragedy when the chamavians sued for peace he required the son of their king as the only hostage in whom he could rely a mournful silence interrupted by tears and groans declared the sad perplexity of the barbarians and their aged chief lamented in pathetic language that his private loss was now embittered by a sense of the public calamity while the chamavians lay prostrate at the foot of his throne the royal captive whom they believed to have been slain unexpectedly appeared before their eyes and as soon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention the caesar addressed the assembly in the following terms behold the son the prince whom you wept you had lost him by your fault god and the romans have restored him to you i shall still preserve and educate the youth rather as a monument of my own virtue than as a pledge of your sincerity should you presume to violate the faith which you have sworn the arms of the republic will avenge the perfidy not on the innocent but on the guilty the barbarians withdrew from his presence impressed with the warmest sentiments of gratitude and admiration this interesting story which zosimus has abridged is related by eunapius in excerpt legationum p          with all the amplifications of grecian rhetoric but the silence of libanius of ammianus and of julian himself renders the truth of it extremely suspicious   it was not enough for julian to have delivered makes three expeditions beyond the rhine the provinces of gaul from the barbarians of germany he aspired to emulate the glory of the first and most illustrious of the emperors after a d             whose example he composed his own commentaries of the gallic war libanius the friend of julian clearly insinuates orat iv p     that his hero had composed the history of his gallic campaigns but zosimus l iii p   0 seems to have derived his information only from the orations  and the epistles of julian the discourse which is addressed to the athenians contains an accurate though general account of the war against the germans  caesar has related with conscious pride the manner in which he twice passed the rhine julian could boast that before he assumed the title of augustus he had carried the roman eagles beyond that great river in three successful expeditions see ammian xvii    0 xviii   and zosim l iii p     julian ad s p q athen p   0  the consternation of the germans after the battle of strasburgh encouraged him to the first attempt and the reluctance of the troops soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of a leader who shared the fatigues and dangers which he imposed on the meanest of the soldiers the villages on either side of the meyn which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle felt the ravages of an invading army the principal houses constructed with some imitation of roman elegance were consumed by the flames and the caesar boldly advanced about ten miles till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest undermined by subterraneous passages which threatened with secret snares and ambush every step of the assailant the ground was already covered with snow and julian after repairing an ancient castle which had been erected by trajan granted a truce of ten months to the submissive barbarians at the expiration of the truce julian undertook a second expedition beyond the rhine to humble the pride of surmar and hortaire two of the kings of the alemanni who had been present at the battle of strasburgh they promised to restore all the roman captives who yet remained alive and as the caesar had procured an exact account from the cities and villages of gaul of the inhabitants whom they had lost he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readiness and accuracy which almost established the belief of his supernatural knowledge his third expedition was still more splendid and important than the two former the germans had collected their military powers and moved along the opposite banks of the river with a design of destroying the bridge and of preventing the passage of the romans but this judicious plan of defense was disconcerted by a skilful diversion three hundred light armed and active soldiers were detached in forty small boats to fall down the stream in silence and to land at some distance from the posts of the enemy they executed their orders with so much boldness and celerity that they had almost surprised the barbarian chiefs who returned in the fearless confidence of intoxication from one of their nocturnal festivals without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter and devastation it is sufficient to observe that julian dictated his own conditions of peace to six of the haughtiest kings of the alemanni three of whom were permitted to view the severe discipline and martial pomp of a roman camp followed by twenty thousand captives whom he had rescued from the chains of the barbarians the caesar repassed the rhine after terminating a war the success of which has been compared to the ancient glories of the punic and cimbric victories  as soon as the valor and conduct of julian restores the cities of gaul had secured an interval of peace he applied himself to a work more congenial to his humane and philosophic temper the cities of gaul which had suffered from the inroads of the barbarians he diligently repaired and seven important posts between mentz and the mouth of the rhine are particularly mentioned as having been rebuilt and fortified by the order of julian ammian xviii   libanius orat x p       0 of these seven posts four are at present towns of some consequence bingen andernach bonn and nuyss the other three tricesimae quadriburgium and castra herculis or heraclea no longer subsist but there is room to believe that on the ground of quadriburgium the dutch have constructed the fort of schenk a name so offensive to the fastidious delicacy of boileau see danville notice de lancienne gaul p     boileau epitre iv and the notes  the vanquished germans had submitted to the just but humiliating condition of preparing and conveying the necessary materials the active zeal of julian urged the prosecution of the work and such was the spirit which he had diffused among the troops that the auxiliaries themselves waving their exemption from any duties of fatigue contended in the most servile labors with the diligence of the roman soldiers it was incumbent on the caesar to provide for the subsistence as well as for the safety of the inhabitants and of the garrisons the desertion of the former and the mutiny of the latter must have been the fatal and inevitable consequences of famine the tillage of the provinces of gaul had been interrupted by the calamities of war but the scanty harvests of the continent were supplied by his paternal care from the plenty of the adjacent island six hundred large barks framed in the forest of the ardennes made several voyages to the coast of britain and returning from thence laden with corn sailed up the rhine and distributed their cargoes to the several towns and fortresses along the banks of the river we may credit julian himself orat ad s p q atheniensem p   0 who gives a very particular account of the transaction zosimus adds two hundred vessels more l iii p     if we compute the  00 corn ships of julian at only seventy tons each they were capable of exporting   0000 quarters see arbuthnots weights and measures p     and the country which could bear so large an exportation must already have attained an improved state of agriculture  the arms of julian had restored a free and secure navigation which constantius had offered to purchase at the expense of his dignity and of a tributary present of two thousand pounds of silver the emperor parsimoniously refused to his soldiers the sums which he granted with a lavish and trembling hand to the barbarians the dexterity as well as the firmness of julian was put to a severe trial when he took the field with a discontented army which had already served two campaigns without receiving any regular pay or any extraordinary donative the troops once broke out into a mutiny immediately before the second passage of the rhine ammian xvii     a tender regard for the peace and happiness of civil administration of julian his subjects was the ruling principle which directed or seemed to direct the administration of julian ammian xvi   xviii   mamertinus in panegyr vet xi    he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters to the offices of civil government and affected to assume with more pleasure the character of a magistrate than that of a general before he took the field he devolved on the provincial governors most of the public and private causes which had been referred to his tribunal but on his return he carefully revised their proceedings mitigated the rigor of the law and pronounced a second judgment on the judges themselves superior to the last temptation of virtuous minds an indiscreet and intemperate zeal for justice he restrained with calmness and dignity the warmth of an advocate who prosecuted for extortion the president of the narbonnese province who will ever be found guilty exclaimed the vehement delphidius if it be enough to deny and who replied julian will ever be innocent if it is sufficient to affirm in the general administration of peace and war the interest of the sovereign is commonly the same as that of his people but constantius would have thought himself deeply injured if the virtues of julian had defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from an oppressed and exhausted country the prince who was invested with the ensigns of royalty might sometimes presume to correct the rapacious insolence of the inferior agents to expose their corrupt arts and to introduce an equal and easier mode of collection but the management of the finances was more safely entrusted to florentius praetorian prefect of gaul an effeminate tyrant incapable of pity or remorse and the haughty minister complained of the most decent and gentle opposition while julian himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own behavior the caesar had rejected with abhorrence a mandate for the levy of an extraordinary tax a new superdiction which the prefect had offered for his signature and the faithful picture of the public misery by which he had been obliged to justify his refusal offended the court of constantius we may enjoy the pleasure of reading the sentiments of julian as he expresses them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his most intimate friends after stating his own conduct he proceeds in the following terms was it possible for the disciple of plato and aristotle to act otherwise than i have done could i abandon the unhappy subjects entrusted to my care was i not called upon to defend them from the repeated injuries of these unfeeling robbers a tribune who deserts his post is punished with death and deprived of the honors of burial with what justice could i pronounce his sentence if in the hour of danger i myself neglected a duty far more sacred and far more important god has placed me in this elevated post his providence will guard and support me should i be condemned to suffer i shall derive comfort from the testimony of a pure and upright conscience would to heaven that i still possessed a counselor like sallust if they think proper to send me a successor i shall submit without reluctance and had much rather improve the short opportunity of doing good than enjoy a long and lasting impunity of evil ammian xvii   julian epistol xv edit spanheim such a conduct almost justifies the encomium of mamertinus ita illi anni spatia divisa sunt ut aut barbaros domitet aut civibus jura restituat perpetuum professus aut contra hostem aut contra vitia cortamen  the precarious and dependent situation of julian displayed his virtues and concealed his defects the young hero who supported in gaul the throne of constantius was not permitted to reform the vices of the government but he had courage to alleviate or to pity the distress of the people unless he had been able to revive the martial spirit of the romans or to introduce the arts of industry and refinement among their savage enemies he could not entertain any rational hopes of securing the public tranquillity either by the peace or conquest of germany yet the victories of julian suspended for a short time the inroads of the barbarians and delayed the ruin of the western empire  his salutary influence restored the cities of description of paris gaul which had been so long exposed to the evils of civil discord barbarian war and domestic tyranny and the spirit of industry was revived with the hopes of enjoyment agriculture manufactures and commerce again flourished under the protection of the laws and the curiae or civil corporations were again filled with useful and respectable members the youth were no longer apprehensive of marriage and married persons were no longer apprehensive of posterity the public and private festivals were celebrated with customary pomp and the frequent and secure intercourse of the provinces displayed the image of national prosperity libanius orat parental in imp julian c    in fabricius bibliothec graec tom vii p          a mind like that of julian must have felt the general happiness of which he was the author but he viewed with peculiar satisfaction and complacency the city of paris the seat of his winter residence and the object even of his partial affection see julian in misopogon p   0     the primitive state of paris is illustrated by henry valesius ad ammian xx   his brother hadrian valesius or de valois and m danville in their respective notitias of ancient gaul the abbe de longuerue description de la france tom i p       and m bonamy in the mem de lacademie des inscriptions tom xv p           that splendid capital which now embraces an ample territory on either side of the seine was originally confined to the small island in the midst of the river from whence the inhabitants derived a supply of pure and salubrious water the river bathed the foot of the walls and the town was accessible only by two wooden bridges a forest overspread the northern side of the seine but on the south the ground which now bears the name of the university was insensibly covered with houses and adorned with a palace and amphitheatre baths an aqueduct and a field of mars for the exercise of the roman troops the severity of the climate was tempered by the neighborhood of the ocean and with some precautions which experience had taught the vine and fig tree were successfully cultivated but in remarkable winters the seine was deeply frozen and the huge pieces of ice that floated down the stream might be compared by an asiatic to the blocks of white marble which were extracted from the quarries of phrygia the licentiousness and corruption of antioch recalled to the memory of julian the severe and simple manners of his beloved lutetia  julian in misopogon p   0 leucetia or lutetia was the ancient name of the city which according to the fashion of the fourth century assumed the territorial appellation of parisii  where the amusements of the theater were unknown or despised he indignantly contrasted the effeminate syrians with the brave and honest simplicity of the gauls and almost forgave the intemperance which was the only stain of the celtic character julian in misopogon p       0  if julian could now revisit the capital of france he might converse with men of science and genius capable of understanding and of instructing a disciple of the greeks he might excuse the lively and graceful follies of a nation whose martial spirit has never been enervated by the indulgence of luxury and he must applaud the perfection of that inestimable art which softens and refines and embellishes the intercourse of social life  chap xx the motives progress and effects of the conversion of constantine  legal establishment and constitution of the christian or catholic church the public establishment of christianity may be considered as one of those important and domestic revolutions which excite the most lively curiosity and afford the most valuable instruction the victories and the civil policy of constantine no longer influence the state of europe but a considerable portion of the globe still retains the impression which it received from the conversion of that monarch and the ecclesiastical institutions of his reign are still connected by an indissoluble chain with the opinions the passions and the interests of the present generation  in the consideration of a subject which may be date of the conversion of constantine examined with impartiality but cannot be viewed with indifference a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature that of ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of constantine the eloquent lactantius in the midst a d  0  of his court seems impatient the date of the divine institutions of lactantius has been accurately discussed difficulties have been started solutions proposed

p        0 lardners credibility part ii vol vii p        for my own part i am almost convinced that lactantius dedicated his institutions to the sovereign of gaul at a time when galerius maximin and

the gods of rome and of his ancestors zosimus l ii p  0   the perplexity a d     produced by these discordant authorities is derived from the behavior of constantine himself according to the strictness of ecclesiastical language the first of the christian emperors was unworthy of that name till the moment of his death since it was only during his last illness a d     that he received as a

first time eusebius in vit constant l iv c    immediately before his baptism and death from the connection of these two facts valesius ad loc eusebius has drawn the conclusion which is reluctantly admitted by tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p     and opposed with feeble arguments by mosheim p      and was afterward admitted by the initiatory rites of baptism into the number of the faithful eusebius in vit constant l iv c          the legend of constantines baptism at rome thirteen years before his death was invented in the eighth century as a proper motive for his donation such has been the gradual progress of knowledge that a story of which cardinal baronius annal ecclesiast a d     no        declared himself the unblushing advocate is now feebly supported even within the verge of the vatican see the antiquitates christianae tom ii p     a work published with six approbations at rome in the year      by father mamachi a learned dominican  the christianity of constantine must be allowed in a much more vague and qualified sense and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and almost imperceptible gradations by which the monarch declared himself the protector and at length the proselyte of the church it was an arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education to acknowledge the divine power of christ and to understand that the truth of his revelation was incompatible with the worship of the gods the obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a national religion and he insensibly discovered his new opinions as far as he could enforce them with safety and with effect during the whole course of his reign the stream of christianity flowed with a gentle though accelerated motion but its general direction was sometimes checked and sometimes diverted by the accidental circumstances of the times and by the prudence or possibly by the caprice of the monarch his ministers were permitted to signify the intentions of their master in the various language which was best adapted to their respective principles the quaestor or secretary who composed the law of the theodosian code makes his master say with indifference hominibus supradictae religionis l xvi tit ii leg   the minister of ecclesiastical affairs was allowed a more devout and respectful style  the legal most holy and catholic worship see eusebius hist eccles l x c   and he artfully balanced the hopes and fears of his subjects by publishing in the same year two edicts a d     the first of which enjoined the solemn observance of sunday cod theodos l ii tit viii leg   cod justinian l iii tit xii leg   constantine styles the lords day dies solis a name which could not offend the ears of his pagan subjects  and the second directed the regular consultation of the aruspices cod theod l xvi tit x leg   godefroy in the character of a commentator endeavors tom vi p     to excuse constantine but the more zealous baronius annal eccles a d     no    censures his profane conduct with truth and asperity  while this important revolution yet remained in suspense the christians and the pagans watched the conduct of their sovereign with the same anxiety but with very opposite sentiments the former were prompted by every motive of zeal as well as vanity to exaggerate the marks of his favor and the evidences of his faith the latter till their just apprehensions were changed into despair and resentment attempted to conceal from the world and from themselves that the gods of rome could no longer reckon the emperor in the number of their votaries the same passions and prejudices have engaged the partial writers of the times to connect the public profession of christianity with the most glorious or the most ignominious era of the reign of constantine  whatever symptoms of christian piety might his pagan superstition transpire in the discourses or actions of constantine he persevered till he was near forty years of age in the practice of the established religion theodoret l i c    seems to insinuate that helena gave her son a christian education but we may be assured from the superior authority of eusebius in vit constant l iii c    that she herself was indebted to constantine for the knowledge of christianity  and the same conduct which in the court of nicomedia might be imputed to his fear could be ascribed only to the inclination or policy of the sovereign of gaul his liberality restored and enriched the temples of the gods the medals which issued from his imperial mint are impressed with the figures and attributes of jupiter and apollo of mars and hercules and his filial piety increased the council of olympus by the solemn apotheosis of his father constantius see the medals of constantine in ducange and banduri as few cities had retained the privilege of coining almost all the medals of that age issued from the mint under the sanction of the imperial authority  but the devotion of constantine was more peculiarly directed to the genius of the sun the apollo of greek and roman mythology and he was pleased to be represented with the symbols of the god of light and poetry the unerring shafts of that deity the brightness of his eyes his laurel wreath immortal beauty and elegant accomplishments seem to point him out as the patron of a young hero the altars of apollo were crowned with the votive offerings of constantine and the credulous multitude were taught to believe that the emperor was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar deity and that either waking or in a vision he was blessed with the auspicious omens of a long and victorious reign the sun was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of constantine and the pagans might reasonably expect that the insulted god would pursue with unrelenting vengeance the impiety of his ungrateful favorite the panegyric of eumenius vii inter panegyr vet which was pronounced a few months before the italian war abounds with the most unexceptionable evidence of the pagan superstition of constantine and of his particular veneration for apollo or the sun to which julian alludes orat vii p      see commentaire de spanheim sur les cesars p       as long as constantine exercised a limited he protects the christians of gaul sovereignty over the provinces of gaul his christian subjects were protected by the authority and perhaps by the laws of a prince who wisely left a d  0       to the gods the care of vindicating their own honor if we may credit the assertion of constantine himself he had been an indignant spectator of the savage cruelties which were inflicted by the hands of roman soldiers on those citizens whose religion was their only crime constantin orat ad sanctos c    but it might easily be shown that the greek translator has improved the sense of the latin original and the aged emperor might recollect the persecution of diocletian with a more lively abhorrence than he had actually felt in the days of his youth and paganism in the east and in the west he had seen the different effects of severity and indulgence and as the former was rendered still more odious by the example of galerius his implacable enemy the latter was recommended to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father the son of constantius immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of persecution and granted the free exercise of their religious ceremonies to all those who had already professed themselves members of the church they were soon encouraged to depend on the favor as well as on the justice of their sovereign who had imbibed a secret and sincere reverence for the name of christ and for the god of the christians see eusebius hist eccles l viii    l ix   and in vit constable l i c       lactant divin institut i   caecilius de mort persecut c      about five months after the conquest of italy a d     march the emperor made a solemn and authentic declaration of his sentiments by the celebrated edict edict of milan of milan which restored peace to the catholic church in the personal interview of the two western princes constantine by the ascendant of genius and power obtained the ready concurrence of his colleague licinius the union of their names and authority disarmed the fury of maximin and after the death of the tyrant of the east the edict of milan was received as a general and fundamental law of the roman world caecilius de mort persecut c    has preserved the latin original and eusebius hist eccles l x c   has given a greektranslation of this perpetual edict which refers to some provisional regulations  the wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the civil and religious rights of which the christians had been so unjustly deprived it was enacted that the places of worship and public lands which had been confiscated should be restored to the church without dispute without delay and without expense and this severe injunction was accompanied with a gracious promise that if any of the purchasers had paid a fair and adequate price they should be indemnified from the imperial treasury the salutary regulations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration and such an equality must have been interpreted by a recent sect as an advantageous and honorable distinction the two emperors proclaim to the world that they have granted a free and absolute power to the christians and to all others of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer to which he has addicted his mind and which he may deem the best adapted to his own use they carefully explain every ambiguous word remove every exception and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict which was designed to establish and secure without any limitation the claims of religious liberty they condescend to assign two weighty reasons which have induced them to allow this universal toleration the humane intention of consulting the peace and happiness of their people and the pious hope that by such a conduct they shall appease and propitiate the deity whose seat is in heaven they gratefully acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the divine favor and they trust that the same providence will for ever continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people from these vague and indefinite expressions of piety three suppositions may be deduced of a different but not of an incompatible nature the mind of constantine might fluctuate between the pagan and the christian religions according to the loose and complying notions of polytheism he might acknowledge the god of the christians as one of the many deities who composed the hierarchy of heaven or perhaps he might embrace the philosophic and pleasing idea that notwithstanding the variety of names of rites and of opinions all the sects and all the nations of mankind are united in the worship of the common father and creator of the universe a panegyric of constantine pronounced seven or eight months after the edict of milan see gothofred chronolog legum p   and tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p     uses the following remarkable expression sum rerum sator cujus tot nomina sunt quot linguas gentium esse voluisti quem enim te ipse dici velis scire non possumus panegyr vet ix    in explaining constantines progress in the faith mosheim p     etc is ingenious subtle prolix   but the counsels of princes are more frequently influenced by views of temporal advantage than use and beauty of the christian morality by considerations of abstract and speculative truth the partial and increasing favor of constantine may naturally be referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of the christians and to a persuasion that the propagation of the gospel would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue whatever latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct whatever indulgence he may claim for his own passions it is undoubtedly his interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil obligations of society but the operation of the wisest laws is imperfect and precarious they seldom inspire virtue they cannot always restrain vice their power is insufficient to prohibit all that they condemn nor can they always punish the actions which they prohibit the legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the powers of education and of opinion but every principle which had once maintained the vigor and purity of rome and sparta was long since extinguished in a declining and despotic empire philosophy still exercised her temperate sway over the human mind but the cause of virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the pagan superstition under these discouraging circumstances a prudent magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which diffused among the people a pure benevolent and universal system of ethics adapted to every duty and every condition of life recommended as the will and reason of the supreme deity and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or punishments the experience of greek and roman history could not inform the world how far the system of national manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine revelation and constantine might listen with some confidence to the flattering and indeed reasonable assurances of lactantius the eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect and almost ventured to promise that the establishment of christianity would restore the innocence and felicity of the primitive age that the worship of the true god would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually considered themselves as the children of a common parent that every impure desire every angry or selfish passion would be restrained by the knowledge of the gospel and that the magistrates might sheath the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated by the sentiments of truth and piety of equity and moderation of harmony and universal love see the elegant description of lactantius divin institut v   who is much more perspicuous and positive than it becomes a discreet prophet   the passive and unresisting obedience which theory and practice of passive obedience bows under the yoke of authority or even of oppression must have appeared in the eyes of an absolute monarch the most conspicuous and useful of the evangelic virtues the political system of the christians is explained by grotius de jure belli et pacis l i c     grotius was a republican and an exile but the mildness of his temper inclined him to support the established powers  the primitive christians derived the institution of civil government not from the consent of the people but from the decrees of heaven the reigning emperor though he had usurped the scepter by treason and murder immediately assumed the sacred character of vicegerent of the deity to the deity alone he was accountable for the abuse of his power and his subjects were indissolubly bound by their oath of fidelity to a tyrant who had violated every law of nature and society the humble christians were sent into the world as sheep among wolves and since they were not permitted to employ force even in the defense of their religion they should be still more criminal if they were tempted to shed the blood of their fellow creatures in disputing the vain privileges or the sordid possessions of this transitory life faithful to the doctrine of the apostle who in the reign of nero had preached the duty of unconditional submission the christians of the three first centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent of the guilt of secret conspiracy or open rebellion while they experienced the rigor of persecution they were never provoked either to meet their tyrants in the field or indignantly to withdraw themselves into some remote and sequestered corner of the globe tertullian apolog c             tamen nunquam albiniani nec nigriani vel cassiani inveniri potuerunt christiani ad scapulam c   if this assertion be strictly true

justified the theory of resistance see his dialogue de jure regni apud scotos tom ii p     0 edit fol ruddiman  perhaps the patience of the primitive church may be ascribed to its weakness as well as to its virtue a sect of unwarlike plebeians without leaders without arms without fortifications must have encountered inevitable destruction in a rash and fruitless resistance to the master of the roman legions but the christians when they deprecated the wrath of diocletian or solicited the favor of constantine could allege with truth and confidence that they held the principle of passive obedience and that in the space of three centuries their conduct had always been conformable to their principles they might add that the throne of the emperors would be established on a fixed and permanent basis if all their subjects embracing the christian doctrine should learn to suffer and to obey  in the general order of providence princes and divine right of constantine tyrants are considered as the ministers of heaven appointed to rule or to chastise the nations of the earth but sacred history affords many illustrious examples of the more immediate interposition of the deity in the government of his chosen people the scepter and the sword were committed to the hands of moses of joshua of gideon of david of the maccabees the virtues of those heroes were the motive or the effect of the divine favor the success of their arms was destined to atchieve the deliverance or the triumph of the church if the judges of israel were occasional and temporary magistrates the kings of judah derived from the royal unction of their great ancestor an hereditary and indefeasible right which could not be forfeited by their own vices nor recalled by the caprice of their subjects the

prophetic tone the future glories of his long and universal reign lactant divin institut i   eusebius in the course of his history his life and his oration repeatedly inculcates the divine right of constantine to the empire  galerius and maximin maxentius and licinius were the rivals who shared with the favorite of heaven the provinces of the empire the tragic deaths of galerius and maximin soon gratified the resentment and fulfilled the sanguine expectations of the christians the success of constantine against maxentius and licinius removed the two formidable competitors who still opposed the triumph of the second david and his cause might seem to claim the peculiar interposition of providence the character of the roman tyrant disgraced the purple and human nature and though the christians might enjoy his precarious favor they were exposed with the rest of his subjects to the effects of his wanton and capricious cruelty the conduct of licinius soon betrayed the reluctance with which he had consented to the wise and humane regulations of the edict of milan the convocation of provincial synods was prohibited in his dominions his christian officers were ignominiously dismissed and if he avoided the guilt or rather danger of a general persecution his partial oppressions were rendered still more odious by the violation of a solemn and voluntary engagement our imperfect knowledge of the persecution of licinius is derived from eusebius hist eccles l x c   vit constantin l i c        l ii c     aurelius victor mentions his cruelty in general terms  while the east according to the lively expression of eusebius was involved in the shades of infernal darkness the auspicious rays of celestial light warmed and illuminated the provinces of the west the piety of constantine was admitted as an unexceptionable proof of the justice of his arms and his use of victory confirmed the opinion of the christians that their hero was inspired and conducted by the lord of hosts the conquest of italy produced a general edict of toleration and as soon as the defeat of licinius had invested constantine with the sole dominion of the roman world he immediately a d     by circular letters exhorted all his subjects to imitate without delay the example of their sovereign and to embrace the divine truth of christianity eusebius in vit constant l ii c             0   the assurance that the elevation of constantine loyalty and zeal of the christian party was intimately connected with the designs of providence instilled into the minds of the christians two opinions which by very different means assisted the accomplishment of the prophecy their warm and active loyalty exhausted in his favor every resource of human industry and they confidently expected that their strenuous efforts would be seconded by some divine and miraculous aid the enemies of constantine have imputed to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with the catholic church and which apparently contributes to the success of his ambition in the beginning of the fourth century the christians still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the empire but among a degenerate people who viewed the change of masters with the indifference of slaves the spirit and union of a religious party might assist the popular leader to whose service from a principle of conscience they had devoted their lives and fortunes in the beginning of the last century the papists of england were only a thirtieth and the protestants of france only a fifteenth part of the respective nations to whom their spirit and power were a constant object of apprehension see the relations which bentivoglio who was then nuncio at brussels and afterward cardinal transmitted to the court of rome relazione tom ii p         bentivoglio was curious wellinformed but somewhat partial  the example of his father had instructed constantine to esteem and to reward the merit of the christians and in the distribution of public offices he had the advantage of strengthening his government by the choice of ministers or generals in whose fidelity he could repose a just and unreserved confidence by the influence of these dignified missionaries the proselytes of the new faith must have multiplied in the court and army the barbarians of germany who filled the ranks of the legions were of a careless temper which acquiesced without resistance in the religion of their commander and when they passed the alps it may fairly be presumed that a great number of the soldiers had already consecrated their swords to the service of christ and of constantine this careless temper of the germans appears almost uniformly in the history of the conversion of each of the tribes the legions of constantine were recruited with germans zosimus l ii p    and the court even of his father had been filled with christians see the first book of the life of constantine by eusebius  the habits of mankind and the interest of religion gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed which had so long prevailed among the christians and in the councils which were assembled under the gracious protection of constantine the authority of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the military oath and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church de his qui arma projiciunt in pace placuit eos abstinere a communione council arelat canon iii the best critics apply these words to the peace of the church  while constantine in his own dominions increased the number and zeal of his faithful adherents he could depend on the support of a powerful faction in those provinces which were still possessed or usurped by his rivals a secret disaffection was diffused among the christian subjects of maxentius and licinius and the resentment which the latter did not attempt to conceal served only to engage them still more deeply in the interest of his competitor the regular correspondence which connected the bishops of the most distant provinces enabled them freely to communicate their wishes and their designs and to transmit without danger any useful intelligence or any pious contributions which might promote the service of constantine who publicly declared that he had taken up arms for the deliverance of the church eusebius always considers the second civil war against licinius as a sort of religious crusade at the invitation of the tyrant some christian officers had resumed their zones or in other words had returned to the military service their conduct was afterward censured by the   th canon of the council of nice if this particular application may be received instead of the

had formerly opened a passage to the israelites through the waters of jordan and had thrown down the walls of jericho at the sound of the trumpets of joshua would display his visible majesty and power in the victory of constantine the evidence of ecclesiastical history is prepared to affirm that their expectations were justified by the conspicuous miracle to which the conversion of the first christian emperor has been almost unanimously ascribed the real or imaginary cause of so important an event deserves and demands the attention of posterity and i shall endeavor to form a just estimate of the famous vision of constantine by a distinct consideration of the standard the dream and the celestial sign by separating the historical the natural and the mavelous parts of this extraordinary story which in the composition of a specious argument have been artfully confounded in one splendid and brittle mass  i an instrument of the tortures which were inflicted the labarum or standard of the cross only on slaves and strangers became an object of horror in the eyes of a roman citizen and the ideas of guilt of pain and of ignominy were closely united with the idea of the cross nomen

of mankind had condescended to suffer see aurelius victor who considers this law as one of the examples of constantines piety an edict so honorable to christianity deserved a place in the theodosian code instead of the indirect mention of it which seems to result from the comparison of the vth and xviiith titles of the ixth book  but the emperor had already learned to despise the prejudices of his education and of his people before he could erect in the midst of rome his own statue bearing a cross in its right hand with an inscription which referred the victory of his arms and the deliverance of rome to the virtue of that salutary sign the true symbol of force and courage eusebius in vit constantin l i c  0 this statue or at least the cross and inscription may be ascribed with more probability to the second or even the third visit of constantine to rome immediately after the defeat of maxentius the minds of the senate and people were scarcely ripe for this public monument  the same symbol sanctified the arms of the soldiers of constantine the cross glittered on their helmet was engraved on their shields was interwoven into their banners and the consecrated emblems which adorned the person of the emperor himself were distinguished only by richer materials and more exquisite workmanship agnoscas regina libens mea signa necesse est in quibus effigies crucis aut gemmata

the labarum the derivation and meaning of the word labarum or laborum which is employed by gregory nazianzen ambrose prudentius etc still remain totally unknown in spite of the efforts of the critics who have ineffectually tortured the latin greek spanish celtic teutonic illyric armenian etc in search of an etymology see ducange in gloss med and insim latinitat sub voce labarum and godefroy ad cod

an opinion that as long as the guards of the labarum were engaged in the execution of their office they were secure and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy in the second civil war licinius felt and dreaded the power of this consecrated banner the sight of which in the distress of battle animated the soldiers of constantine with an invincible enthusiasm and scattered terror and dismay through the ranks of the adverse legions eusebius in vit constantin l ii c       he introduces the labarum before the italian expedition but his narrative seems to indicate that it was never shown at the head of an army till constantine above ten years afterward declared himself the enemy of licinius and the deliverer of the church  the christian emperors who respected the example of constantine displayed in all their military expeditions the standard of the cross but when the degenerate successors of theodosius had ceased to appear in person at the head of their armies the labarum was deposited as a venerable but useless relic in the palace of constantinople see cod theod l vi tit xxv sozomen l i c   theophan chronograph p    theophanes lived toward the end of the eighth century almost five hundred years after constantine the modern greeks were not inclined to display in the field the standard of the empire and of christianity and though they depended on every superstitious hope of

the midst of the ensigns of rome the solemn epithets of safety of the republic glory of the army restoration of public happiness are equally applied to the religious and military trophies and there is

of these medals and quotes a particular dissertation of a jesuit the pere de grainville on this subject   ii in all occasions of danger or distress it was the dream of constantine the practice of the primitive christians to fortify their minds and bodies by the sign of the cross which they used in all their ecclesiastical rites in all the daily occurrences of life as an infallible preservative against every species of spiritual or temporal evil tertullian de corona c   athanasius tom i p  0  the learned jesuit petavius dogmata theolog l xv c    0 has collected many similar passages on the virtues of the cross which in the last age embarrassed our protestant disputants  the authority of the church might alone have had sufficient weight to justify the devotion of constantine who in the same prudent and gradual progress acknowledged the truth and assumed the symbol of christianity but the testimony of a contemporary writer who in a formal treatise has avenged the cause of religion bestows on the piety of the emperor a more awful and sublime character he affirms with the most perfect confidence that in the night which preceded the last battle against maxentius constantine was admonished in a dream to inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the celestial sign of god the sacred monogram of the name of christ that he executed the commands of heaven and that his valor and obedience were rewarded by the decisive victory of the milvian bridge some considerations might perhaps incline a skeptical mind to suspect the judgment or the veracity of the rhetorician whose pen either from zeal or interest was devoted to the cause of the prevailing faction caecilius de m p c    it is certain that this historical declamation was composed and published while licinius sovereign

of increasing their stock of miracles  but if the dream of constantine is separately considered it may be naturally explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the emperor whilst his anxiety for the approaching day which must decide the fate of the empire was suspended by a short and interrupted slumber the venerable form of christ and the wellknown symbol of his religion might forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a prince who reverenced the name and had perhaps secretly implored the power of the god of the christians as readily might a consummate statesman indulge himself in the use of one of those military stratagems one of those pious frauds which philip and sertorius had employed with such art and effect besides these wellknown examples tollius preface to

silence of diodorus plutarch justin etc it may be observed that polyaenus who in a separate chapter l iv c   has collected nineteen military stratagems of antigonus is totally ignorant of this remarkable vision  the praeternatural origin of dreams was universally admitted by the nations of antiquity and a considerable part of the gallic army was already prepared to place their confidence in the salutary sign of the christian religion the secret vision of constantine could be disproved only by the event and the intrepid hero who had passed the alps and the apennine might view with careless despair the consequences of a defeat under the walls of rome the senate and people exulting in their own deliverance from an odious tyrant acknowledged that the victory of constantine surpassed the powers of man without daring to insinuate that it had been obtained by the protection of the gods the triumphal arch which was erected about three years after the event proclaims in ambiguous language that by the greatness of his own mind and by an instinct or impulse of the divinity he had saved and avenged the roman republic instinctu divinitatis mentis magnitudine the inscription on the triumphal arch of constantine which has been copied by baronius gruter etc may still be perused by every curious traveller  the pagan orator who had seized an earlier opportunity of celebrating the virtues of the conqueror supposes that he alone enjoyed a secret and intimate commerce with the supreme being who delegated the care of mortals to his subordinate deities and thus assigns a very plausible reason why the subjects of constantine should not presume to embrace the new religion of their sovereign habes profecto aliquid cum illa mente divina secretum quae delegata

similar standard and to march with an assurance of victory against maxentius and all his enemies eusebius l i c        0 the silence of the same eusebius in his ecclesiastical history is deeply felt by those advocates for the miracle who are not absolutely callous  the learned bishop of caesarea appears to be sensible that the recent discovery of this mavelous anecdote would excite some surprise and distrust among the most pious of his readers yet instead of ascertaining the precise circumstances of time and place which always serve to detect falsehood or establish truth the narrative of constantine seems to indicate that he saw the cross in the sky before he passed the alps against maxentius the scene has been fixed by provincial vanity at treves besancon etc see tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p      instead of collecting and recording the evidence of so many living witnesses who must have been spectators of this stupendous miracle the pious tillemont mem eccles tom vii p      rejects with a sigh the useful acts of artemius a veteran and a martyr who attests as an eyewitness the vision of constantine  eusebius contents himself with alleging a very singular testimony that of the deceased constantine who many years after the event in the freedom of conversation had related to him this extraordinary incident of his own life and had attested the truth of it by a solemn oath the prudence and gratitude of the learned prelate forbade him to suspect the veracity of his victorious master but he plainly intimates that in a fact of such a nature he should have refused his assent to any meaner authority this motive of credibility could not survive the power of the flavian family and the celestial sign which the infidels might afterward deride gelasius cyzic in act council nicen l i c    was disregarded by the christians of the age which immediately followed the conversion of constantine the advocates for the vision are unable to produce a single testimony from the fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries who in their voluminous writings repeatedly celebrate the triumph of the church and of constantine as these venerable men had not any dislike to a miracle we may suspect and the suspicion is confirmed by the ignorance of jerome that they were all unacquainted with the life of constantine by eusebius this tract was recovered by the diligence of those who translated or continued his ecclesiastical history and who have represented in various colors the vision of the cross  but the catholic church both of the east and of the west has adopted a prodigy which favors or seems to favor the popular worship of the cross the vision of constantine maintained an honorable place in the legend of superstition till the bold and sagacious spirit of criticism presumed to depreciate the triumph and to arraign the truth of the first christian emperor godefroy was the first who in the year      not ad philostorgium l i c   p    expressed any doubt of a miracle which had been supported with equal zeal by cardinal baronius and the centuriators of magdeburgh since that time many of the protestant critics have inclined toward doubt and disbelief the objections are urged with great force by m chauffepie dictionnaire critique tom iv p       and in the year      a doctor of sorbonne the abbe du voism published an apology which deserves the praise of learning and moderation   the protestant and philosophic readers of the present age will incline to believe that in the account of his own conversion constantine attested the conversion of constantine might be sincere a wilful falsehood by a solemn and deliberate perjury they may not hesitate to pronounce that in the choice of a religion his mind was determined only by a sense of interest and that according to the expression of a profane poet lors constantin dit ces propres paroles jai renverse le culte des idols sur les debris de leurs temples fumans au dieu du ciel jai prodigue lencens mais

constantine or of christianity in an age of religious fervor the most artful statesmen are observed to feel some part of the enthusiasm which they inspire and the most orthodox saints assume the dangerous privilege of defending the cause of truth by the arms of deceit and falsehood personal interest is often the standard of our belief as well as of our practice and the same motives of temporal advantage which might influence the public conduct and professions of constantine would insensibly dispose his mind to embrace a religion so propitious to his fame and fortunes his vanity was gratified by the flattering assurance that he had been chosen by heaven to reign over the earth success had justified his divine title to the throne and that title was founded on the truth of the christian revelation as real virtue is sometimes excited by undeserved applause the specious piety of constantine if at first it was only specious might gradually by the influence of praise of habit

virtues of his father the rise and appearance of an heavenly race a primitive nation throughout the world and the gradual restoration of the innocence and felicity of the golden age the poet was perhaps unconscious of the secret sense and object of these sublime predictions which have been so unworthily applied to the infant son of a consul or a triumvir the different claims of an elder and younger son of pollio of julia of drusus of marcellus are found to be incompatible with chronology history and the good sense of virgil  but if a more splendid and indeed specious interpretation of the fourth eclogue contributed to the conversion of the first christian emperor virgil may deserve to be ranked among the most successful missionaries of the gospel see lowth de sacra poesi hebraeorum praelect xxi p          in the examination of the fourth eclogue the respectable bishop of london has displayed learning taste ingenuity and a temperate enthusiasm which exalts his fancy without degrading his judgment   the awful mysteries of the christian faith and devotion and privileges of constantine worship were concealed from the eyes of strangers and even of catechumens with an affected secrecy which served to excite their wonder and curiosity the distinction between the public and the secret parts of divine service the missa catechumenorum and the missa fidelium and the mysterious veil which piety or policy had cast over the latter are very judiciously explained by thiers exposition du saint sacrement l i c       p        but as on this subject the papists may reasonably be suspected a protestant reader will depend with more confidence on the learned bingham antiquities l x c    but the severe rules of discipline which the prudence of the bishops had instituted were relaxed by the same prudence in favor of an imperial proselyte whom it was so important to allure by every gentle condescension into the pale of the church and constantine was permitted at least by a tacit dispensation to enjoy most of the privileges before he had contracted any of the obligations of a christian instead of retiring from the congregation when the voice of the deacon dismissed the profane multitude he prayed with the faithful disputed with the bishops preached on the most sublime and intricate subjects of theology celebrated with sacred rites the vigil

deserted the altars of the gods the master of the empire would have been left destitute of any form of religious worship in his last visit to rome he piously disclaimed and insulted the superstition

sacremens tom i p     0  dom martenne de ritibus ecclesiae antiquis tom i and by bingham in the tenth and eleventh books of his christian antiquities one circumstance may be observed in which the modern churches have materially departed from the ancient custom the sacrament of baptism even when it was administered to infants was immediately followed by confirmation and the holy communion was regularly administered by the bishop himself with his assistant clergy in the cathedral church of the diocese during the fifty days between the solemn festivals of easter and pentecost and this holy term admitted a numerous band of infants and adult persons into the bosom of the church the discretion of parents often suspended the baptism of their children till they could understand the obligations which they contracted the severity of ancient bishops exacted from the new converts a noviciate of two or three years and the catechumens themselves from different motives of a temporal or a spiritual nature were seldom impatient to assume the character of perfect and initiated christians the sacrament of baptism was supposed to contain a full and absolute expiation of sin and the soul was instantly restored to its original purity and entitled to the promise of eternal salvation among the proselytes of christianity there were many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite which could not be repeated to throw away an inestimable privilege which could never be recovered by the delay of their baptism they could venture freely to indulge their passions in the enjoyment of this world while they still retained in their own hands the means of a sure and easy absolution the fathers who censured this criminal delay could not deny the certain and victorious efficacy even of a deathbed baptism the ingenious rhetoric of chrysostom could find only three arguments against these prudent christians   that we should love and pursue virtue for her own sake and not merely for the reward   that we may be surprised by death without an opportunity of baptism   that although we shall be placed in heaven we shall only twinkle like little stars when compared to the suns of righteousness who have run their appointed course with labor with success and with glory chrysostom in epist ad hebraeos homil xiii apud chardon hist des sacremens tom i p    i believe that this delay of baptism though attended with the most pernicious consequences was never condemned by any general or provincial council or by any public act or declaration of the church the zeal of the bishops was easily kindled on much slighter occasions  the sublime theory of the gospel had made a much fainter impression on the heart than on the understanding of constantine himself he pursued the great object of his ambition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy and after the victory he abandoned himself without moderation to the abuse of his fortune instead of asserting his just superiority above the imperfect heroism and profane philosophy of trajan and the antonines the mature age of constantine forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in his youth as he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth he proportionably declined in the practice of virtue and the same year of his reign in which he convened the council of nice was polluted by the execution or rather murder of his eldest son this date is alone sufficient to refute the ignorant and malicious suggestions of zosimus zosimus l ii p  0  for this disingenuous falsehood he has deserved and experienced the harshest treatment from all the ecclesiastical writers except cardinal baronius a d     no        who had occasion to employ the infidel on a particular service against the arian eusebius  who affirms that after the death of crispus the remorse of his father accepted from the ministers of christianity the expiation which he had vainly solicited from the pagan pontiffs at the time of the death of crispus the emperor could no longer hesitate in the choice of a religion he could no longer be ignorant that the church was possessed of an infallible remedy though he chose to defer the application of it till the approach of death had removed the temptation and danger of a relapse the bishops whom he summoned in his last illness to the palace of nicomedia were edified by the fervor with which he requested and received the sacrament of baptism by the solemn protestation that the remainder of his life should be worthy of a disciple of christ and by his humble refusal to wear the imperial purple after he had been clothed in the white garment of a neophyte the example and reputation of constantine seemed to countenance the delay of baptism eusebius l iv c          the bishop of caesarea supposes the salvation of constantine with the most perfect confidence  future tyrants were encouraged to believe that the innocent blood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be washed away in the waters of regeneration and the abuse of religion dangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue  the gratitude of the church has exalted the virtues and excused the failings of a generous patron who seated christianity on the throne of propagation of christianity the roman world and the greeks who celebrate the festival of the imperial saint seldom mention the name of constantine without adding the title of equal to the apostles see tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p     the greeks the russians and in the darker ages the latins themselves have been desirous of placing constantine in the catalogue of saints  such a comparison if it alludes to the character of those divine missionaries must be imputed to the extravagance of impious flattery but if the parallel is confined to the extent and number of their evangelic victories the success of constantine might perhaps equal that of the apostles themselves by the edicts of toleration he removed the temporal disadvantages which had hitherto retarded the progress of christianity and its active and numerous ministers received a free permission a liberal encouragement to recommend the salutary truths of revelation by every argument which could affect the reason or piety of mankind the exact balance of the two religions continued but a moment and the piercing eye of ambition and avarice soon discovered that the profession of christianity might contribute to the interest of the present as well as of a future life see the third and fourth books of his life he was accustomed to say that

imperfect exception related only to the jews and the great body of slaves who were the property of christian or pagan masters could not improve their temporal condition by changing their religion i am ignorant by what guides the abbe raynal was deceived as the total absence of quotations is the unpardonable blemish of his entertaining history  the salvation of the common people was purchased at an easy rate if it be true that in one year twelve thousand men were baptized at rome besides a proportionable number of women and children and that a white garment with twenty pieces of gold had been promised by the emperor to every convert see acta st silvestri and hist eccles nicephor callist l vii c    ap baronium annal eccles a d     no       such evidence is contemptible enough but these circumstances are in themselves so probable that the learned dr howell history of the world vol iii p    has not scrupled to adopt them  the powerful influence of constantine was not circumscribed by the narrow limits of his life or of his dominions the education which he bestowed on his sons and nephews secured to the empire a race of princes whose faith was still more lively and sincere as they imbibed in their earliest infancy the spirit or at least the doctrine of christianity war and commerce had spread the knowledge of the gospel beyond the confines of the roman provinces and the barbarians who had disdained an humble and proscribed sect soon learned to esteem a religion which had been so lately embraced by the greatest monarch and the most civilized nation of the globe the conversion of the barbarians under the reign of constantine is celebrated by the ecclesiastical historians see sozomen l ii c   and theodoret l i c       but rufinus the latin translator of eusebius deserves to be considered as an original authority his information was curiously collected from one of the companions of the apostle of aethiopia and from bacurius an iberian prince who was count of the domestics father mamachi has given an ample compilation on the progress of christianity in the first and second volumes of his great but imperfect work  the goths and germans who enlisted under the standard of rome revered the cross which glittered at the head of the legions and their fierce countrymen received at the same time the lessons of faith and of humanity the kings of iberia and armenia worshipped the god of their protector and their subjects who have invariably preserved the name of christians soon formed a sacred and perpetual connection with their roman brethren the christians of persia were suspected in time of war of preferring their religion to their country but as long as peace subsisted between the two empires the persecuting spirit of the magi was effectually restrained by the interposition of constantine see in eusebius in vit constant l iv c   the pressing and pathetic epistle of constantine in favor of his christian brethren of persia  the

extraction was invested with the double character of ambassador and bishop he embarked on the red sea with two hundred horses of the purest breed of cappadocia which were sent by the emperor to the

enquiry concerning the seat of paradise strange monsters etc   the irresistible power of the roman emperors change of the national religion was displayed in the important and dangerous change of the national religion the terrors of a military force silenced the faint and unsupported murmurs of the pagans and there was reason to expect that the cheerful submission of the christian clergy as well as people would be the result of conscience and gratitude it was long since established as a fundamental maxim of the roman constitution that every rank of citizens were alike subject to the laws and that the care of religion was the right as well as duty of the civil magistrate constantine and his successors could not easily persuade themselves that they had forfeited by their conversion any branch of the imperial prerogatives or that they were incapable of giving laws to a religion which they had protected and embraced the emperors still continued to exercise a supreme jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical order and the sixteenth book of the a d          theodosian code represents under a variety of titles the authority which they assumed in the government of the catholic church  but the distinction of the spiritual and temporal distinction of the spiritual and temporal powers powers see the epistle of osius ap athanasium vol i p   0 the public remonstrance which osius was forced to address to the son contained the same principles of ecclesiastical and civil government which he had secretly instilled into the mind of the father  which had never been imposed on the free spirit of greece and rome was introduced and confirmed by the legal establishment of christianity the office of supreme pontiff which from the time of numa to that of augustus had always been exercised by one of the most eminent of the senators was at length united to the imperial dignity the first magistrate of the state as often as he was prompted by superstition or policy performed with his own hands the sacerdotal functions m de la bastie memoires de lacademie des inscriptions tom xv p        has evidently proved that augustus and his successors exercised in person all the sacred functions of pontifex maximus or high priest of the roman empire  nor was there any order of priests either at rome or in the provinces who claimed a more sacred character among men or a more intimate communication with the gods but in the christian church which entrusts the service of the altar to a perpetual succession of consecrated ministers the monarch whose spiritual rank is less honorable than that of the meanest deacon was seated below the rails of the sanctuary and confounded with the rest of the faithful multitude something of a contrary practice had insensibly prevailed in the church of constantinople but the rigid ambrose commanded theodosius to retire below the rails and taught him to know the difference between a king and a priest see theodoret l v c     the emperor might be saluted as the father of his people but he owed a filial duty and reverence to the fathers of the church and the same marks of respect which constantine had paid to the persons of saints and confessors were soon exacted by the pride of the episcopal order at the table of the emperor maximus martin bishop of tours received the cup from an attendant and grave it to the presbyter his companion before he allowed the emperor to drink the empress waited on martin at table sulpicius severus in vit sti martin c    and dialogue ii   yet it may be doubted whether these extraordinary compliments were paid to the bishop or the saint the honors usually granted to the former character may be seen in binghams antiquities l ii c   and vales ad theodoret l iv c   see the haughty ceremonial which leontius bishop of tripoli imposed on the empress tillemont hist des empereurs tom iv p     patres apostol tom ii p      a secret conflict between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions embarrased the operations of the roman government and a pious emperor was alarmed by the guilt and danger of touching with a profane hand the ark of the covenant the separation of men into the two orders of the clergy and of the laity was indeed familiar to many nations of antiquity and the priests of india of persia of assyria of judea of aethiopia of egypt and of gaul derived from a celestial origin the temporal power and possessions which they had acquired these venerable institutions had gradually assimilated themselves to the manners and government of their respective countries plutarch in his treatise of isis and osiris informs us that the kings of egypt who were not already priests were initiated after their election into the sacerdotal order  but the opposition or contempt of the civil power served to cement the discipline of the primitive church the christians had been obliged to elect their own magistrates to raise and distribute a peculiar revenue and to regulate the internal policy of their republic by a code of laws which were ratified by the consent of the people and the practice of three hundred years when constantine embraced the faith of the christians he seemed to contract a perpetual alliance with a distinct and independent society and the privileges granted or confirmed by that emperor or by his successors were accepted not as the precarious favors of the court but as the just and inalienable rights of the ecclesiastical order  the catholic church was administered by the state of the bishops under the christian emperors spiritual and legal jurisdiction of eighteen hundred bishops the numbers are not ascertained by any ancient writer or original catalogue for the partial lists of the eastern churches are comparatively modern the patient diligence of charles a sto paolo of luke holstenius and of bingham has laboriously investigated all the episcopal sees of the catholic church which was almost commensurate with the roman empire the ninth book of the christian antiquities is a very accurate map of ecclesiastical geography  of whom one thousand were seated in the greek and eight hundred in the latin provinces of the empire the extent and boundaries of their respective dioceses had been variously and accidentally decided by the zeal and success of the first missionaries by the wishes of the people and by the propagation of the gospel episcopal churches were closely planted along the banks of the nile on the seacoast of africa in the proconsular asia and through the southern provinces of italy the bishops of gaul and spain of thrace and pontus reigned over an ample territory and delegated their rural suffragans to execute the subordinate duties of the pastoral office on the subject of the rural bishops or chorepiscopi who voted in synods and conferred the minor orders see thomassin discipline de leglise tom i p     etc and chardon hist des sacremens tom v p     etc they do not appear till the fourth century and this equivocal character which had excited the jealousy of the prelates was abolished before the end of the tenth both in the east and the west  a christian diocese might be spread over a province or reduced to a village but all the bishops possessed an equal and indelible character they all derived the same powers and privileges from the apostles from the people and from the laws while the civil and military professions were separated by the policy of constantine a new and perpetual order of ecclesiastical ministers always respectable sometimes dangerous was established in the church and state the important review of their station and attributes may be distributed under the following heads i popular election ii ordination of the clergy iii property iv civil jurisdiction v spiritual censures vi exercise of public oratory vii privilege of legislative assemblies  i the freedom of elections subsisted long after   election of bishops the legal establishment of christianity thomassin discipline de leglise tom ii l ii c      p          has copiously treated of the election of bishops during the five first centuries both in the east and in the west but he shows a very partial bias in favor of the episcopal aristocracy bingham l iv c   is moderate and chardon hist des sacremens tom v p  0       is very clear and concise  and the subjects of rome enjoyed in the church the privilege which they had lost in the republic of choosing the magistrates whom they were bound to obey as soon as a bishop had closed his eyes the metropolitan issued a commission to one of his suffragans to administer the vacant see and prepare within a limited time the future election the right of voting was vested in the inferior clergy who were best qualified to judge of the merit of the candidates in the senators or nobles of the city all those who were distinguished by their rank or property and finally in the whole body of the people who on the appointed day flocked in multitudes from the most remote parts of the diocese incredibilis multitudo non solum ex eo oppido tours sed etiam ex vicinis urbibus ad suffragia fetenda convenerat etc sulpicius severus in vit martin c   the council of laodicea canon xiii prohibits mobs and tumults and justinian confined the right of election to the nobility novell cxxiii    and sometimes silenced by their tumultuous acclamations the voice of reason and the laws of discipline these acclamations might accidentally fix on the head of the most deserving competitor of some ancient presbyter some holy monk or some layman conspicuous for his zeal and piety but the episcopal chair was solicited especially in the great and opulent cities of the empire as a temporal rather than as a spiritual dignity the interested views the selfish and angry passions the arts of perfidy and dissimulation the secret corruption the open and even bloody violence which had formerly disgraced the freedom of election in the commonwealths of greece and rome too often influenced the choice of the successors of the apostles while one of the candidates boasted the honors of his family a second allured his judges by the delicacies of a plentiful table and a third more guilty than his rivals offered to share the plunder of the church among the accomplices of his sacrilegious hopes the epistles of sidonius apollinaris iv    vii     exhibit some of the scandals of the gallican church and gaul was less polished and less corrupt than the east  the civil as well as ecclesiastical laws attempted to exclude the populace from this solemn and important transaction the canons of ancient discipline by requiring several episcopal qualifications of age station etc restrained in some measure the indiscriminate caprice of the electors the authority of the provincial bishops who were assembled in the vacant church to consecrate the choice of the people was interposed to moderate their passions and to correct their mistakes the bishops could refuse to ordain an unworthy candidate and the rage of contending factions sometimes accepted their impartial mediation the submission or the resistance of the clergy and people on various occasions afforded different precedents which were insensibly converted into positive laws and provincial customs a compromise was sometimes introduced by law or by consent either the bishops or the people chose one of the three candidates who had been named by the other party  but it was every where admitted as a fundamental maxim of religious policy that no bishop could be imposed on an orthodox church without the consent of its members the emperors as the guardians of the public peace and as the first citizens of rome and constantinople might effectually declare their wishes in the choice of a primate but those absolute monarchs respected the freedom of ecclesiastical elections and while they distributed and resumed the honors of the state and army they allowed eighteen hundred perpetual magistrates to receive their important offices from the free suffrages of the people all the examples quoted by thomassin discipline de leglise tom ii l ii c   p  0       appear to be extraordinary acts of power and even of oppression the confirmation of the bishop of alexandria is mentioned by philostorgius as a more regular proceeding hist eccles l ii     it was agreeable to the dictates of justice that these magistrates should not desert an honorable station from which they could not be removed but the wisdom of councils endeavored without much success to enforce the residence and to prevent the translation of bishops the discipline of the west was indeed less relaxed than that of the east but the same passions which made those regulations necessary rendered them ineffectual the reproaches which angry prelates have so vehemently urged against each other serve only to expose their common guilt and their mutual indiscretion  ii the bishops alone possessed the faculty of ii ordination of the clergy spiritual generation and this extraordinary privilege might compensate in some degree for the painful celibacy the celibacy of the clergy during the first five or six centuries is a subject of discipline and indeed of controversy which has been very diligently examined see in particular thomassin discipline de leglise tom i l ii c lx lxi p

the remark of caesar vi    that in the celtic hierarchy some room was left for choice and emulation  such institutions were founded for possession rather than conquest the children of the priests enjoyed with proud and indolent security their sacred inheritance and the fiery spirit of enthusiasm was abated by the cares the pleasures and the endearments of domestic life but the christian sanctuary was open to every ambitious candidate who aspired to its heavenly promises or temporal possessions the office of priests like that of soldiers or magistrates was strenuously exercised by those men whose temper and abilities had prompted them to embrace the ecclesiastical profession or who had been selected by a discerning bishop as the best qualified to promote the glory and interest

might invalidate the holy rites till the abuse was restrained by the prudence of the laws might constrain the reluctant and protect the distressed and the imposition of hands for ever bestowed some of the most valuable privileges of civil society the whole body of the catholic clergy more numerous perhaps than the legions was exempted by the emperors from all service private or public all municipal offices and all personal taxes and contributions which pressed on their fellowcitizens with intolerable weight and the duties of their holy profession were accepted as a full discharge of their obligations to the republic the charter of immunities which the clergy obtained from the christian emperors is contained in the   th book of the theodosian code and is illustrated with tolerable candor by the learned godefroy whose mind was balanced by the opposite prejudices of a civilian and a protestant  each bishop acquired an absolute and indefeasible right to the perpetual obedience of

magistrate must have been received in all the tribunals as a maxim of civil law  the christians not only recovered the lands and houses of which a d     they had been stripped by the persecuting laws of diocletian but they acquired a perfect title to all the possessions which they had hitherto enjoyed by the connivance of the magistrate as soon as christianity became the religion of the emperor and the empire the national clergy might claim a decent and honorable maintenance and the payment of an annual tax might have delivered the people from the more oppressive tribute which superstition imposes on her votaries but as the wants and expenses of the church increased with her prosperity the ecclesiastical order was still supported and enriched by the voluntary oblations of the faithful eight years after the edict of milan constantine granted to all his a d     subjects the free and universal permission of bequeathing their fortunes to the holy catholic church habeat unusquisque

of both sexes who embraced the monastic life became the peculiar favorites of their sovereign the christian temples of antioch alexandria jerusalem constantinople etc displayed the ostentatious piety

columns the pavement were incrusted with variegated marbles the most precious ornaments of gold and silver of silk and gems were profusely dedicated to the service of the altar and this specious magnificence was supported on the solid and perpetual basis of landed property in the space of two centuries from the reign of constantine to that of justinian the eighteen hundred churches of the empire were enriched by the frequent and unalienable gifts of the prince and people an annual income of six hundred pounds sterling may be reasonably assigned to the bishops who were placed at an equal distance between riches and poverty see justinian novell cxxiii   the revenue of the patriarchs and the most wealthy bishops is not expressed the highest annual valuation of a bishopric is

modern authors who have expressly treated the subject or swell these notes to a disagreeable and disproportioned size    under a despotic government the bishops alone enjoyed and asserted the inestimable privilege of being tried only by their peers and even in a capital accusation a synod of their brethren were the sole judges of their guilt or innocence such a tribunal unless it was inflamed by personal resentment or religious discord might be favorable or even partial to the sacerdotal order but constantine was satisfied tillemont has collected from rufinus theodoret etc the sentiments and language of constantine mem eccles tom iii p       0  that secret impunity would be less pernicious than public scandal and the nicene council was edified by his public declaration that if he surprised a bishop in the act of adultery he should cast his imperial mantle over the episcopal sinner   the domestic jurisdiction of the bishops was at once a privilege and a restraint of the ecclesiastical order whose civil causes were decently withdrawn from the cognizance of a secular judge their venial offenses were not exposed to the shame of a public trial or punishment and the gentle correction which the tenderness of youth may endure from its parents or instructors was inflicted by the temperate severity of the bishops but if the clergy were guilty of any crime which could not be sufficiently expiated by their degradation from an honorable and beneficial profession the roman magistrate drew the sword of justice without any regard to ecclesiastical immunities   the arbitration of the bishops was ratified by a positive law and the judges were instructed to execute without appeal or delay the episcopal decrees whose validity had hitherto depended on the consent of the parties the conversion of the magistrates themselves and of the whole empire might gradually remove the fears and scruples of the christians but they still resorted to the tribunal of the bishops whose abilities and integrity they esteemed and the venerable austin enjoyed the satisfaction of complaining that his spiritual functions were perpetually interrupted by the invidious labor of deciding the claim or the possession of silver and gold of lands and cattle   the ancient privilege of sanctuary was transferred to the christian temples and extended by the liberal piety of the younger theodosius to the precincts of consecrated ground see cod theod l ix tit xlv leg   in the works of fra paolo tom iv p     etc there is an excellent discourse on the origin claims abuses and limits of sanctuaries he justly observes that ancient greece might perhaps contain fifteen or twenty azyla or sanctuaries a number which at present may be found in italy within the walls of a single city  the fugitive and even guilty suppliants were permitted to implore either the justice or the mercy of the deity and his ministers the rash violence of despotism was suspended by the mild interposition of the church and the lives or fortunes of the most eminent subjects might be protected by the mediation of the bishop  v the bishop was the perpetual censor of the v spiritual censures

charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation not a moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the separated congregations from any share of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had so liberally bestowed on the orthodox clergy but as the sectaries might still exist under the cloud of royal disgrace the conquest of the east was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total destruction eusebius in vit constantin l iii c              after a preamble filled with passion and reproach constantine absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the heretics and confiscates their public property to the use either of the revenue or of the catholic church the sects against whom the imperial severity was directed appear to have been the adherents of paul of samosata the montanists of phrygia who maintained an enthusiastic succession of prophecy the novatians who sternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance the marcionites and valentinians under whose leading banners the various gnostics of asia and egypt had insensibly rallied and perhaps the manichaeans who had recently imported from persia a more artful composition of oriental and christian theology after some examination of the various opinions of tillemont beausobre lardner etc i am convinced that manes did not propagate his sect even in persia before the year

be found in baronius annal eccl a d      the design of extirpating the name or at least of restraining the progress of these odious heretics was prosecuted with vigor and effect some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and had pleaded for the rights of humanity two immaterial circumstances may serve however to prove that the mind of constantine was not entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry before he condemned the manichaeans and their kindred sects he resolved to make an accurate enquiry into the nature of their religious principles as if he distrusted the impartiality of his ecclesiastical counselors this delicate commission was entrusted to a civil magistrate whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed and of whose venal character he was probably ignorant constantinus enim cum limatius superstitionum quaereret sectas manichaeorum

accusations which african controversy assailed the throne of constantine as soon as the death of maxentius had submitted africa to his a d     victorious arms were ill adapted to edify an imperfect proselyte he learned with surprise that the provinces of that great country from the confines of cyrene to the columns of hercules were distracted with religious discord the best materials for this part of ecclesiastical history may be found in the edition of optatus milevitanus published paris   00 by m dupin who has enriched it with critical notes geographical discussions original records and an accurate abridgement of the whole controversy m de tillemont has bestowed on the donatists the greatest part of a volume tom vi part i and i am indebted to him for an ample collection of all the passages of his favorite st augustine which relate to those heretics  the source of the division was derived from a double election in the church of carthage the second in rank and opulence of the ecclesiastical thrones of the west caecilian and majorinus were the two rival primates of africa and the death of the latter soon made room for donatus who by his superior abilities and apparent virtues was the firmest support of his party the advantage which caecilian might claim from the priority of his ordination was destroyed by the illegal or at least indecent haste with which it had been performed without expecting the arrival of the bishops of numidia the authority of these bishops who to the number of seventy condemned caecilian and consecrated majorinus is again weakened by the infamy of some of their personal characters and by the female intrigues sacrilegious bargains and tumultuous proceedings which are imputed to this numidian council schisma igitur illo tempore confusae mulieris iracundia peperit ambitus nutrivit avaritia roboravit optatus l i c    the language of purpurius is that of a furious madman dicitur te necasse filios sororis tuae duos purpurius

brethren or rather to his accomplices let him come hither to receive our imposition of hands and we will break his head by way of penance optat l i c     the bishops of the contending factions maintained with equal ardour and obstinacy that their adversaries were degraded or at least dishonored by the odious crime of delivering the holy scriptures to the officers of diocletian from their mutual reproaches as well as from the story of this dark transaction it may justly be inferred that the late persecution had embittered the zeal without reforming the manners of the african christians that divided church was incapable of affording an impartial judicature the controversy was solemnly tried in five successive tribunals which were appointed by the emperor and the whole proceeding from the first appeal to the final sentence lasted above three years a severe inquisition which was taken by the praetorian vicar and the proconsul of africa the report of two episcopal visitors who had been sent to carthage the decrees of the councils of rome and of arles and the supreme judgment of constantine himself in his sacred consistory were all favorable to the cause of caecilian and he was unanimously acknowledged by the civil and ecclesiastical powers as the true and lawful primate of africa the honors and estates of the church were attributed to his suffragan bishops and it was not without difficulty that constantine was satisfied with inflicting the punishment of exile on the principal leaders of the donatist faction as their cause was examined with attention perhaps it was determined with justice perhaps their complaint was not without foundation that the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious arts of his favorite osius the influence of falsehood and corruption might procure the condemnation of the innocent or aggravate the sentence of the guilty such an act however of injustice if it concluded an importunate dispute might be numbered among the transient evils of a despotic administration which are neither felt nor remembered by posterity  but this incident so inconsiderable that it schism of the donatists scarcely deserves a place in history was productive of a memorable schism which afflicted the provinces a d     of africa above three hundred years and was extinguished only with christianity itself the inflexible zeal of freedom and fanaticism animated the donatists to refuse obedience to the usurpers whose election they disputed and whose spiritual powers they denied excluded from the civil and religious communion of mankind they boldly excommunicated the rest of mankind who had embraced the impious party of caecilian and of the traditors from whom he derived his pretended ordination they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline this rigid theory was supported by the most uncharitable conduct whenever they acquired a proselyte even from the distant provinces of the east they carefully repeated the sacred rites of baptism the councils of arles of nice and of trent confirmed the wise and moderate practice of the church of rome the donatists however had the advantage of maintaining the sentiment of cyprian and of a considerable part of the primitive church vincentius lirinensis p     ap tillemont mem eccles tom vi p     has explained why the donatists are eternally burning with the devil while st cyprian reigns in heaven with jesus christ and ordination as they rejected the validity of those which he had already received from the hands of heretics or schismatics bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the donatists if they obtained possession of a church which had been used by their catholic adversaries they purified the unhallowed building with the same jealous care which a temple of idols might have required they washed the pavement scraped the walls burnt the altar which was commonly of wood melted the consecrated plate and cast the holy eucharist to the dogs with every circumstance of ignominy which could provoke and perpetuate the animosity of religious factions see the sixth book of optatus milevitanus p      00  notwithstanding this irreconcilable aversion the two parties who were mixed and separated in all the cities of africa had the same language and manners the same zeal and learning the same faith and worship proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the donatists still maintained in some provinces particularly in numidia their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate but the invincible spirit of the sect sometimes preyed on its own vitals and the bosom of their schismatical church was torn by intestine divisions a fourth part of the donatist bishops followed the independent standard of the maximianists the narrow and solitary path which their first leaders had marked out continued to deviate from the great society of mankind even the imperceptible sect of the rogatians could affirm without a blush that when christ should descend to judge the earth he would find his true religion preserved only in a few nameless villages of the caesarean mauritania tillemont mem ecclesiastiques tom vi part i p     he laughs at their partial cruelty he revered augustine the great doctor of the system of predestination   the schism of the donatists was confined to africa the more diffusive mischief of the trinitarian controversy successively penetrated into the trinitarian controversy every part of the christian world the former was an accidental quarrel occasioned by the abuse of freedom the latter was a high and mysterious argument derived from the abuse of philosophy from the age of constantine to that of clovis and theodoric the temporal interests both of the romans and barbarians were deeply involved in the theological disputes of arianism the historian may therefore be permitted respectfully to withdraw the veil of the sanctuary and to deduce the progress of reason and faith of error and passion from the school of plato to the decline and fall of the empire  the genius of plato informed by his own the system of plato before christ   0 meditation or by the traditional knowledge of the priests of egypt plato egyptum peragravit ut a sacerdotibus barbaris numeros et caelestia acciperet

sublime contemplation of the first selfexistent necessary cause of the universe the athenian sage was incapable of conceiving how the simple unity of his essence could admit the infinite variety of distinct and successive ideas which compose the model of the intellectual world how a being purely incorporeal could execute that perfect model and mould with a plastic hand the rude and independent chaos the vain hope of extricating himself from these difficulties which must ever oppress the feeble powers of the human mind might induce plato to consider the divine nature under the threefold modification of the first cause the reason or logos and the soul or spirit of the universe the logos his poetical imagination sometimes fixed and animated these metaphysical abstractions the three archical or original principles were represented in the platonic system as three gods united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable generation and the logos was particularly considered under the more accessible character of the son of an eternal father and the creator and governor of the world such appear to have been the secret doctrines which were cautiously whispered in the gardens of the academy and which according to the more recent disciples of plato could not be perfectly understood till after an assiduous study of thirty years the modern guides who lead me to the knowledge of

sagacious of the christian theologians the great athanasius himself has heartily confessed athanasius tom i p  0  his expressions have an uncommon energy and as he was writing to monks there could not be any occasion for him to effect a rational language  that whenever he forced his understanding to meditate on the divinity of the logos his toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves that the more he thought the less he comprehended and the more he wrote the less capable was he of expressing his thoughts in every step of the enquiry we are compelled to feel and acknowledge the immeasurable disproportion between the size of the object and the capacity of the human mind we may strive to abstract the notions of time of space and of matter which so closely adhere to all the perceptions of our experimental knowledge but as soon as we presume to reason of infinite substance of spiritual generation as often as we deduce any positive conclusions from a negative idea we are involved in darkness perplexity and inevitable contradiction as these difficulties arise from the nature of the subject they oppress with the same insuperable weight the philosophic and the theological disputant but we may observe two essential and peculiar circumstances which discriminated the doctrines of the catholic church from the opinions of the platonic school  i a chosen society of philosophers men of a law of the christians liberal education and curious disposition might silently meditate and temperately discuss in the gardens of athens or the library of alexandria the abstruse questions of metaphysical science the lofty speculations which neither convinced the understanding nor agitated the passions of the platonists themselves were carelessly overlooked by the idle the busy and even the studious part of mankind in a treatise which professed to explain the opinions of the ancient philosophers concerning the nature of the gods we might expect to discover the theological trinity of plato but cicero very honestly confessed that though he had translated the  could never understand that mysterious  praef ad l xii in isaiam tom v p       but after the logos

the roman world those persons who from their age or sex or occupations were the least qualified to judge who were the least exercised in the habits of abstract reasoning aspired to contemplate the economy of the divine nature and it is the boast of tertullian tertullian in apolog c     simonide his remarks on the  profound and interesting  that a christian mechanic could readily answer such questions as had perplexed the wisest of the grecian sages where the subject lies so far beyond our reach the difference between the highest and the lowest of human understandings may indeed be calculated as infinitely small yet the degree of weakness may perhaps be measured by the degree of obstinacy and dogmatic confidence these speculations instead of being treated as the amusement of a vacant hour became the most serious business of the present and the most useful preparation for a future life a theology which it was incumbent to believe which it was impious to doubt and which it might be dangerous and even fatal to mistake became the familiar topic of private meditation and popular discourse the cold indifference of philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion and even the metaphors of common language suggested the fallacious prejudices of sense and experience the christians who abhorred the gross and impure generation of the greek mythology lactantius iv   yet the probole or prolatio which the most orthodox divines borrowed without scruple from the valentinians and illustrated by the comparisons of a fountain and stream the sun and its rays etc either meant nothing or favored a material idea of the divine generation see beausobre tom i l iii c   p      were tempted to argue from the familiar analogy of the filial and paternal relations the

toward the throne of heaven had not been imperceptibly checked by the apprehension of violating the unity and sole supremacy of the great father of christ and of the universe the suspense and fluctuation produced in the minds of the christians by these opposite tendencies may be observed in the writings of the theologians who flourished after the end of the apostolic age and before the origin of the arian controversy their suffrage is claimed with equal confidence by the orthodox and by the heretical parties and the most inquisitive critics have fairly allowed that if they had the good fortune of possessing the catholic verity they have delivered their conceptions in loose inaccurate and sometimes contradictory language see daille de usu patrum and le clerc bibliotheque

deep impression been erazed by the learned defense of bishop bull   ii the devotion of individuals was the first authority of the church circumstance which distinguished the christians from the platonists the second was the authority of the church the disciples of philosophy asserted the rights of intellectual freedom and their respect for the sentiments of their teachers was a liberal and voluntary tribute which they offered to superior reason but the christians formed a numerous and disciplined society and the jurisdiction of their laws and magistrates was strictly exercised over the minds of the faithful the loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually confined by creeds and confessions the most ancient creeds were drawn up with the greatest latitude see bull judicium eccles cathol who tries to prevent episcopius from deriving any advantage from this observation  the freedom of private judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods the authority of a theologian was determined by his ecclesiastical rank and the episcopal successors of the apostles inflicted the censures of the church on those who deviated from the orthodox belief but in an age of religious controversy every act of oppression adds new force to the elastic vigor of the mind and the zeal or obstinacy of a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by secret motives of ambition or avarice a metaphysical argument became the cause or pretense of political contests the subtleties of the platonic school were used as the badges factions of popular factions and the distance which separated their respective tenets was enlarged or magnified by the acrimony of dispute as long as the dark heresies of praxeas and sabellius labored to confound the father with the son the heresies of praxeas sabellius etc are accurately explained by mosheim p       0      praxeas who came to rome about the end of the second century deceived for some time the simplicity of the bishop and was confuted by the pen of the angry tertullian  the orthodox party might be excused if they adhered more strictly and more earnestly to the distinction than to the equality of the divine persons but as soon as the heat of controversy had subsided and the progress of the sabellians was no longer an object of terror to the churches of rome of africa or of egypt the tide of theological opinion began to flow with a gentle but steady motion toward the contrary extreme and the most orthodox doctors allowed themselves the use of the terms and definitions which had been censured in the mouth of the sectaries socrates acknowledges that the heresy of arius proceeded from his strong desire to embrace an opinion the most diametrically opposite to that of sabellius  after the edict of toleration had restored peace and leisure to the christians the trinitarian controversy was revived in the ancient seat of platonism the learned the opulent the tumultuous city of alexandria and the flame of religious discord was rapidly communicated from the schools to the clergy the people the province and the east the abstruse question of the eternity of the logos was agitated in ecclesiastic conferences and popular sermons and the heterodox opinions of arius the figure and manners of arius the character and numbers of his first proselytes are painted in very lively colors by epiphanius tom i haeres lxix

implacable adversaries have acknowledged the learning and blameless life of that eminent presbyter who in a former election had declared and perhaps generously declined his pretensions to the episcopal throne see philostorgius l i c   and godefroys ample commentary yet the credibility of philostorgius is lessened in the eyes of the orthodox by his arianism and in those of rational critics

pronounced his final sentence as an absolute rule of faith sozomen l i c    represents alexander as indifferent and even ignorant in the beginning of the controversy while socrates l i c   ascribes the origin of the dispute to the vain curiosity of his theological speculations dr jortin remarks on ecclesiastical history vol ii p     has censured with his usual freedom the conduct of alexander   the undaunted presbyter who presumed to resist the authority of his angry bishop was separated from the communion of the church but the pride of arius was supported by the applause of a numerous party he reckoned among his immediate followers two bishops of egypt seven presbyters twelve deacons and what may appear almost incredible seven hundred virgins a large majority of the bishops of asia appeared to support or favor his cause and their measures were conducted by eusebius of caesarea the most learned of the christian prelates and by eusebius of nicomedia who had acquired the reputation of a statesman without forfeiting that of a saint synods in palestine and bithynia were opposed to the synods of egypt the attention of the prince and people was attracted by this theological dispute and the decision at the end of six years the flames of arianism might burn for some time in secret but there is reason to believe that they burst out with violence as early as the year     tillemont mem eccles tom vi p        0  was referred to the a d          supreme authority of the general council of nice  when the mysteries of the christian faith were three systems of the trinity dangerously exposed to public debate it might be observed that the human understanding was capable of forming three distinct though imperfect systems concerning the nature of the divine trinity and it was pronounced that none of these systems in a pure and absolute sense were exempt from heresy and error quid credidit certe aut tria nomina audiens tres deos esse credidit et idololatra effectus est aut

arius and his disciples the logos was a dependent and spontaneous production created from nothing by the will of the father the son by whom all things were made as the doctrine of absolute creation

his ample spirit and impressed the effulgence of his glory visible image of invisible perfection he saw at an immeasurable distance beneath his feet the thrones of the brightest archangels yet he shone only with a reflected light and like the sons of the roman emperors who were invested with the titles of caesar or augustus this profane and absurd simile is employed by several of the primitive fathers particularly by athenagoras in his apology to the emperor marcus and his son and it is alleged without censure by bull himself see defens fid nicen f iii c   no    he governed the universe in obedience to the will of his father and monarch ii in the second hypothesis the logos tritheism possessed all the inherent incommunicable perfections which religion and philosophy appropriate to the supreme god three distinct and infinite minds or substances three coequal and coeternal beings composed the divine essence see cudworths intellectual system p         this dangerous hypothesis was countenanced by the two gregorys of nyssa and nazianzen by cyril of alexandria john of damascus etc see cudworth p  0  le clerc bibliotheque universelle tom xviii p      0   and it would have implied contradiction that any of them should not have existed or that they should ever cease to exist augustine seems to envy the freedom of the philosophers liberis verbis loquuntur philosophi nos autem non dicimus duo vel tria principia duos vel tres deos de civitat dei x     the advocates of a system which seemed to establish three independent deities attempted to preserve the unity of the first cause so conspicuous in the design and order of the world by the perpetual concord of their administration and the essential agreement of their will a faint resemblance of this unity of action may be discovered in the societies of men and even of animals the causes which disturb their harmony proceed only from the imperfection and inequality of their faculties but the omnipotence which is guided by infinite wisdom and goodness cannot fail of choosing the same means for the accomplishment of the same ends iii three beings who by the selfderived sabellianism necessity of their existence possess all the divine attributes in the most perfect degree who are eternal in duration infinite in space and intimately present to each other and to the whole universe irresistibly force themselves on the astonished mind as one and the same being boethius who was deeply versed in the philosophy of plato and aristotle explains the unity of the trinity by the indifference of the three persons see the judicious remarks of le clerc bibliotheque choisie tom xvi p     etc  who in the economy of grace as well as in that of nature may manifest himself under different forms and be considered under different aspects by this hypothesis a real substantial trinity is refined into a trinity of names and abstract modifications that subsist only in the mind which conceives them the logos is no longer a person but an attribute and it is only in a figurative sense that the epithet of son can be applied to the eternal reason which was with god from the beginning and by which not by whom all things were made the incarnation of the logos is reduced to a mere inspiration of the divine wisdom which filled the soul and directed all the actions of the man jesus thus after revolving round the theological circle we are surprised to find that the sabellian ends where the ebionite had begun and that the incomprehensible mystery which excites our adoration eludes our enquiry if the sabellians were startled at this conclusion they were driven down another precipice into the confession that the father was born of a virgin that he had suffered on the cross and thus deserved the odious epithet of patripassians with which they were branded by their adversaries see the invectives of tertullian against praxeas and the temperate reflections of mosheim p         and beausobre tom i l iii c   p       if the bishops of the council of nice the transactions of the council of nice are related by the ancients not only in a partial but in a very imperfect manner such a picture as frapaolo would have

universelle tom x p          had council of nice been permitted to follow the unbiassed dictates a d     of their conscience arius and his associates could scarcely have flattered themselves with the hopes of obtaining a majority of votes in favor of an hypothesis so directly adverse to the two most popular opinions of the catholic world the arians soon perceived the danger of their situation and prudently assumed those modest virtues which in the fury of civil and religious dissentions are seldom practiced or even praised except by the weaker party they recommended the exercise of christian charity and moderation urged the incomprehensible nature of the controversy disclaimed the use of any terms of definitions which could not be found in the scriptures and offered by very liberal concessions to satisfy their adversaries without renouncing the integrity of their own principles the victorious faction received all their proposals with haughty suspicion and anxiously sought for some irreconcilable mark of distinction the rejection of which might involve the arians in the guilt and consequences of heresy a letter was publicly read and ignominiously torn in which their patron eusebius of nicomedia ingenuously confessed that the admission of the homoousion or consubstantial the homoousion a word already familiar to the platonists was incompatible with the principles of their theological system the fortunate opportunity was eagerly embraced by the bishops who governed the resolutions of the synod and according to the lively expression of ambrose we are indebted to ambrose de fide l iii cap ult for the knowledge of this curious anecdote hoc verbum posuerunt patres quod viderunt adversariis esse formidini ut tanquam evaginato ab ipsis gladio ipsum nefandae caput heraeseos amputarent  they used the sword which heresy itself had drawn from the scabbard to cut off the head of the hated monster the consubstantiality of the father and the son was established by the council of nice and has been unanimously received as a fundamental article of the christian faith by the consent of the greek the latin the oriental and the protestant churches but if the same word had not served to stigmatize the heretics and to unite the catholics it would have been inadequate to the purpose of the majority by whom it was introduced into the orthodox creed this majority was divided into two parties distinguished by a contrary tendency to the sentiments of the tritheists and of the sabellians but as those opposite extremes seemed to overthrow the foundations either of natural or revealed religion they mutually agreed to qualify the rigor of their principles and to disavow the just but invidious consequences which might be urged by their antagonists the interest of the common cause inclined them to join their numbers and to conceal their differences their animosity was softened by the healing counsels of toleration and their disputes were suspended by the use of the mysterious homoousion which either party was free to interpret according to their peculiar tenets the sabellian sense which about fifty years before had obliged the council of antioch see bull defens fid nicen sect ii c i p        he thinks it his duty to reconcile two orthodox synods to prohibit this celebrated term had endeared it to those theologians who entertained a secret but partial affection for a nominal trinity but the more fashionable saints of the arian times the intrepid athanasius the learned gregory nazianzen and the other pillars of the church who supported with ability and success the nicene doctrine appeared to consider the expression of substance as if it had been synonimous with that of nature and they ventured to illustrate their meaning by affirming that three men as they belong to the same common species are consubstantial or homoousian to each other according to aristotle the stars were homoousian to each other that homoousius means of one substance in kind has been shown by petavius curcellaeus cudworth le clerc etc and to prove it would be actum agere this is the just remark of dr jortin vol ii p     who examines the arian controversy with

vibrate on either side beyond this consecrated ground the heretics and the demons lurked in ambush to surprise and devour the unhappy wanderer but as the degrees of theological hatred depend on the spirit of the war rather than on the importance of the controversy the heretics who degraded were treated with more severity than those who annihilated the person of the son the life of athanasius was consumed in irreconcilable opposition to the impious madness of the arians the ordinary appellation with which athanasius and his followers chose to compliment the arians was that of ariomanites  but he defended above twenty years the sabellianism of marcellus of ancyra and when at last he was compelled to withdraw himself from his communion he continued to mention with an ambiguous smile the

christian philosopher it is a thing says hilary equally deplorable and dangerous that there are as many creeds as opinions among men as many doctrines as inclinations and as many sources of blasphemy as there are faults among us because we make creeds arbitrarily and explain them as arbitrarily the homoousion is rejected and received and explained away by successive synods the partial or total resemblance of the father and of the son is a subject of dispute for these unhappy times every year nay every moon we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries we repent of what we have done we

which for the most part disclaimed the odious name of their parent arius it is amusing enough to delineate the form and to trace the vegetation of a singular plant but the tedious detail of leaves without flowers and of branches without fruit would soon exhaust the patience and disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student one question which gradually arose from the arian controversy may however be noticed as it served to produce and discriminate the three sects who were united only by their common aversion to the homoousion of the nicene synod   if they were asked whether the son was like unto the father the question was resolutely answered in the negative by the heretics who adhered to the principles of arius or indeed to those of philosophy which seem to establish an infinite difference between the creator and the most excellent of his creatures this obvious consequence was maintained by aetius in philostorgius l iii c    the character and adventures of aetius appear

convince such talents engaged the friendship of the arian bishops till they were forced to renounce and even to persecute a dangerous ally who by the accuracy of his reasoning had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion and offended the piety of their most devoted followers   the omnipotence of the creator suggested a specious and respectful solution of the likeness of the father and the son and faith might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny that the supreme god might communicate his infinite perfections and create a being similar only to himself yet according to the

interest and who occupied the principal thrones of the east they detested perhaps with some affectation the impiety of aetius they professed to believe either without reserve or according to the scriptures that the son was different from all other creatures and similar only to the father but they denied that he was either of the same or of a similar substance sometimes boldly justifying their dissent and sometimes objecting to the use of the word substance which seems to imply an adequate or at least a distinct notion of the nature of the deity   the sect which asserted the doctrine of a similar substance was the most numerous at least in the provinces of asia and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of seleucia sabinus ap socrat l ii c    had copied the acts

profane of every age have derided the furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the homoousians and the homoiousians as it frequently happens that the sounds and characters which approach the nearest to each other accidentally represent the most opposite ideas the observation would be itself ridiculous if it were possible to mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of the semiarians as they were improperly styled and that of the catholics themselves the bishop of poitiers who in his phrygian exile very wisely aimed at a coalition

easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by philosophy and the submission which is enjoined by religion the inhabitants of the west were of a less inquisitive spirit their passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects their minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute and such was the happy ignorance of the gallican church that hilary himself above thirty years

by a latin noun  which had been consecrated by the gospel or by the church to express the mysteries of the christian faith and a verbal defect might introduce into the latin theology a long train of error or perplexity the preference which the fourth council of the lateran at length gave to a numerical rather than a generical unity see petav tom ii l iv c    p     was favored by the latin language  seems to excite the idea of substance trinitas of qualities  but as the western provincials had the good fortune of deriving their religion from an orthodox source they preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had accepted with docility and when the arian pestilence approached their frontiers they were supplied with the seasonable preservative of the homoousion by the paternal care of the roman pontiff their sentiments and their temper were displayed in the memorable synod of council of rimini rimini which surpassed in numbers the council a d   0 of nice since it was composed of above four hundred bishops of italy africa spain gaul britain and illyricum from the first debates it appeared that only fourscore prelates adhered to the party though they affected to anathematise the name and memory of arius but this inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill of experience and of discipline and the minority was conducted by valens and ursacius two bishops of illyricum who had spent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils and who had been trained under the eusebian banner in the religious wars of the east by their arguments and negociations they embarrassed they confounded they at last deceived the honest simplicity of the latin bishops who suffered the palladium of the faith to be extorted from their hands by fraud and importunity rather than by open violence the council of rimini was not allowed to separate till the members had imprudently subscribed a captious creed in which some expressions susceptible of an heretical sense were inserted in the room of the homoousion it was on this occasion that according to jerome the world was surprised to find itself arian ingemuit totus orbis et arianum se esse miratus est hieronym adv lucifer tom i p      but the bishops of the latin provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses than they discovered their mistake and repented of their weakness the ignominious capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence and the homoousian standard which had been shaken but not overthrown was more firmly replanted in all the churches of the west the story of the council of rimini is very elegantly told by sulpicius severus hist sacra l ii p        0 edit lugd bat      and by jerome in his dialogue against the luciferians the design of the latter is to apologize for the conduct of the latin bishops who were deceived and who repented   such was the rise and progress and such were conduct of the emperors in the arian controversy the natural revolutions of those theological disputes which disturbed the peace of christianity under the reigns of constantine and of his sons but as those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith as well as over the lives and fortunes of their subjects the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance and the prerogatives of the king of heaven were settled or changed or modified in the cabinet of an earthly monarch  the unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded indifference of constantine the provinces of the east interrupted the triumph of constantine but the emperor continued for some time to view with cool and careless indifference a d     the object of the dispute as he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of theologians he addressed to the contending parties to alexander and to arius a moderating epistle eusebius in vit constant l ii c        the principles of toleration and religious indifference contained in this epistle have given great offense to baronius tillemont etc who suppose that the emperor had some evil counselor either satan or eusebius at his elbow see jortins remarks tom ii p      which may be ascribed with far greater reason to the untutored sense of a soldier and statesman than to the dictates of any of his episcopal counselors he attributes the origin of the whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question concerning an incomprehensible point of the law which was foolishly asked by the bishop and imprudently resolved by the presbyter he laments that the christian people who had the same god the same religion and the same worship should be divided by such inconsiderable distinctions and he seriously recommends to the clergy of alexandria the example of the greek philosophers who could maintain their arguments without losing their temper and assert their freedom without violating their friendship the indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been perhaps the most effectual method of silencing the dispute if the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous and if constantine himself in the midst of faction and fanaticism could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind but his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the impartiality of the magistrate and to awaken the zeal of the proselyte he was provoked by the insults which had his zeal been offered to his statues he was alarmed by the a d     real as well as the imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief and he extinguished the hope of peace and toleration from the moment that he assembled three hundred bishops within the walls of the same palace the presence of the monarch swelled the importance of the debate his attention multiplied the arguments and he exposed his person with a patient intrepidity which animated the valor of the combatants notwithstanding the applause which has been bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of constantine eusebius in vit constantin l iii c     a roman general whose religion might be still a subject of doubt and whose mind had not been enlightened either by study or by inspiration was indifferently qualified to discuss in the greek language a metaphysical question or an article of faith but the credit of his favorite osius who appears to have presided in the council of nice might dispose the emperor in favor of the orthodox party and a welltimed insinuation that the same eusebius of nicomedia who now protected the heretic had lately assisted the tyrant theodoret has preserved l i c  0 an epistle from constantine to the people of nicomedia in which the monarch declares himself the public accuser of one of his subjects he styles eusebius  and complains of his hostile behavior during the civil war  might exasperate him against their adversaries the nicene creed was ratified by constantine and his firm declaration that those who resisted the divine judgment of the synod must prepare themselves for an immediate exile annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition which from seventeen was almost instantly reduced to two protesting bishops eusebius of caesarea

found the emperor had now imbibed the spirit of controversy and the angry sarcastic style of his edicts was designed to inspire his subjects with the hatred which he had conceived against the enemies of christ socrates l i c   in his circular letters which were addressed to the several cities constantine employed against the heretics the arms of ridicule and comic raillery   but as if the conduct of the emperor had been and the orthodox party guided by passion instead of principle three years from the council of nice were scarcely elapsed a d          before he discovered some symptoms of mercy and even of indulgence toward the proscribed sect which was secretly protected by his favorite sister the exiles were recalled and eusebius who gradually resumed his influence over the mind of constantine was restored to the episcopal throne from which he had been ignominiously degraded arius himself was treated by the whole court with the respect which would have been due to an innocent and oppressed man his faith was approved by the synod of jerusalem and the emperor seemed impatient to repair his injustice by issuing an absolute command that he should be solemnly admitted to the communion in the cathedral of constantinople on the same day which had been fixed for the triumph of arius he expired  and the strange and horrid circumstances of his death might excite a suspicion that the orthodox saints had contributed more efficaciously than by their prayers to deliver the church from the most formidable of her enemies we derive the original story from athanasius tom i p   0 who expresses some reluctance to stigmatize the memory of the dead he might exaggerate but the perpetual commerce of alexandria and constantinople would have rendered it dangerous to invent those who press the literal narrative of the death of arius his bowels suddenly burst out in a privy must make their option between poison and miracle  the three principal leaders of the catholics athanasius of alexandria eustathius of antioch and paul of constantinople were deposed on various accusations by the sentence of numerous councils and were afterward banished into distant provinces by the first of the christian emperors who in the last moments of his life received the rites of baptism from the arian bishop of nicomedia the ecclesiastical government of constantine cannot be justified from the reproach of levity and weakness but the credulous monarch unskilled in the stratagems of theological warfare might be deceived by the modest and specious professions of the heretics whose sentiments he never perfectly understood and while he protected arius and persecuted athanasius he still considered the council of nice as the bulwark of the christian faith and the peculiar glory of his own reign the change in the sentiments or at least in the conduct of constantine may be traced in eusebius in vit constant l iii c    l iv c    socrates l i c        sozomen l ii c        theodoret l i c        and philostorgius l ii c       but the first of these writers was too near the scene of action and the others were too remote from it it is singular enough that the important task of continuing the history of the church should have been left for two laymen and a heretic   the sons of constantine must have been admitted from their childhood into the rank of catechumens but they imitated in the delay of their constantius favors the arians baptism the example of their father like him they presumed to pronounce their judgment on mysteries into which they had never been regularly a d

the sentiments of constantius who inherited the provinces of the east and acquired the possession of the whole empire the arian presbyter or bishop who had secreted for his use the testament of the deceased emperor improved the fortunate occasion which had introduced him to the familiarity of a prince whose public counsels were always swayed by his domestic favorites the eunuchs and slaves

candide chapter iv which ends with one of the first companions of christopher columbus  the partiality which constantius always expressed toward the eusebian faction was insensibly fortified by the dexterous management of their leaders and his victory over the tyrant magnentius increased his inclination as well as ability to employ the arms of power in the cause of arianism while the two armies were engaged in the plains of mursa and the fate of the two rivals depended on the chance of war the son of constantine passed the anxious moments in a church of the martyrs under the walls of the city his spiritual comforter valens the arian bishop of the diocese employed the most artful precautions to obtain such early intelligence as might secure either his favor or his escape a secret chain of swift and trusty messengers informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle and while the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted master valens assured him that the gallic legions gave way and insinuated with some presence of mind that the glorious event had been revealed to him by an angel the grateful emperor ascribed his success to the merits and intercession of the bishop of mursa whose faith had deserved the public and miraculous approbation of heaven sulpicius severus in hist sacra l ii p  0   0   the arians who considered as their own the victory of constantius preferred his glory to that of his father cyril apud baron a d     no    expressly observes that in the reign of constantine the cross had been found in the bowels of the earth but that it had appeared in the reign of constantius in the midst of the heavens this opposition evidently proves that cyril was ignorant of the stupendous miracle to which the conversion of constantine is attributed and this ignorance is the more surprising since it was no more than twelve years after his death that cyril was consecrated bishop of jerusalem by the immediate successor of eusebius of caesarea see tillemont mem eccles tom viii p      cyril bishop of jerusalem immediately composed the description of a celestial cross encircled with a splendid rainbow which during the festival of pentecost about the third hour of the day had appeared over the mount of olives to the edification of the devout pilgrims and the people of the holy city it is not easy to determine how far the ingenuity of cyril might be assisted by some natural appearances of a solar halo  the size of the meteor was gradually magnified and the arian historian has ventured to affirm that it was conspicuous to the two armies in the plains of pannonia

impartially considered the progress of civil or ecclesiastical discord are always entitled to our notice and a short passage of ammianus who served in the armies and studied the character of constantius is perhaps of more value than many pages of theological invectives the christian religion which in itself says that moderate historian is plain and simple he confounded by the dotage of superstition instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority he cherished and propagated by verbal disputes the differences which his vain curiosity had excited the highways were covered with troops of bishops galloping from every side to the assemblies which they call synods and while they labored to reduce the whole sect to their own particular opinions the public establishment of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journies so curious a passage well deserves to be transcribed christianam religionem absolutam et simplicem anili superstitione

ecclesiastical transactions of the reign of constantius would furnish an ample commentary on this remarkable passage which justifies the rational apprehensions of athanasius that the restless activity of the clergy who wandered round the empire in search of the true faith would excite the contempt and laughter of the unbelieving world athanas tom i p   0  as soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of the civil war he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters at arles milan sirmium and constantinople to the amusement or toils of controversy the sword of the magistrate and even of

the unfortunate gallus and even the deaths of the imperial ministers who had been massacred at antioch were imputed to the suggestions of that dangerous sophist the mind of constantius which could neither be moderated by reason nor fixed by faith was blindly impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss by his horror of the opposite extreme he alternately embraced and condemned the sentiments he successively banished and recalled the leaders of the arian and semiarian factions sozomen l iv c    athanas tom i p     tillemont mem eccles tom vii p     has collected several instances of the haughty fanaticism of constantius from the detached treatises of lucifer of cagliari the very titles of these treatises inspire zeal and terror moriendum pro dei filio de regibus

weighing the syllables which composed his fluctuating creeds the subject of his meditation still pursued and occupied his slumbers the incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial visions and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of bishop of bishops from those ecclesiastics who forgot the interest of their order for the gratification of their passions the design of establishing an uniformity of doctrine which had engaged him to convene so many synods in gaul italy illyricum and asia was repeatedly baffled by his own levity by the divisions of the arians and by the resistance of the catholics and he resolved as the last and decisive effort imperiously to dictate the decrees of a general council the destructive earthquake of nicomedia the difficulty of finding a convenient place and perhaps some secret motives of policy produced an alteration in the summons the bishops of the east were directed to meet at seleucia in isauria while those of the west held their deliberations at rimini on the coast of the hadriatic and instead of two or three deputies from each province the whole episcopal body was ordered to march the eastern council after consuming four days in fierce and unavailing debate separated without any definitive conclusion the council of the west was protracted till the seventh month taurus the praetorian prefect was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all be united in the same opinion and his efforts were supported by a power of banishing fifteen of the most refractory and a promise of the consulship if he achieved so difficult an adventure his a d   0 prayers and threats the authority of the sovereign the sophistry of valens and ursacius the distress of cold and hunger and the tedious melancholy of a hopeless exile at length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of rimini the deputies of the east and of the west attended the emperor in the palace of constantinople and he enjoyed the satisfaction of imposing on the world a profession of faith which established the likeness without expressing the consubstantiality of the son of god sulp sever hist sacra l ii p        0 the greek historians were very ignorant of the affairs of the west  but the triumph of arianism had been preceded by the removal of the orthodox clergy whom it was impossible either to intimidate or to corrupt and the reign of constantius was disgraced by the unjust and ineffectual persecution of the great athanasius  we have seldom an opportunity of observing character and adventures of athanasius either in active or speculative life what effect may be produced or what obstacles may be surmounted by the force of a single mind when it is inflexibly applied to the pursuit of a single object the immortal name of athanasius we may regret that gregory nazianzen composed a panegyric instead of a life of athanasius but we should enjoy and improve the advantage of drawing our most authentic materials from the rich fund of his own epistles and apologies tom i p   0      i shall not imitate the example of socrates l ii c   who published the first edition of his history without giving himself the trouble to consult the writings of athanasius yet even socrates the more curious sozomen and the learned theodoret connect the life of athanasius with the series of ecclesiastical history the diligence of tillemont tom viii and of the benedictine editors has collected every fact and examined every difficulty will never be separated from the catholic doctrine of the trinity to whose defense he consecrated every moment and every faculty of his being educated in the family of alexander he had vigorously opposed the early progress of the arian heresy he exercised the important functions of secretary under the aged prelate and the fathers of the nicene council beheld with surprise and respect the rising virtues of the young deacon in a time of public danger the dull claims of age and of rank are sometimes superseded and within five months after his return from nice the deacon athanasius was seated on the archiepiscopal throne of egypt he filled that eminent station above a d          fortysix years and his long administration was spent in a perpetual combat against the powers of arianism five times was athanasius expelled from his throne twenty years he passed as an exile or a fugitive and almost every province of the roman empire was successively witness to his merit and his sufferings in the cause of the homoousion which he considered as the sole pleasure and business as the duty and as the glory of his life amidst the storms of persecution the archbishop of alexandria was patient of labor jealous of fame careless of safety and although his mind was tainted by the contagion of fanaticism athanasius displayed a superiority of character and abilities which would have qualified him far better than the degenerate sons of constantine for the government of a great monarchy his learning was much less profound and extensive than that of eusebius of caesarea and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the polished oratory of gregory or basil but whenever the primate of egypt was called upon to justify his sentiments or his conduct his unpremeditated style either of speaking or writing was clear forcible and persuasive he has always been revered in the orthodox school as one of the most accurate masters of the christian theology and he was supposed to possess two profane sciences less adapted to the episcopal character the knowledge of jurisprudence sulpicius severus hist sacra l ii p     calls him a lawyer a jurisconsult this character cannot now be discovered either in the life or writings of athanasius  and that of divination dicebatur enim fatidicarum sortium fidem quaeve augurales portenderent alites scientissime callens aliquoties praedixisse futura ammianus xv   a prophecy or rather a joke is related by sozomen l iv c  0 which evidently proves if the crows speak latin that athanasius understood the language of the crows  some fortunate conjectures of future events which impartial reasoners might ascribe to the experience and judgment of athanasius were attributed by his friends to heavenly inspiration and imputed by his enemies to infernal magic  but as athanasius was continually engaged with the prejudices and passions of every order of men from the monk to the emperor the knowledge of human nature was his first and most important science he preserved a distinct and unbroken view of a scene which was incessantly shifting and never failed to improve those decisive moments which are irrecoverably past before they are perceived by a common eye the archbishop of alexandria was capable of distinguishing how far he might boldly command and where he must dexterously insinuate how long he might contend with power and when he must withdraw from persecution and while he directed the thunders of the church against heresy and rebellion he could assume in the bosom of his own party the flexible and indulgent temper of a prudent leader the election of athanasius has not escaped the reproach of irregularity and precipitation the irregular ordination of athanasius was slightly mentioned in the councils which were held against him see philostorg l ii c    and godefroy p    but it can scarcely be supposed that the assembly of the bishops of egypt would solemnly attest a public falsehood athanas tom i p      but the propriety of his behavior conciliated the affections both of the clergy and of the people the alexandrians were impatient to rise in arms for the defense of an eloquent and liberal pastor in his distress he always derived support or at least consolation from the faithful attachment of his parochial clergy and the hundred bishops of egypt adhered with unshaken zeal to the cause of athanasius in the modest equipage which pride and policy would affect he frequently performed the episcopal visitation of his provinces from the mouth of the nile to the confines of aethiopia familiarly conversing with the meanest of the populace and humbly saluting the saints and hermits of the desert see the history of the fathers of the desert published by rosweide and tillemont mem eccles tom vii in the lives of antony pachomius etc athanasius himself who did not disdain to compose the life of his friend anthony has carefully observed how often the holy monk deplored and prophesied the mischiefs of the arian heresy athanas tom ii p         etc  nor was it only in ecclesiastical assemblies among men whose education and manners were similar to his own that athanasius displayed the ascendancy of his genius he appeared with easy and respectful firmness in the courts of princes and in the various turns of his prosperous and adverse fortune he never lost the confidence of his friends or the esteem of his enemies  in his youth the primate of egypt resisted the persecution against athanasius great constantine who had repeatedly signified a d   0 his will that arius should be restored to the catholic communion at first constantine threatened in speaking but requested in writing  his letters gradually assumed a menacing tonc but while he required that the entrance of the church should be open to all he avoided the odious name of arius athanasius like a skilful politician has accurately marked these distinctions tom i p     which allowed him some scope for excuse and delay  the emperor respected and might forgive this inflexible resolution and the faction who considered athanasius as their most formidable enemy were constrained to dissemble their hatred and silently to prepare an indirect and distant assault they scattered rumors and suspicions represented the archbishop as a proud and oppressive tyrant and boldly accused him of violating the treaty which had been ratified in the nicene council with the schismatic followers of meletius the meletians in egypt like the donatists in asrica were produced by an episcopal quarrel which arose from the persecution i have not leisure to pursue the obscure controversy which seems to have been misrepresented by the partiality of athanasius and the ignorance of epiphanius see mosheims general history of the church vol i p  0   athanasius had openly disapproved that ignominious peace and the emperor was disposed to believe that he had abused his ecclesiastical and civil power to persecute those odious sectaries that he had sacrilegiously broken a chalice in one of their churches of maraeotis that he had whipped or imprisoned six of their bishops and that arsenius a seventh bishop of the same party had been murdered or at least mutilated by the cruel hand of the primate the treatment of the six bishops is specified by sozomen l ii c    but athanasius himself so copious on the subject of arsenius and the chalice leaves this grave accusation without a reply  these charges which affected his honor and his life were referred by constantine to his brother dalmatius the censor who resided at antioch the synods of caesarea and tire were successively convened and the bishops of the east were instructed to judge the cause of athanasius before they proceeded to consecrate the new church of the resurrection at jerusalem the primate might be conscious of his innocence but he was sensible that the same implacable spirit which had dictated the accusation would direct the proceeding and pronounce the sentence he prudently declined the tribunal of his enemies despised the summons of the synod of caesarea and after a long and artful delay submitted to the peremptory commands of the emperor who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience if he refused to appear in the council of tire athanas tom i p     socrates l i c    sozomen l ii c    the emperor in his epistle of convocation eusebius in vit constant l iv c    seems to prejudge some members of the clergy and it was more than probable that the synod would apply those reproaches to athanasius  before athanasius at the head of fifty egyptian a d     prelates sailed from alexandria he had wisely secured the alliance of the meletians and arsenius himself his imaginary victim and his secret friend was privately concealed in his train the synod of tire was conducted by eusebius of caesarea with more passion and with less art than his learning and experience might promise his numerous faction repeated the names of homicide and tyrant and their clamours were encouraged by the seeming patience of athanasius who expected the decisive moment to produce arsenius alive and unhurt in the midst of the assembly the nature of the other charges did not admit of such clear and satisfactory replies yet the archbishop was able to prove that in the village where he was accused of breaking a consecrated chalice neither church nor altar nor chalice could really exist the arians who had secretly determined the guilt and condemnation of their enemy attempted however to disguise their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms the synod appointed an episcopal commission of six delegates to collect evidence on the spot and this measure which was vigorously opposed by the egyptian bishops opened new scenes of violence and perjury see in particular the second apology of athanasius tom i p       0  and his epistles to the monks p  0       they are justified by original and authentic documents but they would inspire more confidence if he appeared less innocent and his enemies less absurd  after the return of the deputies from alexandria the majority of the council pronounced the final sentence of degradation and exile against the primate of egypt the decree expressed in the fiercest language of malice and revenge was communicated to the emperor and the catholic church and the bishops immediately resumed a mild and devout aspect such as became their holy pilgrimage to the sepulcher of christ eusebius in vit constantin l iv c          but the injustice of these ecclesiastical judges had not been countenanced by the submission or even by the presence of athanasius he resolved his first exile to make a bold and dangerous experiment a d     whether the throne was inaccessible to the voice of truth and before the final sentence could be pronounced at tire the intrepid primate threw himself into a bark which was ready to hoist sail for the imperial city the request of a formal audience might have been opposed or eluded but athanasius concealed his arrival watched the moment of constantines return from an adjacent villa and boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street of constantinople so strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate suitor but his resentment was subdued by involuntary respect and the haughty spirit of the emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a bishop who implored his justice and awakened his conscience athanas tom i p  0  in a church dedicated to st athanasius this situation would afford a better subject for a picture than most of the stories of miracles and martyrdoms  constantine listened to the complaints of athanasius with impartial and even gracious attention the members of the synod of tire were summoned to justify their proceedings and the arts of the eusebian faction would have been confounded if they had not aggravated the guilt of the primate by the dexterous supposition of an unpardonable offense a criminal design to intercept and detain the cornfleet of alexandria which supplied the subsistence of the new capital athanas tom i p     eunapius has related in vit sophist p       edit commelin a strange example of the cruelty and credulity of constantine on a similar occasion the eloquent sopater a syrian philosopher enjoyed his friendship and provoked the resentment of ablavius his praetorian prefect the cornfleet was detained for want of a south wind the people of constantinople were discontented and sopater was beheaded on a charge that he had bound the winds by the power of magic suidas adds that constantine wished to prove by this execution that he had absolutely renounced the superstition of the gentiles  the emperor was satisfied that the peace of egypt would be secured by the absence of a popular leader but he refused to fill the vacancy of the archiepiscopal throne and the sentence which after long hesitation he pronounced was that of a jealous ostracism rather than of an ignominious exile in the remote province of gaul but in the hospitable court of treves athanasius passed about twentyeight months the death of the emperor changed the face of public affairs and amidst the general indulgence of a young reign the primate was and restoration restored to his country by an honorable edict of the younger constantine who expressed a deep a d

his innocence was unanimously declared in a council of fifty bishops of italy at the end of three years the primate was summoned to the court of milan by the emperor constans who in the indulgence of unlawful pleasures still professed a lively regard for the orthodox faith the cause of truth and justice was promoted by the influence of gold philostorgius l iii c    if any corruption was used to promote the interest of religion an advocate of athanasius might justify or excuse this questionable conduct by the example of cato and sidney the former of whom is said to have given and the latter

of the catholic church ninetyfour a d     bishops of the west seventysix bishops of the east encountered each other at sardica on the verge of the two empires but in the dominions of the protector of athanasius their debates soon degenerated into hostile altercations the asiatics apprehensive for their personal safety retired to philippopolis in thrace and the rival synods reciprocally hurled their spiritual thunders against their enemies whom they piously condemned as the enemies of the true god their decrees were published and ratified in their respective provinces and athanasius who in the west was revered as a saint was exposed as a criminal to the abhorrence of the east the canon which allows appeals to the roman pontiffs has almost raised the council of sardica to the dignity of a general council and its acts have been ignorantly or artfully confounded with those of the nicene synod see tillemont tom viii p     and geddess tracts vol ii p        0  the council of sardica

we might distrust the professions of the archbishop tom i p      prudence would undoubtedly suggest the mild and respectful tone that became a subject and a bishop in these familiar conferences with the sovereign of the west athanasius might lament the error of constantius but he boldly arraigned the guilt of his eunuchs and his arian prelates deplored the distress and danger of the catholic church and excited constans to emulate the zeal and glory of his father the emperor declared his resolution of employing the troops and treasures of europe in the orthodox cause and signified by a concise and peremptory epistle to his brother constantius that unless he consented to the immediate restoration of athanasius he himself with a fleet and army would seat the archbishop on the throne of alexandria notwithstanding the discreet silence of athanasius and the manifest forgery of a letter inserted by socrates these menaces are proved by the unquestionable evidence of luciser of cagliari and even of constantius himself see tillemont tom viii p      but this religious war so horrible to nature was prevented by the timely compliance of constantius and the emperor of the east condescended to solicit a reconciliation with a subject whom he had injured athanasius waited with decent pride till he had received three successive epistles full of the strongest assurances of the protection the favor and the esteem of his sovereign who invited him to resume his episcopal seat and who added the humiliating precaution of engaging his principal ministers to attest the sincerity of his intentions they were manifested in a still more public manner by the strict orders which were dispatched into egypt to recall the adherents of athanasius to restore their privileges to proclaim their innocence and to eraze from the public registers the illegal proceedings which had been obtained during the prevalence of the eusebian faction after every satisfaction and security had been given which justice or even delicacy could require the primate proceeded by slow journeys through the provinces of thrace asia and syria and his progress was marked by the abject homage of the oriental bishops who excited his contempt without deceiving his penetration i have always entertained some doubts concerning the retractation of ursacius and valens athanas tom i p     their epistles to julius bishop of rome and to athanasius himself are of so different a cast from each other that they cannot both be genuine the one speaks the language of criminals who confess their guilt and infamy the other of enemies who solicit on equal terms an honorable reconciliation  at antioch he saw the emperor constantius sustained with modest firmness the embraces and protestations of his master and eluded the proposal of allowing the arians a single church at alexandria by claiming in the other cities of the empire a similar toleration for his own party a reply which might have appeared just and moderate in the mouth of an independent prince the entrance of the archbishop into his capital was a triumphal procession absence and persecution had endeared him to the alexandrians his authority which he exercised with rigor was more firmly established and his fame was diffused from aethiopia to britain over the whole extent of the christian world the circumstances of his second

prince to the necessity of dissembling can never expect a sincere and lasting forgiveness and the tragic resentment of constantius fate of constans soon deprived athanasius of a powerful and generous protector the civil war a d     between the assassin and the only surviving brother of constans which afflicted the empire above three years secured an interval of repose to the catholic church and the two contending parties were desirous to conciliate the friendship of a bishop who by the weight of his personal authority might determine the fluctuating resolutions of an important province he gave audience to the ambassadors of the tyrant with whom he was afterward accused of holding a secret correspondence athanasius tom i p         defends his innocence by pathetic complaints solemn assertions and specious arguments he admits that letters had been forged in his name but he requests that his own secretaries and those of the tyrant may be examined whether those letters had been written by the former or received by the latter  and the emperor constantius repeatedly assured his dearest father the most reverend athanasius that notwithstanding the malicious rumors which were circulated by their common enemies he had inherited the sentiments as well as the throne of his deceased brother athanas tom i p           gratitude and humanity would have disposed the primate of egypt to deplore the untimely fate of constans and to abhor the guilt of magnentius but as he clearly understood that the apprehensions of constantius were his only safeguard the servour of his prayers for the success of the righteous cause might perhaps be somewhat abated the ruin of athanasius was no longer contrived by the obscure malice of a few bigoted or angry bishops who abused the authority of a credulous monarch the monarch himself avowed the resolution which he had so long suppressed of avenging his private injuries athanas tom i p     theodoret l ii c    the emperor declared that he was more desirous to subdue athanasius than he had been to vanquish magnentius or sylvanus  and the first winter after his victory which he passes at arles was employed against an enemy more odious to him than the vanquished tyrant of gaul  if the emperor had capriciously decreed the councils of arles and milan death of the most eminent and virtuous citizen of the republic the cruel order would have been a d          executed without hesitation by the ministers of open violence or of specious injustice the caution the delay the difficulty with which he proceeded in the condemnation and punishment of a popular bishop discovered to the world that the privileges of the church had already revived a sense of order and freedom in the roman government the sentence which was pronounced in the synod of tire and subscribed by a large majority of the eastern bishops had never been expressly repealed and as athanasius had been once degraded from his episcopal dignity by the judgment of his brethren every subsequent act might be considered as irregular and even criminal but the memory of the firm and effectual support which the primate of egypt had derived from the attachment of the western church engaged constantius to suspend the execution of the sentence till he had obtained the concurrence of the latin bishops two years were consumed in ecclesiastical negociations and the important cause between the emperor and one of his subjects was solemnly debated first in the synod of arles and afterward in the great council of milan the affairs of the council of milan are so imperfectly and erroneously related by the greek writers that we must rejoice in the supply of some letters of eusebius extracted by baronius from the archives of the church of vercellae and of an old life of dionysius of milan published by bollandus see baronius a d     and tillemont tom vii p       which consisted of above three hundred bishops their integrity was gradually undermined by the arguments of the arians the dexterity of the eunuchs and the pressing solicitations of a prince who gratified his revenge at the expense of his dignity and exposed his own passions whilst he influenced those of the clergy corruption the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty was successfully practiced honors gifts and immunities were offered and accepted as the price of an episcopal vote the honors presents feasts which seduced so many bishops are mentioned with indignation by those who were too pure or too proud to accept them we combat says hilary of poitiers against

primate was artfully represented as the only measure which could restore the peace and union of the catholic church the friends of athanasius were not however wanting to their leader or to their cause

justice they declared that neither the hope of his favor nor the fear of his displeasure should prevail on them to join in the condemnation of an absent an innocent a respectable brother something of this opposition is mentioned by ammianus xv   who had a very dark and superficial knowledge of ecclesiastical history liberius perseveranter renitebatur nec visum hominem nec auditum damnare nefas

have proceeded so vigorously against their adversaries the principal of whom they immediately deposed  by the impartial judgment of the latin church they deplored the hard condition of athanasius who after enjoying so many years his seat his reputation and the seeming confidence of his sovereign was again called upon to confute the most groundless and extravagant accusations their language was specious their conduct was honorable but in this long and obstinate contest which fixed the eyes of the whole empire on a single bishop the ecclesiastical factions were prepared to sacrifice truth and justice to the more interesting object of defending or removing the intrepid champion of the nicene faith the arians still thought it prudent to disguise in ambiguous language their real sentiments and designs but the orthodox bishops armed with the favor of the people and the decrees of a general council insisted on every occasion and particularly at milan that their adversaries should purge themselves from the suspicion of heresy before they presumed to arraign the conduct of the great athanasius sulp severus in hist sacra l ii p       but the voice of reason if reason was indeed on condemnation of athanasius the side of athanasius was silenced by the clamours of a factious or venal majority and the councils of arles and milan were not dissolved a d     till the archbishop of alexandria had been solemnly condemned and deposed by the judgment of the western as well as of the eastern church the bishops who had opposed were required to subscribe the sentence and to unite in religious communion with the suspected leaders of the adverse party a formulary of consent was transmitted by the messengers of state to the absent bishops and all those who refused to submit their private opinion to the public and inspired wisdom of the councils of arles and milan were immediately banished by the emperor who affected to execute the decrees of the catholic church among those prelates who led the honorable band of confessors and exiles liberius of rome osius of cordova paulanus of treves dionysius of milan eusebius of vercellae lucifer of cagliari and hilary of poitiers may deserve to be particularly distinguished the eminent station of liberius who governed the capital of the empire the personal merit and long experience of the venerable osius who was revered as the favorite of the great constantine and the father of the nicene faith placed those prelates at the head of the latin church and their example either of submission or resistance would probably be imitated by the episcopal crowd but the repeated attempts of the emperor to seduce or to intimidate the bishops of rome and cordova were for some time ineffectual the spaniard declared himself ready to suffer under constantius as he had suffered threescore years before under his grandfather maximian the roman in the presence of his sovereign asserted the innocence of athanasius and his own freedom when he was banished to beraea in thrace he sent back a large sum which had been offered for the accommodation of his journey and insulted the court of milan by the haughty remark that the emperor and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay their soldiers and their bishops the exile of liberius is mentioned by ammianus xv   see theodoret l ii c    athanas tom i p          hilar fragment i  the resolution of liberius and osius was at length subdued by the hardships of exile and confinement the roman pontiff purchased his return by some criminal compliances and afterward expiated his guilt by a seasonable repentance persuasion and violence were employed to extort the reluctant signature of the decrepid bishop of cordova whose strength was broken and whose faculties were perhaps impaired by the weight of an hundred years and the insolent triumph of the arians provoked some of the orthodox party to treat with inhuman severity the character or rather the memory of an unfortunate old man to whose former services christianity itself was so deeply indebted the life of osius is collected by tillemont tom vii p          who in the most extravagant terms first admires and then reprobates the bishop of cordova in the midst of their lamentations on his fall the prudence of athanasius may be distinguished from the blind and intemperate zeal of hilary   the fall of liberius and osius reflected a exiles brighter luster on the firmness of those bishops who still adhered with unshaken fidelity to the cause of athanasius and religious truth the ingenious malice of their enemies had deprived them of the benefit of mutual comfort and advice separated those illustrious exiles into distant provinces and carefully selected the most inhospitable spots of a great empire the confessors of the west were successively banished to the deserts of arabia or thebais the lonely places of mount taurus the wildest parts of phrygia which were in the possession of the impious montanists etc when the heretic aetius was too favorably entertained at mopsuestia in cilicia the place of his exile was changed by the advice of acacius to amblada a district inhabited by savages and infested by war and pestilence philostorg l v c    yet they soon experienced that the deserts of libya and the most barbarous tracts of cappadocia were less inhospitable than the residence of those cities in which an arian bishop could satiate without restraint the exquisite rancour of theological hatred see the cruel treatment and strange obstinacy of eusebius in his own letters published by baronius a d     no      0   their consolation was derived from the consciousness of rectitude and independence from the applause the visits the letters and the liberal alms of their

capricious taste of the emperor constantius and so easily was he offended by the slightest deviation from his imaginary standard of christian truth that he persecuted with equal zeal those who defended the consubstantiality those who asserted the similar substance and those who denied the likeness of the son of god three bishops degraded and banished for those adverse opinions might possibly meet in the same place of exile and according to the difference of their temper might either pity or insult the blind enthusiasm of their antagonists whose present sufferings would never be compensated by future happiness  the disgrace and exile of the orthodox bishops of the west were designed as so many preparatory steps to the ruin of athanasius himself ample materials for the history of this third persecution of athanasius may be found in his own works see particularly his very able apology to constantius tom i p     his first apology for his flight p  0  his prolix epistle to the solitaries p  0  and the original protest of the people of alexandria against the violences committed by syrianus p     sozomen l iv c   has thrown into the narrative two or three luminous and important circumstances  six third expulsion of athanasius from alexandria and twenty months had elapsed during which the imperial court secretly labored by the most insidious arts to remove him from alexandria and to withdraw the allowance which supplied his a d     popular liberality but when the primate of of egypt deserted and proscribed by the latin church was left destitute of any foreign support constantius dispatched two of his secretaries with a verbal commission to announce and execute the order of his banishment as the justice of the sentence was publicly avowed by the whole party the only motive which could restrain constantius from giving his messengers the sanction of a written mandate must be imputed to his doubt of the event and to a sense of the danger to which he might expose the second city and the most fertile province of the empire if the people should persist in the resolution of defending by force of arms the innocence of their spiritual father such extreme caution afforded athanasius a specious pretense respectfully to dispute the truth of an order which he could not reconcile either with the equity or with the former declarations of his gracious master the civil powers of egypt found themselves inadequate to the task of persuading or compelling the primate to abdicate his episcopal throne and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of alexandria by which it was stipulated that all proceedings and all hostilities should be suspended till the emperors pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained by this seeming moderation the catholics were deceived into a false and fatal security while the legions of the upper egypt and of libya advanced by secret orders and hasty marches to besiege or rather to surprise a capital habituated to sedition and inflamed by religious zeal athanasius had lately sent for antony and some of his chosen monks they descended from their mountain announced to the alexandrians the sanctity of athanasius and were honorably conducted by the archbishop as far as the gates of the city athanas tom ii p         see likewise rufinus iii     in vit patr p      the position of alexandria between the sea and the lake mareotis facilitated the approach and landing of the troops who were introduced into the heart of the city before any effectual measures could be taken either to shut the gates or to occupy the important posts of desence at the hour of midnight twentythree days after the signature of the treaty syrianus duke of egypt at the head of five thousand soldiers armed and prepared for an assault unexpectedly invested the church of st theonas where the archbishop with a part of his clergy and people performed their nocturnal devotions the doors of the sacred edifice yielded to the impetuosity of the attack which was accompanied with every horrid circumstance of tumult and bloodshed but as the bodies of the slain and the fragments of military weapons remained the next day an unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the catholics the enterprise of syrianus may be considered as a successful irruption rather than as an absolute conquest the other churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages and during at least four months alexandria was exposed to the insults of a licentious army stimulated by the ecclesiastics of an hostile faction many of the faithful were killed who may deserve the name of martyrs if their deaths were neither provoked nor revenged bishops and presbyters were treated with cruel ignominy consecrated virgins were stripped naked scourged and violated the houses of wealthy citizens were plundered and under the mask of religious zeal lust avarice and private resentment were gratified with impunity and even with applause the pagans of alexandria who still formed a numerous and discontented party were easily persuaded to desert a bishop whom they feared and esteemed the hopes of some peculiar favors and the apprehension of being involved in the general penalties of rebellion engaged them to promise their support to the destined successor of athanasius the famous george of cappadocia the usurper after receiving the consecration of an arian synod was placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of sebastian who had been appointed count of egypt for the execution of that important design in the use as well as in the acquisition of power the tyrant george disregarded the laws of religion of justice and of humanity and the same scenes of violence and scandal which had been exhibited in the capital were repeated in more than ninety episcopal cities of egypt encouraged by success constantius ventured to approve the conduct of his ministers by a public and passionate epistle the emperor congratulates the deliverance of alexandria from a popular tyrant who deluded his blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence expatiates on the virtues and piety of the most reverend george the elected bishop and aspires as the patron and benefactor of the city to surpass the fame of alexander himself but he solemnly declares his unalterable resolution to pursue with fire and sword the seditious adherents of the wicked athanasius who by flying from justice has confessed his guilt and escaped the ignominious death which he had so often deserved athanas tom i p     the emperor or his arian secretaries while they express their resentment betray their fears and esteem of athanasius   athanasius had indeed escaped from the most his behavior imminent dangers and the adventures of that extraordinary man deserve and fix our attention on the memorable night when the church of st theonas was invested by the troops of syrianus the archbishop seated on his throne expected with calm and intrepid dignity the approach of death while the public devotion was interrupted by shouts of rage and cries of terror he animated his trembling congregation to express their religious confidence by chanting one of the psalms of david which celebrates the triumph of the god of israel over the haughty and impious tyrant of egypt the doors were at length burst open a cloud of arrows was discharged among the people the soldiers with drawn swords rushed forwards into the sanctuary and the dreadful gleam of their armor was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar these minute circumstances are curious as they are literally transcribed from the protest which was publicly presented three days afterward by the catholics of alexandria see athanas tom i p      athanasius still rejected the pious importunity of the monks and presbyters who were attached to his person and nobly refused to desert his episcopal station till he had dismissed in safety the last of the congregation the darkness and tumult of the night favored the retreat of the archbishop and though he was oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude though he was thrown to the ground and left without sense or motion he still recovered his undaunted courage and eluded the eager search of the soldiers who were instructed by their arian guides that the head of athanasius would be the most acceptable present to the emperor from that moment the primate of egypt disappeared from the eyes of his enemies and remained above six years concealed in impenetrable obscurity the jansenists have often compared athanasius and arnauld and have expatiated with pleasure on the faith and zeal the merit and exile of those celebrated doctors this concealed parallel is very dexterously managed by the abbe de la bleterie vie de

pachomius received the fugitive primate as their father admired the patience and humility with which he conformed to their strictest institutions collected every word which dropped from his lips as

reached the formidable deserts which the gloomy and credulous temper of superstition had peopled with demons and savage monsters the retirement of athanasius which ended only with the life of constantius was spent for the most part in the society of the monks who faithfully served him as guards as secretaries and as messengers but the importance of maintaining a more intimate connection with the catholic party tempted him whenever the diligence of the pursuit was abated to emerge from the desert to introduce himself into alexandria and to trust his person to the discretion of his friends and adherents his various adventures might have furnished the subject of a very entertaining romance he was once secreted in a dry cistern which he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the treachery of a female slave rufin l i c    sozomen l iv c  0 this and the following story will be rendered impossible if we suppose that athanasius always inhabited the asylum which he accidentally or occasionally had used  and he was once concealed in a still more extraordinary asylum the house of a virgin only twenty years of age and who was celebrated in the whole city for her exquisite beauty at the hour of midnight as she related the story many years afterward she was surprised by the appearance of the archbishop in a loose undress who advancing with hasty steps conjured her to afford him the protection which he had been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her hospitable roof the pious maid accepted and preserved the sacred pledge which was entrusted to her prudence and courage without imparting the secret to any one she instantly conducted athanasius into her most secret chamber and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a servant as long as the danger continued she regularly supplied him with books and provisions washed his feet managed his correspondence and dexterously concealed from the eye of

personally negociating with his friends and of observing and improving the divisions of his enemies might justify in a prudent statesman so bold and dangerous an enterprise and alexandria was connected by trade and navigation with every seaport of the mediterranean from the depth of his inaccessible retreat the intrepid primate waged an incessant and offensive war against the protector of the arians and his seasonable writings which were diligently circulated and eagerly perused contributed to unite and animate the orthodox party in his public apologies which he addressed to the emperor himself he sometimes affected the praise of moderation whilst at the same time in secret and vehement invectives he exposed constantius as a weak and wicked prince the executioner of his family the tyrant of the republic and the antichrist of the church in the height of his prosperity the victorious monarch who had chastised the rashness of gallus and suppressed the revolt of sylvanus who had taken the diadem from the head of vetranio and vanquished in the field the legions of magnentius received from an invisible hand a wound which he could neither heal nor revenge and the son of

the roman pontiff as long as he maintained rome his station and his principles was guarded by the warm attachment of a great people and could reject with scorn the prayers the menaces and the oblations of an heretical prince when the eunuchs had secretly pronounced the exile of liberius the wellgrounded apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use the utmost precautions in the execution of the sentence the capital was invested on every side and the prefect was commanded to seize the person of the bishop either by stratagem or by open force the order was obeyed and liberius with the greatest difficulty at the hour of midnight was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of the roman people before their consternation was turned into rage as soon as they were informed of his banishment into thrace a general assembly was convened and the clergy of rome bound themselves by a public and solemn oath never to desert their bishop never to acknowledge the usurper faelix who by the influence of the eunuchs had been irregularly chosen and consecrated within the walls of a profane palace at the end of two years their pious obstinacy subsisted entire and unshaken and when constantius visited rome he was assailed by the importunate solicitations of a people who had preserved as the last remnant of their ancient freedom the right of treating their sovereign with familiar insolence the wives of many of the senators and most honorable citizens after pressing their husbands to intercede in favor of liberius were advised to undertake a commission which in their hands would be less dangerous and might prove more successful the emperor received with politeness these female deputies whose wealth and dignity were displayed in the magnificence of their dress and ornaments he admired their inflexible resolution of following their beloved pastor to the most distant regions of the earth and consented that the two bishops liberius and faelix should govern in peace their respective congregations but the ideas of toleration were so repugnant to the practice and even to the sentiments of those times that when the answer of constantius was publicly read in the circus of rome so reasonable a project of accommodation was rejected with contempt and ridicule the eager vehemence which animated the spectators in the decisive moment of a horserace was now directed toward a different object and the circus resounded with the shout of thousands who repeatedly exclaimed one god one christ one bishop the zeal of the roman people in the cause of liberius was not confined to words alone and the dangerous and bloody sedition which they excited soon after the departure of constantius determined that prince to accept the submission of the exiled prelate and to restore him to the undivided dominion of the capital after some ineffectual resistance his rival was expelled from the city by the permission of the emperor and the power of the opposite faction the adherents of faelix were inhumanly murdered in the streets in the public places in the baths and even in the churches and the face of rome upon the return of a christian bishop renewed the horrid

rome constantinople alexandria and the other great cities of the empire still contained a strong and powerful faction of infidels who envied the prosperity and who ridiculed even on their theaters the theological disputes of the church constantinople alone enjoyed the advantage of being born and educated in the bosom of the faith the capital of the east had never been polluted by the worship of idols and the whole body of the people had deeply imbibed the opinions the virtues and the passions which distinguished the christians of that age from the rest of mankind after the death of alexander the episcopal throne was disputed by paul and macedonius by their zeal and abilities they both deserved the eminent station to which they aspired and if the moral character of macedonius was less exceptionable his competitor had the advantage of a prior election and a more orthodox doctrine his firm attachment to the nicene creed which has given paul a place in the calendar among saints and martyrs exposed him to the resentment of the arians in the space of fourteen years he was five times driven from his throne to which he was more frequently restored by the violence of the people than by the permission of the prince and the power of macedonius could be secured only by the death of his rival the unfortunate paul was dragged in chains from the sandy deserts of mesopotamia to the most desolate places of mount taurus cucusus was the last stage of his life and sufferings the situation of that lonely town on the confines of cappadocia cilicia and the lesser armenia has occasioned some

insinuate a prudent doubt  the first blood which stained the new capital was spilt in this ecclesiastical contest and many persons were slain on both sides in the furious and obstinate seditions of the people the commission of enforcing a sentence of banishment against paul had been entrusted to hermogenes the mastergeneral of the cavalry but the execution of it was fatal to himself the catholics rose in the defense of their bishop the palace of hermogenes was consumed the first military officer of the empire was dragged by the heels through the streets of constantinople and after he expired his lifeless corpse was exposed to their wanton insults ammianus xiv  0 refers to his own account of this tragic event but we no longer possess that part of his history  the fare of hermogenes instructed philip the praetorian prefect to act with more precaution on a similar ocsion in the most gentle and honorable terms he required the attendance of paul in the baths of zeuxippus which had a private communication with the palace and the sea a vessel which lay ready at the gardenstairs immediately hoisted fail and while the people were still ignorant of the meditated sacrilege their bishop was already embarked on his voyage to thessalonica they soon beheld with surprise and indignation the gates of the palace thrown open and the usurper macedonius seated by the side of the prefect on a lofty chariot which was surrounded by troops of guards with drawn swords the military procession advanced toward the cathedral the arians and the catholics eagerly rushed to occupy that important post and three thousand one hundred and fifty persons lost their lives in the confusion of the tumult macedonius who was supported by a regular force obtained a decisive victory but his reign was disturbed by clamor and sedition and the causes which appeared the least connected with the subject of dispute were sufficient to nourish and to kindle the flame of civil discord as the chapel in which the body of the great constantine had been deposited was in a ruinous condition the bishop transported those venerable remains into the church of st acacius this prudent and even pious measure was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole party which adhered to the homoousian doctrine the factions immediately flew to arms the consecrated ground was used as their field of battle and one of the ecclesiastical historians has observed as a real fact not as a figure of rhetoric that the well before the church overflowed with a stream of blood which filled the porticoes and the adjacent courts the writer who should impute these tumults solely to a religious principle would betray a very imperfect knowledge of human nature yet it must be confessed that the motive which misled the sincerity of zeal and the pretense which disguised the licentiousness of passion suppressed the remorse which in another cause would have succeeded to the rage of the christians of constantinople see socrates l

these historians but a modern greek who could write the life of a saint without adding fables and miracles is entitled to some commendation   the cruel and arbitrary disposition of constantius which did not always require the provocations of guilt and resistance was justly exasperated cruelty of the arians by the tumults of his capital and the criminal behavior of a faction which opposed the authority and religion of their sovereign the ordinary punishments of death exile and confiscation were inflicted with partial rigor and the greeks still revere the holy memory of two clerks a reader and a subdeacon who were accused of the murder of hermogenes and beheaded at the gates of constantinople by an edict of constantius against the catholics which has not been judged worthy of a place in the theodosian code those who refused to communicate with the arian bishops and particularly with macedonius were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics and of the rights of christians they were compelled to relinquish the possession of the churches and were strictly prohibited from holding their assemblies within the walls of the city the execution of this unjust law in the provinces of thrace and asia minor was committed to the zeal of macedonius the civil and military powers were directed to obey his commands and the cruelties exercised by this semiarian tyrant in the support of the homoiousion exceeded the commission and disgraced the reign of constantius the sacraments of the church were administered to the reluctant victims who denied the vocation and abhorred the principles of macedonius the rites of baptism were conferred on women and children who for that purpose had been torn from the arms of their friends and parents the mouths of the communicants were held open by a wooden engine while the consecrated bread was forced down their throat the breasts of tender virgins were either burnt with redhot eggshells or inhumanly compressed between sharp and heavy boards socrates l ii c       sozomen l iv c    the principal assistants of macedonius in the work of persecution were the two bishops of nicomedia and cyzicus who were esteemed for their virtues and especially for their charity i cannot forbear reminding the reader that the difference between the homoousion and homoiousion is almost invisible to the nicest theological eye  the novatians of constantinople and the adjacent country by their firm attachment to the homoousian standard deserved to be confounded with the catholics themselves macedonius was informed that a large district of paphlagonia we are ignorant of the precise situation of mantinium in speaking of these four bands of legionaries socrates sozomen and the author of the acts of st paul use the indesinite terms of

on this occasion the efficacy of an ecclesiastical mission he commanded a body of four thousand legionaries to march against the rebels and to reduce the territory of mantinium under his spiritual dominion the novatian peasants animated by despair and religious fury boldly encountered the invaders of their country and though many of the paphlagonians were slain the roman legions were vanquished by an irregular multitude armed only with scythes and axes and except a few who escaped by an ignominious flight four thousand soldiers were left dead on the field of battle the successor of constantius has expressed in a concise but lively manner some of the theological calamities which afflicted the empire and more especially the east in the reign of a prince who was the slave of his own passions and of those of his eunuchs many were imprisoned and persecuted and driven into exile whole troops of those who are styled heretics were massacred particularly at cyzicus and at samosata

resistance the strenuous efforts of his son constans to restore the unity of the church exasperated the sentiments of mutual hatred which had first occasioned the separation and the methods of force and corruption employed by the two imperial commissioners paul and macarius furnished the schismatics with a specious contrast between the maxims of the apostles and the conduct of their pretended

roman laws who were imperfectly converted to the christian faith but who were actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their donatist teachers they indignantly supported the exile of their bishops the demolition of their churches and the interruption of their secret assemblies the violence of the officers of justice who were usually sustained by a military guard was sometimes repelled with equal violence and the blood of some popular ecclesiastics which had been shed in the quarrel inflamed their rude followers with an eager desire of revenging the death of these holy martyrs by their own cruelty and rashness the ministers of persecution sometimes provoked their fate and the guilt of an accidental tumult precipitated the criminals into despair and rebellion driven from their native villages the donatist peasants assembled in formidable gangs on the edge of the getulian desert and readily exchanged the habits of labor for a life of idleness and rapine which was consecrated by the name of religion and faintly condemned by the doctors of the sect the leaders of the circumcellions assumed the assumed the title of captains of the saints their principal weapon as they were indifferently provided with swords and spears was a huge and weighty club which they termed an israelite and the wellknown sound of praise be to god which they used as their cry of war diffused consternation over the unarmed provinces of africa at first their depredations were colored by the plea of necessity but they soon exceeded the measure of subsistence indulged without control their intemperance and avarice burnt the villages which they had pillaged and reigned the licentious tyrants of the open country the occupations of husbandry and the administration of justice were interrupted and as the circumcellions pretended to restore the primitive equality of mankind and to reform the abuses of civil society they opened a secure asylum for the slaves and debtors who flocked in crowds to their holy standard when they were not resisted they usually contented themselves with plunder but the slightest opposition provoked them to acts of violence and murder and some catholic priests who had imprudently signalized their zeal were tortured by the fanatics with the most refined and wanton barbarity the spirit of the circumcellions was not always exerted against their defenseless enemies they engaged and sometimes defeated the troops of the province and in the bloody action of bagai they attacked in the open field but with unsuccessful valor an advanced guard of the imperial cavalry the donatists who were taken in arms received and they soon deserved the same treatment which might have been shown to the wild beasts of the desert the captives died without a murmur either by the sword the axe or the fire and the measures of retaliation were multiplied in a rapid proportion which aggravated the horrors of rebellion and excluded the hope of mutual forgiveness in the beginning of the present century the example of the circumcellions has been renewed in the persecution the boldness the crimes and the enthusiasm of the camisards and if the fanatics of languedoc surpassed those of numidia by their military achievements the africans maintained their fierce independence with more resolution and perseverance the histoire des camisards in   vol   mo villefranche    0 may be recommended as accurate and impartial it requires some attention to discover the religion of the author   such disorders are the natural effects of religious tyranny but the rage of the donatists was inflamed their religious suicides by a frenzy of a very extraordinary kind and which if it really prevailed among them in so extravagant a degree cannot surely be paralleled in any country or in any age many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life and the desire of martyrdom and they deemed it of little moment by what means or by what hands they perished if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith and the hope of eternal happiness the donatist suicides alleged in their justification the example of razias which is related in the   th chapter of the second book of the maccabees  sometimes they rudely disturbed the festivals and profaned the temples of paganism with the design of exciting the most zealous of the idolaters to revenge the insulted honor of their gods they sometimes forced their way into the courts of justice and compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their immediate execution they frequently stopped travelers on the public highways and obliged them to inflict the stroke of martyrdom by the promise of a reward if they consented and by the threat of instant death if they refused to grant so very singular a favor when they were disappointed of every other resource they announced the day on which in the presence of their friends and brethren they should cast themselves headlong from some lofty rock and many precipices were shown which had acquired fame by the number of religious suicides in the actions of these desperate enthusiasts who were admired by one party as the martyrs of god and abhorred by the other as the victims of satan an impartial philosopher may discover the influence and the last abuse of that inflexible spirit which was originally derived from the character and principles of the jewish nation  the simple narrative of the intestine divisions general character of the christian sects which distracted the peace and dishonored the triumph of the church will confirm the remark of a pagan historian and justify the complaint of a a d          venerable bishop the experience of ammianus had

sectaries who assumed and bestowed the appellations of orthodox and heretics they had been educated in the same religion and the same civil society their hopes and fears in the present or in a future life were balanced in the same proportion on either side the error might be innocent the faith sincere the practice meritorious or corrupt their passions were excited by similar objects and they might alternately abuse the favor of the court or of the people the metaphysical opinions of the athanasians and the arians could not influence their moral character and they were alike actuated by the intolerant spirit which has been extracted from the pure and simple maxims of the gospel  a modern writer who with a just confidence toleration of paganism has prefixed to his own history the honorable epithets of political and philosophical histoire politic et philosophique des etablissemens des europeens dans les deux indes tom i p    accuses the timid prudence of montesquieu for neglecting to enumerate among the causes of the decline of the empire a law of constantine by which the exercise of the pagan worship was absolutely suppressed and a considerable part of his subjects was left destitute of priests of temples and of any public religion the zeal of the philosophic historian for the rights of mankind has induced him to acquiesce in the ambiguous testimony of those ecclesiastics who have too lightly ascribed to their favorite hero the merit of a general persecution according to eusebius in vit constantin l ii c    the emperor prohibited both in cities and in the country  the abominable acts or parts of idolatry socrates l i c    and sozomen l ii c     have represented the conduct of constantine with a just regard to truth and history which has been neglected by theodoret l v c    and orosius vii    tum deinde says the latter primus constantinus justo ordine et pio vicem vertit edicto siquidem statuit citra ullam hominum caedem paganorum templa claudi  instead of alleging this imaginary law which would have blazed in the front of the imperial codes we may safely appeal to the original epistle which constantine addressed to the followers of the ancient religion at a time when he no longer disguised his conversion nor dreaded the rivals of his throne he invites and exhorts in the most pressing terms the subjects of the roman empire to imitate the example of their master but he declares that those who still refuse by constantine to open their eyes to the celestial light may freely enjoy their temples and their fancied gods a report that the ceremonies of paganism were suppressed is formally contradicted by the emperor himself who wisely assigns as the principle of his moderation the invincible force of habit of prejudice and of superstition see eusebius in vit constantin l ii c     0 in the sermon to the assembly of saints which the emperor pronounced when he was mature in years and piety he declares to the idolaters c xi that they are permitted to offer sacrifices and to exercise every part of their religious worship  without violating the sanctity of his promise without alarming the fears of the pagans the artful monarch advanced by slow and cautious steps to undermine the irregular and decayed fabric of polytheism the partial acts of severity which he occasionally exercised though they were secretly prompted by a christian zeal were colored by the fairest pretenses of justice and the public good and while constantine designed to ruin the foundations he seemed to reform the abuses of the ancient religion after the example of the wisest of his predecessors he condemned under the most rigorous penalties the occult and impious arts of divination which excited the vain hopes and sometimes the criminal attempts of those who were discontented with their present condition an ignominious silence was imposed on the oracles which had been publicly convicted of fraud and falsehood the effeminate priests of the nile were abolished and constantine discharged the duties of a roman censor when he gave orders for the demolition of several temples of phoenicia in which every mode of prostitution was devoutly practiced in the face of day and to the honor of venus see eusebius in vit constantin l iii c        and l iv c       these acts of authority may be compared with the suppression of the bacchanals and the demolition of the temple of isis by the magistrates of pagan rome  the imperial city of constantinople was in some measure raised at the expense and was adorned with the spoils of the opulent temples of greece and asia the sacred property was confiscated the statues of gods and heroes were transported with rude familiarity among a people who considered them as objects not of adoration but of curiosity the gold and silver were restored to circulation and the magistrates the bishops and the eunuchs improved the fortunate occasion of gratifying at once their zeal their avarice and their resentment but these depredations were confined to a small part of the roman world and the provinces had been long since accustomed to endure the same sacrilegious rapine from the tyranny of princes and proconsuls who could not be suspected of any design to subvert the established religion eusebius in vit constant l iii c    and libanius oratpro templis p    0 edit gothofred

without being published or was published without being executed the evidence of facts and the monuments which are still extant of brass and marble continue to prove the public exercise of the pagan worship during the whole reign of the sons of constantine in the east as well as in the west in cities as well as in the country a great number of temples were respected or at least were spared and the devout multitude still enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices of festivals and of processions by the permission or by the connivance of the civil government about four years after the supposed date of his bloody edict constantius visited the temples of rome and the decency of his behavior is recommended by a pagan orator as an example worthy of the imitation of succeeding princes that emperor says symmachus suffered the privileges of the vestal virgins to remain inviolate he bestowed the sacerdotal dignities on the nobles of rome granted the customary allowance to defray the expenses of the public rites and sacrifices and though he had embraced a different religion he never attempted to deprive the empire of the sacred worship of antiquity symmach epistol x     the senate still presumed
