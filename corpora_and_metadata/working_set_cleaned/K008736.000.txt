brother i am extremely glad to see you   odogh by my faith and so am i you odzooks give us a kiss man i give you my honor i am as glad to see you in dublin at this juncture as i should to see a hundred head of fat bullocks upon my own land all ready for ballinasloe fair   coun sir your humble servant that is a great compliment from you brother i know   odogh it is a very true one i assure you   coun well i see by the newspapers that my sister is returned from her coronation frolie and in health i suppose or you would have wrote me word had it been otherwise   odogh yes yes she is in health indeed and returned with a vengeance   coun pray what is the matter   odogh ogho enough is the matter the devil an inhabitant in swifts hospital for lunatics is in a worse pickle than she is   coun you surprise me  in what respect pray   odogh why with a distemper that she has brought over with her from england which will in a little time i am afraid infect the whole nation   coun pray what may that be   odogh sir it is called the irish fine ladys delirium or the london vertigo if you were to hear her when the sit is upon her  oh she is as mad  the devil a thing in this poor country but what gives her the spleen and the vapors  then such a phrenzy of admiration for every thing in england  and among the rest of her madness she has brought over a new language with her   coun what do you mean by a new language   odogh why a new kind of a london english that is no more like our irish english than a coxcomb fine gilded chariot like a glassmanogue noddy  why what name do you think she went by when she was in england   coun why what name dare she go by but dogherty   odogh dogherty  ogho  upon my honor she startles when she hears the name of dogherty and blushes and is as much ashamed as if a man had spoke bawdy to her  no no my dear she is no longer the plain modest goodnatured domestic obedient irish mrs odogherty but the traveled rampant highlisd prancing english mrs diggerty   coun ha ha ha mrs diggerty ridiculous   odogh ay ridiculous indeed to change her name  was there ever such impertinence but do you know brother among the rest of your sisters whims and madnesses that she is turned a great politician too concerning my name   coun ha ha ha a politician i  why how in the name of wonder and common sense can politics and the name of dogherty be connected   odogh o it is a wonder indeed  but strange as it is they are connected  but very ridiculously as you may imagine   coun but prithee by what means   odogh why you must know we are to have an election shortly for the county that i live in which young lord turnabout wants to carry for one of his own gang and as the election in a great measure depends upon my interest the young fox knowing the conceit and vanity of my wife has taken her by her favorite soible and tickled it up by telling her that if i direct my interest properly it would not be difficult to procure me a title now sir this piece of flattery has stirred up such a rage of quality and title in her giddy head that i cannot rest night or day for her importunity  in short she would have me desert my friends and sell myself my honor and my country as several others have done before me merely for a title only that she may take place of a parcel of foolish idle women and sink the ancient name of dogherty in the upstart title of lady thingum my lady fiddle f addle or some such ridiculous nonsense   coun but sir pray pause a little upon this business  my sisters vanity i grant you may be ridiculous  but though you despise titles and oftentation yet as your interest can certainly make the member were i in your circumstances i would have a voice in the senate of my country  go into parliament for the county yourself   odogh ogh i have been among them already and i know them all very well what signifies my sitting among hundreds of people with my single opinion all alone when i was there before i was stigmatized as a singular blockhead an impracticable fellow only because i would not consent to sit like an image and when the master of the puppets pulled the string of my jaw on one side to say aye and on the other side to say no and to leap over a stick backwards and forwards just as the faction of party and jobbers and leaders and political adventurers directed  ah brother brother i have done with them all  oh i have done with them all   coun what and after all your expense of opposing government right or wrong and supporting your patriots will you give them all up   odogh indeed i will  i was patriot mad i own like a great many other fools in this distracted country  sir i was so mad that i hated the very name of a courtier as much as an illiterate layswaddling methodist does that of a regular clergyman but i am cured of that folly for now i find that a courtier is just as honest a man as a patriot  my dear they are both made of the same stuff ah i have at last found out what sort of an animal a patriot is   coun ay  and pray brother what sort of an animal is he   odogh why he is a sort of a political weathercock that is blown about by every wind of society which the foolish people are always looking up at and staring and distracting themselves with the integrity of its vicissitudes  today it is blown by the rough rattling tempest of party next day by the tradewind of fly subtle veering faction then by the headlong hurricane of the peoples hot foggy breath huzza boys down with the courtier up with the patriot till at last the smooth soft gentle warm breeze of interest blows upon it and from that moment it rusts to a point and never stirs after  so there is your puff patriot for you  ogh to the devil i pitch them all   coun ha ha ha i am glad to find brother that you are come to that way of thinking at last and i wish you had had the same notions years ago it would have saved you many thousands   odogh indeed and that it would  however experience is an excellent tutor and as you are a young man and just coming into the world mine may be of some service to you take this judgment from me then and remember that an honest quiet country gentleman who out of policy and humanity establishes manufactories or that contrives employment for the idle and the industrious or that makes but a blade of corn grow where there was none before is of more use to this poor country than all the courtiers and patriots and politicians and prodigals that are unhanged  so there let us leave them and return to my wifes business   coun with all my heart i long to have a particular account of her conduct   odogh o brother i have many grievances to tell you of but i have one that is more whimsical than all the rest   coun pray what is it   odogh why you must know brother i am going to be a cuckold as fast as i can   coun ha ha ha that is a comical grievance indeed   odogh o stay till you hear the story and i will engage you will say it is as comical a cuckoldom as ever was contrived   coun i am glad to find sir it is of so sacetious a nature  pray let me hear this business   odogh sit down then brother for i have got a little touch of my gout let us sit down for a moment and i will let you into the whole affair   coun pray do sir for you have really raised my curiosity   sits odogh you must know brother there is an english coxcomb in this town just arrived among us who thinks every woman that sees him is in love with him and this spark like another paris of troy has taken it into his head to make a helen of my wife and a poor cuckoldy menelaus of me   coun ha ha ha pray who is the spark   odogh why the name of this cuckoldmaker is mushroom but from his conceit and impertinence the women and jokers of this town have dignified him with the title of count mushroom sir he is the son of a pawnbroker in london who having a mind to make a gentleman of his son sent him to the university of oxford where by mixing in the follies and vices of irregular youth he got into a most sanguine friendship with young lord oldcastle who you know has a large estate in this country and of whose ancestors mine have held long and profitable leases which are now near expiring  in short sir this same count mushroom and my lord became the pylades and orestes of the age and so very fond was my lord of him that out of sheer friendship to the count he got his sister with child   coun ha ha ha that was friendly indeed   odogh o yes it was what you may call modern friendship taste and bun tun and my lord being a man of gratitude in return made him his agent in this country and sent him over to settle his affairs here and the count and i being in treaty to renew the leases with my lord and we not being able to agree upon the terms the coxcomb sends my wife a warm billedoux in which he very gallantly tells her that she shall decide the difference between us and settle the leases at her own price only upon the trifling condition that he may be permitted now and then to be the occasional lord of her ladyships matrimonial manor   coun impudent rascal and pray what says my sister to all this   odogh why she does not know a word of the matter   coun no pray how came you to be acquainted with his letter then and his designs upon my sister   odogh why there is the joke it was by the help of katty farrel my wifes woman by whose assistance i carry on a correspondence with the fellow in my wifes name unknown to her and by that means i shall not only detect and expose the fellow but get an excellent bargain of the leases which are to be signed this very day   coun but sir i hope you wont accept of leases upon those terms   odogh o i have no time to moralize with you on that point but depend upon it i will convince you before i sleep of the propriety of my taking the leases lord what signifies it it is only a good bargain got from a foolish lord by the ingenuity of a knavish agent which is what happens every day in this country and in every country indeed   enter john john sir mr mushroom and mr sharp the attorney are below   odogh o they are come about the leases i will wait on them john   exit john now brother you shall see one of the pertest and most conceited impudent coxcombs that has ever yet been imported into this land or that disgraced humanity   mushroom without mush my compliments mrs katty to your lady i will be with her in the twinkling of a star or in less time than a single glance of her own immortal beauty can pass to the center of an amorous heart   odogh orra now did you ever hear such cursed nonsense   enter mushroom mush my dear diggerty i kiss your hands i am come on purpose  i beg ten thousand pardons  i understood you were alone  you are busy i presume   odogh indeed count we are not this gentleman is a relation  my wifes brother  counselor hamilton whom you have so often heard me talk of and with whom i desire you will be acquainted   mush sir i feel a superlative happiness in being known to you i have long expected and long wished for it with a lovers appetite therefore without waiting for the dull avocation of experience or the pedantic forms of ceremony i beg you will honor me with a niche in your esteem and register me in the select catalogue of your most constant and most ardent friends and admirers   coun o dear sir you are superabundantly obliging  this is such a favor    mush no no no  none none  give me your hand hamilton you are my friend diggertys friend and that is enough  i will serve you  say no more  i will serve you  rely upon me  i live in this town quite en famille  i go about every where am of no party but those of love pleasure and gallantry  the women like and command me at cards tea scandal and dancing  the men at wit hazard jolly parties a late hour and a bottle  i love ease hate ceremony and am at home wherever i go  that is my system hamilton  ha is not that taste life philosophy and summum bonum  ha my dear at home wherever i go ant i diggerty   odogh o indeed to give you your due count you are never bashful in any place   mush never never my dear   odogh no faith nor none of your family i believe   mush ha ha ha never never my dear diggerty  bashfulness is a mark of ignorance an uncourtly vulgar disease  what we men of the world are never infected with  but my dear diggerty i am come on purpose to settle with you my attorney with the leases is below for as i know my lord would be loath to lose you as a tenant and as i am convinced it would be for his interest you should have the lands why we will even sign and seal at once upon your own terms  for really i think tenants in ireland want encouragement  they are racked too high  they are indeed  it is a shame they should be racked so high   odogh faith count there is many a true word poke in jest   mush upon my honor i am serious  you want encouragement in trade too   odogh but do you really think so   mush i do upon my honor and i will speak to some people of consequence about it on the other side as soon as i return   odogh orra but will you   mush i will upon my honor   odogh o aye you politicians promise us the devil and all

claret  excellent claret upon my honor it is true indeed it is not such claret as we drink in london  however upon the whole it is a pretty neat light soft silky palateable wine and i like it mightily  but your fish in this here country is horrid there you want taste hamilton  that there is an article of the scavoir vivre in which you are totally ignorant  quite barbarous    coun aye in what respect sir   mush oh my dear hamilton how can you ask such a question  you you now  who have been in london  why you eat all your fish here too no    coun too no   mush yes all too no  why you eat it the very day  nay sometimes the very hour it comes out of the water  now that there is a total want of taste  quite barbarous   odogh o yes brother we eat all our fish in this here country too no  too no a great deal now i fancy count we should keep our fish before we dress it as you keep your venison till it has got the hot gout   mush ha ha ha  the hot gout  ha ha ha  oh i shall expire  my dear diggerty i honor your hot gout  but your french is a little en irlandois  en provence  haut gout is the word   odogh yes yes  i understand you  fogo   mush ha ha ha  hamilton you are a little odd in this here country in some points  your friend there  is  you understand me  however upon the whole take you altogether you are a damned honest tory rory rantum scantum dancing singing laughing boozing jolly friendly fighting hospitable people and i like you mightily   omnes ha ha ha   coun upon my word sir the people of ireland are much obliged to you for your helter skelter rantum scantum portrait

you do us that honor   mush i really intend it   odogh faith then you will be a great honor to us and you will find a great many relations here count for we have a large crop of the mushrooms in this here country   mush o sir i dont doubt it for we are a numerous family both in england and ireland  but i beg pardon my dear diggerty i must rob you of my company for a moment to pay my devoirs to your lady i know she is impatient to see me upon a particular affair  i will return upon the wings of diligence then sign squeeze wax and dedicate to wit mirth and convivial jollity  hamilton yours

last night to my lady kinnegad and some more of them at bragg  but do not take any notice that i have told you of it for she intends to borrow as much from mr mushroom for a day or two as will pay the

irishtown or ringsend oh every thing i set my eyes on here gives me the ennui and the country cure   odogh o yes every thing here gives her the contre coeur that is a disease she has brought over with her from london that we know nothing of here   mrs dig the streets are so narrow the houses so dirty and the people so ridiculous then the women count ha ha ha  i cannot help laughing when i think of them well i am convinced that the women of this here country who have never traveled have nothing of that  a  a  nonchalance and that jennyseequee that we have in london   odogh o no brother the women

finer than this here   coun then you were at the city feast too sister   mrs dig o dear yes the court never stirred without me   odogh no indeed the court never stirred without her   mrs dig and the lord mayor made a point of having me there so i went with her grace a friend of mine and a party of the court as one of the household  but the minute i went in every eye was upon me lord it was veestly pleasant to see how the she grocers the she mercers the she dyers the she hosiers and the she tailors did stare at me  i was very brilliant that is certain  rather more so than i was at the wedding   odogh o indeed i dont doubt but you were a sight   mrs dig o pray mr diggerty be quiet and dont interrupt me  well but brother as i was saying it was imminsely entertaining to hear the awkward city creatures whisper and give their vardee upon me in their city manner  lord is this the handsome irish woman  the famous irish toast the celebrated mrs diggerty  ha  i dont think she is so handsome says one  hum  well enough says another only i dont like her nose  pray does not she squint says a third  o yes she certainly squints says a fourth  and she is a little crooked  but she is

expect in this little production an extempore on the famous mrs odiggertys dancing at court  now attend  when beauteous diggerty leads up the dance in fair britannias court then every heart is in a prance and longs for cupids sport beaux ogle and pant and gaze belles envy and sneer yet praise as venus herself were there and prudes agree it must be she it must be she  or diggerty it must be she  or diggerty or diggerty the fair  bows very low to mrs diggerty that is all gentlemen that is all  only a jeu desprit as i told you a slight effort of a muse bound in the silken chains of beauty and delight   he bows she curtsies coun conceited coxcomb   aside mush and now madam i have a favor to beg of you   mrs dig o command it  what is it   mush why madam as the celebrated doctor thomas augustus arne has honored this hasty offspring with an alliance of his harmonious mule and as your ladyship has frequently heretofore enlivened it with your vocal glee shall we beg that you will once more animate these verbal images with a touch of your promethean pipe   mrs dig o dear count you are veestly panegyrical   coun aye aye come sister as you have the tune oblige us with it   mrs dig i

o then only show me the necessity and all my objections will vanish   mrs dig why sir i am affronted for want of a title a parcel of upstarts with their crownets upon their coaches their chairs their spoons their handkerchiefs  nay on the very knockers of their doors  creatures that were below me but the other day are now truly my superiors and have the precedence and are set above me at table   odogh set above you at table   mrs dig yes sir set above me at table wherever i go   odogh upon my honor then that is a great shame well well my dear  come come my dear dont be in such a fluster   mrs

more provoking to a woman of my teest and spirit than to hear the titles of a parcel of upstart ugly creatures bawled in ones ears upon every occasion  my lady kinnegads coach there  my lady kilgobbins chair there  my lady casteknocks servants there  my lady tanderagees chariot there and after all these titles only consider how my vile neem founds  cries mrs diggertys servants there  mrs diggertys chair there  mrs diggertys coach there  it is so mean and beggarly i cannot bear it  the very thought of it makes me ready to burst my stays and almost throws me into my hysterics   throws herself into a couch odogh nay my dear dont be working yourself up to your sits your hysterics and your tantrums now   mrs dig my life is miserable rises you cross me in every thing you are always finding fault with my routs and my drums and my fancy ball  the other night you would not make up a dress for it nor appear at it  o fie fie fie  but you are true irish to the very bone of you   odogh indeed i am and to the marrow within the bone too and what is more i hope i shall never be otherwise   mrs dig ridiculous weakness pray sir do not you think the english love their country as well as the irish do theirs   odogh o indeed i believe they do and a great deal better though we have a great many among us that call themselves patriots and champions who at the same time would not care if poor old ireland was squeezed as you squeeze an orange  provided they had but their share of the juice   mrs dig pooh pooh nobody minds what you say  you are always abusing every body in power  well sir you see the english are improving in teest every day and have their burlettas and their operas their cornelys their almacks their macaronies    odogh o my dear i tell you again and again that the english can never be precedent to us they by their genius and constitution must always run mad about something or other either about burlettas pantomimes a man in a bottle a cocklane ghost or something of equal importance but my dear they can afford to run mad after such nonsense why they owe more money than we are worth stay till we are as rich as they are and then we may be allowed to run mad after absurdities as well as they   mrs dig mighty well sir mighty well oh mighty well   odogh heyday what is the matter now   mrs dig but i see your design  you have a mind to break my heart  sobs and cries  yes you argue and contradict me for no other end  you do every thing to fret and vex me   odogh pray explain my dear what is it you mean   mrs dig why sir ever since i returned to this odious country i have been requesting and begging and praying that you would send to london only for the set of longtailed horses that i told you i admired so  but no i cannot prevail though you know my lady kilgobbin my lady balruddery my lady castleknock and in short every lady of figure all run upon long tails  nobody but doctors apothecaries lawyers cits and country squires drive with short tails now  for my part you know i detest a short tail   odogh well my dear i have sent for your brother to town on purpose to settle all these points between us and if he thinks it proper that you should have long tails you may have them as long as my lady kilgobbins my lady balrudderys tails or any tails in the universe and as to the title if it can be had why we will submit that to him

marriage articles upon a separation or your husbands death you are entitled only to a hundred pounds a year which cautious pittance his prudence wisely insisted on as a necessary check upon the conduct of giddy female youth and thoughtless vanity when matched with the tempered age of sobriety and discretion  now madam i am commissioned to inform you that the doors are open and that the stipulated sum will be punctually paid you as your vicious appetite shall demand for know that neither your husbands love my affection nor a residence in this house can be enjoyed by you another hour

precedence that grieve him for they have made you the ridicule of every flirt and coxcomb and the scorn and pity of every sober person that knows your folly this reflects disgrace upon your friends contempt upon the spirit and credit of your husband and has furnished whispering suspicion with stories and implications which have secretly fixed an infectious stain upon your chastity   both rise

thousand outlandish kickshaws that i am sure were never designed for christian food and let the good rough rumps of beef the jolly surloins the geefe and turkies cram fowls bacon and greens and the pies puddings and pasties that used to be perfectly shoving one another off of the table so that there was not room for the peoples plates with a fine large cod too as big as a young alderman  i say let all those french kickshaws be banished from my table and these good old irish dishes be put in their places and then the poor every day will have something to eat   mrs dig they shall sir   odogh and as to yourself my dear nancy i hope i shall never have any more of your london english none of your this here is your that there is your winegars your weals your vindors your toastesses and your

him notwithstanding   mush o yes my dear he is a very pretty fellow  that all the world allows   odogh it is very true but his prettiness will be his ruin for as he makes it his business and his glory to win the affections of women wherever he goes and as he has made conquests of several married women in this town there are half a dozen husbands of us that have agreed to poison him   mush how poison him o horrid why that will be murder my dear   odogh o that is none of our business  let him look to that  we must leave that to the law  the fellow is always following you to the playhouse
