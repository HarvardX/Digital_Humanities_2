the examiner a satire by arthur murphy esquire  te lupe te muti et genuinum fregit in illis perseus london printed for j coote at the kings arms in paternoster row  mdcclxi  price one shilling and sixpence  advertisement the author of the following poem is apprehensive that neither he nor the objects of his satire are of consequence enough to engage attention to so long a piece as he has been drawn into by the nature of his subject but as he has been pestered with defamatory pieces for several months past with rosciads apologies murphyads meretriciads etc etc etc and as it must be imagined that the men who have miscarried of all these libels have found encouragement from some sorts of readers it is now hoped that they who have afforded leisure for a perusal of the pieces against the present writer will do him the justice to hear him speak for himself he is sorry that he has been obliged to employ his time in this sort of controversy which he despises as a thing illiberal in itself dishonorable to letters and generally the mean subterfuge of those who want to make a livelihood of an authors name but he thought the rancour discharged against him merited a retort not for the mischief it had done but on account of the malignity of the design excited by this motive he took up the pen and as mr pope says of his imitations of horace he thought an answer upon boileaus model would be more full and of more dignity than any he could have made in his own person he has only to add that he does not intend to maintain these people by carrying on a paperwar for unless he has some extreme provocation and that too with more wit than they have hitherto exerted he is determined to look down upon them with a contemptuous silence for the future his writings should they attack them will speak though feebly for themselves and his morals if traduced will falsify their slander and tell each of them aloud to use the words adopted by a noble prelate on a similar occasion mentiris impudentissime  lincolns inn      n b the reader will observe that expostulation stands at the head of the poem though changed for another word in the title page and this must be accounted for  the very men who provoked the author to this piece began to crouch from the lash as soon as they heard it was hanging over them and to weaken its effect they immediately advertised a poem called the expostulation it was therefore thought proper not to cancel what was then printed off but to prevent the confusion of two pieces with the same name to give the subsequent poem a new title page and now the sons of darkness are welcome to avail themselves of their design truly worthy of such liberal men    the expostulation a satire with thee thou inward spark of vital fire who do each function and each thought inspire who now impellst me into scenes of strife now wiser bidst me seek the calms of life with thee my mind now must i converse hold and all i think and feel shall now be told too long my indolence forbore to weed thy rankling faults which now have grown to seed but since at length you have fairly roused my gall now hear your own my friend and once for all to hear thee in thy wild capricious vein at dullness rail the cause of wit sustain discourse of authors and decide their fate important master of each learned debate and boldly thunder out thy classic lore wed swear above all modern fame you soar for just expression and conception true for genius taste and spirit  who but you you one would think in this degenerate time alone should wear the meed of sacred rhyme and boast so freely all around you deal no pore to smart at and no nerve to feel but i who know your very inmost part come sit you down and let me wring your heart yes i who know which way your folly tends who count your vices at my fingers ends laugh in my sleeve whenever so pert and vain you dogmatise in high parnassian strain or when incensed your neighbors faults you scan forget the author and dissect the man no barrister harrangues with half your spleen when lords refuse her not miss f  d so keen but tell me sir does heaven thy breast inspire with emanations of aetherial fire does that fine phrenzy in thy bosom roll which fires a genius and pervades his soul to thee propitious have the aonian maids led thy young footsteps to their springs and shades know whoever fails parnassus height to climb and taste the well whence flows immortal rhyme on wings icarian vain excursions tries and downward cleaves the unelastic skies ranks not with dryden on the rubric row but crawls with lloyd among the weeds below but if advice unheard remonstrance vain you needs must follow still this idle strain by fairer methods aim at general praise nor on the thorns of satire graft your bays with a bold hand bid clio sweep the string and sound the virtues of a british king show him with all his subjects blessings crowned in war victorious and in arts renowned tell how the muses with a generous strife rouse at his voice and waken into life swell at his word the rhine with gallic blood and bid thy verse devolve a crimson flood sing how the indian near the rising day lays down his arms and venerates his sway what though apollo should his aid refuse you will show at least a kind goodnatured muse perhaps may sell reflect what gain twill bring ye an ounce of incense for a solid guinea but i you will say your feeble powers invite to regions that demand an eagles flight a british king should have a muse of fire to sing augustus calls for virgils lyre but lloyd and i who without phoebus aid are doomed to follow still the rhyming trade a theme so lofty we can never rehearse mere spiderspinners of a cobweb verse for us twere best not tempt forbidden lays nothing dishonours like insipid praise at fulsome panegyric void of skill blush though the poet cannot the patron will and thus my mind thus would you hide your spleen and to malignity give candours mien were it not better mount in epic bold and be whatever romes querno was of old like him in fustian prove the public sport and be the rhyming blockhead of a court than strive with wit to say the piercing thing and dart your soul in each envenomed sting hopst thou to rival popes immortal page and smile at folly in a future age cast but your eye around you and survey books once admired now withering in decay whole poems for their time delightful found all now transferred to grocers by the pound verse that could once a ladys toilet grace against a dead wall attracts the livried race else to high holborn or moorfields consigned midst other stillborn embryos of the mind it lies for ages doomed in silence deep with shirleys pepin or black prince to sleep where worms subsist on rhymes once counted terse and elegantly feed on mouldring verse but grant your works may share a better fate and taste or true or false prolong their date grant that your foes may all wellnichd in rhyme go down ridiculous to latest time yet while you live if mankind hate or fear what can avail the laurel on your bier slow comes if warfare is the authors doom slow comes the praise engraven on his tomb what demon then inflames your angry fits why wage a war with blockheads or with wits the envenomed shaft they have levelled at your name has the blow reached you  have they hurt your same and why then drag them to the public eye in their obscurity let libels die lloyds poetry is quietly inurnd from dirt twas born and is to dirt returned incog the craftsman vented all his spite his perished essays never saw the light the apology is numbered with the dead each trunk it decks lie lightly on its head in peace henceforth may every scribbling slave creep to oblivious slumber in his grave yes write who will each blockhead still possess the liberty or license of the press each modern curl still has his rubric post and every press maintains a scribbling host hence englands navy often defrauded stands and the soil loses its manuring hands bankrupts in trade their pens that moment dip as rats will issue from a sinking ship each printer perks subscriptions in your face proposals crowd each diuretic place and yet no patriot reformation makes nor yet whom hunger spares the pressact takes writers abound no bard so void of fire but finds his fools to purchase and admire you only you remain disgusted still the fancied regent of the muses hill but since on others works you must refine and trace new blemishes in every line since censor like you judge each writers wit think in your turn to what must you submit naught can escape thy strong satyric force but of yourself how does the world discourse first lloyd will cry  now estimate your fame murphy or durfey for it is all the same a line of mr

pupil shall attend his will there shall he to his circle wisely drunk now praise the jealous wife and now a punk then vent his spleen in his malignant fit against thy life thy morals and thy wit his meagre cheek midst his nocturnal sport with envy pale and his lips black with port beware he cries of that proud haughty spirit who views malignly every poets merit still fond in lettered warfare to engage some gadfly bites and stings him to a rage a fool who thinks his notions to dispense the legislator of all taste and sense he runs a muck and quite a coxcomb grown hates colmans comedies and likes his own at bar or senate never approves a speech and falls asleep though churchills self should preach churchill a rough unwieldy son of earth warm for his friends and foe to others worth inflamed with malice in invective fierce a vigorous daylabourer in verse who by sharp scandal hopes in wit to sway as hannibal by vinegar made way he too shall rouse your writings to revile and make

aloft to fame but thou a helpless an inglorious name with not a friend to deck thy brow with bays do thou alas aspire to general praise to draw from books in him is great indeed in such as thee it is criminal to read seated by party on the muses throne whatever he takes by conquest is his own if ever he deign to shine in borrowed lays for him they will quote immortal homers days but thou presume to imitate a line no star maeonian on thy head shall shine whatever praise with all thy toil and pain thou gainst my friend thou must with envy gain declared a plagiary proclaimed aloud a mere jackdaw in furtive colors proud thus do they treat you an auxiliar band list in their cause and thicken round the land to arms to arms the scribbling legion cries your goosequills seize his reputation dies see shirley rushes on devoid of fear and leads his craftsman and his gazetteer in tenfold brass behold the murphyad rise armed at all points with ribaldry and lies see grubstreet opens her ten thousand doors see billingsgate unsluices all her stores see essays fables puns assist the fray abuse descending from confedrate say printer of the gazetteer  see authors on all sides desert their dens new edge their blunted wits and nib their pens all who in distant hockleyhole reside and they who drink fleetditch thy sable tide who in moorfields have scrawld a darkened cell in the kings bench or in the compter dwell on ludgate hill who bloody murders write or pass in fleetstreet supperless the night the bards who doze around an alehouse fire who tipple drams or fatten with entire thick as when locusts over the land appear and ruin all the promise of the year thick as when pismires crawl along the plain or halfstarvd crows around some ripened grain they sorm their ranks they rail they doom me dead and the press aims its thunders on my head their sooty naiads you address in vain their naiads sore will madden every brain and tell me was it not a crying sin to represent poor shirley drunk with gin why deal on churchill the malicious blow and hurl him down to grots of mud below must you sor ever in new broils engage must i still be a victim for your rage must still your petulance mankind provoke answer me fairly for it is past a joke what can you urge  must i then bear you say to be made still the topic of the day still must i hear and never once reply teased as i am by all the scribbling fry must i not dare resent tormented sore with churchills rumbling rosciad over and over shall lloyd with fables and epistles teaze and dine upon me whensoeer he please i never can and let the vermin know it bear in the dog days a reciting poet a bard who takes a mean clandestine aim to raise himself and wound anothers fame or if of open combat not afraid calls in his brother bravoes to his aid on strength of numbers his whole courage grounds and whom he single dreads with clans surrounds for me i never formed a junto yet never made a black conspiracy in wit at others fortune never heaved a sigh nor viewed a rival with an eunuchs eye never sought the silent covert of the night to steal unseen and stab with coward spite if ever provoked to tempt the lettered fray i still like ajax wished for open day and may my name stand ay accursed by men if ever i hold a dark insidious pen ill fare the page though all the nine should join to point each thought and harmonize the line ill fare the page by envys breath inspired and not with generous emulation fired that anger bears without occasion fit and quarrels for the vain renown of wit in an ingenuous mind that plants a sting or of young genius hurts the trembling wing to war with merit that would rather choose than glow with generous rapture for the muse but shall each mean each vulgar son of earth my fame attack my morals and my birth shall grovelling lloyd deride the author squire nor i indignant kindle into fire gods shall an upstart grow up into life a peers dependant by a strumpet wife titles assume free from invective spite and honors sons not claim an equal right still on my head shall furious churchills rage come inexhausted foaming over his page what crime has made it my unhappy lot to bear his phrenzy  i provoked him not when he my enemy avowed became had i ever stained my volume with his name his bread to injure did i ever strive kind heaven i knew not such a thing alive his rage announed him first as bugs by night to warn ye of their being stink and bite and thus attacked shall i not ward the blow not bid defiance to the insulting foe shall i not tell the scurrilous divine the naiads of fleetditch inspire his line not tell his pious leer and double chin that arrogance and venom dwell within as some huge marble goodly to the sight where the blue veins meander and unite where nature throws a grace on every part and with a casual hand outrivals art soon as the workman cleaves it is ponderous side and bids the mass in various parts divide within the center of the enormous load strange to relate he finds a lurking toad is it injustice is it barbarous skill with his own arts the murderer to kill consider well the matter and you will find i only claim what is claimed by all mankind the generous freedom to declare my mind each reader claims it standing at a stall each critic claims it who never reads at all who can behold a selfapplauded bard whose every line does common sense discard but instant cries the silly scribbling fool of a bribed bookseller the venal tool or else the madman shut from pen and ink let him of hellebore deep doses drink this will they say and what do i say more they speak unhurt provoked i quit the score is this the sign of a malignant spirit that views with envious eye each authors merit by more deliberate means know envy tends saps on unseen and withering gains its ends hoards her designs never acts the open part smiles in your face and stabs you to the heart  marcus has genius  but i never can but mourn one thing  he is thought a dangerous man does alcibiades direct the state enlighten to the senate a debate does he fulfill each part in private life true to his friends and tender to his wife envy grants all  yet should a tale be told i hope it will not  it makes my blood run cold should i relate  you would all in wonder fix how with such feelings cruelty can mix thus cautious malice never once speaks out but nods winks hesitates and hints a doubt not so the honest mind  from bias free it courts no object sacred truth but thee for thee it searches all with stern delight brings a right honorable lie to light through each false medium darts a look severe and through his dignities can eye a peer gives things their proper name with freedom brave a cats a cat and lloyd a playhouse slave in works of wit never lets opinion sway nor joins the current fashion of the day each piece rejudges by the rules of art and plays over all an aristarchus part marks the obscure to oerlook can never incline the lazy harshness of a rugged line the ambitious poverty of sounding phrase the mediocrity of easy lays the wornout joke the raillery unfit the mere rough horseplay of a clumsy wit with faults like these if the work venal stand it marks each fault with a proscribing hand pronounces sentence with a critics fire and leaves the authors faction to admire are there who stoop a manager to please who if he belches can commend his ease around the town who circulate his tales and take the freedom of the house for vails is there a clerk who writes for hire the day and steals at night to see a virgin play a bard whose tragedy rejected lies and each day bathes in tears its parents eyes or else whose muse nine nights escaped disgrace and hates with female spite a rival face en such with other fops the vain the sad fwits halfbeaux halfparsons and halfmad whenever they please in dread array can sit the selfimpannelld jury of the pit annoy the playrs with scorn each scene dismiss whistle and catcall roar and chafe and hiss rise from the unfinished piece the bard decry the only culprit that unheard must die a writ of error should he dare to bring and fly on millars or on tonsons wing of every reader he becomes the slave the standing jest of each buffooning knave in humble preface he implores in vain or lulls with dedications gentle strain the poets judge no soothing arts assuage as jeffries rigid and foulmouthed as page and must i only then still choke with bile shall men be coxcombs nor i dare to smile not dare to smile when all around i see each garret emptying its full reams on me on me who heaven be thanked have had the skill to keep at bay the brethren of the quill who never with shirley have a pipe enjoyed nor at bob derrys have got drunk with lloyd who shun the haunts of each dull scribbling fool and never with churchill read my works to pool a lady celebrated in a late indecent poem called the meretriciad  my writings hurt them  what sir  their success may envy still grow pale nor know redress my satire hurts them too  misguided men who own a wound from such a powrless pen a muse like mine may serve but never bites who without me had known that shirley writes yes yes he writes nor has my feeble strain congealed his sense or petrified his vein still churchill pours the torrent of his wit yet why  the advice i gave was sound and fit no more abroad to mend the manners roam but know that charity begins at home and ever to plays and playrs you turn your head attend your function and inter the dead this was the counsel this the kind address and tell me frankly said his b  p less whom have i wounded  did i ever with art aim at the innocent a poisoned dart on any honest head did i with skill a drop of venom from my pen distill show me the man whom real genius fires who pants for fame and whom the god inspires of right and wrong the bounds who still can find and boasts the pure recesses of the mind who free from envy sees a rising youth his breast impregnated with generous truth fond to oblige desirous to commend nor for his talents jealous of a friend in his own way a rival who can eye nor to subvert him helps about a lie show such a man my idol he shall prove and even with johnson shall divide my love but should there issue forth a pigmy wight still flagrant from the rod who needs must write whose hand still tingling from the ushers stroke must pen an essay and the muse provoke prate like a connoisseur of just and fit yet want the growth of manhood and of wit from a friends genius who his strength derives as the crab grafted on the medlar thrives who thus supported can the merit claim even from the stock whence his nutrition came in selfapplause who can whole hours employ while his fond eye consents in tears of joy by works of darkness hopes to rise to day and damns a brief and pettyfogs a play cabals and plots and wriggles for a name and shrinks and withers at a rivals fame fears lest your industry with him should vie and seems a friend to be a surer spy fond to advise you merely to deceive and if your work succeeds the first to grieve who for his ends mean offices can bear and fetch and carry letters for a playr who deems a manager a sacred thing and swears who laughs at him  dislikes his king far far from me let such his talents boast and be the genius of an evening post farther still farther let crispinus stand between us rise whole continents of land yet ever we part his picture i would choose come then and sit crispinus for the muse the honest muse whose hand severely kind shall crayon forth each feature of thy mind her work begins  emerging from the strife of mingling colors lo he starts to life is that crispinus  what that uncouth form who seems a very monster in a storm can he or truth or poesy dispense that caliban in manners as in sense in his fierce look what passions scowling lie the downward head and the assassins eye his very youth against decency rebelled from school with early infamy expelled thence cometlike irregular he flew and as he fled still more eccentric grew still he despised all order sense and rank at fairs he cudgelled and with porters drank in every low dexterity he dealt broughtonian fame and judgment at a blt there is a game among the vulgar called pricking at the bt  at wheelbarrows for apples coggd the dice in every alehouse gathered every vice till wondrous to relate his race to crown he sanctified his scandal with a gown then tartufflike a pulpit he attained with real malice and devotion feigned there pious leers a satyr in disguise and talks of virtue with lascivious eyes for scanty hire the morning lecture gives and still a needy bacchanalian lives his days of folly one continued round now at the punchhouse now the skittleground now at the billiardroom whole hours he will sit now hiss the foremost critic of the pit to works obscene now lend the obscener jest and to a meretriciad give a zest to acts of envy all his soul inclined a mere thersites both in form and mind his pleasure still to join the rabble race and with low ribaldry each name deface all worth above him eager to annoy mischief his pride and malice all his joy even in the church where he should truths impart he proves a vile apostate in his heart midst the lords prays his spleen a lie can frame and meditate a murder of your fame midst his devotion against heaven rebel and even his very wit can pimp for hell can on detraction at the altar plod assist the fiends and tear him from his god if such crispinus may he shun my ways and be his calumny my highest praise thee too orbilius thee my just disdain rejects thou meanest of the envenomed train to thy green years if nature ever was kind grown old in youth you are now a vanished mind by drams thy faculties dissolved away of rankling envy thou art left the prey he knows thy character who sees thy face thy looks a libel on the human race the envious sneer is thine if genius rise the ghastly smile when patient merit sighs thinking that frets but never tends to use the pangs of labor nothing that produce the hypocritic leer the fawning style the timid anger and the treacherous smile rancour that lusts each neighbor to abuse an unperforming pigeonliverd muse the narrow spirit that for pelf can pray profusion that can muddle it away so mean for favors he can humbly sue so proud when granted can abuse you too thus for a job a genius he addressed an understrapper at his own request then at his patron railed with rancrous heart and from accomplice played the informers part a figure which the loves and joys forsake which would each prostitute a vestal make but that all virtue still to put to flight he panders schoolboys to the foul delight despised by rakes sad outcast of the schools bullied by cowards a flattrer to fools a mere  but more the muse will not detect for who can bear a maggot to dissect sworn in a laegue when bards like these combine and rancour is the apollo of each line when half wits convenanted seize the bays and sing alternate one anothers praise from others brows when every sprig they tear vainly they think usurperslike to wear when their own works for models they display and this mans poems show and tothers play at this i burst at this my muse proceeds not like the barber whispering to the reeds but tells aloud and calls the world to hear each jealous scribbler wears an asss ear but still i am told why quarrel with these fools why indiscreetly wanton with edge tools satires a dangerous weapon and has made adverse to pope himself the rhyming trade let your satyric muse renounce her pen or never dare to tread the stage again else shall the vandals storm you from the pit and with their lungs revenge their want of wit must i then stand appalled by partyzeal no  to a peoples judgment i appeal that people ever generous as brave from ruffian hands the virgin muse will save a play of merit their protection draws find but the piece and they will find applause faction with all her catcalls shall retire and envy withering by degrees expire even each false friend shall shake his head in vain and feel from wit the pleasure and the pain but still though here the disappointed foe sounds a retreat he aims a second blow angry be foams he roars with croaking note the scenes are patchwork like a josephs coat the whole a motley linsey wolsey piece from old and modern rome from france and greece why let em say it  but shall men expect to find us scholars then as thieves detect shall i see others rifle all the spring nor dare a garland for myself to bring no let me roam through each poetic shade taste every fount and visit every glade crop from each antients brow the fairest flowers and follow genius to the aonian bowers still some small spark of inspiration gain or from the muse or museinspired train ye sacred nine to whom i lowly bend to whom my morning orisons ascend with whom my earliest youth aspired to dwell and sought your visions in each pensive cell give me oh give me purer air to breathe in haunts where poet never culled a wreath bid unseen images before me roll and stream the fair ideas on my soul or if like philips son i sight in vain for some new worlds yet unexplord domain like him then let me make the old my own its manners view and leave no tract unknown chief let the band who warmed a happier age its manners view and leave no tract unknown chief let the band who warmed a happier age who strung the lyre or gave the historic page let them oh let them teach their sacred lore and of fair wisdom open all their store at morn at eve the rapture still impart and touch with finer sentiment the heart embellish virtue give the lash to crimes and be the moralists of aftertimes illustrious race if ever i court the muse some heavenly portion of yourselves infuse nor let the flowers which at your shrine i gain transplanted die and curse my barren brain but round my brow ye sons of lasting praise with modern ivy twine one sprig of bays old homer thus could maros breast inspire and thus menander his own terence fire moliere himself the great moliere whose view unmasked each object and looked nature through in plautus colors could his pencil dip and like the be each various fragrance sip seize the true comic each diverting whim and spain and italy both wrote for him on ancient columns johnson raised his name on borrowed wings even shakespeare soared to fame the manly wycherley loved foreign lays and steel and vanbrugh traveled for their bays on their example will i rest my cause though niggard envy still withold applause yes while i live it is my settled plan whatever i read to profit all i can though dullness sons conjoined  friend learn to fear the voice of prudence whispers in my ear why dullness sons for ever  let the men just bubble up and then sink down again soothem with flattery  to oppose is vain with all my heart  i will sing another strain bob lloyd in fable equals la fontain colman the comic muse is yours entire and juvenal must yield to churchills fire flexney and thrush and pottinger and say the weekly lie the scandal of the day the lurking foe  bravo my mind  proceed it is wondrous well  bravissimo indeed but can thou sooth them with this artful style it is deep malignity beneath a smile this praise that damns will makeem chafe the more heavens how they now will fret and rave and roar hard is at best the fate of all who choose for idle fame to meditate the muse tapers light up to lend mankind a ray and unregarded waste themselves away round you more various ills in ambush wait for you must add severity to fate lo from the printing house one darts his pen and vomits smoke like cacus from his den st jamess chronicle alarms the town and in four columns scandal marches down but scandal say you soon must droop its head at morn it flutters and at eve it is dead for boys at school it helps to vamp a kite or else emblazes some rejoicing night to the tale whispered or the printed lie a life well acted is a dread reply to all the harm a jealous wit can mean a piece well written is the worst of spleen it is my mind then let it be your rule to smile contempt on every scribbling fool what smile in silence and with patience bear fierce slanders tongue and envys livid glare no from the lash be every witling sore as for their malice witches died of yore alas alas all grubstreet in a rage will lay its harpy claws upon your page your name each angry bard will still pursue what can the bravoes of parnassus do what should i fear  an evidence suborned and every mischief from a poet scorned who can  what can he  hush  speak out  again be prudent friend or fairly drop your pen finis
