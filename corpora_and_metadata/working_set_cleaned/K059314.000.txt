and endeavoring to conceal the generous hand that bestows it permit me in the name of a public charity to pay the due tribute of public thanks for the kind favor and protection with which you were pleased to honor the asylum a protection which we with pleasure consider as the foundation of our present success and the earnest of future prosperity the following pages have no pretentions to any

instances to convince the reader that the sure and only method to obtain the royal favor is to deserve it  that a life so essential as your majestys to the welfare and happiness of thousands may be long continued to us in uninterrupted health peace and felicity is the sincere wish of every english heart and the constant prayer of  madam your majestys most faithful subject and servant thomas francklin great queen  street june   th      hosea c xiv v   in thee the fatherless finds mercy amongst all those virtues and perfections which contribute to the luster and dignity of human nature charity has ever held the first and most exalted station as the best and truest representative of the most high god his vicegerent upon earth commissioned as it were by him to remove the wants soften the calamities and mitigate the sorrows of mankind  the age we live in can not i fear with any propriety be styled the age of wit or wisdom of learning piety or virtue but it may perhaps not undeservedly be called the age of charity never was there a time wherein so many hospitals schools and foundations have been raised and supported amongst us it is indeed astonishing when we consider the variety of channels through which our bounty has flowed to reflect how full the current is in every one of them but what can not the gracious providence of god maintain and preserve the same divine power which so marvellously filled the widows cruise of oil has from time to time supplied and replenished this perennial fountain this copious stream still glideth through our fertile soil blesses the earth with her increase and waters the furrows thereof  in obedience to the commands of our great lord and master who so frequently recommends the poor and deserted to our care and protection charityschools for the maintenance and protection of indigent children have been erected and liberally supported in every part of this kingdom and the good effects of them are universally felt and acknowledged but in every human institution there must be some human weakness some mark of the imperfection of our nature in a nation like ours and more especially in the great center of it there must always be a perpetual vicissitude of manners new accidents new vices and follies will produce new wants and calamities which will consequently require new resources to guard against or remove them large numerous and extensive therefore as our charityschools were they have been found in some measure inadequate to the purposes for which they were designed and objects have of late years presented themselves which even this wide circle of benevolence could not comprehend they did not could not indeed from the nature of their constitution comprehend a set of helpless and miserable beings excluded by their peculiarly unhappy circumstances from the benefit of every public institution barren and leafless branches cut off as it were from the tree of life which deprived of all moisture and nourishment must inevitably wither and decay these principally consisted of orphan and deserted girls who after wandering about for a time in the utmost misery and distress soon perished with hunger or which was still more to be lamented fell an early sacrifice to vice infamy and prostitution  an evil so dreadful and so alarming called for a speedy and effectual remedy as the effects of it were becoming every day and every hour more fatal to society when it pleased the gracious providence of god to inspire the breasts of a few searchers after good with the design of erecting an asylum for these wretched outcasts a haven of rest and safety from the cruel storms of this world which beat so hard upon them this truly noble and benevolent purpose was immediately put in execution and has by the prudent economy of its directors and the liberal bounty of the subscribers to it been enabled to banish all those evils which it was meant to remove and to answer every good end which it was intended to promote  to bring good out of evil to render the miseries and disstresses of mankind productive of virtue and happiness is doubtless one of the noblest acts which human wisdom can contrive or human power can execute as it is the nearest and most exact imitation we can aspire to of the divine being that this is most evidently the design and endeavor of that amiable charity which i am here called upon to recommend will appear indisputable to every impartial mind that shall but for a moment reflect on the few following particulars  and first then  the principal and peculiar recommendation of this excellent charity is that here the fatherless finds mercy all these unfortunate little ones whom you now see before you are orphans and surely a more melancholy or distressful circumstance cannot be conceived left in their tender infancy to the mercy of a cruel multitude and the bad examples of a licentious age without a parent to guide or instruct them without a shepherd to feed them in green pastures or lead them beside the waters of comfort this my brethren is a voice crying in the wilderness which we must all hear this is a call on our humanity which we can never resist those to whom god has graciously continued the life of their parents sensible of so inestimable a blessing must feel for and compassionate the wretched beings who are deprived of it and on the other hand if there are now before me as i doubt not but there are some who still lament a fathers care or bewail a lost mothers tenderness they i am satisfied will anticipate every thing that could be urged in their favor they will reflect and consider what a miserable what a deplorable condition those must be in who are deprived of this and withal of every other consolation  parents we know there have been and to this day are so totally void of all feeling and humanity as even to destroy their own offspring can we wonder then to hear of others who in opposition to the dictates of nature totally desert and forsake them such was the wretched and truly pitiable condition of many whom this asylum has relieved it has indeed sometimes happened that these miserable orphans were left in their tender infancy by parents who could not possibly avoid it their fathers have been hurried from them by cruel necessity or perhaps perished abroad in the service of their country whilst their unhappy mothers have fallen a sacrifice to disease and penury at home thus does this useful charity whilst it relieves private distress promote public happiness and discharge the debt of gratitude which society owes to the industrious parent by that support and protection which it affords to his afflicted child  but the children educated in the asylum are not only orphans but what will render them still more proper objects of our compassion female orphans the most powerful argument in favor of this excellent institution is doubtless its amiable partiality to that sex which ever lays so warm so irresistible a claim to our support and protection a sex by nature left more weak and defenseless than our own liable to more dangers and temptations less able to struggle with difficulties or to oppose the malice and subtlety of a corrupt and designing world the female mind is formed in a soft and tender mold peculiarly susceptible of impressions and as remarkably tenacious of them how much then does it import their future happiness that the first which they receive should be fair and good and that to keep the waters from corruption they should be sweet and untainted at the fountain  beauty we know is an universal light it shines like the sun with equal luster on the palace and the cottage it is the free gift the patrimony as it were of beneficent nature who dispenses her bounties to all her children without regard to rank or condition but beauty as experience teaches us is sometimes a dangerous and fatal preeminence all the advantages of birth and education have proved insufficient to save the distinguished possessors of it from ruin and destruction even where parents have been near to guard and friends to admonish too often has it fallen a sacrifice to the impulse of passion or the arts of the betrayer but if affluence and knowledge are ensnared how shall poverty and ignorance escape it is ever a maxim with the wicked that guilt like sorrow is lightened by participation and that a companion in our crimes will palliate and diminish the iniquity of them hence it arises that the prostitute and abandoned part of the sex are ever active and vigilant to seduce the young and innocent and lead them into the paths of vice and folly to what certain what unavoidable misery then must be exposed those unhappy females who are left in their tender years to all the snares and temptations all the arts and seductions of the profligate and designing the arrows of misfortune are in their sides they are marked out as it were from the herd for immediate destruction and fly like stricken deer to the asylums friendly covert to hide themselves from their cruel pursuers vice infamy and ruin in behalf of objects like these i need not i am satisfied address myself to those who are of the same sex with themselves your sympathetic hearts untaught and uninstructed will dictate all that can be said and all that can be done as women you will pity them as mothers you will feel for them as christians you will i doubt not contribute to relieve and support them  but that we may view this noble structure in every light that can best display its beauty symmetry and proportion let us consider what benefits and advantages may arise to the community from this excellent institution let us consider that the asylum in grateful return for that support and protection which it receives from us may and already has produced a number of industrious conscientious and faithful servants a circumstance in which our domestic ease and happiness is nearly and intimately concerned never perhaps was there a time when they were more wanting than at present owing no doubt to that universal spirit of dissipation that reigning love of pleasure that impatience of labor and restraint which has of late spread itself through all ranks and degrees whilst those accept the office of servants who are either unable or unwilling to perform it the evil i fear must continue how valuable therefore and how truly laudable is an institution which tends to remove so general a calamity which teaches the children entrusted to its care and that at an age when they are most capable of learning every useful branch of household economy instructs them in every thing that they ought to know and which is perhaps peculiar to this charity in nothing which they ought not  many of our charities it must be acknowledged have erred greatly in this important particular with parental affection they have adopted parental weakness also have counteracted their own designs and by excessive tenderness and indulgence ruined those unfortunate beings whom they meant to preserve too much care has frequently been taken of their intellects and too little of their morality and their education been thus rendered too extensive and exalted for that rank and situation in life which they were designed for an error which our asylum has most industriously endeavored to avoid we imitate not the boasted seminaries of the romish church where the moment their recluse votaries are set apart for the service of god they become useless to society whilst ours on the other hand are taken from the world only that they may be of the greater service to it removed from the vices and temptations and at the same time reaping all the advantages participating the improvements and practicing the duties and relations of public life  it is with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction i have heard that many of the children here educated have by their extraordinary industry and application by sobriety decency and every method in their power endeavored to repay the goodness of their benefactors a circumstance very proper to be mentioned on this occasion as it reflects honor on the mistress who instructs them on the governors who preside over this charity and indeed on every person who contributes toward the maintenance and support of it  when these thus happily thus seasonably protected orphans shall leave their retreat and come out into the world when experience shall have taught them what snares they have avoided what dangers they have been protected from when they shall see how many of their unhappy fellowcreatures perhaps the companions of their infancy for want of this kind shelter have fallen an easy prey to vice and sunk into the loathsome abyss of sin and misery how will their hearts overflow with gratitude to their generous patrons with what eyes of tender acknowledgement and heartfelt satisfaction will they look back on these delightful seats of innocence and peace  here they are sheltered from the world before they can possibly have received any fatal infection from it before the soft wax can have taken any bad impression their duty toward god toward their benefactors toward the community to which they belong are here the first things they learn and consequently stand the fairest chance of being the last things which they will forget those can never be bad servants who are good women and pious christians such and such only we endeavor to send out will be industrious from habit sober from example virtuous from principle honest and faithful from conscience and from religion  to religion indeed that noblest foundation of every good we doubtless owe our great and i may perhaps add almost unparalleled success except the lord build the house their labor is but lost that build it except the lord keeps the city the watchman waketh but in vain charity we know is the natural offspring of devotion and love of man springs from the love of god to the erection and enlargement of the chapel this structure we are i am satisfied indebted in a great measure for the increase and enlargement of those frequent and liberal contributions which have enabled us to support it from this fountain of living waters have flowed all those refreshing streams of benevolence that from time to time have watered our fertile garden and whilst the word of god is here preached as it has hitherto been in purity truth and simplicity without ornament pomp or parade untincturd by modern ostentation and unleavened by modern enthusiasm the objects of our care and attention will i doubt not continue to reap the blessed fruits of it  the lord we read in scripture was with joseph and all that he did prospered in his hand the lord we trust my brethren is with us also thanks be to the great giver of every good gift our success has exceeded even our fondest hopes and our most sanguine wishes could scarce have formed a more delightful prospect than that which is now before us the duty therefore of this day arises from the united principles of gratitude and benevolence we assemble in this place to return our unfeigned thanks for past mercies and to implore the continuance of divine favor the heat and labor of the war is over and we meet in joy to celebrate our victory the noblest of all victories a victory over the human heart over the selfish cruel passions of avarice and inhumanity may the triumphs we already boast be the harbingers of more extensive conquests still behind and our past success prove the auspicious omen of future prosperity  let us then with an eye of pleasure and complacency contemplate the beautiful picture that is now before us let us behold benevolence surrounded by her attendant virtues administering to the necessities and cultivating the minds of these happy children temperance presides over their meals humility clothes industry instructs and modesty adorns them these are the matrons that superintend these are the guardians that watch over and protect them these will plead strongly for the precious charge entrusted to them these we trust will intercede for their beloved care will soften the hearts of the obdurate open the hand of the tenacious and melt even the most unfeeling into tenderness and commiseration  true charity my brethren like true beauty wants not the paint of art to set off or the gorgeous robes of flattery to adorn her to be distinguished she need but to be seen to be admired she need but to be known i have only endeavored to point her out unto you and may venture to leave the rest to your own generous hearts many perhaps there may be many i doubt not but there are now before me whom a larger share of the good things of this world has rendered more able many whom the grace of god joined to their own serious reflections has made more willing than ever they were before to distribute many there are who wait but to know to whom they should do good before they do it such i am satisfied the little imperfect sketch which i have drawn of this institution will induce to contribute toward its maintenance and support  amongst all the fair daughters of charity those polished corners of our christian temple the asylum seems to boast superior charms and to shine forth with distinguished luster like that innocence which she preserves and that virtue which she protects she may be betrayed suspected or traduced but like them she will still be cherished by the good and received by the worthy whether we consider the distresses which she relieves or the miseries which she prevents the blessings which she bestows on the present age or the felicity which she insures for the future she must appear in every light most amiable and praise worthy her form is pleasing her manners plain and unaffected her religion pure and undefiled in a word she attracts by her simplicity engages by her behavior encourages by her tenderness animates by her example as if it were her ambition and a nobler she cannot have to imitate in all things that gracious and benignant queen who has condescended to patronize and protect her  to conclude then  whatever may be our state or condition in this life we are all of us like those whom i have been here endeavoring to recommend to you subject to dangers temptations and distress no rank or station how exalted soever can totally exempt us from those sorrows or misfortunes which are the common lot and portion of mortality who is there amongst us that may not sometimes wish for an asylum shall we not then whilst we have it in our power bestow that shelter and relief on others which we ourselves may one day stand in need of let us show mercy to the fatherless if we expect it from the father of mercy so shall we preserve to our minds that peace and tranquillity which alone can render us easy and contented in this life so shall we find rest to our souls in that blessed asylum of peace and happiness which god has prepared for the virtuous the charitable and the benevolent in that which is to come  finis
