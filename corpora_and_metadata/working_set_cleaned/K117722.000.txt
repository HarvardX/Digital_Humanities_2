the danger of priestcraft to religion and government with some politic reasons for toleration occasioned by a discourse of mr sacheverels intituld the political union etc lately printed at oxford  in a letter to a newelected member of parliament  london printed in the year   0   a letter etc sir your friends in this place rejoiced at the news of your election not so much out of love to you as to their country we applauded the happiness or wisdom of your electors who at a time when england is so much in danger made choice of a member to serve it in parliament who so truly loves it and so thoroughly understands its interest who has sense enough to know that english principles alone can make an englishman and to contemn the unthinking crowd who prefer the name to the thing who knows that he is most an englishman who does most for englands happiness and who prefers a foreigner that endeavors to support it before an englishman who attempts to enslave it and esteems one who was born a dutchman or perhaps a german but isbecome an englishman before one who was born indeed an englishman but is become an errant frenchman for every honest and brave man will love an honest and brave man and hate a knave and a coward which every traitor to his country is  no man knows better than your self the nature and end of the trust reposed in you that senators are sent up to the great council to preserve the properties of those who sent them which is the alpha and omega the original and end of government that nothing an rightly come within the compass of your debates but what has a relation to that care and that to do any thing contrary to it is to betray the trust reposed in you no man is more fully convinced that the properties of the people of england are now in the utmost danger both from a formidable enemy abroad and from a restless party at home no man consequently can be more satisfied that it is your duty to do all that lies in your power to enable her majesty to resist the foreign force that would conquer us and the domestic arts of those who by sowing divisions among us would render us an easy prey to the conqueror  as some among us would sell us for money so others would barter us for dominion and a third sort who are the tools of the former would betray us out of conscience but the artifices of no sort of men are so dangerous as of those who pretend them sacred and would make them pass upon the minds of men for religion  such seems to me to be the intention of a book which was lately published at oxford and licensed by the vice chancellor of that university called the political union which is manifestly writ with a design to take off the act of toleration and to advance the temporal power of the church which would not fail to divide and weaken us more and more and make our condition desperate  the discourse is founded upon a text in the   th of proverbs and the    th by me kings reign and princes decree justice from which the author has drawn this following proposition which is the subject matter of his pamphlet  that religion is the grand support of government that the peace happiness and prosperity of the secular and civil power depends upon that of the spiritual and ecclesiastical in all my lifetime i never met with any discourse that was writ with less religion and less goodmanners or with more sophistry or more malice tho indeed he has taken pretty good care to moderate its venom by dullness as they who make venus treacle are wont to temper vipers with opium  but that we may discover the sophistry of the whole discourse more clearly let us divide this proposition into the following branches first religion is the grand support of government secondly the peace happiness and prosperity of the secular power depend upon that of the spiritual and ecclesiastical   first religion is the grand support of government where by religion may be meant two things   religion it self and the power it has over the minds of men   priestcraft which comprehends all that the arts of designing men cause to pass for religion with the unthinking part of the world tho it is neither dictated by the law of nature nor included in the written word and here we shall show that religion taken in the first sense is the support of government but that taken in the latter it necessarily tends to the utter subversion of it     religion and the power that it has over the minds of men is the support of government for without the observance of moral virtue there can be no government and moral virtue is undeniably religion but now if government depends on religion what sort of religion must that person have who endeavors at such a juncture as this to set three nations all in confusion and to bring all things to anarchy or whether is he a more able statesman who makes it his business to soment the divisions of a people engaged in a war with a very potent enemy or a more pious churchman who goes about to extinguish the remains of charity that are in the minds of christians but    priestcraft is destructive to government and that we may make this the more plain to the reader let us explain a little farther what we mean by priestcraft priestcraft is an art by which designing men in order to their own advantage make that pass for religion upon the unthinking part of the world that is neither dictated by the law of nature nor included in the written religion of the country from which it follows that that must needs be priestcraft with a vengeance that would make any thing pass for religion which is contrary to the law of nature or to the precepts or design of written religion now the chief virtues of the christian religion are charity humility meekness peacemaking mercy so that among christian priests every doctrine is priestcraft that is repugnant to these all then that savours of persecution is priestcraft because it is contrary to humility to meekness to mercy to peacemaking and above all to charity for the want of which no other part of religion no not the abundance of faith it self is able to make amends all that the clergy do to advance their temporal greatness is priestcraft because that is contrary to humility meekness and purity and consequently such priestcraft is destructive to government for if government depends on religion then any thing that does hurt to the latter must do it to the former but nothing does more hurt to religion than priestcraft because this alone makes more atheists than any thing in the world besides for many people are apt to imagine that there can be nothing in religion when they see that the priests who are most conversant in it make it a mere pretext and more particularly i believe that priestcraft has done more harm to the christian religion even than open immorality for what reason can be given why deism and avowed atheism should be more propagated since the estalishing of the true religion than ever they were before unless it be this that perhaps there has been more priestcraft in it than ever there has been in any other religion but further when mr s says that religion is the support of government he means either religion in general or only the true religion if he means religion in general can any thing be more absurd than to write a book for the proving of that which never any one was stupid enough to deny for as far back as history reaches there is no mention of any government without a national religion which shows the sense of mankind in the case but now at this rate what occasion can there be for persecuting or for the magistrates tolerating only one religion when it is plain that government is supported by all but if mr s means that government is supported only by the true religion he manifestly errs because experience tells us that several governments flourish at this present time in the world under the pagan and mohammedan as well as under the christian religion  but if mr s means that government is best supported by the true religion we grant it but even that may serve to show the folly and the danger of priestcraft for if government depends on religion and the christian religion has seen more divisions more confusions and more civil wars in the nations in which it has been established than ever any religion did before why then it follows that if it is the best of religions it has had the worst of priests  the design of christianity is certainly to unite mankind more closely but some crafty persons who have made that their pretense and secular interest and power their business have been industrious to wrest it from its pure intention and have made use of it to sow fatal divisions in kingdoms and commonwealths divisions contrary to their private happiness their political safety and to the intention of that very religion which is made the pretense for supporting them  for what can be the reason that the christian religion whose design is union has been made use of to sow more divisions and more dissensions in the nations in which it has been established than ever the pagan religion did among the ancient romans but because too many of the christian priests interfere with government which the romans were by much too wise to permit to theirs  but further let us ask mr s if the civil government is best supported by the true religion which is the true religion the christian religion in general or any particular branch of it as for example that which is called the church of england if the christian religion in general be the true religion then why should any branch of it be refused to be tolerated but if only the church of england be the true religion i would fain ask mr s if a christian can be saved in no other branch of the christian religion and if he answers that that can be done i would ask him if that religion can be false which procures the salvation of souls or if that religion which procures the salvation of souls and consequently is acceptable and agreeable to god ought to men to be odious and intolerable but if mr s affirms that no one can be saved out of the church of england i must ask him once more in which of the churches of england a man may be saved that i may know in which he must be damned mr s would oblige me by telling me which is the false church of england for since he tells us page    that there is a true church of england it follows necessarily that there must be a false one now which is the true and which is the false one or which is the true and which is the false priesthood for we may know the flock by the pastors is that the true that neglects and forsakes the gospel for a foolish little secular greatness that is lost in covetousness and the desire of power the lust of the flesh and the pride of life who tho our savior commanded his apostles not to take two coats mat  0  0 will be satisfied each of them with no less than four benefices and who have nothing that is apostolical in them but the calling for fire from heaven like james and john upon those who will not receive them who breathe forth nothing but rage and malice and the fury of persecution is this the true the christian catholic priesthood no these are so many antichrists if we will believe st john epist   chapter   v    who is a liar but he who denies that jesus is the christ he is antichrist who denies the father and the son now no man denies the savior of the world so effectually as by his works st peter denied him in words and yet believed in him but he who denies him by his works denies him from his very heart now he denies him by his works the most effectually whose works show least of charity in this says st john in epist   chapter   v  0 the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of god neither he who loves not his brother  if the church of england is the true religion that sure must be its true its catholic priesthood those moderate humble peacemaking merciful men who breathe forth nothing but charity who neglect all worldly greatness to bear their masters yoke and who have learnt of him to be meek and lowly in heart who are hearty foes to division only and faithful constant friends to peace and union these are the true sons of the church to use mr ss expression for since the very spirit and soul of the christian religion is the spirit of union and charity and the spirit of division is by consequence the spirit of malice and of the devil the true son of the church is he who appears the most for union and a wise man may in this case find out the child by the same method by which in another solomon so sagaciously found out the mother for as she was the true mother who was not for dividing the child he is certainly the true child who is least for dividing the mother  if then the best religion only ought to be tolerated and the church of england is the best religion and the true church of england to use mr ss expression is only properly the church and the moderate part of that church be only the true church as we have endeavored to show and if that violent party which calls it self the church of england differs from the moderate party more than any other dissenters because they are at a greater distance from charity than any other dissenters why then if toleration is taken away it follows that of all the dissenters from the true church the violent part of the church of england ought the least to be tolerated  by which sir it appears that mr s has been making a rod for himself for if only the true church of england is to remain and the moderate church of england be the true church of england if the most violent ought the least to be tolerated because they are the most repugnant to charity and consequently are the most enclining to disturb the public why then it evidently follows that mr s who is the most violent even of the violent ought never to be endured in a wellordered state  for can any thing be more opposite to the spirit of christianity than either his design or his manner of handling it is not his design apparently to set three nations at variance does not his style show a furious zealot bent upon embroiling the world has he not treated the dissenters and those of the church with equal rancour and venom does he not use these wellmannerd and wellnaturd expressions to the latter viz false and perfidious members shuffling treacherous latitudinarians sots and bigots apostates and renegadoes false traitors crafty faithless insidious persons while the gentlest terms he uses to the others are villains swarm of sectaries robbers vipers boars beasts devils traitors bastard spawn of a popish party propagators of schism and panders of a cursed train sharers in villainy and rebellion is this the style of a christian is this the language of charity that never yet was known to revile upon the most provoking trials the spirit of the gospel would have taught him another strain the evangelists never used any invective against judas pilate or any of the enemies or executioners of christ and st jude tells us in his epistle that michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee  but sir i begin to apprehend that i shall tire your patience and therefore it is high time to proceed to the consideration of the second branch of mr ss proposition which follows  the peace happiness and prosperity of the secular power depends upon that of the spiritual and ecclesiastical  where we shall enquire first what is meant by the secular power and its peace and prosperity i mean what is meant among us for it will be necessary to apply things and bring them home to our selves secondly what is meant by the spiritual and ecclesiastical power and its peace and prosperity thirdly how far the former is dependant on the latter   first by the secular power among us may be meant   either the whole legislative power including the king the lords and the commons who have power by the consent of the people to enact such laws as may augment their strength and defend and secure their properties or by the secular power may be meant   the executive power alone or the power which is lodged in the hands of the sovereign by the consent of the people in order to a due execution of the laws which are made for the securing their properties   by the peace and prosperity of the legislative power can be meant nothing but the successful obtaining the end for which they assemble which is the securing of property   by the peace and prosperity of the executive power separate and distinct from the legislative can be meant nothing but an augmentation of power or a power beyond what is given by law and the consent of the people and the enjoyment of that power unmolested and undisturbed   secondly what may be meant by the spiritual and ecclesiastical power and its peace and prosperity   by the spiritual power and its peace and prosperity may be meant the flourishing of religion in the world and the prevailing influence it has over the minds of men and its exertion of that influence unmolested and undisturbed   by the ecclesiastical power as opposed to spiritual and its peace and prosperity may be meant a power to do more than is allowed by religion and the enjoyment of that power unmolested and undisturbed   thirdly let us now show the dependence that the peace and prosperity of the civil power has upon that of the spiritual and ecclesiastical    the peace and prosperity of the legislative power does depend upon the peace and prosperity of the spiritual power opposed to the ecclesiastical that is it depends upon the flourishing of religion in the world and the prevailing influence it has over the minds of men  we have taken notice above that the peace and prosperity of the legislative power means nothing but the successful obtaining the end for which they assemble which is the securing the properties of the people so that in short the prosperity of the legislative power supposes the flourishing of the people who are the fountain of it now the more prevalent religion is upon the minds of a people the more will the people flourish for the more religion prevails the more will the rules of justice be kept inviolate the more will peace and union among them be strengthened and by consequence the more secure will they be from the encroaching attempts of each other and the stronger to repel any foreign force but from hence it follows that    the peace and prosperity of the legislative power and by consequence of the whole body of the people does not depend upon that of the ecclesiastical power as it is opposed to the spiritual where by ecclesiastical power i mean the power of enslaving the conscience by inflicting temporal penalties for the clergy by that power which they have not from religion and which is therefore secular by the usurpation i say of such a power they promote libertinism and atheistical principles and do a great deal of harm to religion and so by weakening that which strengthens it weaken the legislative power besides the clergy by the usurpation of such a power not only encroach upon the legislative but run counter to it for the legislative power is placed in such and such hands by the consent of the people in order to the maintaining or augmenting the public strength and the securing every mans property as long as he does no harm to the public or to particular persons but the clergy by the usurpation of this temporal power invade the properties of innocent people and by exasperating the minds of the sufferers divide and weaken the public strength  besides the power which the clergy have of persecuting must be derived from the whole or a part of the legislative if they derive it only from a part against the consent of the rest why then they divide and weaken the legislative if they derive it from the consent of the whole why then the legislative betrays the trust which the people reposed in them and run counter to the very end of government which is the securing of property and by so doing destroys it self for this is plain that wherever there is persecution property cannot be secure for since faith or belief is not in a mans power how can any man be secure of property in a nation where he may lose it to morrow for no other reason than for not believing what he cannot believe but    the peace and prosperity of the executive power as it has a distinct and separate interest from that of the legislative neither does nor can depend upon the prosperity of the spiritual power that is upon the flourishing force of religion for the power we speak of is a power beyond what is allowed by law and the consent of the people now the more virtuous and the more religious any people are the less that people are in danger of arbitrary power it is want ofvirtue that makes men factious and nothing but faction can make any one arbitrary for then a sovereign grows arbitrary when a part of his subjects on account of their own mistaken interest or violent resentment betray the rights of the rest but    the peace and prosperity of the executive power take it upon a distinct and separate interest from that of the legislative does often depend upon the prosperity of the ecclesiastical power that is to say the arbitrary and tyrannical power of the prince depends upon the illegal impious power of the priesthood all government is certainly both for and from the people who first entered into civil society for the defense of their rights how then came the people ever to give up those rights which we see they have often done and to depend upon the arbitrary will of their governors since it is contrary to the very end for which they entered into society and does not fail to bring them into a worse condition than the state of nature why the common method by which princes obtain unlimited power is this they prevail upon the corrupt part of the clergy to trump up those wretched abominable doctrines of jus divinum nonresistance and passive obedience upon the people which is as much as to tell them that if their sovereign lord and master who is absolute and independent and accountable to none but god will at any time graciously condescend to do them the honor to lie with any of their wives or daughters they ought most obsequiously to hold the door because he has the power of doing what he pleases from a right divine but if any man asks this question how comes it that the clergy who are a part of the collective body of the people should be instrumental in making their princes arbitrary since in the peoples rights they give up their own i answer that the clergy are not such fools but that in giving up the peoples rights they always except their own nay not only that but in lieu of the power they convey to the king which he has not by law they never fail to stipulate a power for themselves which they have not by gospel if any man will but cast his eye over the different countries of europe he will find that in most dominions where arbitrary power prevails the temporal power of the clergy is great nay so great that at the same time that they support a power in their kings of cutting the throats of their people they reserve to themselves the privilege of cutting the throats of their kings  but if at any time it should happen which i hope never will but which yet is not impossible that any part of the english clergy should prove so corrupt as to enter into the same measures which diverse of them did in some former reigns into measures that had like to have proved so fatal to our constitution and which if they should be taken are likely to prove more fatal now than ever i desire them to consider that they have not empire enough over the minds of men to make their princes arbitrary tho perhaps they may have credit enough to throw us into fatal divisions and subject us to a foreign power one of our former princes was very sensible of this and therefore at the same time that some of the clergy of the church of england were endeavoring with all their might to make him absolute and independent by preaching up passive obedience non resistance and jus divinum upon the people he who knew the world very well and was convinced that they had not authority over the consciences and minds of his subjects sufficient to do his business was undermining them all the while and introducing the romish clergy for if he grew absolute he did not care by what religion having more of the tyrant in his humor than the saint those whom he undermined his successor assaulted openly as little knowing of what spirit they were what was the event why as soon as they saw that the arbitrary power which they had been helping him and his predecessor to extended it self to them that not only toleration was set up and consequently all their ambition mortified and their temporal power thrown down but that they were fallen into the snare which themselves had laid that their properties and their privileges were become a prey to that unbounded power which they had designed to swallow the peoples why then to the amazement of all the world they began to speak a language which they had never been taught and to cry out aloud that the king had broken the contract which he had made with the people meaning at the same time the implicit compact which he had made with themselves  thus sir have i dissected this sophisters proposition and endeavored to show the benefit of religion to government and the mischief of priestcraft for my own part sir at the same time i am not at all alarmed about keeping up the toleration the queen has given her word for maintaining it which i have no reason to mistrust because i never knew that she broke it however if i am not misinformd there are persons besides mr s who are preparing to have a throw at it and to do their utmost endeavors to take it away the very attempt whereof is at present the most horrible wickedness that can be conceived and the most dangerous to church and state for the effecting of it would necessarily have these consequences it would weaken the english nation among themselves and by fomenting the divisions among us and exasperating the minds of the parties make us the less able to carry on the war against the enemy of europe for a body that is in convulsions when it is about to engage will be more likely to fall foul on it self than to beat the enemy  as the effecting of this design would weaken the english so in all likelihood it would quite alienate the scots from us it would make them believe they have been abused and laughed at and the union from that time would become a general jest now of what consequence the alienating of the spirits of the scots at such a juncture as this might be to the common interest i leave to be determined by those who have the management of public affairs  as the bringing about this design would weaken the two nations by dividing them among themselves and from one another it would lessen the queens reputation at home and her credit abroad for after she had broken her word with her subjects in a case of the highest importance how could any of the allies rely upon it when she gives it to them only on the behalf of her subjects and this consideration makes this attempt as impudently wicked as it is extremely foolish because all who have any knowledge of the queen know it will be absolutely impossible  besides should they effect this design they must resolve either to maintain persecution or to let it fall again if they resolve to let it fall again why they will provoke their enemies to no purpose and render themselves ridiculous if they resolve to carry it on they must at the same time determine to break through the act of settlement because they know very well that if ever the house of hanover should come they would infallibly deliver the nation from so grievous a burden  but let us now show the folly and wickedness of this attempt by discovering the mischief which the effecting it would bring to the church it self we have said before that to maintain persecution they must break through the act of settlement an act which is the security of this nation and of the liberties of europe what may we reasonably believe would follow why the next successor would be introduced by men of arbitrary principles for who but men of such principles would break through such an act now men of arbitrary principles will certainly be for securing their persons and their power but the only way for men who act like them to secure both will be to make their new monarch as arbitrary as they can well then they will make use of any method that will best conduce to that and consequently of any religion but the romish religion will be of more use to them in the accomplishment of their designs than the reformed can be for reasons too well known to be inserted here and therefore to compass it they will set up toleration anew and expose the church to the united fury of papists and dissenters and its too easy clergy to the just derision of the reformed churches abroad  however visionary these notions may seem to the violent part of the clergy of the church of england yet the impartial world need not be told that this is not the first time that they have been making rods for themselves for let any one among them answer to this if the doctrines of jus divinum of passive obedience and of nonresistance doctrines which they preached up with so much earnestness with so much zeal had passed upon the credulous nation where now had been the clergy of the church of england it is well they had wiser men to take care of them wiser i mean in the affairs of the world for in short they ought not to pry into matters of state they have an employment of a larger extent and of a much nobler consequence and they must needs prove ill politicians if they are good priests but however we have this comfort at present that there are two invincible obstacles to the effecting of this design the one is the unblemished honor of the queen the other the honor of the approaching parliament in which i know there are so many members of unalterable unshaken principles so many members to say all in a word so exactly resembling your self that no consideration can ever prevail upon them to break through so excellent a constitution and to betray the trust reposed in them i say no consideration can ever prevail upon them to make the majority of that people miserable for whose prosperity they were sent to consult nor to establish an inquisition in england which may fall heavy upon their dearest friends nay and perhaps too upon themselves for since no mans belief is within his own power they themselves may perhaps be hereafter involved in the penalties which they ordain or if themselves should not be their posterity probably may and they are too considerate to give a just occasion to their children or grandchildren to curse their memories for making a law which must render their innocent lives unhappy besides they have wisdom enough to know that no opposition can stifle truth and that indulgence is the surest and noblest method of suppressing error  to conclude i am very far from having any prejudice to the church of england i honor and esteem the moderate part of it but cannot for my life esteem the violent in any religion whatever nor can i think i am much to blame for shall a little rakelly parson be justly reputed scandalous for open drunkenness and fornication and shall he be accounted venerable whose every action shows want of charity which is downright antichristian for this is plain that fornication and drunkenness tho crying sins of themselves yet are less damnable than murder now being out of charity is murder if we will believe st john   epist      whosoever hates his brother is a murderer the reason is plain he who hates his brother would kill him if he were not restrained by law for mankind can have but two restraints upon them religion and law but the christian who hates his brother is not restrained by religion because if he were he would not hate him yet after all the only harm that i wish even to the violent part of the clergy is that like our kings they may be restrained from the doing mischief and confined to the doing good i am  sir yours etc  finis
