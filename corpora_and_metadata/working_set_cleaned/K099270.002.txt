resolved upon vivacity is contagious  you are certainly right said i amelia i once more feel that i have looked at my object in the wrongest point of view it deserves a fairer situation and i am now resolved to place it in a libral light the health which you have prayed for i anticipate joyfully and with it i expect the rosy cheek the sparkling eye and that cheerful alacrity which runs unfatigued through the amusements or business of the day in your eulogy on the capital of france i forget the phlegm of a studious gloomy englishman and drive in the airy chariot of fancy over the rugged pavement of a crowded city pleased at the sight of so many thousand new faces and not at all disgusted either with the rattle of fashion or the tumult of trade  see my dear amelia see in these sudden alterations the true nature of the heart  there passed over my cheek at this instant one of those transient burnings which makes nature blush for shame at her own inconsistency but i would not give a sixpence for an author who produces not something for the heart even in a comment upon its weaknesses  pshaw said i what a misfortune is it to be hypochondriacal or rather what an hypochondriac is man take him even at the soundest period of his health set but his passions afloat give but the loose rein to his desires or let him but walk in the way of his system and the varying wind the arrant moon and the shifting cloud are all stabilities in the comparison how peevish how playful how irresolute how resolved without reason disgusted and with as little cause put again into humor  and can all these changes exclaims the calm standerby can all these changes take place in traveling somewhat slower than a footpace only from london to dover  ah censurer have a care beware least the accusation be brought home to yourself how would the story run if thou were here with faithful biography to set down the particulars of thy own day depend on it the journal of thy heart in its journey through every six hours of life is too full of quixotism phantasm and vagary and too well stored either with light or serious innovations to assert a superior claim to constancy and even should there be the meanest son of merchandise that ever traded hard for the turn of the penny on thy own side of the scale still i insist upon it thou can not have any right to cast the first stone  the thread of this remonstrance is cut short by almost a page in order to bring forward a circumstance which it is consonant to the system of these travels in this very place and in no other to admit  just as i was beginning to wonder how i could find so many arguments pro and con in regard to this journey to france and bestowing a smile upon the heart which since it beat in the hotel at dover had shifted from one point to another much often than the streamer which at the head of the mast was still inclined the same way a specimen of france in the shape of a nimblefooted artist for the modern human face entered my room with three skips of courtesy and being preinvited proceeded to give my chin the smirkness of the present taste  the mechanical drudgery of shaving however was by no means his business and i soon found the taking off my beard was purely an urbanity which being the first i ever received from a french hairdresser and done with due regard to the graces i the more readily entered into conversation  you have been in france said i young man  i am there at this instant monsieur replied he  the duce you are said i how long is it then since dover was added to the dominions of louis perhaps you will be pleased to allow too that i am your prisoner at this instant  sans doubt monsieur while under my hands but that hits not off my meaning the best part of me  my heart is certainly at this blessed moment in paris  in what part of it prithee is this treasure deposited  ah mon dieu said the lad what a question it beats monsieur up five pair of stairs in the fauxbourgs st marceau in the beautiful bosom of felicity a very lofty lodging perhaps you may think but i like it the better for that it is thereby so much the nearer to the heavens to which felicity belongs  another such an enigma as this would have occasioned an emotion which might untie the knot of it to some purpose especially as the frenchman was now beginning to flourish his razor under my throat  felicity said i putting back his hand as if to ward off the razor till my curiosity was satisfied i am afraid friend you are addicted to that contemptible species of wit which in england we call the conundrum  what i tell you monsieur is simply and solemnly true my heart is in the bosom of my felicity who in the very quarter i told you occupies one little cabinet which is to me more decent than the palace of versailles and as to wit in good faith monsieur the story of felicity is too tender and too sad to permit any thing like it  though the system of some travelers might at such a time as this lead them into the bedchamber to make the most of the two or three hours which remained before the sailing of the packetboat yet was it agreeably to my system to listen attentively to the story of the french barbers unhappy felicity to say the truth there was every thing in the air and manner of this paradox to keep awake the curiosity both of amelia and myself so i desired the supper which had been ordered might be kept back a little that we might have him and his felicity all to ourselves  if you will draw your comb leisurely through my hair young man said i and if there is not in the relation something too painful to be repeated i could wish to know   ah monsieur replied the lad interrupting me and pointing his razor to his own throat having now done with mine the pain which this could give by sending me of a sudden into the grave of my fathers who were all entitled to wear a ribbon in their buttonholes of no mean or undistinguished order would be a mere bagatelle to the very thought of relating my sufferings upon that intolerable subject therefore vous aurez la bonte de me pardonner  though my curiosity was more heightened my compassion got the better of it and i only asked the name of this unfortunate  he bowed very respectfully and repeated his last sentence  this was as much as any man could decently bear and i think amelia exerted the utmost fortitude of female philosophy that she contented herself with a short ejaculation  my good and great god said the  the frenchman was by this time putting into order the left side lock and i felt the comb as he brought it backwards and forwards tremble under his hand in the bended attitude in which he stood to dress me my eye was of necessity confined to the top part of his waistcoat which being thrown open i discovered through the aperture of his shirtbosom the cross of a catholic and a small oval something hanging together  this something could certainly be made nothing of while as was now the case it remained on the wrong side my heart was again at the end of my fingers and i would have given the universe to untwist it luckily for amelia it was out of her sight and so from pure regard to her quiet i kept the torment all to myself twice i made advances toward the inserted oval and twice i drew back my hand at the check of sighs which were heaved from the heart of a frenchman had the gate of paradise been closed full in my face it could not have thrown me into greater perplexity trifles light as air are to the curious confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ   you are very young said i  just old enough to be acquainted with misery cried the barber for till three weeks ago i danced through every street of paris and was at once the merriest and the happiest man in the city  yes be my witness mon bon dieu i was the happiest of men  blessed be the poor fellows heart for dictating this asseveration for in making it he pressed his hand with the warmest veneration upon the cross and turned the oval  it proved to be a little varnished piece of rosecoloured composition studded with sparkling stones with the miniature of a female having the bestnatured set of features in the world in the center of it  at this critical moment guided by my ill stars which were resolved to teaze me the youth left my side locks and withdrew to those which were behind with what ineffable fervor did i then wish that every villainous hair which had contributed to my disappointment might instantly fall from the head upon which they were unworthy to hang  be the reader ever so angry i cannot in justice to the heart which is fully concerned in every syllable of this story get on with it faster  when circumstances which engage the heart are playing at crosspurposes with it and every faculty of the brain is on the stretch for accommodation of our wishes how often that accommodation is brought about to the hearths absolute content by some slight maneuver of all others the least expected  a mighty pretty picture that monsieur said amelia i turned short about with inconceivable quickness as if the expedient was hit off by a miracle  surely the very devil himself delayed me in this business i had scarce turned about before the frenchman turned himself round also and was standing with his back toward me while he held down his head  was ever man so tormented said i  gracious heaven said amelia  oh ciell exclaimed the frenchman he still kept his attitude but soon recovering himself he again begged my pardon and addressing amelia with a hesitating voice   yes madam this picture  this picture  this  this  this  pic  pic  pict  ure here his heart destroyed his language this pic  ture  i say is the picture of my unfortunate felicity  a woman after all cried amelia striking her hands together  and in distress said i looking at the lad  even so said the frenchman pressing the cross and kissing the picture even so  where the heart is affected by sorrows of a soft and social kind it is next to an impossibility to be long silent such sorrows burst of their own accord into language and are always soothed by being trusted to the sympathy of those about us  the frenchman was now touched so thoroughly that as he proceeded to finish my hair he hummed a sort of sonnet under pretense of showing us that all was well again by which piece of finesse his anxiety became in reality too big to be contained and the story ran thus  certainly monsieur this is the picture of my felicity and i am banished from the presence of the dear creature by a couple of accidents which as i hope to be saved could not be helped felicity you must know is cursed with a cruel father who drudges all day in his garret for gold and so is an enemy to every thing but money i was for some time his apprentice and it was impossible to see his fair daughter pass backwards and forwards by our workshop without despising gold and admiring her beauty our hearts were just of the same sort as they were of the same age and we both lost all our french spirits and grew as melancholy as your english people  you will pardon me monsieur  about the same time i had wit enough to know that so surprising a change in us could be wrought by nothing but love we were both convinced of this when we were mightily delighted by stealing a look or a touch or a soft kiss while the old goldbeaters back was turned but the bare truth of our mutual passion was alas put out of all doubt when my master suffered us to pass a fine day at marly that is if we were inclined to treat orselves  the idea was so charming that i shall never no never shall i forget it i had saved up money to the amount of near thirty livres and so i thought i was laying it out to the hearts best advantage by hiring a handsome cabriolet for the whole day i put my hair into order hung on my sword and walked forth with felicity early in the morning under pretense of having time to amuse her certainly we could have gone by a cheaper conveyance but then there would i foresaw be inconveniences equal to the cheapness a common stage is often crowded with disagreeable passengers and as felicity is a fair creature i thought it best to enjoy her company alone better had it been however if the cabriolet had been at paris and i in my masters shop for as i told you before a couple of accidents happened which though they could not be avoided turned out very fatally  in the gardens of our beloved monarch at marly every body knows there are lovers walks without number the trees are so green the streams are so clear and there are so many fair figures of both sexes in so many postures in different places tempting us in marble which scarce seem to want breath that it is very wrong for two young french people that love one another to trust themselves amongst them we got safe out of them at the cost only of about a thousand sighs and one or two tears of confession which stole down the crimsoned cheek of felicity till i kissed it off neither was that kiss well timed for it carried the crimson which was before confined to the face quite down to the neck till its flushing descended even to the bosom oh what a summernights sun shone upon our prospect as we were returning we had no interrupting domestic behind our carriage the horses were extremely gentle and i drove them myself ah that a coachman had been seated before us what misery might have been prevented  as fortune however would have it i was by some means induced to take a sudden turn through a delightful lane though i confess it was not upon the road to paris and while i left the horses to graze upon the herbage that fertilized the banks felicity and i got down with no other view in the world than to pick out a bouquet of fieldflowers which grew amongst the corn ah fatal excursion let no two people who have hearts indulge themselves in picking flowers out of a cornfield how fruitful is this charming soil said i sighing  yes said felicity with a blush  we were walking out with our bouquet  good god said felicity if this high corn is not enough to throw one down  there is no helping it replied i making a couch of the corn oh monsieur our hearts were both so cruelly entangled that we fell to the ground  heavens said felicity if there is not a hare sitting on yonder hillock how should i delight to have it in my bosom  he who loves must endeavor to gratify her whom he admires not thinking that if i struck the animal i should destroy the pleasure felicity wished of nursing it in her bosom i was fool enough to throw a large stone at my game and i was unfortunate enough to kill it  i put it into the box of my cabriolet and set forwards how little did i supect that either this accident or any other that might precede it was overlooked but alas our very rout was watched and we were doged to the door of the goldbeater who was informed of a circumstance which put his daughter under lock and key and which subjected me to horrors both of soul and body for which i have no language the goldbeater shut me into a dark closet in charge while my detector posted away to the police i now had the fear of slavery and the galleys before my eyes my heart bled for felicity from whom i was separated what was to be done fortune a little befriended the lattice of the closet opened upon the leadwork of a neighbouringhouse i crept through it like a thief in the night and having the presence of mind to put on an old fulltrimmed suit of my masters that hung upon a peg in the closet i escaped along the roof and descended into the street you will excuse me for declining to reveal the means by which i reached dover suffice it that here i am one of the most wretched of men i had always a smart way of managing the hair and could scrape my own beard decently enough so i took up the employment of a barber or else i must have starved but i am weary of my life and i resolve very soon to go over the water again let the consequence be what it will my king is too good a man and has too great a heart to persecute a poor fellow any longer for killing a hare to please a young woman with whom he was in love and as to felicity herself the last letter which she found means to send me intimated a circumstance which tells me that i should be no true frenchman and indeed not fit to live in any country if i did not try some way or an other to make her forthwith my lawful wife how this is to be brought about i dont know but my heart is at the contrivance night and day  there was a color in amelias cheeks which appeared at several periods of this little narrative in disapprobation of the conduct as well as the conversation of the narrator but there was a softness in her eyes at some other parts of the relation which showed that her modesty was not so much offended but that she had virtue enough to forgive the transports of a lover  the effects of climate the poor barber had no sooner finished a story which discovered so much of his own heart and that of his country than our ears were saluted with the full bold tones of a voice issuing from the adjoining room to the tune of o the roast beef of old england and when that voice had done up sprung another in a sharper and shriller key singing forth in a sort of ecstasy the supreme pleasures of paris  the barber was just about to take his leave as this invisible concert began but sudden sounds always break the step short and incline the ear toward them to the roast beef of old england though uttered with a swell of tone which beat an alarm to appetite the barber paid a very slight attention and put his razor and combs into their cases with infinite composure but every turn in the sonnet which displayed the pleasures of paris made a strong impression upon both his looks and limbs  oh charmant said he how much better does the frenchman sing than the englishman for you must know monsieur that frenchman lived once within view of my felicitys chamber window and as he passes frequently from calais to paris i now and then slip a billet into his hand which he always delivers where it is directed i love him for this but i should love him better than any other man in paris were it only because he was lodged opposite to my felicitys chamber window  here he bowed respectfully first to amelia then to me and after once more assuring me that he thanked me for my promise to keep his secret and that if i ever walked into the fauxbourgs st marceau and would direct my eyes upwards they might stand the chance of being handsomely rewarded he now softly chorused one of the lines in praise of paris and betwixt sighing and singing went out of the room  the houseclock struck eleven just as he departed and some travelers would have been two hours in bed without the least idea of hairdressing or storytelling which may not seem necessary preparations for a voyage but had i been asleep i had missed many strokes of the heart and i would purchase my knowledge of that with a nights rest at any time  upon the whole my temper was now thoroughly sweetened the picture of the human heart in various attitudes and positions had been exhibited before me i saw plainly the tender attachment which every man had to his native country in general and to that dear spot in particular whether up five pair of stairs in the fauxbourgs st marceau or in the first floor of the royal palace where the treasure of the heart is deposited i beheld also the uniform operations of pain and pleasure upon every son and daughter of adam in every different country the history of the unfortunate felicity convinced me still more fully of this cardinal truth namely that although customs may throw a different coloring over the character of nations there is one silent language universally understood and universally the same  the language of passion and of the affections  in such thoughts as these i passed another halfhour and i venerate the memory of the poor barber for having led me into the train of them they expanded even to the utmost openings of philanthropy all the better principles within me they purged the streams of life which issue from the heart of all the remaining stains of prejudice and they ran through my veins with a purer purple no longer did i imagine it wrong to pass the boundaries of my own country to visit my neighbors on the opposite shore amelia adopted the same sentiment upon the same principles we both reconciled the idea of calmly beholding those ceremonies which different nations employ in adoring the same god we exulted at the hope of knowing many amiable characters in a new country and lastly instead of thinking upon a ship any longer as a monstrous machine that moved without any real necessity upon the face of the waters we contemplated it as a structure equally useful and ingenious and which owed its origin to god himself  the conclusion of the matter was this the heart bade the hand ring the bell with activity and the porter who obeyed its summons was hurried off with the baggage to the packet for it was preparing to weigh anchor  the passage passageboats like stagecoaches throw a man into societies and situations equally characteristic and extraordinary let it therefore be some consolation to those who are by fortune condemned to travel by such public conveyances that they will see more of the heart and all its humors and inclinings in such situations than if hey were perched up alone in all the uncomfortable dignity of a coach and eight  there were ample sources of entertainment in the groupes which were presently crowded into the cabin every face carried strongly in it the lines of a mental peculiarity in favor of that sort of speculation whose object is  human nature but what was better still every passenger except ourselves had been summoned from the sound sleep in which he had been buried to a sudden resurrection  now they who have made it their business to look inquisitively at nature under all the appearances which she can possibly assume they who have correctly marked the changes she undergoes almost every moment in obedience to circumstances great and small they also who have taken an exact survey of the human form at all hours and upon all occasions in order to pourtray with some precision the human heart these all know that there is not in life a more ludicrous moment of physiognomy than that of strangers gathering together at midnight when the senses like their chief instruments are more than half shut up and when none of the sensations even though many of them be new can either be finished or complete it is however for the sake of perfect experience in nature by no means displeasing to survey her thus as it were betwixt sleeping and waking  save amelias and mine every heart as well as every body in the packetboat was in a dose and it may be observed that when nature has not had her nap out she is equally fretful whimsical and wayward i defy the gloomiest imagination under such circumstances not to have been diverted we were a mixture of many countries and our packetboat like the tower of babel resounded with the clangor of many tongues  my eyes and ideas being all wide open and broad awake i sat myself down in a corner of the cabin and made my heart also sit down and hear all but say nothing  the cabin was stored with characteristical contrasts opposite to me sat one of those fearful and delicate beings into the breath of whose nostrils seemed at his birth to have been poured more of the essence of lavender than the spirit of vigorous life it was enshrouded head and ears in coverings of the finest cambric and its body was defended by a robe de chamber lined with the spoils of the ermine the thin texture of its voice might have suited the lungs of a lady in the last languors of a consumption and the muff of sable which extended from side to side of him might have perhaps been a necessary companion in siberia as the thin texture of its voice discovered itself only by a cough and as people cough according to the strength or weakness of constitution pretty much the same in all countries my heart which was all the time looking at him made no scruple to set him down as a parisian petit maitre when lo before half a leagues sailing in the course of which happened many faintings and many complaints of the cursed mistake of providence in not suffering a man to go smoothly over the water from one coast to another this imaginary parisian proved to be a downright affected booby of english manufacture who having been once before in the capital of france took a pride in showing us that he had seen mixed with and imitated only the most contemptible part of it  about a yard to the right of this fool of quality another person of a very different appearance had taken up his temporal residence he was dressed in all that decent and undecorated simplicity upon which englishmen particularly pique themselves the suit upon his body was all of a color there was not a single flourish in the rimming plain were the buttons on his coat exactly matching the cloth plain the ruffles at his wrist which admitted not the gaiety of an edging his hair was in a plain queue and such was his consistency and so much was he all of a piece that his very stockings were ornamented only with a small unembellished clock imagining this shivering neighbor the fop to be really near unto the gate of eternity he administered to him but without speaking in his sickness he applied the hartshorn summoned the coxcombs servants and held their conceited master by the arm when he was pleased to be in a fit amelia in the rolling of the ship slipped from her seat and before i could possibly arise from mine to her relief this stranger with doubly my agility replaced her in her chair  notwithstanding the miss i made in regard to the native country of the coxcomb i thought i should hazard nothing by suffering my heart to insist upon the honor of fixing this persons birth in great britain  in five seconds after this sagacious conclusion drawn from those as i thought them infallible premises of air manner dress and person the gentleman addressed amelia upon the subject of her fall in a way which put it beyond all doubt that he was not an englishman but a frenchman  i next looked at a personage who seemed to have the legs of an irishman who proved to be born in germany i saw a pair of shoulders set upon the back of another who i made no doubt was  chiefly because he gave them a sort of scotch shrug  fresh from the highlands who turned out to be on the very first information of his tongue a man of kent  in short i had seen enough to convince me that he who has one single particle of prejudice lurking in any one corner of his heart or who judges of the whole from a part should be contented to sit in the smoke of his own chimney corner and never look farther into the world than he can see from his window  yet it is travel only which can make us citizens of the world and it is impossible for any thing upon the face of the globe but a fool of quality who has gone far into different nations to put his trust either in the color of a coat the turn of an ancle or the shrug of a shoulder whoever does this will be deeply mortified since he will confound all nations and instead of judging of their characteristic by strokes of the heart which in little actions are always palpable he will go blundering on in headlong preprecipitancy to his own confusion and to the ridicule of others  dress and size of body may however sometimes lead to a small passage that looks into the heart which is beating beneath them but one unguarded action and one sentence apparently too little to show much is worth a thousand such external symptoms  in the center of the cabin lolled in separate chairs but with hands generally united two young englishmen whose traveling hats cockaded it in the face of midnight and who pouring out bumpers of a cordial which they brought with them into very sizeable glasses threw an arch eye at the moon whom they saw through a hatchway that opened on the deck and drank her health after which in the same strain of facetiousness they desired that she would have the civility to betake herself to bed and that she would present their compliments to her master the sun telling him that they should think his worship a very impudent scoundrel and very illmannered seeing that he slept that night so near paris if he did not immediately put on his breeches  at this sally of wit the different passengers were differently affected the young gentlemen looked on all sides of them for laugh but perceiving the joke did not take they were obliged for the credit of the thing to laugh themselves and this laugh under the sense of disappointment produced such a strange mixed sound that i am sure they could much easier have cried for mortification for i will venture to lay it down as a maxim of the heart that not to laugh with me goes nearer to the quick and nettles much more than to laugh at me laugh at my glaring follies and i have no objection but if your muscles are illnatured and obstinately fixed to the line of gravity when i give you what i take to be the pleasantest jest in the world is an offense of which my heart shall carry a resenting impression till its traces are all cut away by death  so it was at present and our young gentleman grinned horribly a ghastly smile   he fop whom i had taken for a frenchman coughed infinite disdain upon the joke and sent his valet to demand of the captain of the packetboat if he conceived there was any joke in having the assurance to suffer a gentleman of his delicacy to be blown to atoms by the cursed seawinds which whistled in at that superdamnable skylight  the gentleman whom i pronounced to be an englishman forced a courteous simper into his face in order to soften the sense of our heros misery and with the same activity by which he had assisted amelia went upon the deck and shut the coxcombs superdamnable skylight  the german with the irish legs was dropping into an agreeable dose so that i really believe he was not within earshot of the joke and as to the man with the scotch shoulders who was not the scotchman but the man of kent he sat kicking his heels just as he had been kicking them for some time before without any additional vigor in the strokes against an empty barrel upon which he was elevated  and yet i appeal to the reader if this single action of our young jesters and the different air with which it was received by the company does not afford a more certain clue to the heart than any judgment that could possibly be formed from a paltry speculation upon legs and shoulders coats and waistcoats the clock of a stocking or the buckling of a shoe such conjectures are vague and indeterminate the chance of hitting or missing is at least equal many men in all countries have large legs and those who do not trust a common liar  such has always been accounted common fame  and who judge not of a country by the specimen of a few clumsy chairmen those know that the gentlemen of ireland are for the most part elegantly formed many men likewise in all countries shrug the shoulders though the common liar above mentioned would confine the habit to the scotch and french neither of whom are more famous for it in fact than other people nor is dress more ascertaining than figure or size for the apron and frock which we give to the butcher may perchance belong to the grocer  so of other trades  these mistakes however originate from our dramatic writers who deceive us in drawing their characters the frenchman of the english theater and the englishman upon the stage of paris are perfect caracaturas it is the same with respect to our exhibition of the irish the prodigious ruffles which we give  on the stage  to the french peasants and parisian domestics is a false trick which no playwrite can possibly put upon a real traveller for the fact is that the french footmen like the english footmen in great families wear these ornaments of a common length and as to the french peasants they all wear ruffles prodigiously small if you will allow so large a word to any thing so minute and so far from the stageruffles allotted to valets being representatives of the truth i call upon every gentleman who has traveled beyond the playhouses of england to the real parts which are said to contain such preposterous exuberances of linen i say i call on them to witness for me that the poor frenchman who lives by his labor scarcely suffers his ruffles to peep the third of an inch from his wristband and i really think it would be doing but a bare justice to the nation if one was to carry over a real ruffle as a pattern for future poets to cut out by  i have here allowed a few pages to common observation without design to interest the heart but to correct the mistakes which writers have diffused over my native country and wherever the subject of simple information with regard to customs as well as manners have been misrepresented i shall certainly write down the actual truth for the readers instruction  before i set out for france i collected most of the volumes which have been written upon it and i was so perfectly convinced that as far as the matter of customs and country went the subject was wholly preoccupied and that all remarks in a similar track would be repetition that i was fully resolved to turn my observations into another channel and address myself in a method distinct from stern on the one hand and mere men of brick and mortar or ordinary describers of building furniture and fine sights on the other in this task as affording infinitely more entertainment both to my readers and to myself i proceed with infinitely more pleasure but i have still found many ideas which are popular in england with respect to france exceedingly fallacious and those ideas i shall from time to time take the liberty of correcting  by leave of the readers heart which i will soon again attend to i will take advantage of this apropos place to observe that it is not true with the regard to the notion we conceive of the french being universally a gay giddy looking people that they may be most of them rakes at heart and that they kindle into instant vivacity as soon as they begin a conversation is admitted but if you meet them in the street in the way of their business or even walking in the public gardens in parties not in the ardours of society i do not believe there is a sedater not to say solemner set of muscles in the whole world the abbes are distinguished by a sobriety of features which might become a mitre nor is there any where less gaity or levity in the look than at paris i mean so far at least as relates to external appearance of both sexes  it is a conception equally false we entertain of the necessity an englishman of taste is under to equip himself on his arrival at paris with clothes of a mere fantastical cut and color a la francoise the plain truth being neither more nor less than this that there never was any place where all sorts of people enjoyed in the greatest degrees all sorts of liberties in dress and that if a person would wish to adopt the very pink of the present taste at paris he would array himself in the dress he brings with him as english fashions are at this period followed both by men and women almost to as great an excess of affectation as french fashions at london so that neither country can say one is more ridiculous than the other in that respect  amongst young people the smart jockeyboot leatherbreeches doeskin gloves and round beaver of newmarket are i perceive entirely the mode of an elegant undress and to show our young nobleman that they do not come over the water for nothing i have the pleasure to assure them that although it is the taste for most people to ride managed horses an exercise and an art which fixes every limb erect and graceful yet there are not wanting some striplings who imitate the lounging lean and slope their backs into an arch over the shoulders of their steeds as if they had really been educated in the stud of an english groom of condition  having now set the readers head right as to some national particulars i return to the incidents of the heart which will doubtless please him much better i allow that the above is a digression or at least that the intelligence is somewhat out of its place for in point of absolute and precise narration i am but just stepping on french ground after a brisk passage and here have i been giving observations that belong to paris but methinks the reader must have very little politeness if he murmurs forth any of his criticisms at this for i only promised to amuse his heart with such incidents as should fall in my way and therefore all which exceeds this promise and which relates to mere matter of fact sentiment in regard to other travelers is absolute favor and given out of the free spirit of my courtesy into the bargain traveling really expands the heart  calais the two young jokers happened to go to the same hotel that i did the coxcomb in the wrapping clothes was carried gently off in a chair to monsieur desseins and the real french gentleman bowed politely to the whole company and walked away to a private house  without choosing to enter into any more jokes at present i withdrew to my chamber and what perhaps your chimneycorner characters will not give credit to slept as soundly as softly and as much to my hearts content in the bed and in the land of an enemy as if my apartment was under the protection of my natural sovereign the sun too beamed benignity and brightness into my chamber in the morning as if to welcome me and tempt me to pursue my journey without further interruptions  i accepted his radiant invitation and arose amelia breakfasted with me and the jokers for whom i am indebted for some admirable hints touching the origin of what is called the imposition of french innkeepers  it is common enough for travelers on the same road to communicate their business the one to the other but the twin jesters were remarkably reserved upon this subject owing very probably to the impossibility of speaking about it for where men have really the true nomeaning in setting out for a long journey it is truly difficult to disclose their motives the most undesigning nothingness brought our youths from london to calais and the same undesigning nothingness will i doubt not carry them back again after looking at them however very intently almost half an hour and turning their hearts on all sides i discovered that if they had any ray of plot in this excursion it was that which might lead foreigners to think very despicably of english prudence and to do their native country and all future travelers an injury by acting like madmen at every stage  for example  one of them took a glittering purse from his waistcoat pocket and with too uncompressed and liberal a hand shook it at the ear of his companion as much as to say here it is my friend here it is the golden key which shall unlock all the curiosities toys and cabinets of france this will we dedicate my lad to pleasure politeness and paris  here amelia was obliged to hem and gingle her coffeecup to prevent the risings of a virtuous indignation  the youth who was in all the glory of his triumph observed by this time some poor aged creatures of both sexes who pick their scanty livelihood from the bounty of travelers curtsying and bowing with petitioning eyes and bending heads at the windows of the hotel  the opportunity of joking never escapes the man whose heart lies in wait for it and he has the art of extracting a joke very often from a tale of misery or an incident that would afflict the tender fools of nature with the agonies of grief the jester with the purse ran to the window near which was a large table upon which he spread out in tempting array several guineas to the tune perhaps of about two hundred the hearts of every mendicant flew up instantaneously into his face a soft suffusion of blood colored for a moment the countenance of age hope sparkled in the eye of despair and every hand shook even to palsy with expectation  i was fool enough to imagine that all this preparation indicated a generous action and amelia was so perfectly persuaded of it that she set down her cup and opened the window that even so transparent an obstacle as a few panes of glass might not lie in the way of the young gentlemans liberality  alas this was nothing more than the ceremony which preceded a joke our hero set the table at two yards distance and desired them to take what they fairly could by stretching forth their arms from the window  the poor creatures shook their heads at the impossibility of the thing a little boy half naked declared that he would stand on his head and tumble a whole hour for a single sous  the jester wittily said that he would give him neither a sow nor a pig unless he could reach it finding no one attempted this he put the money again into the purse and walked with it to the window  now said amelia i hope you will pay the honest people for the anxiety you have given them  certainly madam cried the youth you shall now see that i can do a genteel thing to the honor of england which is after all the only england in the whole world  saying this he opened the purse and bade the little boy put in his head and eat guineas till his belly was full of them but the joke of this circumstance laid in an endeavor to pinch the poor childs nose by tightening the strings when he had made an effort to succeed a second stroke of wit consisted in offering one who looked like a jew a guinea if he would suffer our hero to cut off his beard and one jest of superlative brightness was reserved for an insult upon a woman bent double by age and whose cheeks were ploughed by the furrow of time into wrinkles our generous young gentleman promised to give her an ortolon if she would promise to chew it here the jest lay in the poor creatures having lost all her teeth he then proposed that she should have for her own use as many livres as he could put into her wrinkles provided that she hobbled off with them to her own house without letting them drop in which case they were to be his who should find them the faminestruck wretch urged by the pleadings of nature understood enough of his bad french to comprehend this strange proposal and said she complied with it and i do actually believe he would have gone on with the joke till he had lined her face with silver though he had stuck every livre into her cheek at the price of her pain and blood this i say he most likely would have done had not the tenderhearted amelia run again to the window while the color of true shame for her countrymen came into her face and out of her own pocket dispensed to every petitioner a trifle and advised them to depart in peace  this action interrupted the course of my countrymans humor and by way of polite revenge he put his hand passionately into his purse and discharged several guineas at the heads of the mendicants as they were departing thus for once a very excellent circumstance of joy to the unfortunate arose out of an action in which the heart had no share  for my own part i sallied out into the street and stood guard while the scramble was over for i did not doubt but when the squanderer cooled he would be mean enough to cast a longing lingering look after that money which he had lavished while he was warm  amelias heart smiled in her face upon this occasion and the bucks consoled themselves with observing that the lady might laugh but she had been the means of spoiling a good joke for all that  yes yes thought i  the reason is plain  it is to such lovers of pleasure and politesse as these we may attribute those impositions of which sober and sensible travelers complain such striplings who are inclined to wander and cursed with a fortune which allows the means of doing it having no settled plan either of acting or thinking come into a foreign country and distinguish themselves by the splendour of mischief they can find a ravishing pleasure in taking out a bag full of louis when they want only a livre they are pitiful enough to imagine there is a dignity in the display of money and so let every man look into the bottom of the pocket at once they have the pleasure also to exert the spirit of an englishman as they term it at every inn upon the road and the still small request would make the waiter tender his services full as well yet englishmen of spirit deal their commands vociferously about them and issue their ridiculous orders at the utmost extent of the voice these brisk young gentlemen also concentre the sublime of their delight in the clatter of carriagewheels the crack of whipcord and the delicious clatter of a couple of dozen iron shoes struck forcibly by half a dozen horses against a rugged pavement and i am in doubt whether the circumstance of the french roads being stoney has not as much as any thing else contributed to render them popular in the estimation of the heltershelter race of travelers for every body who is acquainted with the ambition of our english youths can tell that it is last masterstroke consist in passing rapidly within the breadth of a barleycorn by another carriage and he who can turn a corner quicker and shorter than an hackneycoachman has arrived at such an excellence as entitles him to incontested superiority  men of spirit too we have amongst us in whom shoots up the spirit of travel who feel the politesse in all its poignancy from seeing a couple of postillions in their laced jackets with half a dozen brutes have the honor to enter a city before the men of spirit themselves and they take to themselves all that stare and admiration which is paid to the number of horses and to the ornaments of the equipage the joy of such too arises from doing the very action of which a rational traveller would be ashamed for they admire the politesse of paying so respectable a piece of money as a french crown because an englishman forsooth ought for the honor of his country to despise all connection with such morsels of money as pass in exchange of a single livre upon the continent  the innkeeper sees all these prodigalities and has generally enough of the world about him to make out his bill according to the conduct of his customers he perceives that every english booby who is broke from school or the apronstring of his mother gets a weak fathers consent to make up a purse with which he is to make himself more extensively ridiculous hence it is that the disgrace of prodigality is marked as the characteristic of our country from which imputation the honest travelers who are contented with a pair of horses and a decent dinner decently ordered in a quiet articulation which bespeaks us at peace with all men hence i say it is that those travelers who are lowthoughted enough to separate the gold from the silver and the silver from the copper can with difficulty rescue themselves from ignominy  amelia was surveying our heroes with one of those looks which denote the displeasure of the heart when the youngest started up with that sot of agility which is usually the characteristic of people whose heels and heads are equally light swearing that it thundered as if heaven and earth were coming by mutual consent together the waiter appearing decided a wager of fifty guineas that were staked on the table by these british disputants one of whom asserted it was the noise of a wagon and the other as has been observed that it was thunder it proved to be neither for the real cause of the sound showed itself in a few minutes and proved to be the stagecoach or diligence from calais to paris which at that instant was as i imagined about to set off for the city the appearance of this vehicle was a source of infinite wit to our jokers one of which insisted that he had won his wager for that it was to all intents and purposes a wagon and a very ugly illcontrived wagon into the bargain the other wit maintained that he also was willing to abide by his bargain since he would be judged by me amelia and the whole world whether the thing which now darkened the window and half the street was not a great deal more like a cloud out of whose womb issued thunder than either a stagecoach or a wagon  this said i to amelia is the lucky moment we shall now get rid of our troublesome countrymen you may be assured they have too much english blood in their veins to be dragged to paris in this stagecoach this wagon or this thunder while they therefore are disputing what to call it let us go and secure seats in this very machine however unweildy and if possible pay our quota unnoticed and be gone  there is a good degree of hazard in obeying implicitly the first impulses and except in cases of pity and kindness where a worthy object is waiting for ones liberality i scarce know a single instance in which it is not best to wait for the suffrage of second thoughts a man however is so plaguely fond of a fresh idea the moment it is started that he dances about with it as a fond mother might be supposed to gad about with the firstborn for the pride of showing the little idol to her friends  i went incontinently into the street followed by the master of the hotel and finding that two places were to be had and only two i caught at them with the greatest avidity paid down my money cheerfully without paying any regard to the clumsy construction of the conveyance and shaped into the parlour again as having finished the business charmingly  one trip generally brings on another and i have observed that when either man or horse is set in for stumbling it is well if he does not come to the ground i have just hit it amelia said i and as good luck will have it there were but two places vacant  two words malapropos set the heart totally wrong i betrayed the whole project for the english wits saw that i wanted to quit their company  but two places echoed they then will we ride upon the coachbox upon hearing there was no coachbox to a french stagecoach then said they will we ride in the basket for travel from calais to paris in some part or other of that monstrous machine we assuredly will even though we were to mount each of us a miserable steed behind those miserable postilions  as soon as it was determined upon that these bundles of british wit were to be part of our luggage i heartily repented of my hasty engagement but it was too late and too awkward a crisis to retract so i whispered amelia that i did not doubt but that even this inconvenience might have its counterbalance of amusement some way  all for the best said amelia  the english striplings now exhibited another specimen of english prudence in the manner of discharging their bill they had many jocular strokes to make upon the size form figure and variety of the french coin none of which had the good fortune to escape a joke and a censure a louis they said was when compared with a guinea a mean pitiful piece that looked french in every line and mark of the impression they had the sagacity to find out that the fullness and plenitude of flesh represented on the guinea was perfectly characteristic of king george and his dominions while in the profile of louis as well as in the arms of that young monarch they discovered something they could not exactly tell what which belonged to the french nation the french crown they confessed was noblesized did it not resemble in some respects the uncouthness of the diligence nor had they any objection to the small silver coins except that they were palpably mere copies of the good honest english sixpence as to the copper coins they wholly renounced and execrated the whole groupe swearing that they were fit for no earthly thing in the universe unless to drive into the head of an impertinent waiter who should have the audacity to show that he was a man after he had been treated as a brute  during this scene of wit amelia was dealing forth her charity to a poor franciscan who was addressing her heart through the window turning short therefore to the jokers she pointed with her finger to the friar and can you not conceive gentlemen said she in a very tender tone and turn of countenance can you not conceive some good and amiable use to which even the smallest of the pieces of money you so much abuse might be put behold gentlemen how those two windows are surrounded by the sons and daughters of poverty your hearts are there solicited in every form and in every attitude can you possibly survey those objects and say the french money is inconvenient for my part i can conceive every thing that is excellent of that monarch or that man who first divided a single half crown into so many parts each of which are so extremely commodious to the purposes of benevolence ah gentlemen have you not yet traveled far enough in the world to know that what is to you a trifle may to your neighbors be a matter of importance the journey of life if you will admit for a moment a womans allegory is made steep by a thousand hills dangerous by a thousand declivities and rugged by as many narrow or desert passages what a variety of travelers are wearied worn and harrassed upon the road is your purse stored with french small pieces of money what a favorable moment to show the largeness of the heart great circumstances shall spring from small beginnings and half a sous and even a liard shall sometimes bind up the wounds of the soul and be as it were a crutch to help the enfeeled invalid upon his way  the jokers as soon as amelia had done thanked her for her very excellent discourse as they termed it upon poverty french coin and charity and when they paid their bill directed the waiter to carry a few sous to the gentleman with the bald head and bare feet to go a little way toward buying him a night cap and slippers  calais there was a mistake at the bottom of all this hurry the machine was not to set out till the next morning early and it was now but just arrived from paris so that we had three parts of a day upon our hands and it was the contrivance of our hearts to employ it apart from the men of wit but this was impossible  by this time the poor mendicant had come round from the window into the parlour and made his desires known to our striplings partly by his patience in teaching them french and partly by his label of intelligence in english which hung at his girdle which according to the rules of his order was decorated with a rope  he invited us to visit his convent a common courtesy which is paid indiscriminately to all travelers on their first arrival  the wits went for a joke and amelia with me for the heart be assured reader some admirable specimens of english humor were shown off at the church of the convent the franciscan bent the knee and pressed the bosom as he passed the crucifixes which were in several parts of the church the wits followed his example in every thing but the appearance at least of sincerity the friar unlocked a large range of drawers out of which he took the robes roses and other ornaments which are made use of at the altar on days which are set apart for extraordinary ceremonies the franciscan held these with a cautious hand amelia looked at them with the reverence and discretion which decency requires upon every religious occasion i considered them for my own part as wellintended decorations but the jokers found out a pleasant simile and likened every order of the priesthood to so many differentcoloured trappings of a coachhorse on my lord mayors day attended ludicrously by a retinue of longrobed liverymen the two large lights which were burning on each side a silverlamp before the principal crucifix in the center of the altarpiece our young gentlemen observed would do most admirably for a pair of torches to trail behind a carriage if any method could be hit upon to make them flame with a little more spirit but fie upon them cried the jokers they are not lively enough for any thing but a pack of halfstarved mendicant friars or to shed a sort of darkness visible round the vault of our greatgrandfather the franciscan next took us by a narow flight of steps into a long gallery on each side of which were the humble lodgings of his fraternity he opened a little door which led into his own and pointed with a meek and patient action of the finger to his couch of straw the casement of the window half over which clung slips of ivy might be about the size of a single pane of a modern sash and it was defended by bars of iron it seemed indeed to be the very cabinet of mortification and selfdenial but the english jesters declared it was the worst kennel for those foxes in sheeps clothing the parsons they ever beheld this simile bore so hard upon the brotherhood that our franciscan who by the bye understood too much english to be insensible of a downright insult in coarse language turned round to our companions and was going to address them when happening to turn his eye toward a cross upon which his god was extended in the atttitude of suffering the last indignity after almost every other had been discharged against him he bowed submissively to the figure as if he had just caught from it the spirit of acquiescence and the color which indignation had before brought from the heart to the cheek went off and put a check to whatever might have happened every nerve that i had was shaken and leaving amelia a moment to amuse herself with the prospect of the garden of the convent through the little lattice in the friars apartment i drew the venerable monastic gently aside into the gallery and there in a whisper apologized for the liberties which were taken by our young inexperienced travelers who desired to appear more impious than they really were  the mendicant made no reply but as if he had heart enough to forgive all trespasses against him whether of malice or ignorance he smiled ineffable benignity and we again joined the company  here to the increase of my distress i found amelia in a warm argument with our young gentlemen upon the subject of a decent deportment at places of public worship the contest it seems began upon an expedient started by the eldest to make a covering for the nakedness of the figure upon the cross in the room of the friar for our delicate englishman insisted that unless some such circumstance took place a crucifix was no fit object for female inspection he therefore humbly made a motion that the company would unanimously enter into a voluntary subscription to make up such a sum as would purchase a complete suit of clothes not forgetting a little sparkle of tinsel in the french style that the deity might in future appear in the dress of a gentleman  in support of this vein of ridicule the youth was just holding his hat to amelia for her subscription as we came into the room and amelia was parrying off the stroke partly by blushes and partly by arguments is it not very strange gentlemen said she that a woman cannot be one moment unprotected in any corner of the globe however sanctimonious but she must be insulted by the rudeness of her own countrymen she had no time to go on the rage of the franciscan at the sight of the crucifix over which the wit had thrown his pockethandkerchief was worked into a pious enthusiasm and his heart dictated to our striplings a very severe and seasonable lesson  be covered in the blushes of confusion gentlemen said he what principle is it by which you are thus directed to disgrace yourselves and your country we are taught to believe that on your side of the sea the seminaries of education are governed by laws that are wise prudent liberal and amiable we are taught that the education of an english gentleman is attended with a very considerable expense morals and humanity it is said are particularly cultivated in your universities we gather these things i say from the report of those who would emblazon the institutions of your country but if report is to be confronted by experience what does experience tell us on this subject this town of calais has been but too often a witness to your libertinism hither you come over with youth high spirits and a sum of money for the most part too large for the feelings of a moderate man the british empire is so truly respectable as a nation that we who are your neighbors wish to admire your politeness as much as we venerate your genius but how is this possible when the specimens which are exhibited to us of your manners are so frequently cruel and unmanly you enter our country without one generous idea relating to it you call our courtesey which is said to contrast your bluntness insincerity you look at the face of our country and seem to wonder that the smile of providence is extended from the clift of dover to that of calais you look at our customs and because they differ from your customs you turn from them with disgust or affected disdain you enter our churches and turn into the basest ridicule objects most sacred you have not even the discretion to keep silence while we pay our passing obeisance to the shrine of the omnipotent god himself is the sport and pastime of your leisure and laughter our citizens artizans women children as well as the bravest of our soldiers come at all convenient hours to their devotion and though they come without any compulsion you call it hypocrisy we lay before you our curiosities and you despise them we take many wrongs patiently we allow largely to the impressions made by our singularities and then you ill treat us beyond bearing ah ungenerous travelers is it to laugh at your fellow creatures and scoff at your creator that you make such inroads upon us is such the motive that urges a young englishman to migrate is such the conduct of those who ought to be the patterns and examples of a free and noble country you teach our traders to believe that you value nothing so little as money and yet you pretend to wonder that they fix a price upon what you hold in the slightest estimation if the savage is taught by the more mechanical european that the gun can do more execution than the bowstring and at the same time shows him how to pull the trigger can you wonder if he directly puts his first experiment in practice immediately fie upon it gentlemen it is not doing justice either to one kingdom or to another it is not doing as you would be done by tell me i beseech you seriously tell me    here the franciscan raised his voice extended his right arm fixing himself more firmly on his center  at what time did you ever behold one of this country so behave himself in britain he comes to your snore with eyes to see and heart to admire he beholds large tracts of your land in the highest state of vigorous cultivation and a he thinks well of your peasantry by the sweat of whose brows and the diligence of whole hands it is procured he passes through your towns of business and is forcibly struck with the spirit of commerce which seems to be the genius of your climate he inspects the various manufactories extended along the banks of your fruitful rivers and conceives highly of your english ingenuity he goes into the capital of the kingdom and if he draws at all the line of comparison betwixt the two great cities of london and paris he draws it in favor of the former he readily allows to it all that is due to superiority of uniform buildings admirable accommodation for footpassengers and for the convenience of ample streets in which there is sufficient scope for trade and fashion for the car and for the coach gratified abundantly he either fixes amongst you or returns into his native country if the former it is not always what it is said you englishmen imagine it to be because he cannot live so well in france but for more amiable reasons if he returns and where is the man to whom such a return is not sooner or later desirable he brings not over with him any base ideas that are unworthy to travel half a league in the heart of any man breathing but he speaks of your nation as it were to be wished you would have the equity to speak of ours what then gentlemen are we to suppose are we to believe that only the slightest lightest and most superficial part of you addict yourselves to travel i should be sorry to think that this were the case nay my own experience tells me that it is not always so  here he took amelia by the hand and bowed to me with respect  this lady and that gentleman to go no farther have given me no reason to believe they crossed the sea to despise the deity or any of his poorer ministers because perhaps there is some difference in the exterior ceremonies of a national devotion nay i have seen other exceptions to a deplorable general rule and those exceptions are the only things which save england from the contempt into which it would inevitably fall without them excuse my wrath gentlemen i have spoken as an injured man i have spoken as a brother of the holy society to whose use this church is allotted i have spoken as the faithful servant of a master whose sacred image you have wantonly offended  with this noble climax the offended franciscan finished his exhortation and remonstrance never surely was there observed ten minutes for he spoke with deliberation of profounder silence  saint paul at the time of his making felix tremble could not possibly have commanded a more perfect attention there was indeed many favorable circumstances to heighten the solemnity of the whole transaction pale as were the features of the franciscan at his outset his eyes kindled with his argument and his heart gave such animation to his face and such eloquence to his tongue that he led his hearers into implicit captivity the little apartment was in itself an object of awe having a sable hanging of dark tapestry wrought with traits of sacred figures and a cloud which suddenly passed the face of the sun threw a gloom into the place that put as it were into the power of the friar the attractions of magic amelia was bound as if by enchantment to the bed of straw on which she sat and as the declaimer ended she took the hem of his coarse and humiliating tunic and in the compleatest sincerity of her heart pressed it to her bosom even the wits forgot their jocularity and were unusually serious that is to say they looked about for a good joke and could not find it yet were they both ashamed if i may so express myself of their being ashamed they blushed at the novelty of a keen sensation and they wished the friar in heaven for having smitten fire from the flint this awkward kind of consciousness was well illustrated when the youth who had thrown the handkerchief over the crucifix stole it as it were imperceptibly away forcing a sad half smile into his face as much as to insinuate that he did not know what he was about  the blushes we all prepared to depart and in passing through the body of the church the heart of amelia was caught by the appearance of many females distributed in different parts at their devotions she paused  stopped short  folded her hands together involuntarily and went on tiptoe as if fearful of interrupting their ceremonies as the franciscan bowed to the cross in repassing the high altar i verily believe if it were not for shame of doing a decent thing the wits could both have found it in their hearts to have bowed also  at the great door of the church that led into the street the friar bowed to the whole company with a complacence which discovered that he bore no remembrance of what was past so as to affect his urbanity nay to convince us farther that he did not his bend to the striplings was more deep more profound and more respectful even than that to amelia he seemed to know the true point of delicacy and had a heart to treat those whom his tongue however justly had wounded this was but an awkward crisis for the young men one of whom after some irresolute gestures offered a liberal present to the friar  the air with which it was offered and with which it was rejected are two of those important trifles which neither pen nor pencil can do proper justice to they both blushed but the blood appeared in both for an opposite reason the cheek of the person who offered the present was colored by a reproach which bore its commission from the heart the face of the franciscan was tinged by that natural paint of virtue which always mounts at the offer of a bribe he had forgiven the whole matter before but this offer recalled the transaction and although a twentieth part of the sum would have been acceptable some time before there were now many insuperable objections the noble independency of his late eloquence was not the least of these instead therefore of receiving it he tarried awhile till the heart beat pacifically and then declined it with a good grace the interval however betwixt the making of the offer and the final rejection was beautifully interesting to lovers of nature it was a silent transaction in which the heart looked through the eyes and the blood spoke in the cheeks for about two or three minutes the blush of disgrace is deeper and more durable than the blush of virtue there is also a like distinction in the color disgrace is a full disordered fiery kind of flush not without some touches of the livid hue that partakes of fear the cheek of a virtuous man under a sensation of transient anger is set off by a bloom more delicate pure and lively i stood facing both parties and beheld the whole process the color of the friar softened every moment more and more like the traits in a rainbow in the summer till all that was called up from other quarters of the frame gently retired into the proper vessels and only left a glow of dignity and congratulation as the symptom of a recent excellence while the young man who had shame upon his cheek was much longer in getting rid of the tide than ran round his features it burnt with the destructive rage of the dog star it settled in the center then mounted to his eye then crimsoned his neck nature seemed to have pride in it it was a matter of ignominy there actually came from the lads eyes two or three tears i saw them course along as if to quench the burning suffusion which notwithstanding this verged off tardily and i know not how long it would have continued if when all was well again with the friar he had not tenderly taken the youths hand and as he shut the churchdoor gently smiled like the angel of compassion upon our departure  calais the affair of the blushes and the conscious ceremony which they brought about at the door of the church with the little nice discriminations which it was necessary to make in the description are what i call fine strokes of the heart and of character  for such it was that i always looked about me and for such the miser who for very avarice should refuse to shave his beard though it swept his bosom would not travel half so far for the amplest additions to his store  thou nature art my goddess my services are bound to thee i take every opportunity to profess my adoration i would trace thee over rocks and mountains that appear inaccessible as thou sattest at the grate of a dungeon offering the cup of patience to the prisoner or in the palace of the sovereign where art endeavors in vain wholly to discard thy empire i would observe thy inimitable operations i would steal an enraptured glance at thee oh thou wonderworking power while thou were parading it in public triumph through the streets of a city or i would go with thee into the cave of the sequestered hermit where thy sway is not less despotic when as often is the case thou art too shy or too mysterious to be noted at an ordinary survey i would silently sit me down in some unobserved corner and watch thy workings and when it was denied me to view thee in the fuller manifestation of thy glory i would be content to look on the radiant skirts of thy garment every undertaking wherein it is thy delight to engage however minute  and for the most part the minuter the more curious  is precious to thy votaries and neither watchings nor feastings nor fastings nor sorrows nor sicknesses nor stripes nor whatever else happens to the children of men can prevent them or prevent me from yielding up the whole heart to the supreme power of nature  disorder still sat displaying itself in the cheek of the jokers and on our arrival at the hotel they desired to be shown into a private room had the good franciscan heard this request the laurel of a complete victory would have been fitted to his brow but he was a man who seemed not made for conquests of this kind and though it is the way of ordinary mortals to swell out the crest and lift up the head upon such occasions i am persuaded the mendicant would have rejected the advantage he had over the heart of the youth as he rejected the bribe  the tear of unaffected pity was trembling in the eye of amelia as she saw the heroes enter their new and solitary apartment i fee for them said she with a melting accent the helmet which they a little while ago carried so proudly in the air as a streamer of superiority is now without a plume while she whispered this one of them softly desired the waiter to take care that they were not disturbed while the other half closed his conscious eye as if nature had drawn over the lid in disgrace and then he gently shut to the door  now said amelia leave the heart to its own contemplations such a retired hour of sensible reproach is the best thing in the universe for jokers mark the result of it upon their coming out of the room of penitence  the scruple as you have now seen the church monsieur said the master of the hotel to me suppose you were now to pass an hour at the playhouse  old england was still so much about me that i stopped the man abruptly and very gravely demanded to know the day of the week  which either we or you have mistaken said amelia  this is sunday replied the frenchman for which very reason i think you cannot amuse a part of the evening better here clustered the interrogatories of inexperience  what go to the play on a sunday said simplicity finish a noble sermon which we have just heard delivered by a franciscan in his church upon english inhospitality with the farce of a theater and is not every door of every stage in england shut at this very moment said prejudice shall we dare to profane the sabbath said habit  will you go said i amelia  my god said she what a question  why not demanded the master of the hotel whence arises your scruple  from hence said amelia striking her hand somewhat forcibly upon her heart  pardon me fair lady said a very grave looking old man in the dress of an officer who stood at her elbow and overheard the dispute pardon me fair lady if i say that i should suspect the feelings of any heart in such a case did it beat in a less beautiful bosom  there was a gallantry in this compliment which induced us to listen to the arguments of the complimenter rather than to the master of the hotel so we took a turn with the stranger along the courtyard of the hotel and he displayed his heart as he walked backwards and forwards  but this is the lords day sir answered amelia to his first argument  it is so replied the officer and ought therefore to be more particularly distinguished by additional marks of joy what good purpose is affected by that gloom which hangs over this day in your country it is permitted in england to rest from toil every seventh day so it is in france it is ordained that all churches in england shall celebrate the great god to whom they are devoted with prayer and supplication at stated periods so it is in france it is allowed in most parts of england that after divine service the peasants may betake themselves to the brothel or the beerhouse the consequence of which is that sunday more than any other day of the week is closed in drunkenness in france we have provided against an inclination to such beastly excesses we worship god not with a frowning face nor yet with a dull silence nor yet with needless austerities but we distinguish the day which he hallowed by the most agreeable innocent and healthy exercises or entertainments we conceive nothing suitable to the genius of true piety in imposing upon ourselves unchearful customs  the morning we usher in with songs of gratitude and the evening is passed in sports which neither hurt the constitution of man nor contradict the mandates of god where my good friends is it forbidden or rather where is it not encouraged to celebrate the day of the deity with songs and with dances with the tabor and with the timbrel with the lute and with every other instrument of festivity keep holy the sabbath day says the commandment we do keep it holy there is nothing sacred in a wrinkle there is nothing holy in a dull habit of solemnity which has no foundation in reason we have in france no inebriety no oaths no blasphemies no public quarrels or if they are ever seen the police has provided rigours which make the offender a terrible example to his countrymen i formerly passed some time in england and am not unacquainted with your customs or your legislature you stipulate the price of an oath and every man may swear till he is hoarse if he is in a situation to pay a shilling for a blasphemy you have fightings in your cities on a sunday evening and the mob is collected and dispersed without the intervention of a magistrate unless one of the parties fighting should receive his deathwound and even in that case the murderer is suffered to escape under the cover of accidental slaughter whoever walks through your villages on the evening of the sabbath may hear them resound with the oaths of drunken men in the adjacent alehouses and if on their return home to their families who dread their coming you should meet them on the way it behooves you well either to turn aside or else have the fortitude to bear unrevenged the insults of a man when he is in the state of a brute  the french on the contrary    pray sir said amelia interrupting him will you have the goodness to tell me what it is oclock for i am afraid if we dont make haste we shall be too late for the play  the officer smiled at the manner in which she discovered her acquiescence in the custom of being merry on a sunday afternoon and insisted upon showing his fair proselyte the way to the comedy several little peculiarities struck us there during the representation the people instead of sitting down in the pit upon benches as in england stood up the whole time this is strangely awkward and incommodious said prejudice  hush answered liberality it is the custom of the country  good god said prejudice noting a second objection the prompter sits like an ascending ghost with his head and shoulders appearing to the audience through a trapdoor upon the stage instead of concealing himself for the sake of dramatic probability behind the side wings of the scene  hold your tongue cried liberality it is the custom of the country  the audience absolutely stuns one said amelia with their violent conversation between the acts although during the exhibition i confess their attention surpasses ours in england  hush hush replied i seem to take no notice it is the custom of the country  the old french officer who had a quick ear and amazing volubility caught up the sense of the last sentence and harangued like a cicero upon it  the observation my good sir said he addressing himself to me should reconcile every peculiarity that you might meet with in a voyage round the globe the custom of a country should sanctify every thing that is singular either in religion or in manners though vice and virtue are invariably the same modes and maxims differ in almost every place he who confines himself to one country will generally be confined to one set of ideas while he who travels will think more largely and will allow for contrariety of opinion and diversity of manners you have just landed on this border of france and you are surprised at some small differences in our customs from those which are popular with you but were you to pass from hence into other realms you would observe in many of them several singularities still more unfamiliarized and unaccountable the turk the chinese the swiss the tartar will alternately deal forth their surprises upon you if you have no heart to conceive that every nation may be allowed to pursue its own maxims you will have nothing to do but to stare and sit down with your perplexity you have already seen that what is thought to be a pious observance of religion in one country is twentyone miles of not imagined to be even proper or suitable to the deity what then would you say to the modes of remote climes where perhaps almost every idea which you have imbibed in your own country is inverted thus characters in different quarters of the globe receive a different coloring purely from the customs of the country and yet though manners vary the heart may every where make an acceptable offering to the creator he who gave to every class of people a country gave to them a proper constitution both of mind and body and you have just as much reason for disputing against the customs of any country because they dissent from yours as you have for objecting to a dissimilitude in their forms and features in france we neither eat like you nor think like you in several respects in china they neither adopt the food nor the opinions of the french the natives of the southern hemisphere assimilate themselves not to the chinese and yet they are very excellent people who inhabit all those countries learn therefore to believe that every thing which is decent wise and innocent may be practiced from the same principle but by different manners  i desire to know then sir if you do not think us heretics said amelia  heretics said the officer a little incomposed settle that matter with your own heart i have seen the world and should suppose there is heaven enough for all good men in all countries  no doubt replied amelia  then madam rejoined the officer as he handed her out of the box the play being now over then may i hope to give you another meeting when the journey of this life is over be our religions in this world of what sect they will  there was so much of heart in this expression that i took hold of his hand as soon as i had got into the street and thanked him for having made me wiser and more like a man who bore the form of a million other men in regions whose manners bore no trace of resemblance to mine  the citizen of the world is the best character you can aspire to said the soldier and so ended the argument  it is scarce eight oclock continued the old officer looking at his watch and if you do not choose to bury the remains of so charming an evening in your apartments at the hotel i will take a ramble with you into the fields  a quarter of an hours walking brought us to a spot in the center of which was an ancient and ample tree round which the peasants of calais were dancing to the scrapings of a fiddle  gracious god exclaimed i if they are not    hush said amelia pulling me gently by the sleeve it is the custom of the country  we passed quietly on through the crowd in the very heyday of its merriment and sat ourselves down on a distant bench that was made round an oak on purpose for the convenience of the wearied couples or the unfatigued spectators there was an avenue of spacious elms to the right and a little way off leaning against these we beheld a man wholly apart from the rest of the company my curiosity led me to leave amelia with the officer and walk toward him his handkerchief remained up to his eyes as i passed by him three times but when in going by him the fourth time i discovered in his woewan features the lover of the unfortunate felicity how was i astonished he recognized me in a moment and very pensively told me that he came to look at the dances to divert his chagrin but it has not answered monsieur said he i am disgusted with the festivity of which it is impossible for me to partake a healthylooking blythe girl offered just now to dance with me but i had no pleasure in the touch of her hand and as i could not conceive it to be the hand of felicity i declined the offer when the young men and women meet or go arm in arm with smiles upon their faces i can feel the tears coming into my eye because i am not able to show the same tender courtesy to felicity but i see the dancers are going to separate and every man will retire with his partner  i am not accountable i hope if nature has mixed up in me a little envy and so i will betake myself away in good time adieu monsieur adieu but do not forget that the fairest of women resides up five pair of stairs in the fauxbourgs st marceau  the last and deepest shade of the evening was now overshadowing us and amelia waved her hand to beckon me back  and how came you here so soon my good lad said i to the barber  the discourse replied he which passed between us at dover about felicity had such an effect on me that as i passed by the quay in my way home i happened to see the captain of the packet who assured me that he should sail next tide so i gave him the money your bounty monsieur bestowed on me fully resolved to take a walk to paris for which place i design to set off tomorrow  where are your traveling expenses said i  here cried the youth with great confidence my expenses will be defrayed by these hands i make no doubt but i shall dress my way up to town besides a lad of my principles who is to steal a glance at felicity at the end of his journey makes nothing of a couple of hundred miles  let me see you at the table royale said i within an hour  i will be at the door of your apartment monsieur said he to the moment  when the officer had escorted us to our inn he informed us of a little engagement that he had to fulfill and wished us a good repose  bagatelles certainly said i telling amelia the circumstance of having met the lovesick barber certainly i have been the means of drawing this poor lad from his employment since it is evident he followed the dictates of his heart in leaving dover he is in search of his felicity and he designs to comb and shave his way up to her but this is a tiresome method of journeying and as it is necessary for him to be private to what perils will his passion expose him now i have been thinking that    i was interrupted by the master of the hotel who appeared to acquaint me that the young gentlemen in the private room had altered their mind as to going by the diligence and very soon after we departed for the comedy set out post with a design of traveling night and day till they got to paris  there was a mixture of good and bad in this intelligence though amelia by her smile seemed to say it was a good without any alloy their taking advantage of our absence to save the pride of the heart any farther mortification at our return was a symptom of sensibility and might in time bring about desirable improvements but their resolution to travel night and day till they got to paris denoted a violent relapse  few events however are there in life which though in the one hand they bring evil always carry in the other some portion of pleasure or convenience  as to the matter of convenience nothing ever happened half so apropos to any mortal breathing as this sudden exit of the jokers to the poor barber it facilitated also my scheme of getting him to the fauxbourgs st marceau without the drudgery inconsistent with the delicacy of his passion of sticking his comb into any locks but his own  you shall travel snug in the basket of the diligence my good fellow said i to the barber who was now tripping up to the door of the hotel where i stood there may thou and thy tender secrets be as secure as thou would desire them  he put his hand into his pouch and pulling out the lining of his breeches pocket looked as he were looking at a dead blank but the french soon recover themselves and he is no true lover in any country who is without some expedient however retrogade to visit his mistress especially if there was a proper share of danger or of difficulty to quicken him luckily for the barber he had some ounces of romance wrought up with him and these with the prompting spirit of love to set them at work will send a man upon the full run from one end of the earth to the other in defiance of fatigue the sustaining idea of an imaginary goddess to soothe him when the journey is over will carry him through it  the barber i say had romance enough in his constitution to dress up his deity in the fauxbourgs st marceau in the best manner his wanton fancy pillaged the heathen heaven for fair possessions and his own story of felicity was that she had more beauty than venus more sense than minerva more dignity than juno and more grace than the graces judge then how his heart must have throbbed with ecstasy at the proposal of the basket till he felt into his forlorn pouch and drew out the lining in despair but as was noted above the french soon recover themselves  before i saw the face of felicity said the lad pointing to a narrow spangled edging which was run round his coat and wainscot before i saw the face of felicity i had a passion for this but since i have had a passion for her and she will i know like me full as well without any finery upon my coat as with it i know how i shall be able to accomplish the matter you must know monsieur i brushed by a little dapper gascon at the dance who was so taken with my spangles that he left his partner on purpose to ask me where i bought them  i stopped him in this conversation which i could plainly see tended toward downright stripping so putting a louis into his hand i desired him not to miss the opportunity of the morning and to remember that i should expect to be paid again by a look at his felicity up five pair of stairs  the louis the basket the treasure up five pair of stairs and the rescued spangled edging which notwithstanding his affected disregard was not wholly indifferent to him all conjoined to touch upon the nerves of the barber till nature who can neither bear one extreme nor the other nor yet a mixture of both without playing the baby carried him from the hotel betwixt crying and laughing  it would be heresy to omit telling the reader that when the barber hit upon the expedient of the spangled edging i threw out a lure to catch the character of his heart by proposing a better resource in the sale of the little picture at his bosom  sensibility threw him into an admirable situation and if i could properly describe it would do me as much honor as it did him sacre dieu exclaimed he laying his right hand hastily on his sword and then as hastily drawing it away again without drawing the sword as if checked by the recollection of my former civility sacre dieu repeated he what a thought part with thee thou dear image of my felicity part with thee even though it be to visit felicity herself did she not on the day in which i parted from her tie it with trembling fingers round my neck did she not place it upon my bosom as a pledge of my fidelity in all my wanderings    here he broke off addressing the picture in order to conceal it from my view which after fervently kissing it all over he did by putting it first within his shirt and then buttoning up his waistcoat  now you talk of pictures said amelia a little hesitatingly where have you put the cabinet  the question brought home to my own heart the anguish i had inflicted upon the barbers whom i left in a hurry to look after my cabinet  ah self self how do thou cling about us while the trifle of thy own heart is secure and circumstances are all smiling about thee how do thou sport with the playthings of all the rest of the world but if once thy own toy is in danger farewell the moments of composure every affection is in arms to defend thine atoms of property and till thou have recovered those all the acres of the earth besides are set at naught  had i not found my cabinet and in the center drawer of it the picture in the velvet case where i had again deposited it i should have laid down upon my pillow and arose from it in the morning in the sorrow of my heart  my lords anglois my fears in relation to the english jesters were but too prophetic the marks of their wit and genius were visible all along the road if providence had put it into my mind to have informed myself of their route i should certainly have avoided making it mine also thy went by the way of abbeville consequently it would have been for my interest to take the post road through lisle instead of which i ran into their track and smarted for it for as i found the stagecoach a greater evil than the forfeiture of the price of the places i took post horses and was at every stage a witness to the folly and indiscretion of my young countrymen who have contributed largely to inspire every innkeeper with unfavourable ideas of the english from calais to paris the striplings left a trace of a striplings heart wherever i stopped at hautbuisson they clapped another pair of horses to their carriage and bade the drivers consider that they were going upon business more important than life and death the consequence of this was that the master of the post expecting i was upon life and death also was much chagrined that i did not travel with an equal force of cattle and therefore gave me the most sorry steeds in his stable alleging in excuse that my lords anglois had hired all the best horses which must on their account have a days rest at boulogne i heard of an accident which might have proved to any moderate man that the most haste occasioned the least speed for in the very middle of the town and pretty near in the middle of the night the postboy in clattering along came upon the stones and put out his ancle when lo to the utter astonishment of two or three spectators whom oaths in an unknown language had summoned to their chamber windows one of our hereos for the honor of england mounted the saddledhorse and drove to the new inn at the farther end of boulogne as if he had been bred to the whip and spur from his cradle  this piece of coachmanship gave the master of the new inn so spirited an opinion of the jockey blood that galloped through the veins of the english nobility that upon my arrival at his house the day after this memorable action with a quiet pace and with only half the number of horses amelia sitting soberly by my side and the barber who was not behind in the basket as at first proposed but sometimes behind sometimes before and sometimes at the side of my carriage riding upon a bidet when the matter saw us come into his courtyard in such state and steadiness i say he certainly took us for a dutch family upon the travel and i thought upon his handing me out he looked at my mouth as if he wondered what i had done with my pipe he consulted what he took to be our constitution and imagined that he should fit us to the heart when he ordered for us some horses that appeared ten times more like hollanders than ourselves  at montreuil i discovered another mark of our english travelers for they had with great ingenuity cut several very indecent expressions in bread english or bad french on the windows with a diamond the consequence of which is that those who come after them are frequently shown into the worst rooms in the house the more especially at hotels of credit  i was informed at amiens where notwithstanding their resolution of going to paris without resting they stopped to take refreshment that although the capital of picardie was absolutely pillaged to furnish them they had some objection to every thing which the landlord could possibly set upon the table he seriously told me that even the large quantities of money which they lavished about them was not in his idea sufficient recompense for the trouble of attending to their caprices they walked for five minutes while the cloth was laying into the town of amiens which is in the springmonths truly pleasing here they took every opportunity to tell the person who attended them that although amiens was certainly the best town betwixt amiens and calais yet amiens was a worse town than they ever had the misfortune to see before they came to france they were conducted along the beautiful banks of the sum on which this town is situated and though the plains before them are luxuriantly cultivated so as to present a chequerwork of all that is either useful or ornamental and the river meanders as romantically as poesy herself could desire in the midst of the prospect set off too as it seems their prospect then was by the luster of the sun yet our prejudiced travelers told their guide with an air of superiority and indifference that to be sure the corn and verdure was well enough as was also the river sum for france but that by a comparison with the corn verdure and rivers of england they dwindled into shadows in this complaining key they went on even to the gates of paris setting up that part of their own country with which they happened to be most acquainted as the standard for every other thus the very wines and food which they affected while in england to speak of at second hand with such appetite and admiration now that they were really to be had and at a very small expense they set up as proper objects of ridicule and contempt  our burgundy and champaigne sir said the landlord to me though i present to my customers the most excellent and unadulterate the english gentlemen who were here last assured me was wretched stuff unfit to be drank by those who had still upon the tongue the ravishing relish of good old port such as they said they had drank to the tune of three bottles a man at the london tavern the day before their departure from the king of kingdoms in their opinion too sir continued the landlord my cook who has served the royal family and lived last with a prince of the blood had utterly ruined every thing upon which he had laid his hands our sauces our sallads our ragouts our fricasses and our fricandos were all wrong and notwithstanding the reputation which i imagined was given us for spreading the table i found myself to totally deficient in every particular even from the soup to the desert that all i shall for the future say upon the matter is either the french are very conceited or the english are very hard to please amongst other things resumed the landlord after a pause which distinguished the gentlemen whom you have enquired after at amiens was their singular obstinacy at the light of the holy host which made its appearance while they were walking they met the procession at the short turn of a corner so that common decency required their compliance so far at least with the custom as to make way for its going by the guide whom i sent with them whispered very respectfully the absolute necessity of this but they said they were honest protestants all the world over and should give none of the catholics the least reason to suppose they were converts to an absurd and mistaken religion firm in this resolution they rudely opposed the passage of the priests and she sacred cross for near a minute and i know not what would have been the consequence if a party of soldiers from the detachment of the kings bodyguards which are stationed here had not half by force and half by persuasion convinced them of their personal danger after the priests were gone by one of the travelers muttered to the other that those fellows in their white robes and formal faces ought to come under the vagabond act and be punished accordingly  while the french landlord was yet speaking he was interrupted in his narrative of english wit and humor by the arrival of a servant as he came forward as the panting messenger of a gentleman for whose life it seems all the horses in the stable would be immediately wanted  my lord anglois returning to england this alarming intelligence made that part of human nature which cators for individual enjoyment without considering the enjoyments of society bestir itself selfinterest represented the immediate necessity there was for me to secure such a number of horses as would answer my private purpose seeing that the mighty man upon the road would sweep all before him  what your heart is now suggesting is very well worth attending to and unless you set off this very hour you may stand a fair chance of performing the rest of your journey on foot said amelia  short as was this debate it was a little too long for the landlord came bowing a million pardons for the rudeness of the english noblemans servant who had it seems laid his unmerciful hands upon all the best cattle ah wretch without a conscience said mine host he has seized upon the flower of my fields and the pride of my pastures nay even thee my beloved silverlocks thou most beautiful of bidets who were wont to carry upon thy back the pleasing burden of thy mistress and of mine and who is alas gone down into the grave he has thrown an unhallowed saddle even upon thee  he shall sooner saddle me than silverlocks by the sacred god said the barber who stood near me for sooner than suffer such an outrage i will die in the cause  this asseveration which was uttered with the most violent exertions of the heart put the lads legs in such motion that he was at the stabledoor which stood across a large courtyard in a moment and his sword was drawn  heaven defend the heart of so good a creature prayed amelia i would not have any harm come to him for the world  the bidet shall neither serve thee nor thy master exclaimed a voice issuing from the stable he is too slight too slim and too delicate to bear the hard blows of such a rider as the blood upon thy spur shows thee to be this soft creature was made for gentler journeys i have heard his history he has been accustomed to pace quietly along at the pleasure of a woman thy very saddle is too much for him and therefore i say again and again that though thou were to carry off all the other horses in amiens this same silverlocks must remain at his stall which friendship has you see separated from the rest  this romantic harangue was answered first by a crack of the whip which whether directed to the sides of the barber or to those of silverlocks gave a good report immediately after which silverlocks himself came running into the courtyard with the girths loose and the bridle unbuckled as if he had stolen off in the struggle that he had very innocently occasioned the barber and his antagonist who had disarmed him soon appeared and both ran to silverlocks  silverlocks shall stay said one  silverlocks shall go said other  ah poor silverlocks what a devil of a dust thou kicked up in the courtyard said the cook peeping his nightcap out of the kitchen  oh that thy poor mistress were here silverlocks cried a fille de chamber passing along a gallery with certain conveniences in her hand  oh that an english gentleman would suffer a french landlord to be master of his own property exclaimed the landlord  ah silverlocks how art thou pulled about said amelia  silverlocks shall go  silverlocks shall stay re echoed the combatants  stay go go stay silverlocks silverlocks answered every empty tub in the yard till the response was carried to a neighboring copse which sent off the sound with still more vigorous vibrations  by this time the barber was tugging to loosen the crupper and the messenger was laboring to maintain the point of his resolution by an attempt to mount his foot was just fixed in the stirrup when lo the victorious barber who had dexterously slipped the girths to see the saddle turn completely round and lay his enemy level with the dust directly under the belly of silverlocks who as if conscious of the equity of the thing lifted up one of his fair forelegs and gave the prostrate foe such a recriminating crack upon his skull that had it not been of entire lead the business would have been done for ever  this is the picturesque attitude in which my lord anglois who now wheeled into the courtyard found them but he had been too long accustomed to these slight accidents and indeed to all horsecasualties which happen hourly in paris to be discomposed so he calmly enquired into the matter and then desired the fellow either to get up or to lie still as he thought proper as to the brute in dispute he may stay in his stable till he is summoned hence by the last trump for i brought much such an animal over with me and nothing like that i ever brought over with me am i ever disposed to take back again  this was the hearths content of the barber who led off silverlocks in high triumph all the way complimenting himself and silverlocks upon the issue of the victory silverlocks to show that he was not ungrateful whinneyed forth his satisfaction while in return for that token of sensibility the humane barber passed the palm of his hand gently over his forehead slapped silverlocks softly upon the neck and then requested i would keep my lord anglois in talk while he went round to the landlord and insisted upon first comers being first served put of his stable  this same lord anglois was in the appearance of his own dress his equipage his servants their manners and his manners exactly the reverse of the english wits whom we have lately celebrated that is exactly what a french gentleman of real taste and fashion would despise as the utter reverse of themselves he made his appearance in the yard of the post house in a vast blue traveling cloak ornamented by a abroad border of gold tape a pair of scarlet stuff breeches covered his thighs and a pair of enormous boots concealed a couple of legs which if they bore any analogy to the meagre flesh that just skinned over his face might have been lodged in apartments by no means so spacious a thing which was made of light brown felt whose brims were prodigious was substituted in the place of a black british hat and its form instead of being angular was conical like a sugar loaf twisted likewise into numberless ridges all of which glittered in the gaudiness of edging a couteau de chase of dreadful size well studded with silver glittered at his side and his hair though nature had not allowed him any redundance of it was by the art of the frisseur supplied by a weight of powder and pomatum which gloriously contrasted the lightness of the head on which the hair grew add to which his locks were tortured into ten curls on a side rising tier above tier over his ears he exhibited himself in a french cabriolet glaringly gilt the inside of which was crowded with flashes of cordials curiously sorted while the outside was no doubt loaded with that part of french frippery which polite frenchmen hold in utter contempt  this precious fellow begun at his first abroad to show off he said he must just swallow a morsel a la francoise and then set out toward the detestable dale london where upon account of the mal a propos exit of a cursed dropsical uncle he should be obliged to put on a funeral face till the fellow was under ground and during the course of this dismal week the drudgery of which is worth all the fortune he has bequeathed me i shall be condemned said he to pass my time in abominable england where there is not one single thing to eat or to drink but what is most exceedingly gothic  prithee landlord continued our man of travel get me some frogs or snails or a fricassee of any other delicacy in thy house i have met with every thing charming all the way from montpelier except that at one stage a fellow was fool enough to insult me with an idea of my being a vulgar englishman and so upon that infamous presumption had the impudence to suffocate the more delicate organs with the sight and smell of filthy solids and i verily believe had i not instantly waved my white handkerchief in utter horror that the vile roast beef might be removed i must have sunk to earth under the immensity of the joint  the good fare at canterbury came across me and i lifted up my hands in silent astonishment  here is a hero for you whispered amelia  hush said i it is the custom of our countrymen upon their return from travel  the vanity of the landlord however was so much tickled at our heros compliments upon france that he quite forgot the insult offered to the favorite bidet and pranced away with a scrape and a bow to show my lord anglois the best room in the hotel  i shall match thee for this cried the indefatigable barber as he returned disappointed from the stable out of which he could only get two miserablymeagre steeds whose society would have been renounced by quixotes rosinante i will match thee for this said the barber and skipped out of the courtyard into which in a very little time he came again with ablebodied horses ready harnessed and which he himself helped to put to our carriage as if disdaining to be served by the landlord who was full in deep discourse with our anglofrenchman and after we were gone i do not doubt but the conversation ended so totally to the honor of france that we had not in england either a church or a tower or a town or a street a hill or a valley a hat or a wig a cat or a dog a monkey or a man fit to be looked at  i perceive said amelia as we were running smoothly upon the level of a green sward that invited us to enjoy a moments serenity from the concussions of the pavement i perceive that there is a very material difference in the sentiments of comers and goers when an englishman first comes into this country he is prejudiced so egregiously by his old habits that nothing french can get a good word out of him and when the same traveller is upon his return after a weeks or a months staring at the worst part of france he has imbibed so thorough a detestation for every thing english that it is impossible for any thing in britain to please him so that if a man would choose to contrast his own character without being indebted to any second person he ought by all means to make a tour to paris for very soon after he gets there he will be the reverse of what he was at the time he left london  the impartial traveller these remarks were a source of entertaining consideration till we got even to chantilly and at the hotel in that town we were repeating the last sentence within earshot of a person who was sitting at the window of the room into which we were conducted while the fresh horses were putting to under the inspection of the barber who was by this time my faithful and affectionate attendant though in consideration that he was a lover and upon a journey to his mistress i treated him with more deference than is thought generally due to a domestic  i see no reason for that madam said the stranger bowing very courteously to amelia i do not conceive it is at all necessary for a man to be inconsistent with himself or to make himself absurd by ridiculous innovations though he were to make the tour of europe instead of that of france and i think you bear a little too hard upon your countrymen in the supposition with respect to the girls and boys who for mere fashions sake export and import themselves to and from the continent those i reckon as a set of unestablished characters which have neither weight or influence in any country they go abroad with the same design that they go to church  merely to be seen and they come home again after having looked at the world not orderly nor correctly but wildly and as a miscellany in miserable confusion but from the conduct or the sentiments of children most of which are sent off to be out of harms way though by the bye they are in fact the more in it who will presume to draw any certain characteristics of the nation from which they came depend on it madam such vagrants such wanderers over the face of the earth are as contemptible in foreign climes as they are in their own the credit of shooting with a long bow follows them closely they tell tales of england and its customs to foreigners which are believed just as much as their tales of france and italy are believed by those whom they would delude in england such frippery however determines nothing but i presume it is not very unusual for an englishman to travel to a wiser and more rational purpose for my own part madam if in the instance of an individual you will allow a defense of my countymen i am now about to return to the place of my nativity after having traversed the greater parts of the continent twice over i went once for health and once for observation both my wishes have been gratified i entered france without prejudice and without prejudice or a single with to continue here longer i am preparing to cross the water i have made it part of my amusement to state as it were the balance of the two nations and by assistance of notes and memorandums which i have been at the pains to set down on most occasions i find matters exceedingly upon a level we have circumstance of beauty and benefit in particular parts of france which are not to be found in england on the other hand we have in england many things which appear to us more delightful than they are to be seen in france advantage is poised by advantage amusement by amusement elegance by elegance  it is worth while however to visit both countries since if we carry in our bosoms a liberal heart we cannot fail to be richly rewarded for the excursion and it is impossible for a candid man to be a single month in either without seeing and feeling positive proofs that the stories which vulgarly prevail have no foundation but in fancy and falsehood i was told at my leaving london madam that a brave englishman could at any time beat three frenchmen that the french were as notorious for insincerity as the english for plaindealing that the king of france having all his subjects and their property at command tugged at the tight cord of authority till subject and property were both insecure that in france we should look around us in vain for that voluptuous verdure which covers the meads of britain that the french were in general meagre of visage and miserably low of stature that their very soldiers when compared to ours were lilliputians in regimentals that the noblesse of france shut out the peasants from the comforts of society and that the peasants themselves though condemned all the day to cultivate an ungrateful soil had too little flesh upon their bones to enjoy the evening like an english labourer all these vulgar errors i say madam were infused into me i never gave them credit for i always believed them to be what i found them  misrepresentations i have seen one brave frenchman soundly thrash one brave englishman who fought upon the presumption of his subduing three and the plain truth is that man opposed to man in both countries are nearly equal true it is that the sovereign of this country has almost unlimited power but on the stricted enquiry you will find that although he is in the prime of his youth when power is apt to be most wanton there is not yet upon record one single cruelty or severity or inequity to stain the present purity of the royal ermine and what adds not a little to his luster his throne has not been spotted by one drop of hostile blood for he is at peace with all men with respect to verdure i presume you have been a delighted witness that the vegetation of france presents a prospect of luxury not inferior to the most fertile parts of england with respect to bodily endowments the farther you travel into the kingdom the more readily will you allow that the french are by no means undersized but a grateful wellformed set of people rather inclining contrary to the common opinion to height and bulkiness than to diminutiveness and to thinness upon the whole the inhabitants of both countries have equal reason to imagine that the providence under which they are governed is just and equal with such an idea i hope you madam will now set off for the capital of france where you will meet with a thousand things to entertain you and i hope you will likewise pardon the freedom of these sentiments which your own observations brought upon you i admire france madam but i love england to the one i pay only a visit but the other as the song says is my home  the sensible stranger bowed and a smile full of acknowledgment from amelia showed him that all was as it ought to be in her heart  if therefore one improper sensation lurked behind in despite of former efforts it was now done away  the gallant garhon of the fair felicity whose history will hereafter become more interesting announced to us that the horses were ready we jointly wished the impartial and unprejudiced traveller a happy journey and after an agreeable ride through the villages of luzarche ecouen and saint dennis we paid our extra livres for the post royal and entered without prejudice the gates of the city  the heart concludes the second volume the heart has now traveled at its leisure from london to paris and here it is beating at the pleasing recollection of a delightful journey in the hotel de york which is situated in the rue jacob it is the business of memory to represent faithfully the images which are past and i was preparing to retrace every thing i had seen in the course of my journey step by step in order to draw from the whole survey the concluding sentiments of the heart when the cherub philanthropy who spoke from the lips of amelia perceived my design and laying her finger upon my bosom to command attention spoke as follows  we have now left behind us the capital of england more than two hundred miles we have traversed a fruitful and excellent country we have met hospitality on the way sometimes we have met imposition but for that we are indebted to the folly of our own countrymen we have brought our excursion to a temporary period we are in the capital of france here we shall pause at least till we have gratified our curiosity by a view of all that is fair and captivating in a new city in the mean time surely the heart may be allowed to yield to the sentiments which it adduces from a recapitulation of the whole matter having reached the metropolis it seems to be the proper crisis for us to setttle our opinions upon the nation so far as we are able will you permit for once a womans heart to speak upon this subject will you permit her to wish that two countries which are such near neighbors might very long continue tender friends from such an alliance maintained on both sides with reciprocated integrity every thing that is useful and beautiful must be inevitable ah what a delightful assemblage of blessings have i now kindled in my fancy upon this occasion methinks i see the fair form of peace breathing her wishes in the most animating eloquence of language  too long she says infinitely too long has the demon of battle inspired rival kings with an avarice of conquest and in the din of war there is no leisure to reflect that every conquest must be procured at the price of general devastation if on one side the victor returns loaded with spoils and laurels into the arms of an expecting wife the other side presents a picture of anguish from which victory itself might turn weeping away a train of little children are without a father and she who was yesterday exulting in the hope that she is still a wife finds to day that she is a defenseless widow a widow too over whose wounds the opposite party are rejoicing how richly cultivated are the lands of britain and of france but how soon might the ambition of victory dispoil them of every beauty and of every fertility the smiling robe of verdure with which spring covers the earth the blossom which sheds perfume over every valley and the forests which afford a shade to the shepherd and to the philosopher with every other scene that is now waving in the voluptuousness of summer plenty might ere they were gilded by the beams of tomorrows sun be utterly extirpated the rapacious genius of battle attended by his horrid instruments of human carnage inverts every joy and every elegance of nature cast an eye over the foodful earth observe what large tracts of pregnant territory are ripening for the sickle alas they might all yield suddenly to the sword of an insatiate conqueror admit into the sweet scene which you are contemplating the various streams that take their silver circuit through the valleys a thousand flocks the property of a thousand swains are cropping the living herbs that embroider the sides of them the harvest is expected and all is holiday in the heart of the husbandman whether he is master of his acres in the country of england or in that of france methinks i see east of these just mounted upon the summit of two hills situated the one on this the other on that side the water in order to gladden their hopes of the coming plenty the affections of nature are not circumscribed her operations are unifrm and universal these labourious servants of the soil have both the same wishes their cheeks are flushed with equal expectation their hearts pant with equal ardour the golden prospect on either hand enters into the very soul trusting in the mercy of one common father whose blessed beam of maturating favor is proportioned to the necessities of universal vegetation they have neither of them the weight of a single fear upon their bosoms the one protected by a generous young king and by the laws of his country not less protective rejoices that he was born a briton the other protected by a young monarch whose heart is humanized to every virtue that can add luster to his dignity though all the laws even to the law of life are in his hand rejoices that he is a native of france  both are happy and philanthropy breathes forth a fervent prayer that they as well as all the millions on either side of the shore who are now happy upon the same principle may long continue so  and were i as powerful as one of those monarchs i should join in this supplication amelia said i interrupting her you have made philanthropy talk like herself never was there drawn more delightful pictures from the prospects we have seen in our journey here stop my dear traveller  we are here in one of the most bustling hotels in paris though we are three stories from the street the clatter of the city and the confusion of the busy and merry world is heard plainly go not a single sentence farther for if you were to cast but a single glance either above below or on any side the tide of your eloquence which has hitherto run clear as your own complexion would be in some measure or stained or mixed or obstructed it is the place the page the leaf the line the letter in the world to bring the travels of the heart so far as they relate to a journey from westminster bridge to the pont neuf to a conclusion  we will leave the sentiments of amelias philanthropy to operate kindly upon the generous reader and when the pen is taken up again upon this subject his heart shall be invited to scenes which will be drawn from human nature as she exhibits herself in paris  finis
