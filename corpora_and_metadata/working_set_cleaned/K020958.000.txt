country out by giving it a name acquires no doubt a gospel title though the people there the pious christian thinks not worth his care bar this pretense and into air is hurled the claim of europe to the western world cast by a tempest on the savage coast some roving buccaneer set up a post a beam in proper form transversely laid of his redeemers cross the figure made of that redeemer with whose laws his life from first to last had been one scene of strife his royal masters name thereon engraved without more process the whole race enslaved cut off that charter they from nature drew and made them slaves to men they never knew search ancient histories consult records under this title the most christian lords hold thanks to conscience more than half the ball oerthrow this title they have none at all for never yet might any monarch dare who lived to truth and breathed a christian air pretend that christ who came we all agree to bless his people and to set them free to make a convert ever one law gave by which converters made him first a slave spite of the glosses of a canting priest who talks of charity but means a feast who recommends it whilst he seems to feel the holy glowings of a real zeal to all his hearers as a deed of worth to give them heaven whom they have robbed of earth never shall one one truly honest man who blessed with liberty reveres her plan allow one moment that a savage sire could from his wretched race for childish hire by a wild grant their all their freedom pass and sell his country for a bit of glass or grant this barbarous right let spain and france in slavery bred as purchasers advance let them whilst conscience is at distance hurled with some gay bawble buy a golden world an englishman in charterd freedom born shall spurn the slavish merchandise shall scorn to take from others through base private views what he himself would rather die than lose happy the savage of those early times ere europes sons were known and europes crimes gold cursed gold slept in the womb of earth unfelt its mischiefs as unknown its worth in full content he found the truest wealth in toil he found diversion food and health strange to the ease and luxury of courts his sports were labors and his labors sports his youth was hardy and his old age green lifes morn was vigorous and her eve serene no rules he held but what were made for use no arts he learned nor ills which arts produce false lights he followed but believed them true he knew not much but lived to what he knew happy thrice happy now the savage race since europe took their gold and gave them grace pastors she sends to help them in their need some who cannot write with others who cannot read and on sure grounds the gospel pile to rear sends missionary felons every year our vices with more zeal than holy prayers she teaches them and in return takes theirs her rank oppressions give them cause to rise her want of prudence means and arms supplies whilst her brave rage not satisfied with life rising in blood adopts the scalpingknife knowledge she gives enough to make them know how abject is their state how deep their woe the worth of freedom strongly she explains whilst she bows down and loads their necks with chains faith too she plants for her own ends impressed to make them bear the worst and hope the best and whilst she teaches on vile intrests plan as laws of god the wild decrees of man like pharisers of whom the scriptures tell she makes them ten times more the sons of hell but whither do these grave reflections tend are they designed for any or no end briefly but this  to prove that by no act which nature made that by no equal pact twixt man and man which might if justice heard stand good that by no benefits conferred or purchase made europe in chains can hold the sons of india and her mines of gold chance led her there in an accursed hour she saw and made the country here is by power nor drawn by virtues love from love of fame shall my rash folly controvert the claim or wish in thought that title overthrown which coincides with and involves my own europe discovered india first i found my right to gotham on the selfsame ground i first

drew their birth punctilios laid wide from pagan earth as well as those by christian made and jew those known to many and those known to few those which in whim and frolic lightly float and those which swell the slow and solemn note those which whilst reason stands in wonder by make some complexions laugh and others cry those which by some strange faculty of sound can build walls up and raze them to the ground those which can tear up forests by the roots and make brutes dance like men and men like brutes those which whilst ridicule leads up the dance make clowns of monmouth ape the fops of france those which where lady dullness with lord mayors prefides disdaining light and trifling airs hallow the feast with psalmody and those which planted in our churches to dispose and lift the mind to heaven are disgraced with what a foppish organist calls taste all from the fiddle on which every fool the pert son of dull sire discharged from school serves an apprenticeship in college ease

clouded over with fears pleased and displeased by starts in passion warm in reason weak who wrought into a storm like to the fretful bullies of the deep soon spends his rage and cries himself asleep

with eager glee and let his top go down to prate of me youth who fierce fickle insolent and vain impatient urges on to manhoods reign impatient urges on yet with a cast of dear regard looks back on childhood past in the midchase when the hot blood runs high and the quick spirits mount into his eye when pleasure which he deems his greatest wealth beats in his heart and paints his cheeks with health when the chafed steed tugs proudly at the rein and ere he starts has run over half the plain when winged with fear the stag flies full in view and in full cry the eager hounds pursue shall shout my praise to hills which shout again and even the huntsman stop to cry amen manhood of form erect who would not bow though worlds should crack around him on his brow wisdom serene to passion

to charm her god adorns his favorite bowers which brides by the plain hand of neatness dressed unenvied rival wear upon their breast sweet as the incense of the morn and chaste as the pure zone which circles dians waist all flowers of various names and various forms which the sun into strength and beauty warms from the dwarf daisy which like infants clings and fears to leave the earth from whence

crawling over the hallowed cell where some old hermits wont his beads to tell by day by night the myrtle evergreen beneath whose shade love holds his rites unseen the willow weeping over the fatal wave where many a lover finds a watery grave the cypress sacred held when lovers mourn their true love snatched away the laurel worn by poets in old time but destined now in grief to wither on a

winds which rise with healing on their wings before whose cleansing breath contagion flies the sun who traveling in eastern skies fresh full of strength just risen from his bed though in joves pastures they were born and bred with voice and whip can scarce make his steeds stir step by step up the perpendicular who at the hour of eve panting for rest rolls on amain and gallops down the west as fast as jehu oild for ahabs sin drove for a crown or postboys for an inn the moon who holds over night her silver reign regent of tides and mistress of the brain who to her sons those sons who own her power and do her homage at the midnight hour gives madness as a blessing but dispenses wisdom to fools and damns them with their senses the stars who by i know not what strange right preside over

turn appear moments and minutes which without a crime cannot be omitted in accounts of time or if omitted proof we might afford worthy by parliaments to be restored the hours which dressed by turns in black and white ordained as handmaids wait on day and night the day those hours i mean when light presides and business in a cart with prudence rides the night those hours i mean with darkness hung when sense speaks free and folly holds her tongue the morn when nature rousing from her strife with deathlike sleep awakes to second life the eve when as unequal to the task she mercy from her foe descends to ask the week in which six days are kindly given to think of earth and one to think of heaven the months twelve sisters all of different hue though there appears in all a likeness too not such a likeness as through haymans works dull mannerist in christians jews and turks cloys with a sameness in each female face but a strange something born of art and grace which speaks them all to

gawze for which our daughters leave the fig more modest first brought up by eve panting for breath enflamed with lustful fires yet wanting strength to perfect her desires leaning on sloth who fainting with the heat stops at each step and slumbers on his feet autumn when nature who with sorrow feels her dread foe winter treading on her heels makes up in value what she wants in length exerts her powers and puts forth all her strength bids corn and fruits in full perfection rise corn fairly taxed and fruits without excise winter benumbed with cold no longer known by robes of fur since furs became our own a hag who loathing all by all is loathed with weekly daily hourly libels clothed vile faction at her heels who mighty grown would rule the ruler and foreclose the throne would turn all

present labors deem or judge at random of so high a theme high is our theme and worthy are the men to feel the sharpest stroke of satires pen but when kind time a proper season brings in serious mood to treat of serious things then shall they find disdaining idle play that i can be as grave and dull as they thus far in sport  nor let half patriots those who shrink from every blast of power which blows who with tame cowardice familiar grown would hear my thoughts but fear to speak their own who lest bold truths to do sage prudence spite should burst the portals of their lips by night tremble to trust themselves one hour in sleep condemn our course and hold our caution cheap when brave occasion bids for some great end when honor calls the poet as a friend then shall they find that even on dangers brink he dares to speak what they scarce dare to think end of the first book
