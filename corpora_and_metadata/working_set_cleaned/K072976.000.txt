don quixote in england a comedy as it is acted at the new theater in the haymarket  by henry fielding esquire   facile quis speret idem sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem  hor london printed for j watts at the printingoffice in wildcourt near lincolns end fields mdccxxxiv price one shilling and six pence  to the right honorable philip earl of chesterfield knight of the most noble order of the garter my lord however unworthy these scenes may be of your lordships protection the design with which some of them were written cannot fail of recommending them to one who has so gloriously distinguished himself in the cause of liberty to which the corruption i have here endeavored to expose may one day be a very fatal enemy  the freedom of the stage is perhaps as well worth contending for as that of the press it is the opinion of an author well known to your lordship that examples work quicker and stronger on the minds of men than precepts  this will i believe my lord be found truer with regard to politics than to ethics the most ridiculous exhibitions of luxury or avarice may likely have little effect on the sensualist or the miser but i fansy a lively representation of the calamities brought on a country by general corruption might have a very sensible and useful effect on the spectators  socrates who owed his destruction greatly to the contempt brought on him by the comedies of aristophanes is a lasting instance of the force of theatrical ridicule here indeed this weapon was used to an ill purpose but surely what is able to bring wisdom and virtue into disrepute will with great facility lay their opposites under a general contempt there are among us who seem so sensible of the danger of wit and humor that they are resolved to have nothing to do with them and indeed they are in the right on it for wit like hunger will be with great difficulty restrained from falling on where there is great plenty and variety of food  but while the powerful sons of dullness shed all their influence on their inferior brethren be you my lord who are the most favorite offspring of the british muses the patron of their younger children whom your lordship has as much reason to love as others to fear for you must have seen that to be celebrated by them and applauded by the more discerning and worthy are the only rewards which true patriotism a word scandalously ridiculed by some can securely expect and here i am pleading the cause of others for the only title i have to enrol my self in the number of those i have recommended to your favor is by being with the most perfect admiration and respect  my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant henry fielding  preface this comedy was begun at leyden in the year      and after it had been sketched out into a few loose scenes was thrown by and for a long while no more thought of it was originally writ for my private amusement as it would indeed have been little less than quixotism itself to hope any other fruits from attempting characters wherein the inimitable cervantes so far excelled the impossibility of going beyond and the extreme difficulty of keeping pace with him were sufficient to infuse despair into a very adventurous author  i soon discovered too that my too small experience in and little knowledge of the world had led me into an error i soon found it infinitely more difficult than i imagined to vary the scene and give my knight an opportunity of displaying himself in a different manner from that wherein he appears in the romance human nature is every where the same and the modes and habits of particular nations do not change it enough sufficiently to distinguish a quixore in england from a quixote in spain  in these sentiments mr booth and mr cibber concurred with me who upon seeing the aforesaid sketch both dissuaded me from suffering it to be represented on the stage and accordingly it was remanded back to my shelf where probably it would have perished in oblivion had not the solicitations of the distressed actors in drury lane prevailed on me to revise it at the same time that it came into my head to add those scenes concerning our elections  being thus altered it was often rehearsed on that theater and a particular day appointed for its action but the giant cajanus of a race who were always enemies to our poor don deferred his appearance so long that the intervention of the actors benefits would have put it off till the next season had i not brought it on where now it appears  i have troubled the reader thus long to account for this comedys appearing as it now does and that he might distinguish those parts of it which were the production of this season from those which were written in my more juvenile years and before

scene an inn in a country borough introduction manager author manager no prologue sir the audience will never bear it they will not bate you any thing of their due   auth i am the audiences very humble servant but they cannot make a man write a prologue whether he can or no   man why sir there is nothing easier i have known an author bring three or four to the house with one play and give us our choice which we would speak   auth yes sir and i have now three in my pocket written by friends of which i choose none should be spoke   man how so   auth because they have been all spoke already twenty times over   man let me see them pray   auth they are written in such damned cramp hands you will never be able to read them but i will tell you the substance of them one of them begins with abusing the writings of all my cotemporaries lamenting the fallen state of the stage and lastly assuring the audience that this play was written with a design to restore true taste and their approving it is the best symptom they can give of their having any   man well and a very good scheme   auth may be so but it has been the subject of almost every prologue for these ten years last past the second is in a different cast the first twelve lines inveigh against all indecency on the stage and the last twenty lines show you what it is   man that would do better for an epilogue but what is the third   auth why the third has some wit in it and would have done very well but for a mistake   man ay what mistake   auth why the author never read my play and taking it for a regular comedy of five acts has fallen very severely on farce however it is a pretty good one and will do very well for the first genteel comedy you bring on the stage   man but dont you think a play with so odd a title as yours requires to be a little explained may they not be too much surprised at some things   auth not at all the audience i believe are all acquainted with the character of don quixote and sancho i have brought them over into england and introduced them at an inn in the country where i believe no one will be surprised that the knight finds several people as mad as himself this i could have told them in forty dull lines if i would but i rather chose to let it alone for to tell you the truth i can draw but one conclusion from the prologues i have ever seen that the authors are so sensible of the demerits of their plays that they desire to set the audience asleep before they begin but of what real use is a bill of fare to any entertainment where the guests are not left to their choice what part they will pick at but are obliged to swallow the whole indifferently   enter a player play sir the audience make such a noise with their canes that if we dont begin immediately they will beat the house down before the play begins and it is not advisable to put them out of humor for there are two or three of the loudest catcalls in the gallery that ever were heard   auth be not frightened at that those are only some particular friends of mine who are to put on the face of enemies at first and be converted at the end of the first act   man order then to play away the overture immediately come sir what do you do with yourself   auth i shall dispose my self in some part of the house where i shall see and not be seen and i can assure you sir if the audience are but half as well entertained with this play as i shall be my self it will go off with universal applause   don quixote in england act i scene i scene an inn guzzle sancho guzzle never tell me sir of don quixote or don beelzebub here is a man comes into my house and eats me out on it and then tells me he is a knight errant he is an arrant rogue and if he does not pay me my bill i will have a warrant for him   san my master fears no warrant friend had you ever been in spain you would have known that men of his order are above the law   guz tell not me of spain sir i am an englishman where no one is above the law and if your master does not pay me i shall lay his spaniardship fast in a place which he shall find it as difficult to get out of as your countrymen have found it to get into gibraltar   san that is neither here nor there as the old saying is many are shut into one place and out of another men bar houses to keep rogues out and jails to keep them in he that is hanged for stealing a horse today has no reason to buy oats for him tomorrow   guz sirrah your horse nor your ass neither shall have any more oats at my expense never were masters and their beasts so like one another the don is just such another lean ramscallion as his  what do you call him  his rozinante and thou art just such another squat bag of guts as thy dapple send my house and my stable once well emptied of you and if ever i suffer a spaniard to enter my doors again may i have a whole company of soldiers quartered on me for if i must be eaten up i had rather suffer by my own country rogues than foreign ones   air i  san rogues there are of each nation except among the divines and vinegar since the creation has still been made of all wines against one lawyer lurch a county scarce can guard one parson does for a church one doctor for a churchyard    scene ii don quixote sancho quix sancho   san ant please your honor    quix come hither sancho i smell an adventure   san and so do i ant please your worship the landlord of the house swears bitterly that he will have a warrant against us   quix what landlord what house will thou never be in thy senses are we not in a castle   san no marry are we not but we are in a fair way to be in one   quix what do thou mean oaf   san i mean that i shall see your honor in a goal within these two days   quix me in a goal ha caitif   san ay sir we are got into a terrible country a mans quality here cannot defend him if he breaks the laws   quix then indeed knighterrantry were of no use but i tell thee caitif goals in all countries are only habitations for the poor not for men of quality if a poor fellow robs a man of fashion of five shillings to goal with him but the man of fashion may plunder a thousand poor and stay in his own house but know thou base squire of the great don quixote de la mancha that an adventure now presents it self not only worthy me but the united force of all the knights upon earth   san ah poor sancho there is an end of thee a leg or an arm will not suffice this bout   quix there is now arrived in this castle one of the most accursed giants that ever infested the earth he marches at the head of his army that howl like turks in an engagement   san oh lud oh lud this is the country squire at the head of his pack of dogs   quix what do thou mutter varlet   san why sir this giant that your worship talks of is a country gentleman who is going a courting and his army is neither more nor less than his kennel of foxhounds   quix oh the prodigious force of enchantment sirrah i tell thee this is the giant toglogmoglogog lord of the island of gogmogog whose belly has been the tomb of above a thousand strong men   san of above a thousand hogsheads of strong beer i believe   quix this must be the inchanter merlin i know him by his dogs but thou idiot do thou imagine that women are to be hunted like hares that a man would carry his hounds with him to visit his mistress   san sir your true english squire and his hounds are as inseparable as your spanish and his toledo he eats with his hounds drinks with his hounds and lies with his hounds your true errant english squire is but the first dogboy in his house   quix it is pity then that fortune should contradict the order of nature it was a wise institution of plato to educate children according to their minds not to their births these squires should sow that corn which they ride over sancho when i see a gentleman in his own coachbox i regret the loss which some one has had of a coachman the man who toils all day after a partridge or a pheasant might serve his country by toiling after a plough and when i see a low mean tricking lord i lament the loss of an excellent attorney singing within but hark some courteous lady in the castle prepares an entertainment for my ears   air ii tweed side  oh think not the maid whom you scorn with riches delighted can be had i a great princess been born my billy had dear been to me in grandeur and wealth we find woe in love there is nothing but charms on others your treasures bestow give billy alone to these arms in title and wealth what is lost in tenderness often is repaid too much a great fortune may cost well purchased may be the poor maid let golds empty show cheat the great we more real pleasures will prove while they in their palaces hate we in our poor cottage will love   scene iii don quixote guzzle

you are i see the generous confusion which spreads your face   guz i am so poor ant please your honor that it will be quite charity in you it is the same as if you gave it me   quix my lord i am more confused than you but do not think it a gift since i see you so backward to receive it in that light and since my lord every thing i have saving to the charming dulcinea del toboso her fixed and unalterable right be justly yours give me leave to call it a debt my lord sancho pay his lordship a thousand english guineas   san if your worship will please to tell me where i shall get them but there is no paying with an empty hand where nothing is nothing can come on it twelve lawyers make not one honest man   quix cease thy impertinence and pay the money immediately   san if i have seen the color of gold this fortnight may i never see teresa pancha again   quix i am confounded my lord at the extravagance of my squire who out of the spoils of so many giants he has plundered should not have reserved enough to oblige your lordship with such a trifle but if you know any one who will disemburse that sum or any other i will sell him the reversion of the next island i conquer   guz do you make a jest of me sir   quix be not incensed i am sorry i am not able to give it you   guz sorry forsooth a pretty way of paying debts truly i fansy if i was to tell the exciseman and my brewer i

blanket   quix sancho come hither i intend to make thee my ambassador   san why truly sir that is a post i should like hugeously well your bassadours lead rare fat lives they say and i should make a very good bassadour i can assure your worship   quix thou shall go my ambassador to the court of dulcinea del toboso   san i suppose it is equal to your worship what court you send me to and to say the truth i had rather go to some other for though my lady dulcinea be a very good woman yet she has got such a waundy trick of being chanted and i fansy your bassadours fare but ill at your chanted courts   quix reptile reply not on thy life but go and prepare thy self for thy journey then come to me and receive farther instructions for thou shall set out this very evening  but ha the charming

attendants all her plate and jewels which thou have robbed her of   guz hear this neighbors i am accused of stealing plates and jewels when every body knows i have but five dozen of plates and those i

pleasant adventure of the knight of the woeful figure   jez do you think madam this is the very same don  what do you call him whom your father saw in spain and of whom he has told us such pure pleasant stories   dor the same it can be no other oh jezebel i wish my adventure may end as happily as those of my namesake dorotheas did i am sure they are very near as romantic but have not i reason to blame fairlove for suffering me to be here before him the lover that does not outfly his mistresss desires is slow indeed   jez and let me tell you madam he must be very swift who does  air iv  dor oh hasten my lover dear cupid wing hither the youth i admire the wretch is too lazy and stupid who leaves me but time to desire let prudes who leave lovers in anguish themselves in their fonder fits stay but leave not the virgin to languish who meets her true lover half way    well i am a mad girl dont you think this husband of mine that is to be will have a delightful task to tame me

what is it to you what we are saucebox   dor peace dear jezebel  this must be the illustrious sancho himself  i am the princess indoccalambria   san my master the knight of the woeful figure and a woeful figure he makes sure enough sends your ladyship his humble service and hopes you will not take it amiss that he has not been able to knock all the people in the house on the head however he has made it pretty well up in breaking the windows your ladyship will lie pure and cool for the devil a whole pane is there in all your apartment if the glazier had hired him he could not have done better   dor thou mighty squire of the most mighty knight upon earth give my grateful thanks to your master for what he has undertaken upon my account but tell him not to get his precious bones bruised any more for i am sufficiently assured this adventure is reserved for some other knight   san nay nay like enough all men cannot do all things one man gets an estate by what another gets a halter all is not fish that swims many a man wants a wife but more want to get rid of one two cuckolds see each others horns when neither of them can see his own money is the fruit of evil as often as the root of

ladyship would speak a good word for me   dor name it and be assured of any thing in my power honest sancho   san if your princessship could but prevail on my master that i might not be sent home after my lady dulcinea for to tell you the truth madam i am so fond of the english roast beef and strong beer that i dont intend ever to set my foot in spain again if i can help it give me a slice of roast beef before all the rarities of camachos wedding   dor bravely said noble squire   air v the kings old courtier  when mighty roast beef was the englishmans food it enobled our hearts and enriched our blood our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good oh the roast beef of old england and old englands roast beef then britons from all nice dainties refrain which effeminate italy france and spain and mighty roast beef shall command on the main oh the roast beef etc  san oh the roast beef etc    dor i have been told noble squire that you once imposed a certain lady for dulcinea on your master now what think you if this young lady here should personate that incomparable princess   jez who i   san adod your princessship has hit it for he has never seen this dulcinea nor has any body else that i can hear of and who my lady dulcinea should be i dont know unless she be one of your chanted ladies the curate of our parish and mr nicholas the barber have often told me there was no such woman and that my master was a madman and sometimes i am half at a loss to guess whether he be mad or no i am sure if it was not for the sake of a little island that i am to govern i should not have followed his errantries so long   dor fie do not entertain such unworthy thoughts of that most glorious knight   san nay madam i cannot find in my heart to think him mad neither for he will talk sometimes twould do one good to hear him talk he will talk ye three hours and i shall not understand one word he says our curate was a fool to even and yet he has talked what i could not understand neither but that is neither here nor there an empty purse causes a full heart an old womans a very bad bribe but a very good wife conscience often stops at a molehill and leaps over a mountain the law guards us from all evil but itself what is vice today is virtue tomorrow it is not only plumbs that make a pudding physic makes you first sick and then well wine first makes you well and then sick   jez and your proverbs would make the devil sick   dor lose no time good sancho but acquaint the most invincible knight that the lady dulcinea is in the castle well manage the matter so dexterously you shall be in no danger of a discovery   san since my bringing the last dulcinea to him i do not fear that he that can swallow a goose will hardly keck at a gander the bear may well dance when the ass plays on the fiddle   exit sancho scene vii dorothea jezebel dor ha ha ha well for the future i will never disbelieve a traveller the knight and his squire are full as ridiculous as they were described we shall have rare diversion   jez poor fairlove thou art quite forgotten   dor i have rather reason to think dorothea so i am sure when a lover suffers his mistress to come first to the place of appointment he cannot blame any innocent amusement with which she would shorten his absence and to confess a truth to you while i am still under apprehensions of the match my father intends for me i have too great cause to try to divert my grief   air vi from aberdeen to edinburgh  happy the animals who stray in freedom through the grove no laws in love they ever obey but those prescribed by love while we confined to parents rules unfortunate are told none follow loves sweet laws but fools the wise are slaves to gold   exeunt scene viii the street mr mayor and a voter may well neighbor what is your opinion of this strange man that is come to town don quixote as he calls himself   vot think why that he is a madman what should i think   may ecod it runs in my head that he is come to stand for parliament man   vot how can that be neighbor they tell me he is a spaniard   may what is that to us let him look to his qualifications when we have chose him if he cannot sit in the house that is his fault   vot nay nay he cannot be chose if he should stand for to my certain knowledge the corporation have promised sir thomas loveland and mr bouncer   may pugh all promises are conditional and let me tell you mr retail i begin to smoke a plot i begin to apprehend no opposition and then we are sold neighbor   vot no no neighbor then we shall not be sold and that is worse but rather than it should come to that i would ride all over the kingdom for a candidate and if i thought sir thomas intended to steal us in this manner he should have no vote of mine i assure you i shall vote for no man who holds the corporation cheap   may then suppose we were to go in a body and solicit sir don quixote to stand as for his being mad while he is out of bedlam it does not signify   vot but there is another objection neighbor which i am afraid the corporation will never get over   may what is that prythee   vot they say he has brought no money with him   may ay that indeed but though he has no money with him here i am assured by his servant that he has a very large estate and so if the other party come down handsomely with the ready we may trust him for you know at last we have nothing to do but not to choose him and then we may recover all he owes us   vot i do not care to be sold neighbor   may nor i neither neighbor by any but myself i think that is the privilege of a free briton   scene x guzzle mayor retail guz mr mayor a good morrow to you sir are you for a whet this morning   may with all my heart but what is become of the gentleman the traveller   guz he is laid down to sleep i believe pretty well tired with work what the devil to do with him i cannot tell   may my neighbor and i have a strange thought come into our heads you know mr guzzle we are like to have no opposition and that i believe you will feel the want of as much as any man now do you see we have taken it into consideration whether we should not ask this sir don to represent us   guz with all my heart if either of you will hang out a sign and entertain him but he is far enough in my books already   may you are too cautious master guzzle i make no doubt but he is some very rich man who pretends to be poor in order to get his election the cheaper he can have no other design in staying among us for my part i make no doubt but that he is come to stand on the court interest   guz nay nay if he stands at all it is on the court side no doubt for he talks of nothing but kings and princes and princesses and emperors and empresses   may ay ay an officer in the army too i warrant him if we knew but the bottom   guz he seems indeed to be damnably sond of free quarter   ret but if you think he intends to offer himself would it not be wiser to let him for then you know if he spends never so much we shall not be obliged to choose him   may brother alderman i have reproved you already for that way of reasoning it savours too much of bribery i like an opposition because otherwise a man may be obliged to vote against his party therefore when we invite a gentleman to stand we invite him to spend his money for the honor of his party and when both parties have spent as much as they are able every honest man will vote according to his conscience   guz mr mayor talks like a man of sense and honor and it does me good to hear him   may ay ay mr guzzle i never gave a vote contrary to my conscience i have very earnestly recommended the countryinterest to all my brethren but before that i recommended the towninterest that is the interest of this corporation and first of all i recommended to every particular man to take a particular care of himself and it is with a certain way of reasoning that he that serves me best will serve the town best and he that serves the town best will serve the country best   guz see what it is to have been at oxford the parson in the parish himself cannot outtalk him   may come landlord well have one bottle and drink success to the corporation these times come but seldom therefore we ought to make the best of them come along  exeunt the end of the first act act ii scene i scene a chamber in the inn don quixote sancho quix thou have by this time fully perceived sancho the extreme difficulties and dangers of knighterrantry   san ay and of squireerrantry too ant please your worship   quix but virtue is its own reward   san your worship may have a relish for these rewards perhaps but to speak truly i am a poor plain man and know nothing of these fine things and for any reward i have hitherto got i had much rather have gone without it as for an island i believe i could relish it as well as another but a man may catch cold while his coat is making and since you may provide for me in a much easier way if i might be so bold as to speak    quix thou know i will deny thee nothing which is fit for me to give or thee to take   san then if your worship would be so good as to set me up in an inn i should make a rare landlord and it is a very thriving trade among the english   quix and could thou descend so low ignoble wretch   san any thing to get an honest livelihood which is more than i find we are like to do in the way we are going on for if i durst speak it    quix speak fearlesly  i will only impute it to thy ignorance   san why then i find sir that we are looked on here to be neither more nor less better or worse than a couple of madmen   quix sancho i am not concerned at the evil opinion of men indeed if we consider who are their favorites we shall have no reason to be so fond of their applause virtue sancho is too bright for their eyes and they dare not behold her hypocrisy is the deity they worship is not the lawyer often called an honest man when for a sneaking fee he pleads the villains cause or attempts to extort evidence to the conviction of the innocent does not the physician live well in his neighborhood while he suffers them to bribe his ignorance to their destruction but why should i mention those whose profession it is to prey on others look through the world what is it recommends men but the poverty the vice and the misery of others this sancho they are sensible of and therefore instead of endeavoring to make himself better each man endeavors to make his neighbor worse each man rises to admiration by treading on mankind riches and power accrue to the one by the destruction of thousands these are the general objects of the good opinion of men nay and that which is professed to be paid to virtue is seldom more to any thing than a supercilious contempt of our neighbor what is a goodnatured man why one who seeing the want of his friend cries he pities him is this real no if it was he would relieve him his pity is triumphant arrogance and insult it arises from his pride not from his compassion sancho let them call me mad i am not mad enough to court their approbation   san oh good your worship proceed i could fast an hour longer to hear your discourse   scene ii guzzle don quixote sancho guz ant please your honor the mayor of the town is come to wait on you   quix give him admittance this is the chief magistrate of the place who comes i

would be an honor to the greatest of it   sir tho has he made you his advocate tell him i can prefer three thousand to one   quix the usual madness of mankind do you marry your daughter for her sake or your own if for here is sure it is something whimsical to make her miserable in order to make her happy money is a thing well worth considering in these affairs but parents always regard it too much and lovers too little no match can be happy which love and fortune do not conspire to make so the greatest addition of either illy supplies the entire absence of the other nor would millions a

repaid for all his pain  she thus the nymph whom dream affrighting with her lovers death alarms wakes with transports all delighting madly blessed when carest in his warm entwining arms    mrs guz lard bless em who could have parted them that had not a heart of oak   quix here are the fruits of knighterrantry for you this is an instance of what admirable service we are to mankind  i find some

ever taken   drench if this madman be not blooded cupped sweated blisterd vomited purged this instant he will be incurable i am well acquainted with this sort of phrenzy his next paroxysm will be six times as strong as the former   brief pshaw the man is no more mad than i am  i should be finely off if he could be proved non compos mentis it is an easy thing for a man to pretend madness ex post facto   drench pretend madness give me leave to tell you mr brief i am not to be pretended with i judge by symptoms sir   brief symptoms gad here are symptoms for you if you come to that   drench very plain symptoms of madness i think   brief very fine indeed very fine doctrine very fine indeed a mans beating of another is a proof of madness so that if a man be indicted he has nothing to do but to plead non compos mentis and he is acquitted of course so there is an end of all actions of assaults and battery at once   scene xvi sir thomas cook don quixote sancho fairlove dr drench servants

unless any immediate adventure of moment should intervene will attend you   san oh rare sancho this is brave news in faith give me your weddingadventures the devil take all the rest   drench sure sir thomas you will not take a madman home with you to your house   quix i have heard thee thon ignorant wretch throw that word in my face with patience for alas could it be proved what were it more than almost all mankind in some degrees deserve who would doubt the noisy boisterous squire who was here just now to be mad must not this noble knight here have been mad to think of marrying his daughter to such a wretch you doctor are mad too though not so mad as your patients the lawyer here is mad or he would not have gone into a scuffle when it is the business of men of his profession to set other
