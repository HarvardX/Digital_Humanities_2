cornwallis vice president and the rest of the governors and contributors to the middlesexhospital this sermon preached and published at their request is dedicated by their obedient humble servant thomas francklin  luke x v    go and do thou likewise   when we seriously consider the frail corrupt and distressful state of human nature when we reflect on the general lot and portion of mortality when we call to mind to what variety of evils we are subject to how many diseases our bodies are exposed and by how many anxieties our minds may be depressed and tormented we are naturally led to imagine that it must be the business concern and interest of every individual to lighten as much as possible the general burden that every office of tenderness and humanity to our fellow creatures would of course be duly and punctually performed by every one of us as well knowing that all the poor aid and assistance which each particular could lend would still be much too little and insignificant preservatives against the universal calamity that the most we can do is to soften the distress which we cannot prevent to sooth those sorrows which we cannot remove and to pour balm into those wounds which we cannot heal  to diffuse this spirit of love and tenderness to increase this philanthropy to make man sociable to man god the father has implanted in every breast a principle of benevolence and god the son has in his holy religion strengthened dignifyed and improved it this principle shines forth with distinguished luster in every page of the gospel of christ it is taught by his precepts and enforced by his example and there is not perhaps any part of holy writ wherein it is more visibly or more warmly inculcated than in the short and beautiful parable before us wherein the virtue of humanity toward the distressed is painted in the liveliest colors and proposed to us as an object of our applause and of our imitation also  as the following discourse therefore is intended to enforce this principle i cannot i think more surely engage your attention to it than by  first running over as briefly as possible the principal circumstances of this affecting narration  and secondly applying them to the present similar occasion  a certain man says the parable went down from jerusalem to jericho unfortunately for him his journey lay through a lonesome and melancholy desert a place as we are informed by those who were well acquainted with its situation so remarkable for the frequent murders and robberies committed there as to be called the bloody way perpetually infested by the sons of rapine and violence by some of these our unhappy traveller was beset and being unable and probably unwilling to resist was quickly overpowered by them they attacked and plundered him and not content with their spoil to their injustice added inhumanity also they stripped and wounded him and left him half dead in this miserable and distressed condition he remained we may suppose a long time expecting with impatience the arrival of some charitable traveller to assist him when at last as the sacred historian relates it there came down a certain priest that way a sight no doubt inexpressibly agreeable to a man in so dreadful a condition a person of his own religion and a teacher of it also one who besides the common ties of humanity was in a more especial manner bound by his order and profession to acts of charity and beneficence such a one he had reason to expect would have gladly embraced the opportunity of doing good and flown with pleasure to his assistance how great then must have been his grief and disappointment when the priest passed by on the other side the unfeeling man must doubtless have heard his groans and seen his distress but he purposely avoided crossing over that he might not be obliged to stop and relieve him he redoubled his speed therefore and without the least regard to the distress of an unhappy brother proceeded on his journey to add to the calamity of the poor traveller we are told that a levite likewise when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side it is impossible perhaps to read this account without making the following reflection how does every one who hears the circumstances of this melancholy relation detest such behavior and abhor such inhumanity and yet at the same time how many amongst us are guilty of it do we not almost every day and every hour meet with objects worthy of our compassion and relief and yet are we not too apt with the priest and the levite to pass by on the other side but to proceed what the disappointed traveller did not find where he had reason to hope he met with where he had no expectation of it a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him the samaritans it must here be remembered were detested by the jews as corruptors of the true religion and deserters from the true worship the traveller therefore who had already been neglected by the priest and the levite men who embraced the same religious principles as himself could not rationally expect that his avowed enemy the samaritan would take the least notice of him he was notwithstanding most agreeably deceived for the samaritan as we have seen performed every office of friendship every act of charity necessary on the occasion not content with softening his past evils and misfortunes he endeavored to provide against his future wants when he departed says the parable he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee  thus generously and beneficently did the good samaritan behave toward the truly worthy object of his compassion no wonder therefore that our blessed savior should propose this example to the young lawyer and dismiss him in the words of my text with go and do thou likewise that is  see the present bishop of londons excellent sermon on this parable vol   ser    since you commend the samaritan for acting like a neighbor to the jew do you learn to act like a neighbor to the samaritan and to every other fellow creature in distress  the maxim inculcated in the parable and which indeed seems to have been the chief scope and design of it has been often but cannot be too often repeated and enforced to us namely that no national or religious prejudices no difference of party ect or opinion no private jealousy pique or animosity should ever be suffered to diminish weaken or counteract the noble universal principles of benevolence and humanity toward each other the good samaritan we see extended his bounty and compassion to the distressed traveller without any regard to his opposite opinions he considered him not as a jew whom he as a samaritan was at enmity with but as a man and a fellow creature whom he therefore as man and fellow creature was bound to relieve  the words of the text therefore may very properly be considered as spoken with a view not only to instruct the inquisitive lawyer to whom they were immediately addressed but as written for our learning also as conveying an useful admonition to all mankind and exhorting them to the imitation of this illustrious example happy are those who have the virtue and the resolution to follow it  permit me then to apply the circumstances of the parable to the present solemn occasion  thanks be to god our own times heedless and unwary as they are cannot be condemned as insensible to the feelings of compassion or strangers to the virtues of humanity we behold with pleasure and satisfaction the spirit of mercy and tenderness diffusing itself on every side that poverty which our extravagance produces our pity relieves and we at least endeavor to heal the wounds which we have made hospitals schools and foundations rise up flourish and increase amongst us and public vice and folly is in same measure covered and extenuated by public generosity and beneficence  see dr browns estimate of the manners and principles of the times vol   p  0 a certain superficial and declamatory but fashionable writer of the present age has indeed lately endeavored though we hope in vain endeavored to make virtue ashamed and put charity out of countenance to degrade our pity into weakness and melt away our humanity and compassion into fear cowardice and effeminacy but surely waters thus sweet and salutary can never flow from so sordid and corrupt a fountain our charity i am satisfied arises from a nobler motive i would fain persuade myself and if it be an error it is at least an amiable one that it proceeds from that generous benevolent principle which distinguishes and naturally springs from the religion which we profess the religion of jesus christ the good the charitable the righteous from that beneficence which his example taught and which only his divine precepts could inspire this is the leading strong and actuating principle that directs the heart even in this otherwise degenerate age it is this which has already raised in so many the ambition to become good samaritans the ambition of using like him their liberty to release the captive their health to support the sick their abundance to relieve the indigent  and amongst all the fair copies of this noble picture industriously drawn by various hands there is not perhaps one which comes so near to the original as that charity which we are here met to countenance and recommend a charity so extensive in its nature so useful in its effects and so highly conducive to the good of the community as to deserve all the approbation we can give and all the assistance we can bestow  the almighty creator of all things has of his infinite mercy ordained that man shall not in this vale of sorrow be afflicted beyond what he is able to bear the misfortunes incident to mortality seldom press too hard and too closely upon each other and where they are permitted to accumulate power and opportunity are given to men to divide and by dividing to lessen the weight of them evils indeed which when separate may be overpowered when united become intolerable  poverty whilst she is strengthened by health can struggle with misfortune but if she is oppressed by sickness she sinks down and is unequal to the conflict sickness on the other hand whilst she is relieved and supported by the lenient hand of affluence lifts up her head and smiles on the bed of anguish but if penury enters into the chamber her wounds bleed afresh her pains increase and she drops into despair and death what praise then what admiration is due to that hand which brings a remedy for this complicated disorder behold a hand is stretched out a building is raised to receive the sick the poor and the miserable this noble charity has provided every mitigation of these dreadful evils which humanity could suggest  but this hospital opens its charitable arms to receive not only the sick but the lame also  the greater part of the poor in this metropolis it is well known live by the work of their hands they are obliged o earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brows their support and maintenance therefore must depend on the health of their bodies the unimpaired vigor and activity of their limbs and when by any unfortunate accident these are hurt or weakened they are left entirely destitute in so large and populous a city innumerable accidents must inevitably happen which no human foresight could prevent no human prudence could guard against here if assistance is not immediately given it can be of no service if the remedy is not at hand to be administered it may as well not be administered at all before the erection of this and other edifices of the same kind the poor in such distressful situations were left to perish in the streets the levite perhaps only looked at them the priest without regarding them passed by on the other side their pains were either finished by death or cruelly protracted by the ignorance of empirics who lay hold of every occasion to try wanton experiments on the poor and play with the lives of their fellow creatures how noble then how necessary and how beneficial is the institution which can prevent such evils relieve such distress and soften such calamities  when the good samaritan saw the poor traveller lame wounded and stripped he did not before he relieved him ask what sect nation or profession he was of pharisee or sadducee jew or samaritan but flew immediately to his assistance to the honor of the middlesex hospital be it remembered that the example before us has in this particular been closely copyed by it the generality of patients are not admitted into this place without letters of recommendation that so the merit and condition of the object to be relieved may be more fully and thoroughly known a precaution highly proper and commendable but at the same time all accidents are admitted without recommendation in these circumstances no recommendation indeed is necessary but what the afflicted carry with them at such a time but to look up for releif is to demand it of us and but to want assistance is to deserve it  but the chief pride and glory of this extensive charity is still behind and that is the relief which this hospital bestows on the weaker and more helpless sex when they are most weak and unable to help themselves when the snares of death compass them round about and the pains of hell get hold upon them need i represent to you that in this dangerous and distressful hour all the assistances all the conveniences all the superfluities of affluence united are frequently found insufficient the powers of medicine are too often ineffectual the resources of human art the improvements of human knowledge are all too weak to relieve the pangs and stop the agonies of nature at this perilous time all the tenderness of officious friendship and all the endearments of love and affection are required to soften the distress and mitigate the pains of the afflicted sufferer what then must their condition be who at such an hour have no home to receive no friends to cherish no remedies near to assist or support them in behalf of such objects i need not i am sure address myself to the softer sex there is an advocate i know within your own breasts that will make all i can say superfluous nature that best of orators will plead the cause of your afflicted sisters with irresistible eloquence she will point out to you your duty and direct you in the practice of it if you are women if you are mothers if you are christians i need not ask your aid protection and support  having thus enumerated the many benefits and advantages of this extensive charity and dwelt with pleasure on the several branches of it permit me to draw these rays into a point and show you this benignant sun in all its heat and luster permit me to lead your imaginations to a scene which your own eyes may at any time see in reality  behold a groupe of sordid and miserable beings their faces pale with sickness their bodies emaciated by distemper their hearts depressed by sorrow and despair observe some of them so weak and disabled as to want the power of reaching to the hand that is stretched out to relieve them behold others with limbs broken and distorted deprived of life and motion and with the eye of anguish looking up for immediate assistance behind them advances a drooping train of mournful females oppressed at once by the throes of travail and the weight of penury and laboring with all their sexs imbecility under a double burden alas nature shrinks humanity shudders at the prospect but see the clouds divide a dawn of comfort appears to dispel the gloom and beautify the horizon observe the fair companion of faith and hope sweet charity approaching toward them she lifts them up with benignant hand and conducts them to her beloved asylum pass but a little time and mark what succeeds to the first melancholy scene behold the same objects that entered into the palace of charity now returning from it observe the sudden the astonishing change the face of the sick is lighted up with smiles the roses of health bloom upon his cheek the warmth of gratitude glows upon his countenance the luster of joy sparkles in his eye behold the lame man once more rejoicing in the activity of his limbs and returning with fresh vigor and spirit to labor for your service and lastly contemplate the happy woman bearing now with pleasure what she had so long borne with anguish and disquietude she carries in her arms a smiling infant blesses her god praises her benefactors and forgets all her pangs for joy that a man is born into the world  a scene so dreadful and so pleasing a contrast so striking must surely warm the coldest heart to sensibility and open the narrowest mind to sentiments of love and compassion of tenderness and humanity to reflect that by our little contributions by setting aside our superfluities only we have it in our power to produce so astonishing a change in the circumstances and condition of our fellow creatures must doubtless afford that heartfelt pleasure which is infinitely superior to every wordly enjoyment a pleasure which the contributors to this noble charity have felt and long i trust will continue to feel  let us not then my brethren be weary of welldoing when the edifice is large and spacious it must stand in need of continual repairs to maintain and support it this charity as i have before observed to you is in its nature very extensive the fund therefore raised to preserve it must be extensive also the number of patients who are perpetually applying for admittance show the necessity of punctually continuing the old and earnestly soliciting new subscriptions to it add to which that the hardness of the times together with the scarcity and dearness of provisions of every kind oblige many to take shelter in this place who little thought they should ever have stood in need of it  leave not therefore my brethren this labor of love unfinished let each person already concerned in the support of this hospital consider the whole as one miserable and helpless individual whom he has taken under his protection the good samaritan we may remember not only bound up the travellers wounds and poured oil into them but set him upon his horse lodged and paid for him and when at last he left him provided in some measure for his future wants if it would be cruel to neglect an individual whom we had taken under our care so would it likewise be but in a much higher degree with regard to the whole charity to withdraw the aid we had once given would cancel at once all the merit of the obligation nor would it excuse those who acted in this manner that what they subtracted from one charity was bestowed on another that it was the same stream of beneficence directed to a different channel this is the child whom we have adopted we are not to transfer our parental affection to any other but to consider ourselves as bound in honor and conscience to feed and maintain it i mention this because charities god be thanked are daily increasing amongst us and the fickleness of mens dispositions may dispose some to change the objects of their bounty in this case as the seeds of benevolence sprouted up and blossomed in one place they would wither and decay in another charity would by degrees defeat its own end and purpose and like the suicides of our age finally destroy itself  to conclude let us all devoutly entreat the lord and father of mercies that he would pour into our hearts the spirit of mercy that he would imprint strongly on our minds the image of the good samaritan and teach us to go and do likewise let us entreat him that our charity may increase our humanity and compassion be daily strengthened and improved that he will permit them to cover from his eyes the multitude of our sins and that in kind regard to the poor and afflicted whom he loves he will not be extreme to mark what we have done amiss but in the last and great day will suffer those whom we have relieved to plead in our behalf that so howsoever we may have offended him he may yet look upon us with eyes of compassion and say unto us because we have considered the poor and miserable well have ye done my good and faithful servants enter ye into the joy of your lord  finis an account of the middlesexhospital for the reception of sick and lame and for lyingin marriedwomen in marybonefields oxfordroad the happy effects arising from the several hospitals erected about these two great cities for the reception of diseased poor will sufficiently justify the institution of this  nature and religion patronize every instance of distress but they most powerfully befriend that deepest of all distresses sickness in poverty sickness itself will excite compassion though alleviated by every comfort and advantage of wealth how much stronger a sympathy then must arise at the sight or idea of sickness embittered by poverty or considered in another view how affecting is the condition of poverty disabled by sickness this affliction extreme as it is is known to be very frequent most men are inclined but few very few in comparison have the power to relieve it public contributions therefore seemed the most likely means to effect what the private bounty of individuals could not this gave rise in the present charitable age to infirmaries and the continuance and increase of the voluntary subscriptions by which they are supported are the strongest argument that they have answered their end but as there are some populous parts of the town which on account of their distance and the number of their poor receive little benefit from these noble designs it is hoped that the situation of this hospital and its extensive use in providing for the distresses of poor married women with child will recommend it to the assistance and contribution of those whom humanity or religion inspire with benevolence  the qualification of a governor of this charity is an annual subscription of three guineas which also entitles the subscriber to recommend and have in the house at one time either one sick or lame patient or one lyingin woman and to recommend outpatients a subscription of five guineas per annum entitles the subscriber to recommend one sick or lame inpatient outpatients and one lyingin woman a subscription of thirty guineas at one payment constitutes the subscriber a governor for life with the last mentioned privileges contributions of lesser sums than three guineas per annum are thankfully received and entitle the contributors to recommend one sick or lame inpatient and one outpatient at the same time  a committee of the governors appointed quarterly meet at the hospital every tuesday at ten of the clock to receive and discharge patients and to transact the other necessary business of the house where every governor though not of the committee has a right to be present and his attendance is received as a favor a report of their proceedings is made to the general court held every quarter when the resolutions of this committee are approved or rejected  the physicians visit the patients every tuesday thursday and saturday and on intermediate days when particular cases require it the surgeons attend every day  patients are admitted on a letter of recommendation from a governor or contributor who may recommend inpatients and have outpatients on the books according to the regulation abovementioned and when inpatients are recommended and there is not room in the house to receive them they are put on the list to be admitted on the first vacancy and in the mean time are prescribed for as outpatients no security is required for burials all accidents are admitted without recommendation tuesday being the day appointed for the admission of patients they are expected to be at the hospital with their recommendations at ten of the clock the physicians and surgeons meet every saturday at twelve of the clock at the hospital where they give advice gratis to all such diseased poor who shall come though unrecommended and require it  the charitable designs of this hospital were carried on for several years in two convenient houses adjoining to each other in windmillstreet tottenhamcourtroad where the first institution in august      was intended only for the relief of the indigent sick and lame but in july      the governors willing to render it more worthy of the notice of the public by making it still more useful resolved to extend their plan to the relief of the pregnant wives of the industrious poor the first example of this sort of charity within this kingdom  the great increase of patients occasioned by the reputation of this twofold charity obliged the governors to think of enlarging their edifice as well as their plan and the kind benevolence of the public by donations legacies etc enabled them in      to erect a much larger and more convenient building in a high and airy part of marybonefields near oxfordroad wherein the apartments for the reception of the lyingin are in a separate part of the building remote from the sick and lame and that ladies may conveniently visit the lyingin patients without being incommoded by the sick and lame distinct staircases lead to each the lyingin wards having no communication with the sick and lame  married women only are admitted in the last month of their pregnancy after they have been examined by the weekly board and on their producing an affidavit made before a justice of the peace of the time and place of their marriage and of the settlement of the husband with the manner the said settlement was obtained whether by birth servitude or otherwise and that this useful branch of the charity the midwifry ward may be made every way beneficial and not liable to any objection no pupils will be admitted the whole being under the direction of dr brudenell exton physician and manmidwife and no woman whatsoever who has been able to prove her marriage and her husbands settlement so as to avoid burthening the parish wherein the hospital stands has been refused admittance  the number of beds at present are sixtyfour  for sick and lame inpatients    accidents   lying in marriedwomen    servants      the servants of the house are forbid to take any gratuity of the patients or their friends on any pretense whatsoever on pain of expulsion  the patients of this hospital are attended without fee or reward by the following gentlemen physicians dr richard warren pall mall dr hugh smith mincinglane dr john brisbane holbourn manmidwife dr brudenell exton frithstreet soho surgeons mr william young sohosquare mr henry watson great malboroughstreet st jamess mr isaac minors chancery lane the rev mr george davis m a chaplain  such persons who are inclined to favor this charitable design are desired to send their subscriptions with their names and places of abode to the treasurers at the weekly committee held every tuesday in the forenoon at the hospital and in order to supply the current expense of this charity the subscribers are requested to continue to pay their yearly subscriptions in advance  subscriptions and benefactions are likewise taken in at messrs honywood fuller and co bankers in birchinlane and at mr gislingham coopers banker in the strand  as every governor has a right to act at all boards and to enquire into the affairs of the society they are hereby earnestly entreated to make frequent use of this power especially by attending at the weekly board and they may be assured that their doing so will be deemed a confiderable addition to their charity and a very great service to the hospital  those who are disposed to be benefactors by their last will have the following form of a legacy recommended to them  item i give and bequeath unto a b and c d the sum of  upon trust and to the intent that they or one of them do pay to the treasurer or treasurers for the time being of a society who now call themselves the governors of the middlesexhospital for the reception of sick and lame and for lyingin marriedwomen which said sum of  i desire may be paid out of my personal estate and be applied toward carrying on the charitable designs of the said society  the charges of erecting this new building together with furniture and convenient sewers amount to near  000l which by the charitable assistance of the nobility gentry and others the governors have been enabled to pay but there are yet wanting proper paving and a wall to enclose their ground and building and render it as convenient as possible for the uses of the charity toward which useful and necessary purpose the governors ever relying on the director of all charities entertain lively hopes that this laudable design will still continue to merit the favor and protection of the public  an abstract of the accounts of the hospital from the  0th of april      to the  0th of april      receipts l s d balance of the last
