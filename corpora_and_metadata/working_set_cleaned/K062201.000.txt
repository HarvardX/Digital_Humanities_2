letters written to and for particular friends on the most important occasions directing not only the requisite style and forms to be observed in writing familiar letters but how to think and act justly and prudently in the common concerns of human life  containing one hundred and seventythree letters none of which were ever before published  london printed for c rivington in st pauls churchyard j osborn in paternoster row and j leake at bath mdccxli  preface the following letters are published at the solicitation of particular friends who are of opinion that they will answer several good ends as they may not only direct the forms requisite to be observed on the most important occasions but what is more to the purpose by the rules and instructions contained in them contribute to mend the heart and improve the understanding  nature propriety of character plain sense and general use have been the chief objects of the authors attention in the penning of these letters and as he everywhere aimed to write to the judgment rather than to the imagination he would choose that they should generally be found more useful than diverting though where the subjects require strokes of humor and innocent raillery it will be seen perhaps that the method he has taken was the effect of choice and not merely of necessity  the writer is no friend to long prefaces but it may be necessary however to say what he has aimed at in this performance and to leave his merit in the execution of it to proper judges  he has endeavored then in general throughout the great variety of his subjects to inculcate the principles of virtue and benevolence to describe properly and recommend strongly the social and relative duties and to place them in such practical lights that the letters may serve for rules to think and act by as well as forms to write after  particularly he has endeavored to point out the duty of a servant not a slave the duty of a master not a tyrant that of the parent not as a person morose and sour and hard to be pleased but mild indulgent kind and such an one as would rather govern by persuasion than force  he has endeavored to direct the young man in the choice of his friends and companions to excite him to diligence to discourage extravagance sottishness and vice of all kinds  he has aimed to set forth in a variety of cases to both sexes the inconveniences attending unsuitable marriages to expose the folly of a litigious spirit to console the unhappy to comfort the mourner and many of these by arguments though easy and familiar yet new and uncommon  with regard to the letters of courtship the author has aimed to point out such methods of address to a young man as may stand the test of the parents judgment as well as the daughters opinion and at the same time that they should not want the proper warmth of expression which complaisance and passion for the beloved object inspire and is so much expected in addresses of this nature they should have their foundation laid in common sense and a manly sincerity and in a word be such as a prudent woman need not blush to receive nor a discreet man be ashamed to look back upon when the doubtful courtship is changed into the matrimonial certainty  with this view he has also attempted to expose the empty flou ishes and incoherent rhapsodies by which shallow heads and designing hearts endeavor to exalt their mistresses into goddesses in hopes of having it in their power to sink them into the characters of the most credulous and foolish of their sex  orphans and ladies of independent fortunes he has particularly endeavored to guard against the insidious arts of their flattering and selfish dependents and the clandestine addresses of fortunehunters those beasts of prey as they may well be called who spread their snares for the innocent and thoughtless heart  these among other no less material objects have been the authors principal aim how well he has succeeded must as has been hinted be left to the judgment of the candid reader  the contents of the letters i to a father against putting a youth of but moderate parts to a profession that requires

life letter i to a father against putting a youth of but moderate parts to a profession that requires more extensive abilities dear sir you pay me a compliment though a very obliging one when in the last letter you favored me with you desire my advice with respect to the disposition of your son william whom you are inclined to bring up to the bar if in complying with your request i should say any thing you may not entirely approve you will not have so much room to blame me as your own wrong choice of a counselor  i need not now tell you i have a good opinion of will and think him a modest grave sober youth but for this very reason i hardly think him qualified for the profession you would choose for him for i doubt he has neither talents for the law nor ever will have the presence of mind necessary to make a figure at the bar in any smooth easy business he will probably succeed and be a useful member of the commonwealth and as he is not your eldest son i should were it to me put him to a merchant or as we live in an island and trade and navigation are both our riches and our glory i should not even scruple to put a second son to a creditable wholesale dealer rather than fail if he himself is not averse to such a calling for i know not you will excuse me i am sure whether wills genius is equal to that of an universal merchant for the various springs of commerce the seasons for choosing proper commodities and numberless incidents that make a necessary return of gain precarious are full employment for the strongest judgment as a man by one illchosen venture often loses more than he gains by several successful ones  but this opinion of will should you think it just will be no obstacle to his succeeding in the world in some creditable easy business though i think him unequal to the part you seem inclinable to allot him yet he is no fool and experience teaches us that in some sorts of business ample advantage may be made by very moderate talents with much reputation these are principally such employments as merely consist in buyng with prudence and in selling at a marketprofit hence we see several wholesale dealers gain large fortunes with ease and credit and without any other secret than the plain practice of buying at the best hand paying for their goods punctually and vending them always for what they are in dealings of this kind the fatigues are few and clear wellkept books are sufficient to show at any time a mans loss or gain for which generally speaking less than one forenoon in a week is sufficient and yet by a constant attention in this easy manner as good a character and very often more money is to be gained than in professions that require an extraordinary genius a perpetual attention and a close and intense study which very seldom succeeds neither for see you not of hundreds of lawyers how very few of them make a figure or get genteel bread and how many for want of courage to appear at the bar who yet have good parts and knowledge in the laws are forced to confine themselves to chamberpractice in which it is a long time before they grow noted enough to make a tolerable livelihood  as to what you hint of placing him in the physic tribe i like this no better than the other consider only this one thing how long it is before he will be capable of entering into business or reputation as a physician if he ever does it at all for who chooses to trust his health to a raw and unexperienced young man the law requires a sprightly impudence if i may so say the physic line a solemn one in the person who would make a figure in either and do you think though will is grave enough of conscience that he ever can come up to that important deportment that unblushing parade which is the very essence of an english physician so he may in either of the prosessions live over all his days and be quite unknown for as practice in both faculties is the best teacher and theory a most uncertain guide he may live to be forty of fifty years of age and not come into any business that shall improve himself or benefit his consulters  whereas in the way i propose no sooner is he come of age and fit to be trusted with the management of any affairs at all but his seven years will be expired and if he has not been wanting to himself in it and if he be he would have been much more so in an abstruser business he will be enabled with the fortune you can bestow upon him to enter upon the stage of the world with great advantage and become directly a necessary and an useful member of the community and my good friend when you and i recollect that most of the noble families in the kingdom as well as the genteel ones had the foundations of their grandeur laid in trade i expect not in such a country as ours especially that any objection to my advice will be formed either by you or your good lady on this score if you have not more significant reasons proceeding from the boys turn of mind and inclination which i think should always be consulted on these occasions for though i hope it never will be so in your case yet nothing has been more common than that of two sons the eldest brought up to the estate the other to trade in the revolution of twenty or thirty years the latter through the extravagance of the former has made himself eldest as i may say for by saving while the other has been spending he has found means to keep the estate in the family though it has been transferred upon the youngest and as it has then proved the worthiest branch  this i think deserves your consideration and by viewing will in the same light i do that of a wellinclined lad of moderate passions great natural modesty and no soaring genius i believe you will think it best to dispose of him in such manner as may require no greater talents than he is possessed of and may in due time make him appear in the face of the world fully qualified for what he undertakes i am sir  your very humble servant   letter ii from an uncle to a nephew on his keeping bad company bad hours etc in his apprenticeship dear nephew i am very much concerned to hear that you are of late fallen into bad company that you keep bad hours and give great uneasiness to your master and break the rules of his family that when he expostulates with you on this occasion you return pert and bold answers and instead of promising or endeavoring to amend repeat the offense and have entered into clubs and societies of young fellows who set at naught all good example and make such persons who would do their duty the subject of their ridicule as persons of narrow minds and who want the courage to do as they do  let me on this occasion expostulate with you and set before you the evil of the way you are in  in the first place what can you mean by breaking the rules of a family you had bound your self by contract to observe do you think it is honest to break through engagements into which you have so solemnly entered and which are no less the rules of the corporation you are to be one day free of than those of a private family  seven years several of which are elapsed are not so long a term but that you may see it determined before you are overfit to betrusted with your own conduct twentyone or twentytwo years of age is full early for a young man to be his own master whatever you may think and you may surely stay till then at least to choose your own hours and your own company and i fear as you go on if you do not mend your ways your discretion will not then do credit to your choice remember you have no time you can call your own during the continuance of your contract and must you abuse your master in a double sense rob him of his time especially if any of it be hours of business rob him of his rest break the peace of his family and give a bad example to others and all for what why to riot in the company of a set of persons who contemn as they teach you to do all order and discipline who in all likelihood will lead you into into gaming drinking swearing and even more dangerous vices to the unhinging of your mind from your business which must be your future support  consider i exhort you in time to what these courses may lead you consider the affiction you will give to all your friends by your continuance in them lay together the substance of the conversation that passes in a whole evening with your frothy companions after you are come from them and reflect what solid truth what useful lesson worthy of being inculcated in your future life that whole evening has afforded you and consider whether it is worth breaking through all rule and order for  whether your present conduct is such as you would allow in a servant of your own whether you are so capable to pursue your business with that ardor and delight next morning as if you had not drank or kept bad hours over night if not whether your master has not a double loss and damage from your misspent evenings whether the taking of small liberties as you may think them leads you not on to greater for let me tell you you will not find it in your power to stop when you will and then whether any restraint at all will not in time be irksome to you  i have gone through the like servitude with pleasure and credit i found myself my own master full soon for my discretion what you think of your self i know not but i wish you may do as well for your own interest and reputation too as i have done for mine and i will assure you i should not have thought it either creditable or honest to do as you do i could have stood the laugh of an hundred such vain companions as you choose for being too narrowminded to break through all moral obligations to my master in order to show the bravery of a bad heart and what an abandoned mind dared to perpetrate a bad beginning seldom makes a good ending and if you was assured that you could stop when you came for your self which is very improbable how will you answer it to equity and good conscience that you will not do so for your master there is let me tell you more true bravery of mind in forbearing to do an injury than in giving offense  you are now at an age when you should study to improve not divert your faculties you should now lay in a fund of knowledge that in time when ripened by experience may make you a worthy member of the commonwealth do you think you have nothing to learn either as to your business or as to the forming of your mind would it not be much better to choose the silent the sober conversation of books than of such companions as never read or think an author never commits any but his best thoughts to paper but what can you expect from the laughing noisy company you keep but frothy prate indigested notions and thoughts so unworthy of being remembered that it is the greatest kindness to forget them  let me entreat you then my dear kinsman for your familys sake for your own sake before it be too late to reflect as you ought upon the course you are entered into by applying yourself to books instead of such vain company you will be qualified in time for the best of company and to be respected by all ranks of men this will keep you out of unnecessary expenses will employ all your leisure time will exclude a world of temptations and open and enlarge your notions of mn and things and finally set you above that wretched company which now you seem so much delighted with and one thing let me recommend to you that you keep a list of the young men of your standing within the compass of your knowledge and for the next seven years observe what fate will attend them see if those who follow not the course you are so lately entered into will not appear in a very different light from those who do and from the industry and prosperity of the one and the decay or failure of the other if their vain ways do not blast them before or as soon as they begin the world you will find abundant reason every day to justify the truth of the observations i have thrown together as nothing but my affection for you could possibly influence me to these expostulations i hope for a proper effect from them if you would be thought well of by or expect any favor from  your loving uncle your master will at my request send me word of the success of my remonstrances     letter iii a widowmothers letter in answer to her sons complaining of hardships in his apprenticeship dear billy i am very sorry to hear of the difference between your master and you i was always afraid you would expect the same indulgences you had met with at home and as you know that in many instances i have endeavored to make any seeming hardship as easy to you as i could if this causes you to be harder to be satisfied it would be a great trouble to me your uncle tells me i am afraid with too much truth that the indulgences you have received from me have made your present station more disagreeable than it would otherwise have been what i have always done for you was intended for your good and nothing could so deeply afflict me as to see my tenderness have a contrary effect therefore dear child to my constant care for your welfare do not add the sorrow of seeing it the cause of your behaving worse than if it had not been bestowed upon you for as before we put you to your master we had an extraordinary character of him from all his neighbors and those who dealt with him and as mr joseph who is now out of his time gives him the best of characters and declares your mistress to be a woman of great prudence and good conduct i know not how to think they would use you ill in any respect but consider my dear you must not in any woman beside myself expect to find a fond and perhaps partial mother for the little failings which i could not see in you will appear very plain to other persons my love for you would make me wish you always with me but as that is what your future welfare will no way permit and as you must certainly be a gainer by the situation you are now in let a desire to promote my happiness as well as your own make every seeming difficulty light which i hope will appear much lighter for being what i entreat you to dispense with who am  your ever loving mother i have desired your uncle to interpose in this matter and he writes to you on this occasion and has promised to see justice done you in case your complaints be reasonable     letter iv an uncles letter to the youth on the same occasion cousin william i am sorry you should have any misunderstanding with your master i have a good opinion of him and am unwilling to entertain a bad one of you it is so much a masters interest to use his apprentices well that i am inclinable to think that when they are badly treated it is oftener the effect of provocation than choice wherefore before i give myself the trouble of interposing in your behalf i desire you will strictly inquire of yourself whether you have not by some misconduct or other provoked that alteration in your masters behavior of which you so much complain if after having diligently complied with this request you assure me that you are not sensible of having given cause of disgust on your side i will readily use my best endeavors to reconcile you to your master or procure you another but if you find yourself blameble it will be better for you to remove by your own amendment the occasion of your masters displeasure than to have me or any other friend offer to plead your excuse where you know it would be unjust to defend you if this should be your case all your friends together could promise your better behavior indeed but as the performance must even then be your own it will add much more to your character to pass through your whole term without any interposition between you weigh well what i have here said and remember that your future welfare depends greatly on your present behavior i am  your loving kinsman   letter v an apprentice to an uncle about a fraud committed by his fellowapprentice to their master dear uncle i am under greater uneasiness than i am able to express my fellowprentice for whom i had a great regard and from whom i have received many civilities has involved me in the deepest affliction i am unwilling to tell you and yet i must not conceal it that he has forfeited the confidence reposed in him by a breach of trust to which he ungenerously gained my consent by a pretense i did not in the least suspect what must i do my master is defrauded if i discover the injury i am sure to ruin a young man i would fain think possessed of some merit if i conceal the injustice i must at present share the guilt and hereafter be partaker in the punishment i am in the greatest agony of mind and beg your instant advice as you value the peace of  your dutiful though unfortunate nephew   letter vi the uncles answer dear nephew your letter which i just now received gives me great uneasiness and as any delay in the discovery may be attended with consequences which will probably be dangerous to yourself and disagreeable to all who belong to you i charge you if you value your own happiness and my peace to acquaint your master instantly with the injustice that has been done him which is the only means of vindicating your own innocence and prevent your being looked upon as an accomplice in a fact to which i wish you may not be found to have been too far consenting as to the unhappy young man who has been guilty of so fatal an indiscretion i wish if the known clemency and goodnature of your master may pardon this offense he may let his forgiveness teach him the ingratitude and inhumanity of injuring a man who is not only the proper guardian of his youth but whose goodness deserves the best behavior though he be generous enough to excuse the worst let not a minute pass after you receive this before you reveal the matter to your master for i am in hopes that your application to me and your following my advice will greatly plead in your behalf i will very speedily call on your master and am as far as an honest regard for you can make me  your loving uncle   letter vii advice from a father to a young beginner what company to choose and how to behave in it dear robin as you are now entering into the world and will probably have considerable dealings in your business the frequent occasions you will have for advice from others will make you desirous of singling out among your most intimate acquaintance one or two whom you would view in the light of friends  in the choice of these your utmost care and caution will be necessary for by a mistake here you can scarcely conceive the fatal effects you may hereafter experience wherefore it will be proper for you to make a judgment of those who are fit to be your advisers by the conduct they have observed in their own affairs and the reputation they bear in the world for he who has by his own indiscretions undone himself is much fitter to be set up as a landmark for a prudent mariner to shun his courses than an example to follow  old age is generally slow and heavy youth headstrong and precipitate but there are old men who are full of vivacity and young men replenished with discretion which makes me rather point out the conduct than the age of the persons with whom you should choose to associate though after all it is a neverfailing good sign to me of prudence and virtue in a young man when his seniors choose his company and he delights in theirs  let your endeavor therefore be at all adventures to consort yourself with men of sobriety good sense and virtue for the proverb is an unerring one that says a man is known by the company he keeps if such men you can single out while you improve by their conversation you will benefit by their advice and be sure remember one thing that though you must be frank and unreserved in delivering your sentiments when occasions offer yet that you be much readier to hear than speak for to this purpose it has been significantly observed that nature has given a man two ears and but one tongue lay in therefore by observation and a modest silence such a store of ideas that you may at their time of life make no worse figure than they do and endeavor to benefit yourself rather by other peoples ills than your own how must those young men expose themselves to the contempt and ridicule of their seniors who having seen little or nothing of the world are continually shutting out by open mouths and closed ears all possibility of instruction and making vain the principal end of conversation which is improvement a silent young man makes generally a wise old one and never fails of being respected by the best and most prudent men when therefore you come among strangers hear every one speak before you deliver your own sentiments by this means you will judge of the merit and capacities of your company and avoid exposing yourself as i have known many do by shooting out hasty and inconsiderate bolts which they would have been glad to recall when perhaps a silent genius in company has burst out upon them with such observations as have struck consciousness and shame in the forward speaker if he has not been quite insensible of inward reproach  i have thrown together as they occurred a few thoughts which may suffice for the present to show my care and concern for your welfare i hope you will constantly from time to time communicate to me whatever you shall think worthy of my notice or in which my advice may be of use to you for i have no pleasure in this life equal to that which the happiness of my children gives me and of this you may be assured for i am and ever must be  your affectionate father   letter viii general rules for agreeable conversation in a young man from a father to a son dear william as i had not an opportunity of saying so much to you as i wished when you were last here i send this to inform you of some things in your general conversation which i think would be proper for you to observe and amend particularly your excessive itch for talking which discovers itself alike on all occasions i have always flattered myself that you do not want sense and am willing to hope i have not been deceived but the dangerous selfsufficiency of most young men seems violently to have seized you which i hope a little reflection will remove  the art of rendering yourself agreeable in conversation is worth your serious study it is an advantage few can boast though sought after by all and nothing is so constant an enemy to success in those who would excel in this art as the harboring an opinion of their own proficiency before they have attained to any tolerable degree of knowledge in what they imagine themselves possessed of conversation where it is rightly managed must be so conducted as to let each member of the company have a share in the pleasure and applause it affords if you are six in number after you have told a story or made any remark which gives a general satisfaction you must consider it the right of another to call your attention in his turn and unless particularly requested it betrays a great weakness to follow yourself no doubt but you love to be admired and have not others the same passion you believe your wit more brilliant than theirs are you sure that they are not of the same opinion as to their own if a man speaks little you must not from thence conclude him willing to give up every claim to conversible merit perhaps he cannot sing but to be sure he is as desirous of having his peculiar humor or his dry joke applauded as you are to be entreated another song if he is no mathematician perhaps he is versed in religious disputation if he despises plays he may admire history though he understands not geography he may yet know how to describe the humors of mankind and though he pretends not to politics he may have a turn for some more useful science when these are considered if his modesty is great you cannot oblige him more than by throwing an opportunity in his way to display his capacity on the subject he believes himself most able to handle with advantage for in order to support a thorough good humor a man must be pleased with himself as well as with others when this is properly taken care of conversation seldom fails to prove entertaining and to the neglect of this are owing many of the yawning hours spent in companies composed of men not incapable of behaving agreeably  the manner of telling a story is also worth your notice you have known the pleasure of hearing a long one well told mr trotter has an admirable talent in this way but then you must observe that half the pleasure he gives arises from his happily avoiding any of the silly digressions which are the great cause of a storys seeming tedious you never hear him mingle his relation with i remember very well it was the same day that squire trumbuls son came of age  i bought my bay nag the very day before at such a fair being a friday that year  or i can scarce think of it without laughing  but however as i was saying  and a hundred more such deadweights to attention nor does he ever praise a story before he relates it a fatal rock to many a good relation for when any story wants a preparatory recommendation it ought not to be told and even when the relation is possible the generality of auditors are apt to persuade themselves the mountain labors and a mouse is born  these are loose and general hints but by a due improvement of them you will find yourself very sensibly grow more and more agreeable wherever you converse an ease and becoming freedom you already have and by the addition of discretion in your use of them and complaisance to others you will probably succeed in the desire so predominant in you of being admired by men of sense and judgment which will be no small pleasure to  your affectionate father   letter ix an elder to a younger brother who is in love with a young lady of great gaiety etc dear brother i am more concerned for your welfare than you imagine you are younger than myself my duty in some degree requires my care for your good and particularly in a point that may be so material to your whole life as is that of love  beauty has as great a force upon my senses as it can have upon yours i am near thirty years of age you are not more than twenty your passions are strong mine brother are far from subsiding i admire i love with as much force of nature as you can do my reason ought to be stronger and it is well if my passion is not so likewise miss rooke is amiable on many accounts her features are regular her wit sprightly her deportment genteel and voice  i had almost said ravishing her dress is easy and unaffected and her manner of conversation has a freedom that captivates more hearts than yours yet i greatly fear with all these endowments she will not make the wife you ought to wish for her airy flights and gay behavior are pleasing as a partner in conversation but will they be equally agreeable in a partner for life what now charms you charms also others you are now content with thinking yourself one among many that admire her and are admitted to share the brilliancy of her conversation but will a share of her wit and humor her freedom and gaiety please hereafter as a wife and though she is delightful in company are you satisfied she will be as agreeable when alone with you or when she has not an opportunity of shewingaway in a company that perhaps you may not approve she now sees nobody but whom she chooses to see if she should be a wife it is more than probable she may dislike restraints and can you approve of a diffuse conversation in one you desire to yourself  think not brother that i have any interested motive for this advice i assure you i have not i am not your rival i desire not the lady you seem too fond of all i mean for i say nothing at present with regard to your own youth which ought not however to be wholly forgotten as very few prudent matches are made by young gentlemen at your age is to caution you against thinking of a gentlewoman who may and i am willing to believe will be a suitable companion to a gentleman whose station and choice leads him into much company and gay life but to men whose circumstances if not their inclinations require a more retired way of life it is obvious a woman whose talents lie principally in conversation can never for that reason only justify a young gentleman for choosing her for a wife  i hope this will come time enough to put you upon guarding against the inconveniences that threaten the indulgence of your present passion shut not your ears to reason forget not yourself and be sure to remember that the pleasure of an hour or two and of twenty thirty or forty years or a whole life must arise from very different sources i am  dear brother your most affectionate etc   letter x an elder to an extravagant younger brother dear john you may be certain that your misfortunes are to me a most melancholy subject you are my only brother i own it and your misfortunes affect me next to my own but there is this difference in what i feel for you and for myself i am sure every misfortune i have met with has been occasioned by unavoidable accidents this consideration has supported me under the many afflictions i have myself endured but for those i have shared with you i cannot boast the same alleviation while our father lived he was your constant and unwearied support even after your patrimony was squandered away while our mother remained she was every week assisting your necessities but what might more properly be called your levity and extravagance she is now by the divine will taken from us both her jointure as well as the estate my father independently left has devolved upon me of this both nature and providence require i should make the best use and to serve you i readily confess is my greatest care but my dear brother how is this to be done the generous and bountiful assistance of our parents procured you no substantial good what then am i to do to screen you from want and misery  that you are not already happy is not owing to the backwardness of your friends to serve you but allow me to speak plainly to your own indiscretion your own fortune maintained you not for three years were i able to give you as much more what reason have you given me to suppose you will be a better oeconomist than you have been my whole estate let me tell you brother at your rate of expense would scarcely maintain you for seven years and think you as you will i must believe it my duty to leave enough to support my offspring with prudent conduct to the end of time if i send you as you desire fifty guineas what good will that sum procure you it will but serve to lengthen your credit and make you run deeper into debt i have assisted you before and has not this always been the case and have not people given you credit because they think i will support you it is time then my dear brother to hold my hand but yet be assured that when i am covinced you have thoroughly abandoned your prese courses you shall find in me  a truly affectionate brother   letter xi to a young man too soon keeping a horse dear tom i always take great pleasure in hearing of your welfare and of every thing that makes for your satisfaction and comfort but give me leave to say that i am sorry to hear you have so early begun to keep a horse especially as your business is altogether in your shop and you have no end to serve in riding out and are besides young and healthy and so cannot require it as exercise and is it worth while think you to keep a horse the whole week that you may have him at hand on a sunday morning if the day proves fair and you have nothing to keep you in town  you must consider that though here in the country many common tradesmen keep horses the expense is but small to them and the distance of one customer from another in a manner obliges them to it but this can be no plea for you and if you do not want a horse for exercise you can only allege the worst reason in the world for your maintaining one that your neighbors all round you do the same for look who they are and what their motives and you will soon see the difference and that their example will not justify you mr thompson for instance who lives next door to you is near sixty years of age of a pretty gross constitution and capable of no other exercise and moreover he had acquired by length of time and industry an ample fortune before he gave himself this diversion mr jenkins has an estate fallen to him that sets him above the want of trade and his continuing in it is rather an amusement than an employment mr jackson mr west mr trozier and mr kent are all men of established fortunes and when you are as old as the youngest of them and can as well afford it i would be far from dissuading you from keeping a horse but at present you may depend upon it you rather incur their contempt than gain their esteem by offering to appear their equal when they and you well know in what relates to expenses you ought not to be so nor have you had a time for it the lower part of the world may perhaps show you more respect for those marks of substance but should a time come and who is exempt from misfortunes when they must know they were the effects of unthinking levity how despicable must you then appear in their eyes and let me tell you that the esteem of persons of credit and understanding must be gained by very different means from show or equipage for with these modesty prudence and good sense only will ever prevail  besides the expense of the horse is not the least thing to be considered it will in time very probably lead you into a more dangerous one that of bestowing too much of your time in the use of it it will unhinge your mind as i may say from business and give your servants opportunity to be remiss in your absence and as you are a young man it is fit that you should lay up by your industry against a more advanced age when the exercise a horse affords will seem not only more suitable but perhaps absolutely necessary to your health whereas now it may rather pass for wantonness and affectation  you are not without a tolerable share of reason let me prevail with you to use it sell your horse and fear not being laughed at on that account for it will be a credit to you more ways than one to say that your business would not allow you time to use it and it would argue besides great perverseness to continue in an error for no other reason than to support a wrong judgment at first setting out and your reducing an unnecessary expense in good time will more than recover any good opinion you may have lost by running into it  your prudent use of this advice will as it must tend to your good be a great satisfaction to  your tenderly affectionate father   letter xii against a sudden intimacy or friendship with one of a short acquaintance cousin tom i am just setting out for windsor and have not time to say so much as i would on the occasion upon which i now write to you i hear that mr douglas and you have lately contracted such an intimacy that you are hardly ever asunder and as i know his morals are not the best nor his circumstances the most happy i fear he will if he has not already done it let you see that he better knows what he does in seeking your acquaintance than you do in cultivating his  i am far from desiring to abridge you in any necessary or innocent liberty or to prescribe too much to your choice of a friend nor am i against your being complaisant to sirangers for this gentlemans acquaintance is not yet a month old with you but you must not think every man whose conversation is agreeable fit to be immediately treated as a friend of all sorts hastilycontracted friendships promise the least duration or satisfaction as they most commonly arise from design on one side and weakness on the other true friendship must be the effect of long and mutual esteem and knowledge it ought to have for its cement an equality of years a similitude of manners and pretty much a parity in circumstance and degree but generally speaking an openness to a stranger carries with it strong marks of indiscretion and not seldom ends in repentance  for these reasons i would be glad you would be upon your guard and proceed cautiously in this new alliance mr douglas has vivacity and humor enough to please any man of a light turn but where i to give my judgment of him i should pronounce him fitter for the teatable than the cabinet he is smart but very superficial and treats all serious subjects with a contempt too natural to bad minds and i know more young men than one of whose good opinion he has taken advantage and has made them wiser though at their own expense than he found them  the caution i here give you is the pure effect of my experience in life some knowledge of your new associate and my affection for you the use you make of it will determine whether you merit this concern from  your affectionate kinsman   letter xiii a young man in business to a father desiring leave to address his daughter sir i hope the justness of my intentions will excuse the freedom of these few lines whereby i am to acquaint you of the great affection and esteem i have for your daughter i would not sir offer at any indirect address that should have the least appearance of inconsistency with her duty to you and my honorable views to her choosing by your influence if i may approve myself to you worthy of that honor to commend myself to her approbation you are not insensible sir by the credit i have hitherto preserved in the world of my ability by gods blessing to make her happy and this the rather imboldens me to request the favor of an evenings conversation with you at your first convenience when i will more fully explain myself as i earnestly hope to your satisfaction and take my encouragement or discouragement from your own mouth i am sir mean time with great respect  your most obedient humble servant   letter xiv to the daughter on the fathers allowance apprising her of his intended visit madam i have ventured to make known to your honored father the great desire i have to be thought worthy of a relation to him by your means and as he has not discouraged me in the hopes i have entertained that i may possibly be not unacceptable to him and to all your worthy family i propose to do myself the honor of a visit to you next monday though he has been so good as to promise to introduce me and i make no doubt has acquainted you with it i give you nevertheless the trouble of these lines that i might not appear wanting in any outward demonstration of that inviolable respect with which i am dear madam  your most devoted humble servant   letter xv from a young lady to her father acquainting him with a proposal of marriage made to her nottingham april   honored sir i think it my duty to acquaint you that a gentleman of this town by name derham and by business a linendraper has made some overtures to my cousin morgan in the way of courtship to me my cousin has brought him once or twice into my company which he could not well decline doing because he has dealings with him and has an high opinion of him and his circumstances he has been set up three years and has very good business and lives in credit and fashion he is about twentyseven years old and a likely man enough he seems not to want sense or manners and is come of a good family he has broke his mind to me and boasts how well he can maintain me but i assure you sir i have given him no encouragement and told him that i had no thoughts of changing my condition yet a while and should never think of it but in obedience to my parents and i desired him to talk no more on that subject to me yet he resolves to persevere and pretends extraordinary affection and esteem i would not sir by any means omit to acquaint you with the beginnings of an affair that would be want of duty in me to conceal from you and show a guilt and disobedience unworthy of the kind indulgence and affection you have always shown to sir  your most dutiful daughter my humble duty to my honored mother love to my brother and sister and respects to all friends cousin morgan and his wife and sister desire their kind respects i cannot speak enough of their civility to me     letter xvi the fathers answer on a supposition that he approves not of the young mans addresses northampton apr  0 dear polly i have received your letter dated the  th instant wherein you acquaint me of the proposals made to you through your cousin morgans recommendation by one mr derham i hope as you assure me that you have given no encouragement to him for i by no means approve of him for your husband i have inquired of one of his townsmen who knows him and his circumstances very well and i am neither pleased with them nor with his character and wonder my cousin would so inconsiderately recommend him to you indeed i doubt not mr morgans good intentions but i insist upon it that you think nothing of the matter if you would oblige  your indulgent father your mother gives her blessing to you and joins with me in the above advice your brother and sister and all friends send their love and respects to you     letter xvii the fathers answer on a supposition that he does not disapprove of the young mans addresses northampt apr  0 my dear daughter in answer to yours of the  th instant relating to the addresses of mr derham i would have you neither wholly encourage nor discourage his suit for if on inquiry into his character and circumstances i shall find that they are answerable to your cousins good opinion of them and his own assurances i know not but his suit may be worthy of attention but my dear consider that men are deceitful and always put the best side outward and it may possibly on the strict inquiry which the nature and importance of the case demands come out far otherwise than it at present appears let me advise you therefore to act in this matter with great prudence and that you make not yourself too cheap for men are apt to slight what is too easily obtained your cousin will give him hope enough while you dont absolutely deny him and in the mean time he may be told that you are not at your own disposal but entirely resolved to abide by my determination and direction in an affair of this great importance and this will put him upon applying to me who you need not doubt will in this case as in all others study your good as becomes  your indulgent father your mother gives her blessing to you and joins with me in the above advice your brother and sister and all friends send their love and respects to you     letter xviii the young gentlemans letter to the father apprising him of his affection for his daughter northampton april    sir i take the liberty though personally unknown to you to declare the great value and affection i have for your worthy daughter whom i have had the honor to see at my good friend mr morgans i should think myself entirely unworthy of her favor and of your approbation if i could have a thought of influencing her resolution but in obedience to your pleasure as i should on such a supposition offer an injury likewise to that prudence in herself which i flatter myself is not the least of her amiable perfections if i might have the honor of your countenance sir on this occasion i would open myself and circumstances to you in that frank and honest manner which should convince you of the sincerity of my affection for your daughter and at the same time of the honourableness of my intentions in the mean time i will in general say that i have been set up in my business in the linendrapery way upwards of three years that i have a very good trade for the time that i had  000 l to begin with which i have improved to   00 l as i am ready to make appear to your satisfaction that i am descended of a creditable family have done nothing to stain my character and that my trade is still further improveable as i shall i hope enlarge my bottom this sir i thought but honest and fair to acquaint you with that you might know something of a person who sues to you for your countenance and that of your good lady in an affair that i hope may prove one day the greatest happiness of my life as it must be if i can be blessed with that and your dear daughters approbation in hope of which and the favor of a line i take the liberty to subscribe myself good sir  your most obedient humble servant   letter xix from the cousin to the father and mother in commendation of the young gentleman northampton apr    dear cousins i give you both thanks for so long continuing with us the pleasure of cousin pollys company she has entirely captivated a worthy friend of mine mr derham a linendraper of this town and i would have acquainted you with it myself but that i knew and advised cousin polly to write to you about it for i would not for the world any thing of this sort should be carried on unknown to you at my house especially mr derham has shown me his letter to you and i believe every tittle of it to be true and really if you and my cousin approve it as also cousin polly i dont know where she can do better i am sure i should think so if i had a daughter he could love  thus much i thought myself obliged to say and with my kind love to your other self and all my cousins as also my wifes and sisters i remain  your affectionate cousin   letter xx from the father in answer to the young gentleman nottingham april    sir i have received yours of the   th and am obliged to you for the good opinion you express of my daughter but i think she is yet full young to alter her condition and imbark in the cares of a family i cannot but say that the account you give of yourself and your application to me rather than first to try to engage the affections of my daughter carry a very honorable appearance and such as must be to the advantage of your character as to your beginning sir that is not to be so much looked upon as the improvement and i doubt not that you can make good proof of what you assert on this occasion but still i must needs say that i think and so does her mother that it is too early to incumber her with the cares of the world and as i am sure she will do nothing in so important an affair without our advice so i would not for the world in a case so nearly concerning her and her future welfare constrain her in the least i intend shortly to send for her home for she has been longer absent from us than we intended and then i shall consult her inclinations and you will excuse me to say for she is my daughter and a very good child though i say it that i shall then determine myself by that and by what shall appear to offer most for her good in the mean time sir i thank you for the civility and commendable openness of yours and am  your humble servant   the father in this letter referring pretty much to the daughters choice the young gentleman cannot but construe it as an encouragement to him to prosecute his addresses to her in which he doubles his diligence on the hint that she will soon return to nottingham in order to gain a footing in her good will and she finding her father and mother not averse to the affair ventures to give him some room to think his addresses not indifferent to her but still altogether on condition of her parents consent and approbation by the time then that she is recalled home nothing disagreeable having appeared in the young gentlemans behavior and his general character being consistent with his pretensions there may be supposed some degree of familiarity and confidence to have passed between them and she gives him hope that she will receive a letter from him though she will not promise an answer entirely referring to her duty to her parents and their good pleasure he attends her on her journey a good part of the way as far as she will permit and when her cousin his friend informs him of her safe arrival at nottingham he sends the following letter letter xxi from the young gentleman to his mistress on her arrival at her fathers may    dear madam i have understood with great pleasure your safe arrival at your fathers house of which i take the liberty to congratulate your good parents as well as your dear self i will not madam fill this letter with the regret i had to part with you because i have no reason nor merit at present to expect that you should be concerned for me on this score yet madam i am not without hope from the sincerity of my affection for you and the honesty of my intentions to deserve in time those regards which i cannot at present flatter myself with as your good father in his kind letter to me assured me that he should consult your inclinations and determine by them and by what should offer most for your good how happy should i be if i could find my humble suit not quite indifferent to your dear self and not rejected by him if what i have already opened to him as to my circumstances be not unacceptable i should humbly hope for leave to pay you and him a visit at nottingham or if this be too great a favor till he has made further enquiry that he would be pleased to give himself that trouble and put it in my power as soon as possible to convince him of the truth of my allegations upon which i desire to stand or fall in my hopes of your favor and his for i think far different from many in the world that a deception in an affair of this weighty nature should be less forgiven than in any other since then dearest madam i build my hopes more on the truth of my affection for you and the honor of my intentions than any other merit or pretensions i hope you will condescend if not to become an advocate for me which would be too great a presumption to expect yet to let your good parents know that you have no aversion to the person or address of dearest madam  your for everobliged and affectionate humble servant my best respects attend your good father and mother and whole family       as this puts the matter into such a train as may render more writing unnecessary the next steps to be taken being the inquiry into the truth of the young mans assertions and a confirmation of his character and then the proposals on the fathers part of what he will give with his daughter all which may be done best by word of mouth or interposition of friends so we shall have no occasion to pursue this instance of courtship further  letter xxii from a brother to his sister in the country upbraiding her for being negligent in writing my dear sister i write to you to acquaint you how unkindly we all take it here that you do not write oftener to us in relation to your health diversions and employment in the country you cannot be insensible how much you are beloved by us all judge then if you do right to omit giving us the only satisfaction absence affords to true friends which is often to hear from one another my mother is highly disobliged with you and says you are a very idle girl my aunt is of the same opinion and i would fain like a loving brother excuse you if i could pray for the future take care to deserve a better character and by writing soon and often put it in my power to say what a good sister i have for you shall always find me  your most affectionate brother due respects of every one here to my aunt and all friends in the country     letter xxiii in answer to the preceding dear brother most kindly and too justly do you upbraid me i own my fault and never will be guilty of the like again i write to beg my mothers pardon and that she will procure for me that of my good aunt on promise of amendment continue my dear brother to be an advocate for me in all my unintended imperfections and i will never err voluntarily for the future that so i may be as worthy as possible of your kind constructions and show myself what i truly am and ever will be  your most affectionate and obliged sister   letter xxiv from the daughter to her mother in excuse for her neglect honored madam i am ashamed i staid to be reminded of my duty by my brothers kind letter i will offer no excuse for myself for not writing oftener though i have been strangely taken up by the kindness and favor of your good friends here particularly my aunt windus for well do i know that my duty to my honored mother ought to take place of all other considerations all i beg therefore is that you will be so good to forgive me on promise of amendment and to procure forgiveness also of my aunt talbot and all friends believe me madam when i say that no diversions here or elsewhere shall make me forget the duty i owe to so good a mother and such kind relations and that i shall ever be  your gratefully dutiful daughter my aunt and cousins desire their kind love to you and due respects to all friends brother john has great reputation with every one for his kind letter to me     letter xxv from a soninlaw to his wifes father acquainting him with his wifes illness honored sir i am sorry to acquaint you with the indisposition of your dear daughter she was taken ill last monday of a fever and has all the assistance that we can procure in these parts i hope she is not in danger however i thought it my duty to let you know it in time that you may satisfy yourself that no care is wanting and that you may favor us with a personal visit which will be a great consolation to her who craves mean time your blessing and prayers and also to sir  your dutiful son   this may serve mutatis mutandis in the like circumstance for a daughter to her husbands father or mother and in several other intimate relations  letter xxvi from a country chapman beginning trade to a city dealer offering his correspondence manchester oct  0 sir the time of my apprenticeship with mr dobbins of this town being expired i am just going to begin for myself in chesterfield

letter xxxvi a father to a son to dissuade him from the vice of drinking to excess my dear son it is with a grief proportioned to my love which is extreme that i understand you have of late neglected your studies and given yourself up to the odious vice of drinking what shall i say what shall i do to engage you to quit this pernicious practice before it becomes such a habit that it will be impossible or at least very difficult for you to cast it off let me require let me entreat you to give a suitable attention to what i have to say on this head which i shall offer rather as a warm friend than an angry father and as i address myself to your reason i will leave it to yourself to judge of the truth of the observations i have to make to you  in the first place with respect to health the greatest jewel of this life it is the most destructive of all vices asthmas vertigoes palsies apoplexies gouts colicks fevers dropsies consumptions stone and hypochondriack diseases are naturally introduced by excessive drinking  all the rest of the vices together are not so often punished with sudden death as this one what fatal accidents what quarrels what breaches between friend and friend are owing to it  then in the second place how does it deface reason destroy all the tender impulses of nature make a wise man a fool and subject persons of the brightest parts to the contempt of the weakest and even in time extinguish those shining qualities which constitute the difference between a man of sense and a blockhead for as a certain very eminent author well observes fools having generally stronger nerves and less volatile spirits than men of fine understandings that which will rouse the one will make the other either stupid or frantic and though it sometimes whi the fit continues strengthens the imagination yet it always depresses the judgment and after the fit is over both those faculties languish together till in time it quenches the imagination impairs the memory and drowns the judgment  most other vices are compatible as the same author observes with several virtues but drunkenness runs counter to all the duties of life a great drinker can hardly be either a good husband a good father a good son a good brother or a good friend it lays him open to the worst company and this company frequently subjects him to lewd women gaming quarrels riots and often murders all other vices even the greatest of vices as ambition unchastity bigotry avarice hypocrisy detest this unnatural and worse than beastly vice for the beasts themselves even the uncleanest of them know nothing of it much less practice it  other vices indeed make men worse says this judicious author but this alters men from themselves to that degree that they differ not more from their present companions than from their former selves a habitude of it will make the prudent inconsiderate the ambitious indolent the active idle and the industrious slothful so that their affairs are ruined for want of application or by being entrusted in the hands of those who turn them wholly to their own advantage and in the end to the ruin of those who employ them  i have written a long letter already yet have i still more to say which that i may not tire you i will leave to another letter which the next post shall bring you and i am mean time in hopes this will not lose its proper effect  your most indulgent father   letter xxxvii the same subject pursued my dear son by my former you will see that hard drinking is a vice that breaks a mans rest impairs the understanding extinguishes the memory inflames the passions debauches the will lays the foundation of the worst and most dangerous distempers incapacitates a person from pursuing his studies and from applying to the duties of his calling be it what it will begets contempt from the world and even if a mans circumstances were above feeling the expense which can hardly be alters and changes the practiser of it from himself and if he is not above feeling it often reduces him to want and beggary and if he has a family his children who by their fathers industry and sobriety might have made a creditable figure in life are left to the mercy of the world become the outcasts of the earth possibly footsoldiers liveryservants shoecleaners linkboys and perhaps pickpockets highwaymen or footpads and instead of a comfortable livelihood and a station above contempt are entitled only to shame misery and the gallows  and do you judge my son how a man can answer this conduct to god to his parents and other relations to his wife to his children to himself and persist in a barbarous and an unnatural vice which makes himself not only miserable and contemptible but transmits the mischief to his unhappy and innocent children if he has any  add to all this that it is a vice a man cannot easily master and subdue or which like some others may be cured by age but it is a vice that feeds and nourishes itself by practice and grows upon a man as he lives longer in the world till at last if it cuts him not off in the flower of his days his body expects and requires liquor and so though a man when he enters upon it may be single yet if he ever should marry it may he attended with all the frightful and deplorable consequences i have mentioned and ruin besides an innocent and perhaps prudent woman rendering her without her own fault the joint unhappy cause of adding to the number of the miserable and profligate children with which the world too much abounds and which is owing to nothing so much as this detestable sin in the parents  consider all these things my dear son and before it be too late get the better of a vice that you will find difficult to subdue when it is grown to a head and which will otherwise creep upon you every day more and more till it shuts up your life in misery as to yourself and contempt as to the world and instead of giving cause even to your nearest and best friends to remember you with pleasure will make it a kindness in them to forget they ever had in the world if a parent such a son if a tutor such a pupil if a brother or sister such an unhappy near relation if a wife such a husband if a child such a father and if a friend such a wretched one that cannot be thought of without pity and regret for having shortened his days and ruined his affairs by so pernicious a habit  what a joy on the contrary will that noblest of conquests over yourself yield to all those dear relations and in particular what pleasure will you give to the aged heart and declining days of my dear child  your indulgent and most affectionate father   letter xxxviii from an apprentice to his master begging forgiveness for a great misdemeanor good sir i am so ashamed of myself for the last occasion i have given you to be angry with me after my repeated promises of amendment that i have not the courage to speak to you i therefore take this method of begging you to forgive what is past and let this letter testify against me if ever i wilfully or knowingly offend again for the future you have children of your own they may possibly offend though i hope they never will as i have done yet sir would you not wish they might meet with pardon if they should rather than reprobation  my making or my ruin i am sensible lies in your breast if you will not forgive me sad will be the consequence to me i doubt if you do you may save a soul as well as a body from misery and i hope sir you will weigh this with your usual goodness and consideration what is past i cannot help but for what is to come i do promise if god gives me health and power that my actions shall testify for me how much i am good sir  your repentant and obliged servant   letter xxxix the masters answer john your letter has affected me so much that i am willing once more to pass over all you have done surely i may at last depend on these your solemn assurances and as i hope deep contrition if not be it as you say and let your letter testify against you for your ungrateful baseness and for me in my readiness which however shall be the last time to forgive one that has been so much used to promise and so little to perform but i hope for better because i yet wish you well being as you use me  yours or otherwise   letter xl from an apprentice to his friends in praise of his master and family honored sir i know it will be a great satisfaction to you and my dear mother to hear that i go on very happily in my business and my master seeing my diligence puts me forward and encourages me in such a manner that i have great delight in it and hope i shall answer in time your good wishes and expectations and the indulgence which you have always shown me there is such good order in the family as well on my mistresss part as my masters that every servant as well as i knows their duty and does it with pleasure so much evenness sedateness and regularity is observed in all they injoin and expect that it is impossible but it should be so my master is an honest worthy man every body speaks well of him my mistress is a cheerful sweettemperd woman and rather heals breaches than widens them and the children after such examples behave to us all like ones own brothers and sisters who can but love such a family i wish when it shall please god to put me in such a station that i may carry myself just as my master does and if i should ever marry have just such a wife as my mistress and then by gods blessing i shall be as happy as they are and as you sir and my dear mother have always been if any thing can make me still happier than i am or continue to  my present felicity it will be the continuance of yours and my good mothers prayers for honored sir and madam  your ever dutiful son   letter xli another from an apprentice where the master is too remiss in his own affairs honored sir and madam you desire to know how i go on in my business i must needs say very well in the main for my master leaves every thing in a manner to me i wish he did not for his own sake for though i hope he will never suffer on the account of any wilful remissness or negligence much less want of fidelity in me yet his affairs do not go on so well as if he was more in them and less at the tavern but it becomes not me to reflect upon my master especially as what i may write or say on this head will rather expose his failings than do him service for as it must be his equals that should reprove him so all a servant can observe to others will do more harm than good to him one thing is at present in my own power and that is to double my diligence that his family suffer as little as possible by his remissness and another i hope by gods grace will be and that is to avoid in myself when my time comes those failings which i see so blameable in him and as this will be benefiting properly by the example for that be must be worse than a drone that cannot draw honey from a bitter as well as a sweet flower so it will give you the pleasure of knowing  your good instructions are not thrown away upon me and that i am and ever will be  your dutiful son   letter xlii to a country correspondent modestly requesting a balance of accounts between them sir i find myself constrained by a present exigence to beg you to balance the account between us though matters have run into some length yet would i not have applied to you had i known so well how to answer my pressing occasions any other way if it suits you not to pay the whole i beg sir you will remit me as much toward it as you can without prejudice to your other affairs and it will extremely oblige  your most humble servant   letter xliii in answer to the preceding sir i am very glad i have it in my power to send you now directly one hundred pounds on account between us which i do by our carrier who will pay you in specie i will soon remit you the balance of your whole demand and am only sorry that i gave occasion for this application for what is so justly your due when i send you the rest which will be in a few days if i am not greatly disappointed i will accompany it with an order which will begin a new debt but which i hope to be more punctual in discharging than i have been in the last i am very sincerely  your friend and servant   letter xliv a more pressing and angry letter from a city dealer on the same account mr barret i am sorry your ill usage constrains me to write to you in the most pressing manner can you think it is possible to carry on business after the manner you act by me you know what promises you have made me and how from time to time you have broke them and can i depend upon any new ones you make if you use others as you do me how can you think of carrying on business if you do not what must i think of a man who deals worse with me than he does with any body else  if you think you may trespass more upon me than you can on others this is a very bad compliment to my prudence or your own gratitude for surely good usage should be entitled to good usage i know how to allow for disappointments as well as any man but can a man be disappointed for ever trade is so dependent a thing you know that it cannot be carried on without mutual punctuality does not the merchant expect it from me for those very goods i send you and can i make a return to him without receiving it from you what end can it answer to give you two years credit and then be at an uncertainty for goods which i sell at a small profit and have not six months credit for myself indeed sir this will never do i must be more punctually used by you or else must deal as little punctually with others and what then must be the consequence  in short sir i expect a handsome payment by the next return and security for the remainder and shall be very loath to take any harsh methods to procure this justice to myself my family and my own creditors for i am if it be not your own fault  your faithful friend and servant   letter xlv in answer to the preceding sir i must acknowledge i have not used you well and can give no better answer to your just expostulations than to send you the enclosed draught for  0 l which you will be pleased to carry to my credit and to assure you of more punctual treatment for the future your letter is no bad lesson to me i have connd it often and hope i shall improve by it i am ready to give you my bond for the remainder which i will keep paying every month something till it is all discharged and what i write to you for in the interim shall be paid for on receipt of the goods this i hope sir will satisfy you for the present if i could do better i would but shall be streightend to do this but i think in return for your patience i cannot do less to convince you that i am now at last in earnest i beg you will continue to me the same good usage and service i have met with from you hitherto and that you will believe me to be unfeignedly  your obliged humble servant   letter xlvi to a young trader generally in a hurry in business advising method as well as diligence dear nephew the affection i have always borne you as well for your own sake as for your late fathers and mothers makes me give you the trouble of these lines which i hope you will receive as kindly as i intend them  i have lately called upon you several times and have as often found you in an extraordinary hurry which i well know cannot be sometimes avoided but methinks need not be always the case if your time were disposed in regular and proper proportions to your business i have frequently had reason to believe that more than half the flutter which appears among traders in general is rather the effect of their indolence than their industry however willing they are to have it thought otherwise and i will give you one instance in confirmation of this opinion in a neighbor of mine  this gentleman carried on for some years a profitable business but indulging himself every evening in a tavern society or club which the promotion of business as is usually the case gave the first pretense for he looked upon those engagements as the natural consequence of the approach of night and drove on his business in the day with precipitation that he might get thither with the earliest he seldom kept very late hours though he never came home soon the night being gone and his bottle emptied the morning was always wanted to dispel the fumes of the wine whoever therefore came to him before nine was desired to call again and when he rose so many matters waited for him as directly threw him into a flutter so that from his rising till dinnertime he seemed in one continued forment a long dinnertime he always allowed himself in order to recover the fatigues he had undergone and all his tabletalk was how heavy his business lay upon him and what pains he took in it the hearty meal and the time he indulged himself at table begot an inappetency for any more business for that short afternoon so all that could be deferred was put off to the next morning and longedfor evening approaching he flies to his usual solace empties his bottle by eleven comes home gets to bed and is invisible till next morning at nine and then rising enters upon his usual hurry and confusion  thus did his life seem to those who saw him in his business one constant scene of fatigue though he scarce ever applied to it four regular hours in any one day whereas had he risen only at seven in the morning he would have got all his business under by noon and those two hours from seven to nine being before many people go abroad he would have met with no interruption in his affairs but might have improved his servants by his own example directed them in the business of the day have inspected his books written to his dealers and put every thing in so regular a train for the rest of the day that whatever had occurred afterward would rather have served to divert than fatigue him  and what to cut my story short was the upshot of the matter why meeting with some disappointments and losses as all traders must expect and ought to provide for and his customers not seeing him in his shop so much as they expected and when there always in a disobliging petulant hurry and moreover mistakes frequently happening through the flurry into which he put himself and every one about him by these means his business dwindled away insensibly and not being able to go out of his usual course which helped to impair both his capacity and ardor to business his creditors began to look about them and he was compelled to enter into the state of his affairs and then had the mortification to find the balance of  000 l against him  this was a shocking case to himself but more to his family for his wife had lived and his children had been educated in such a manner as induced them to hope their fortunes would be sufficient to place them in a state of independence  in short being obliged to quit a business he had managed with so little prudence his friends got him upon a charitable foundation which afforded him bare subsistence for himself his children were dispersed some one way and some another into low scenes of life and his wife went home to her friends to be snubbd and reflected on by her own family for faults not her own  this example will afford several good hints to a young tradesman which are too obvious to need expatiating upon and as i dare say your prudence will keep you from the like fault you will never have reason to reproach yourself on this score but yet as i always found you in a hurry when i called upon you i could not but give you this hint for fear you should not rightly proportion your time to your business and lest you should suspend to the next hour what you could and ought to do in the present and so did not keep your business properly under method is every thing in business next to diligence and you will by falling into a regular one always be calm and unruffled and have time to bestow in your shop with your customers the female ones especially who always love to make a great many words in their bargainings and expect to be humored and persuaded and how can any man find time for this if he prefers the tavern to his shop and his bed to his business i know you will take in good part what i have written because you are sensible how much i am  your truly affectionate etc   letter xlvii from a son reduced by his own extravagance requesting his fathers advice on his intention to turn player honored sir after the many occasions i have given for your displeasure permit me to ask your advice in an affair which may render my whole life comfortable or miserable you know sir to what a low ebb my folly and extravagance have reduced me your generous indulgence has made you stretch your power to my shame i speak it even beyond the bounds which wisdom and a necessary regard to the rest of your family would permit therefore i cannot hope for further assistance from you something however i must resolve upon to gain a maintenance and an accident fell out yesterday which offers me at least present bread  mr rich master of one of the theaters happened to dine at my uncles when i was there after dinner the subject of discourse was the art of a comedian on which my uncle took occasion to mention the little flights in that way with which i have diverted myself in my gayer moments and partly compelled me to give an instance of my abilities mr rich was pleased to declare his approbation of my manner and voice and on being told my circumstances offered at once to take me into his company with an allowance sufficient for present subsistence and additional encouragement as i should be found to deserve it half a benefit he promised me the first season which by my otherwise too numerous acquaintaince might i believe be turned to pretty good account i am not fond of this life but see no other means of supporting myself like a gentleman your speedy answer will be ever gratefully acknowledged by honored sir  your dutiful though unhappy son   letter xlviii the fathers answer setting forth the inconveniences and disgrace attending the profession of a player dear gilbert i should be glad to have you in any situation which would afford you a comfortable and reputable subsistence but cannot think the life of a stage player proper for that end you must consider that though in the gay trappings of that employment a man may represent a gentleman yet none can be farther from that character if a perpetual dependence be the worst kind of servility in the first place the company you will be in a manner obliged to keep will be such as will tend little to the improvement of your mind or amendment of your morals to the master of the company you list in you must be obsequious to a degree of slavery not one of an audience that is able to hiss but you must fear and each single person you come to know personally you must oblige on every occasion that offers to engage their interest at your benefit a thought the most shocking to a free and generous mind and if to this you add the little profit that will attend making a low figure on the stage and besides the qualifications necessary the incredible fatigue attending the support of a good figure upon it you will easily see that more credit more satisfaction more ease and more profit may be got in many other stations without the mortifying knowledge of being deemed a vagrant by the laws of your country i hope this will be enough to dissuade you from farther thoughts of the stage and in any other employment you may yet expect some small assistance from  your loving father   letter xlix to a brother too captious to bear himself the ridicule he practices upon others dear jack i am glad to find you improve both in thought and speech you know i am no witch at either but so as we have some wit in our family no matter who is at the trouble of carrying it for what he will get by it i suppose you thought to give no small pleasure to the company last night by your facetious flings at all around you not excepting the parson himself but should you not have considered that every one in the room had a right to return the freedom you took in the best manner he was able was it therefore well in you to resent so warmly as you did a smart remark made by mr crispe on a palpable blunder of your own when you had taken so much liberty with him as well as every body else just before indeed brother you must either lay aside ridicule or learn to bear it better and in the present case you should have remembered that in the manner you began with that gentleman it was not possible for him to say any thing it would have been your credit to resent a retort on these occasions must be excused though fraught with resentment for a man is not always in a humor to be jested with and it is the duty of him who begins to take what follows your failing in this known rule whatever you may think has made you appear in so mean a light to the whole company that all your acuteness will not in haste atone for it  if i judge rightly nothing is more delicate than ridicule where it is conducted with prudence and humor it is sure to please even the man who is the subject of it if he is not of a morose temper but when instead of that personal failings or private indiscretions are exposed for the entertainment of a company though you may think to raise a laugh by it in the unreflecting it will bring upon you the censure of the considerate it is our duty to consult what we can bear ourselves as well as what we can inflict on others for my own part i know i cannot bear what is called a close rub as many men can and for that reason i never jest with any body unless by way of reprisal and that i shorten all i can lest my temper should not hold out  no doubt but you have more humor than i but if you do not blend in it a quantity of temper sufficient to carry it off you will be no gainer by the qualification the philosopher says that to bear and forbear are the highest points of wisdom if so where is his wisdom who will neither do the one or the other you may not like the freedom i have here taken but i respect you too well to pass over your foibles without some observation being  your truly affectionate brother   letter l to a friend on his recovery from a dangerous illness dear sir give me leave to mingle my joy with that of all your friends and relations in the recovery of your health and to join with them to bless god for continuing to your numerous wellwishers the benefit of your useful and valuable life may god almighty long preserve you in health and prosper all your undertakings for the good of your worthy family and the pleasure of all your friends and acquaintance in the hearty prayer of sir  your faithful friend and humble servant   letter li on the same occasion good sir i have received with great delight the good news of your recovery from the dangerous illness with which it pleased god to afflict you i most heartily congratulate you and your good lady and family upon it and make it my prayer that your late indisposition may be succeeded by such a renewal of health and strength both of body and mind as may make your life equally happy to yourself as it must be to all who have the pleasure to know you i could not help giving you this trouble to testify the joy that affected my heart on the occasion and to assure you that i am with the greatest affection and respect sir  your faithful humble servant   letter lii in answer to the preceding dear sir i give you many thanks for your kind congratulations my return of health will be the greater pleasure to me if i can contribute in any measure to the happiness of my many good friends and particularly to that of you and yours for i assure you sir that no body can be more than i am  your obliged humble servant   letter liii to a young lady advising her not to change her guardians nor to encourage any clandestine address dear miss the friendship which long subsisted between your prudent mother and me has always made me attend to your welfare with more than a common concern and i could not conceal my surprise at hearing that you intend to remove the guardianship of yourself and fortune from the gentlemen to whom your tender parents committed the direction of both i am afraid my dear your dissatisfaction arises more from sudden distaste than from mature reflection mr jones and mr pit were long the intimate friends and companions of your father for more than thirty years he had experienced their candor and wisdom and it was their fitness for the trust that duced him to leave you to their care and will  reflect upon his judgment  they are not less wise now than when he made his will and if they happen to differ from your judgment in any thing of moment what room have you to suppose yourself better able to judge of the consequences of what you desire than they i do not undervalue your good sense and yet i must tell you that the difference of years considered and their knowledge of the world which yet you can know little of it would he strange if they did not know better than you what was proper for you and their honesty was never yet disputed upon these considerations who is most probably to blame should you happen to disagree from such men you will never meet more restraints than is necessary for your happiness and interest for nothing that can injure you in any respect can add to their advantage or reputation i have known several young ladies of your age impatient of the least control and think hardly of every little contradiction but when by any unadvised step they have released themselves as they call it from the care of their tried friends how often have they had cause to repent their rashness how seldom do you hear those ladies who have subjected themselves to what some reckon the greatest restraints while young repent the effects of them when grown up  to mention the single article about which generally these differences arise that of marriage what good fruits can a lady hope from the insidious progress of a clandestine address a man who can be worth a ladys acceptance will never be ashamed or afraid to appear openly if he deserves to succeed or is conscious that he does what need of concealing his designs from her friends must it not be with a view to get her in his power and by securing a place in her affections make her weakness give strength to his presumption and forward those pretensions that he knew would otherwise be rejected with scorn  let me tell you my dear miss that you neither want sense nor beauty and no young gentleman can be ashamed of being known to love you consider this well and despise the man who seeks the aid of back doors bribed servants and gardenwalls to get access to your person if he had not a meaner opinion of your understanding than he ought he would not hope for success from such poor methods let him see then how much he is mistaken if he thinks you the giddy girl his clandestine conduct seems to call you in time advise with your tried friends trust no servant with secrets you would not have known to your equals or guardians and be sure ever to shun a servile confidant who generally makes her market of her mistress and sells her to the highest bidder  i hope dear miss you will seriously reflect upon all i have said and excuse the wellmeant zeal of  your sincere friend   letter live from a mother to her daughter jealous of her husband dear bet i am sorry to find you are grown jealous of your husband it is a most uneasy passion and will be fatal not only to your present quiet but to your future happiness and probably to that of your family if you indulge it  your either have or have not cause for it if you have cause look into yourself and your own conduct to see if you have not by any change of temper or disagreeableness of behavior alienated your husbands affections and if so set about amending both in order to recover them for once he loved you and you was satisfied he did above all your sex or you would not have had him if it be owing to his inconstant temper that is indeed unhappy but then so long as you are clear of blame you have nothing to reproach yourself with and as the creatures wicked men follow omit nothing to oblige them you must try to avoid such uneasy and disturbing resentments as will make you more and more distasteful to him show him that no guilty wretchs pretended love can be equal to your real one show him that such creatures shall not outdo you in an obliging behavior and sweetness of temper and that let him fly off from his duty if he will you will persevere in yours this conduct will if not immediately in time flash conviction in his face he will see what a goodness he injures and will be softened by your softness but if you make his home uneasy to him he will fly both that and you and to whom will he fly but most probably to one who will allow his pleas and aggravate every thing against you who will side with him inflame his passions and thereby secure him to herself and would you contribute to such a wretchs power over him and furnish opportunities for her to triumph over you for while you exasperate his passions and harden his mind against you she will by wicked blandishments show him how obliging she can be and so a course of life that he would follow privately and by stealth as it were he will more openly pursue he will grow shameless in it and so common is the vice mores the pity will find those who will extenuate it for their own sakes and throw the blame on the violence of your temper and say you drive him into these excesses thus much i write supposing you have reason to be jealous i will write yet another letter on this important subject i hope they will have the weight intended them by  your ever indulgent mother   letter lv the same subject continued dear bet what i wrote in my former was on a supposition that you had too much reason to be uneasy at your husbands conduct  i will now pursue the subject and put the case that you have no proof that he is guilty but your surmizes or perhaps the busy whisperings of officious makedebates in this case take care my betsey that you dont by the violence of your passions precipitate him on the course you dread and that you alienate not by unjust suspicions his affections from you for then perhaps he will be ready indeed to place them somewhere else where you may not so easily draw him off for he will may be think as to you if he be devoid of superior considerations that he may as well deserve your suspicions as be tiezed with them without deserving them  i know it is a most shocking thing to a sober young woman to think herself obliged to share those affections which ought to be all her own with a vile prostitute besides the danger which is not small of being entirely circumvented in her husbands love and perhaps have only his indifference if not contempt instead of it but my dear at the worst comfort yourself that you are not the guilty person for one day he will perhaps fatally find his error and consider besides my betsey that your case from an unfaithful husband is not near so bad as his would be from an unfaithful wife for child he cannot make the progeny of a bastard race succeed to his and your estate or chattels in injury of your lawful children if any such he should have the law of the land brands them whereas a naughty wife often makes the children of another man heirs of her husbands estate and fortune in injury of his own children or family so though the crime may be equal in other respects yet this makes the injury of the woman to the man greater than his can be to her  these thoughts i have thrown together as they occurred in two letters that i might not tire you with a length that yet the important subject required let me briefly sum up the contents  if he be guilty try by softness and kind expostulations to reclaim him before the vice be rooted in him if it be so rooted as that he cannot be drawn off you know not what god may do for you if you trust in him and take not upon yourself by giving up your mind to violence to be your own avenger a sick bed a tender conduct in you a sore disaster and who that lives is not liable to such may give him to see the error  his ways and show him the foulness of his crime which your good usage will aggravate upon  sober reflection with the no weak addition  ingratitude to so good a wife the wretch he has chosen for a partner in his guilt may by her sordid ways awake him by her libidinous deportment satiate him by her detected commerce with others for such creatures having once given themselves up to vice know no bounds make him abhor her and then he will see the difference between such a one and a chaste wife whose interests are bound up in his own and will admire you more than ever he did and you will have the pleasure besides in all probability of saving a soul that stands in so near a relation to your own  but if your uneasiness be owing to private talebearers and busy intermeddlers take care my dear you are not made a property of by such mischievous people take care that you make not your own present peace and your future good and that of your family and of him your injured husband the sacrifices to such pernicious busybodies  consider my dear all i have said and god bless you with a conduct and discretion suitable to the occasion before you and at the worst give you comfort and patience in your own innocence for such is this transitory life that all the ill or good we receive will be soon over with us and then the pushment of the former and the reward of the latter will make all scores even and what is past appear as nothing mean time i can but pray for you as my dear child becomes  your ever affectionate mother   letter lvi from a tender father to an ungracious son son john i am under no small concern that your continued ill courses give me occasion to write this letter to you i was in hopes that your solemn promises of amendment might have been better depended on but i see to my great mortification that all i have done for you and all i have said to you is thrown away what can i say more than i have said yet once more am i desirous to try what the force of a letter will do with one who has not suffered mere words to have any effect upon him perhaps this remaining with you if you will now and then seriously peruse it may in some happy moment give you reflection and by gods grace bring on your repentance and amendment  consider then i beseech you in time the evil of your ways make my case your own and think if you were to be father of such a son how his actions would grieve and afflict you but if my comfort has no weight with you consider my son how your present courses must impair in time a good constitution destroy your health and most probably shorten your life consider that your reputation is wounded i hope not mortally as yet that you will be ranked among the profligate and outcasts of the world that no virtuous man will keep you company that every one who has a regard for his own credit will shun you and that you will be given up to the society of the worst and most abandoned of men when you might be improved by the examples of the best that no family which values their own honor and the welfare of their child will suffer your addresses to a daughter worthy of being sought after for a wife should you incline to marry and that the worst of that sex must probably in that case fall to your lot which will make you miserable in this world when you might be happy  then as to another world beyond this transitory one my heart trembles for what most probably will be the consequence to your poor soul for the human mind is seldom at a stay if you do not grow better you will most undoubtedly grow worse and you may run into those sins and evils that you now perhaps think yourself incapable of as already you are arrived at a height of folly and wickedness that once you would have thought you could not have been guilty of dont my dear son let your poor mother and me have the mortification to think that we have been the unhappy means of giving life to a child of perdition instead of a child of glory that our beloved son with all the pains we have taken to instill good principles into his mind in hopes he would one day prove a credit and comfort to his family should instead of answering our longing wishes when at age take such contrary courses as will make us join to wish he had never been born  consider my dear son we dont want any thing of you but your own good we lived before you were born you have been a great expense to us to bring you up to these years you cannot now live without us but we can without you we hope god will continue your life to be still a further expense to us for all we live for is our childrens good let then the disinterestedness of our plea move you be but good to yourself that is all we require of you let us but have reason to hope that when we are dead and gone you will support our name with credit and be no burden to your poor sisters nor disgrace to our memories show us that you are of a generous not of a sordid nature and will probably set yourself above future misfortunes by reclaiming in time and then we shall be happy as god has done his part by you and given you talents that every one cannot boast let me beg you to consider only how much more noble it is to be in such a situation as shall enable you to confer benefits than such an one as shall lay you under the poor necessity to receive them from others and perhaps where they ought to be least expected  i have written a long letter the subject is next my heart and will excuse it god give a blessing to it god give you to see the error of your ways before it be too late and before you get such a habit as you cannot alter if you would let your poor mother and sisters look upon you with pleasure rather than apprehension in case god almighty should take me away from them et them think of you as a protector in my stead rather than as an ungrateful spoiler among them and you will then give comfort to my life as long as god shall spare it and alleviate instead of aggravate the pangs of my dying hour when god shall send it  my dear dear son i conjure you by all our past tenderness and affection for you by our hopes and our fears from infancy to manhood to think of all these things reflect upon the transitoriness of worldly enjoyments even when better chosen than yours are judge of the pleasures you expect in your present course by the vanity of the past of your next assignations by the aching head and undelighted heart which followed the last and you will find that no satisfaction which is not grounded on virtue and sobriety can be durable or worthy of a rational creature  your good mother who joins her tears so often with mine to deplore the sad prospect your ill courses give us joins also her prayers to mine that this my last effort may be attended with success and that you will not let us entreat in vain amen amen says  your indulgent and afflicted father   letter lvii the sons dutiful answer honored sir i am greatly affected with the tender and moving goodness expressed in your indulgent letter i am exceedingly sorry that all your good advice before has been so cast away upon me as to render this further instance of your paternal affection necessary i am resolved instantly to set about a reformation and to conform myself entirely to your good pleasure for the future and i beg sir the continuance of yours and my good mothers prayers to god to enable me to adhere to my present good resolutions i have so often promised and so often broken my word rather indeed through the strength of my passions than a design of nonperformance that i think i ought now to give you some proof that i am in earnest and what better can i give than to assure you that i will henceforth break myself from the frothy companions i used to take too much delight in and whose lewd banters and temptations have so frequently set aside my good purposes you sir for the future shall recommend the company proper for me to keep and i beg you will chalk out for me the paths in which you would have me tread and as much as possible i will walk in them and when i have convinced you of the sincerity of my reformation i hope sir you and my honored mother will restore me to your good opinions which it shall be my constant study to deserve i have already broke with george negus who attempted to laugh me out of my good resolutions and i beg leave to wait upon you for such a space of time as you shall think proper in order to break myself from the rest of my profligate companions and that i may have the benefit of your advice and direction for my future conduct god continue long for the benefit of us all your life and health and make me happy in contributing as much to your future comforts as i have by my past excesses to your trouble of mind is and shall always be the prayer of honored sir  your truly penitent and dutiful son   letter lviii to a friend on occasion of his not answering his letters dear sir it is so long since i had the favor of a line from you that i am under great apprehensions in relation to your health and welfare i beg you sir to renew to me the pleasure you used to give me in your correspondence for i have written three letters to you before this to which i have had no answer and am not conscious of having any way disobliged you if i have i will most willingly ask your pardon for nobody can be more than i am  your affectionate and faithful friend and servant   letter lix in answer to the preceding dear sir you have not cannot disoblige me but i have greatly disobliged myself in my own faulty remissness i cannot account for it as i ought to say i had business one time company another was distant from home a third will be but poor excuses for not answering one of your kind letters in four long months i therefore ingenuously take shame to myself and promise future amendment and that nothing shall ever while i am able to hold a pen make me guilty of the like neglect to a friend i love so well and have so much reason so to do forgive me then my good my kind my generous friend and believe me ever  your highly obliged humble servant   letter lx from a father to a son on his negligence in his affairs dear jemmy you cannot imagine what a concern your carelessness and indifferent management of your affairs give me remissness is inexcusable in all men but in none so much as in a man of business the soul of which is industry diligence and punctuality  let me beg of you to shake off the idle habits you have contracted quit unprofitable company and unseasonable recreations and apply to your comptinghouse with diligence it may not be yet too late to retrieve your affairs inspect therefore your gains and cast up what proportion they bear to your expenses and then see which of the latter you can and which you cannot contract consider that when once a man suffers himself to go backward in the world it must be an uncommon spirit of industry that retrieves him and puts him forward again  reflect i beseech you before it be too late upon the inconveniences which an impoverished trader is put to for the remainder of his life which too may happen to be the prime part of it the indignities he is likely to suffer from those whose money he has unthinkingly squandered the contempt he will meet with from all not excepting the idle companions of his folly the injustice he does his family in depriving his children not only of the power of raising themselves but of living tolerably and how on the contrary from being born to a creditable expectation he sinks them into the lowest class of mankind and exposes them to the most dangerous temptations what has not such a father to answer for and all this for the sake of indulging himself in an idle a careless a thoughtless habit that cannot afford the least satisfaction beyond the present hour if in that and which must be attended with deep remorse when he comes to reflect think seriously of these things and in time resolve on such a course as may bring credit to yourself justice to all you deal with peace and pleasure to your own mind comfort to your family and which will give at the same time the highest satisfaction to  your careful and loving father   letter lxi the sons grateful answer honored sir i return you my sincere thanks for your seasonable reproof and advice i have indeed too much indulged myself in an idle careless habit and had already begun to feel the evil consequences of it when i received your letter in the insults of a creditor or two from whom i expected kinder treatment but indeed they wanted but their own so i could only blame myself who had brought their rough usage upon me your letter came so seasonably upon this that i hope it will not want the desired effect and as i thank god it is not yet too late i am resolved to take another course with myself and my affairs that i may avoid the ill consequences you so judiciously forewarn me of and give to my family and friends the pleasure they so well deserve at my hands and particularly that satisfaction to so good a father which is owing to him by  his most dutiful son   letter lxii a young woman in town to her sister in the country recounting her narrow escape from a snare laid for her on her first arrival by a wicked procuress dear sister we have often by our good mother been warned against the dangers that would too probably attend us on coming to london though i must own her admonitions had not always the weight i am now convinced they deserved  i have had a deliverance from such a snare as i never could have believed would have been laid for a person free from all thought of ill or been so near succeeding upon one so strongly on her guard as i imagined myself and thus my dear sister the matter happened  returning on tuesday from seeing my cousin atkins in cheapside i was overtaken by an elderly gentlewoman of a sober and creditable appearance who walked by my side some little time before she spoke to me and then guessing by my asking the name of the street that i was a stranger to the town she very courteously began a discourse with me and after some other talk and questions about my country and the like desired to know if i did not come to town with a design of going into some genteel place i told her if i could meet with a place to my mind to wait upon a single lady i should be very willing to embrace it she said i looked like a creditable sober and modest body and at that very time she knew one of the best gentlewomen that ever lived who was in great want of a maid to attend upon her own person and that if she liked me and i her it would be a lucky incident for us both  i expressed myself thankfully and she was so very much in my interest as to entreat me to go instantly to the lady lest she should be provided and acquaint her i was recommended by mrs jones not doubting as she said but on inquiry my character would answer my appearance  as that you know was partly my view in coming to town i thought this a happy incident and determined not to lose the opportunity and so according to the direction she gave me i went to inquire for mrs c in jns court fleet street the neighborhood looked genteel and i soon found the house i asked for mrs c she came to me dressed in a splendid manner i told her what i came about she immediately desired me to walk into the parlour which was elegantly furnished and after asking me several questions with my answers to which she seemed very well pleased a servant soon brought in a bowl of warm liquor which she called negus consisting of wine water orange etc which she said was for a friend or two she expected presently but as i was warm with walking she would have me drink some of it telling me it was a pleasant innocent liquor and she always used her waiting maids as she did herself i thought this was very kind and condescending and being warm and thirsty and she encouraging me i took a pretty free draught of it and thought it very pleasant as it really was she made me sit down by her saying pride was not her talent and that she should always indulge me in like manner if i behaved well when she had not company and then slightly asked what i could do and the wages i required with my answers she seemed well satisfied and granted the wages i asked without any offer of abatement  and then i rose up in order to take my leave telling her i would any day she pleased of the ensuing week bring my clothes and wait upon her  she said that her own maid being gone away she was in the utmost want of another and would take it kindly if i would stay with her till next day because she was to have some ladies to pass the evening with her i said this would be pretty inconvenient to me but as she was so situated i would oblige her after i had been with my aunt and acquainted her with it to this she replied that there was no manner of occasion for that because she could send the cook for what i wanted who could at the same time tell my aunt how matters stood  i thought this looked a little odd but she did it with so much civility and seemed so pleased with her new maid that i scarcely knew how to withstand her but the apprehension i had of my aunts anger for not asking her advice in what so nearly concerned me made me insist upon going though i could perceive displeasure in her countenance when she saw me resolved  she then plied me very close with the liquor which she again said was innocent and weak but i believe it was far otherwise for my head began to turn round and my stomach felt a little disordered i entreated the favor of her to permit me to go on a firm promise of returning immediately but then my new mistress began to raise her voice a little assuring me i should on no account stir out of her house she left the room in a sort of a pet but said she would send the cook to take my directions to my aunt and i heard her take the key out of the outward door  this alarmed me very much and in the instant of my surprise a young gentlewoman entered the parlour dressed in white satin and every way genteel she sat down in a chair next me looked earnestly at me a while and seemed going to speak several times but did not at length she rose from her chair bolted the parlourdoor and breaking into a flood of tears expressed herself as follows  dear young woman i cannot tell you the pain i feel on your account and from an inclination to serve you i run a hazard of involving myself in greater misery than i have yet experienced if that can be but my heart is yet too honest to draw others as i am desired to do into a snare which i have fallen into myself you are now in as notorious a brothel as is in london and if you escape not in a few hours you are inevitably undone i was once as innocent as you now seem to be no apprehension you can be under for your virtue but i felt as much my name was as unspotted and my heart as unversd in ill when i first entered these guilty doors whither i was sent on an errand much like what i understand has brought you hither i was by force detained the whole night as you are designed to be was robbed of my virtue and knowing i should hardly be forgiven by my friends for staying out without their knowledge and in the morning being at a loss all in confusion as i was what to do before i could resolve on any thing i was obliged to repeat my guilt and had hardly time afforded me to reflect on its fatal consequences my liberty i entreated to no purpose and my grief served for the cruel sport of all around me in short i have been now so long confined that i am ashamed to appear among my friends and acquaintance in this dreadful situation i have been perplexed with the hateful importunities of different men every day and though i long resisted to my utmost yet downright force never failed to overcome thus in a shameful round of guilt and horror have i lingered out ten months subject to more miseries than tongue can express the same sad lot is intended you nor will it be easy to shun it however as i cannot well be more miserable than i am i will assist you what i can and not as the wretched procuress hopes contribute to make you as unhappy as myself  you may guess at the terror that seized my heart on this sad story and my own danger i trembled in every joint nor was i able to speak for some time at last in the best manner i could i thanked my unhappy new friend and begged she would kindly give me the assistance she offered which she did for the first gentleman that came to the door she stepped up herself for the key to let him in which the wretched procuress gave her and i took that opportunity as she directed to run out of the house and that in so much hurry and confusion as to leave my hood fan and gloves behind me  i told my aunt every circumstance of my danger and escape and received a severe reprimand for my following so inconsiderately in so wicked a town as this the direction of an entire stranger  i am sure sister you rejoice with me for my deliverance and this accident may serve to teach us to be upon our guard for the future as well against the viler part of our own sex as that of the other i am dear sister  your truly affectionate sister   n b this shocking story is taken from the mouth of the young woman herself who so narrowly escaped the snare of the vile procuress and is fact in every circumstance  letter lxiii to a daughter in a country town who encourages the address of a subaltern a case too frequent in country places dear betsy i have been under the deepest affliction ever since i heard of your encouraging the addresses of a soldier whether sergeant or corporal i know not who happens to quarter next door to your uncle  what my dear child can you propose by such a match is his pay sufficient to maintain himself if it be will it be sufficient for the support of a family  consider there will be no opportunity for you to increase his poor income but by such means as will be very grating for you to submit to will your hands be capable of enduring the fatigues of a washtub for your maintenance or will following a camp suit your inclinations think well of the certain misery that must attend your making such a choice  look round at the wives of all his fellow soldiers and mark their appearance at their homes and in public is their abject condition to be coveted do you see any thing desirable in poverty and rags and as to the man for whom you must endure all this he may possibly indeed be possessed of honesty and a desire to do his best for you at least you may think so but is it probable he will for if he be wise and industrious how came he to prefer a life so mean and contemptible if he was bred to any trade why did he desert it  be cautious of rushing yourself into ruin and as i am not able to maintain you and a young family do not throw yourself upon the uncertain charity of welldisposed people who are already vastly encumbered by the miserable i hope you will not thus rashly increase the unhappy number of such but will give due attention to what i have said for i can have no view but that of discharging the duty of  your loving father   letter lxiv of expostulation from a grave friend to a young man on his slighting and irreverent behavior to his father dear sir i take the freedom of a brief expostulation with you on your behavior to your father and i hope you will receive it from me with the same good will that i mean it  his indulgence to you formerly certainly claims better returns on your part although it should be allowed as you fondly imagine that his affection to you is alienated there may be something of petulancy in him which you ought to bear with for one time or other you may be convinced by experience that age itself has its insuperable afflictions that require the allowance of every one and more particularly of such who hope to live a long life themselves and still more particularly of a son whose high passions require perhaps at least as much allowance he may be petulant but are you not fiery and impetuous and i would fain know whether you ought to bear with him or he with you  it is a very groundless surmise to think his affections are alienated from you a father must love his son he cannot help it and is it credible even to yourself on cool reflection that the same good man who was wont to be delighted with your childish vanities and foibles for we have all had them more or less and even indulged and perhaps cherished those youthful forwardnesses that might be called the seeds of those passions which now being sprung up give him so much disturbance and make you so impatient of contradiction can you i say believe that this same good man without reason without provocation can change that love into hate  you are grown to mans estate and though far from the ungracious sons that we have seen in the world yet ought not to be so partial to yourself as to believe you are wholly faultless examine your own conduct then and although you should not be able to charge your intention with any blame yet you must leave your behavior to be judged by others and twill perhaps be given against you that some slight some negligence some inattention if not worse too cutting for a fathers cares and fondness to support has escaped you then consider sir what a grievous thing it must be to him to reflect that this behavior of yours may be but the gradual consequence of his former indulgence to you and that he is deservedly punished for not rooting up in your childish days those weeds which now spread to his uneasiness but let me tell you sir that it ought to be a more sad reflection to a considerate young gentleman that he is to be the instrument to punish his fond fathers faulty indulgence to himself  i have been a diligent observer of the dispensations of providence in this respect and have always seen the sin of undutifulness to parents punished in kind more than any one sin i have seen the son of the undutiful son revenging the cause of his grandfather and at the same time entailed a curse upon his son if he has not been taken off childless who in his turn has retorted the ungracious behavior and thus a curse has been entailed by descent upon the family from one generation to another  you will say that your behavior to your father is not you hope of such an atrocious nature as to be attended with such terrible consequences and perhaps will add that you do not wish for a better behavior from your son than you show to your father but if this be not partiality to yourself pray consider that while your father takes your present conduct in so ill part and you use so little circumspection to avoid giving him disgust and have so little complaisance as not to set him right the thing is full as tormenting to him from the appearance as if it were real nay it is real to him if he believes so  he thinks and let me tell you sir he thinks justly that he ought to expect as much deference to his will and pleasure now as he has heretofore shown you indulgence even in those things that now perhaps you are so unkind to suffer to turn severest upon him i would not recriminate but it was with very little reverence and indeed with an air as censurable as the words that you told him in my hearing that he knew not what he would have that he expected you to be more accountable at this age than when you were a child etc why dear sir does your being of age lessen the duty you owe to your father are not his cares for you allowably doubled and ought he not now to expect from your good sense and more mature understanding improved as it is to be hoped by the education he has at a great expense given you greater proofs of duty rather than less he may forget perhaps what he was at your age as you irreverently told him but how much more laudable would it be for you at yours to enter into what you would naturally expect from your son were you in the place and at the age of your father a generous mind will do its duty though it were not to meet with suitable rewards or returns for even should your father not do his by you you are not absolved of yours to him much less then ought the natural the consequential infirmities of age to dissolve the duty of a son to an indulgent parent  be convinced my dear sir of your wrong conduct and dont think it beneath the high spirit of a brave young gentleman to submit to the will of his father by your dutifulness and circumspection you may in all probability add to the number as well as the comfort of his days to whom you owe your being but whar a woe does that young man bring upon himself who robs his aged parent in both respects it behooves all children to reflect upon this timely and with awe  on how many occasions has he heretofore rejoiced to me on even the smallest openings and dawnings of your mind and genius how has he dwelt on your praises on even supposed beauties which have appeared such to his fond and partial tenderness only how has he extenuated your failings connived at your faults and extolled and brought forward into strong light even the remotest appearance of virtue in you such was always and such notwithstanding the intermixtures of age and infirmity and even of your continued slights and impatience always will be the instances of his paternal affection for you and i will venture to say that even this very petulance as you think it is a demonstration of his regard for you however disagreeable it may be to you since he loves you too well to be insensible to those parts of your behavior which he thinks are owing to slight or negligence  i have exceeded the bounds i intended when i began and would rather leave to your natural good sense and cooler reflection what i have already urged than tire you too much with what might still farther be added on this occasion but the affection and friendship i have for all your family and the long intimacy i have had with your good father who however knows nothing of my writing and the evil consequences that may follow a wider breach between you will answer for my intention and i hope for my freedom which i will take upon me to say i expect from your candor and education being  your sincere friend to serve you   letter lxv against too great a love of singing and music dear cousin i am sure you have the good sense to take kindly what i am going to mention to you in which i can have no possible view but your benefit when you were last with me at hertford you much obliged us all with the instances you gave us of your skill in music and your good voice but as you are so young a man and seem to be so very much pleased yourself with these acquirements i must enter a caution or two on this score because of the consequences that may follow from too much delight in these amusements which while they are pursued as amusements only may be safe and innocent but when they take up too much of a mans time may be not a little pernicious  in the first place my dear cousin these pleasures of sound may take you off from the more desirable ones of sense and make your delights stop at the ear which should go deeper and be placed in the understanding for whenever a cheerful singer is in company adieu to all conversation of an improving or intellectual nature  in the second place it may expose you to company and that not the best and most eligible neither and by which your business and your other more useful studies may be greatly if not wholly neglected and very possibly your health itself much impaired  in the third place it may tend for so it naturally does to enervate the mind and make you haunt musical societies operas and concerts and what glory is it to a gentleman if he were even a fine performer that he can strike a string touch a key or sing a song with the grace and command of a hired musician  fourthly music to arrive at any tolerable proficiency in it takes up much time and requires so much application as leaves but little room and what is worse when delighted in little inclination for other improvements and as life is a short stage where longest surely the most precious moments of it ought to be better employed than in so light and airy an amusement the time of youth will be soon over and that is the time of laying the foundation of more solid studies the mind as well as the body will become stiff by years and unsusceptible of those improvements that cannot be attained but in particular periods of it and once an airy delight engages the faculties a habit is formed and nothing but great struggle and absolute necessity if that will do it can shake it off one part of life is for improvement that is youth another part is for turning that improvement to solid benefits to ones self ones family or acquaintance that is the middle part another part carries a retrospect to a future estate and shall we lose the time of improvement which can never come again forfeit all the benefits of it in our middlelife and embitter our future prospect as well mundane as eternal with reflections on our past neglect of opportunities that never can be recalled and all for what why only to be deemed for eight or ten empty years of life a good companion as the phrase is  though perhaps a bad husband a bad father a bad friend and of course a bad man  some there are who divide life into four stages or opportunities he they say who is not handsome by twenty strong by thirty wise by forty rich by fifty will never be either handsome strong wise or rich and this generally speaking is a good and improving observation which should teach us as we go along to make a right use of those periods of life which may be proper entrances for us into a still more important one than that behind it  i have but lightly touched on these weighty points because i know you have good sense enough to improve as much from hints as others can from tedious lectures and when i have repeated that i am far from dissuading you from these amusements while they are restrained to due bounds and are regarded as amusements only i know you will think me what i always desire to be thought and what i truly am  your affectionate uncle and sincere friend   letter lxvi from a daughter to her father pleading for her sister who had married without his consent honored sir the kind indulgence you have always shown to your children makes me presume to become an advocate for my sister though not for her fault she is very sensible of that and sorry she has offended you but has great hopes that mr robinson will prove such a careful and loving husband to her as may atone for his past wildness and engage your forgiveness for all your children are sensible of your paternal kindness and that you wish their good more for their sakes than your own  this makes it the more wicked to offend so good a father but dear sir be pleased to consider that it now cannot be helped and that she may be made by your displeasure very miserable in her own choice and as his faults are owing to the inconsideration of youth or otherwise it would not have been a very discreditable match had it had your approbation i could humbly hope for my poor sisters sake that you will be pleased rather to encourage his present good resolutions by your kind favor than make him despair of a reconciliation and so perhaps treat her with a negligence which hitherto she is not apprehensive of for he is really very fond of her and i hope will continue so yet is she dejected for her fault to you and wishes yet dreads to have your leave to throw herself at your feet to beg your forgiveness and blessing which would make the poor dear offender quite happy  pardon sir my interposing in her favor in which my husband also joins she is my sister she is your daughter though she has not done so worthily as i wish to become that character be pleased sir to forgive her however and also forgive me pleading for her who am  your everdutiful daughter   letter lxvii the fathers answer my dear nanny you must believe that your sisters unadvised marriage which she must know would be disagreeable to me gives me no small concern and yet i will assure you that it arises more from my affection for her than any other consideration in her education i took all the pains and care my circumstances would admit and often flattered myself with the hope that the happy fruits of it would be made appear in her prudent conduct what she has now done is not vicious but indiscreet for you must remember that i have often declared in her hearing that the wild assertion of a rake making a good husband was the most dangerous opinion a young woman could imbibe  i will not however in pity to her point out the many ills i am afraid will attend her rashness because it is done and cannot be helped but wish she may be happier than i ever saw a woman who leaped so fatal a precipice  her husband has this morning been with  for her fortune and it was with much tempe i told him that as all she could hope for was wholly at my disposal i should disburse it in such a manner as i thought would most contribute to her advantage and that as he was a stranger to me i should choose to know he deserved it before he had the power over what i intended to do for her he bit his lip and with a hasty step was my humble servant  tell the rash girl that i would not have her to be afflicted at this behavior in me for i know it will contribute to her advantage one way or other if he married her for her own sake she will find no alteration of behavior from this disappointment but if he married only for her money she will soon be glad to find it in my possession rather than his  your interposition in her behalf is very sisterly and you see i have not the resentment she might expect but would to god she had acted with your prudence for her own sake i wish it i am  your loving father   letter lxviii to a brother against making his wife and children the constant subject of his praise and conversation dear brother the love i have always had for you and an unwillingness i find in myself to say any thing that may put you to confusion has made me take this method of acquainting you with a small indiscretion i have often observed in you and which i perceive gradually to gain ground as your family increases  what i mean is an immoderate inclination to make your spouse and your children the subject of discourse wherever you are imagine not that any pique or dislike draws this from me my sister i think is possessed of as many valuable qualities as most of her sex and all your children are very promising no wonder then that this view makes a very deep impression upon so tender a heart as yours and the fondness of a husband and of a father is what must make you esteemed by all who consider the many advantages arising from thence to posterity but a mind full of affection for what is so dear to himself stands in need of the utmost care to keep what concerns only himself from employing too much the attention of others what affects you most sensibly upon this subject is even by your friends heard rather with an ear of censure than applause and what the tender bias of a father swells in your conception to the most witty repartee by an ear destitute of that bias sounds neither witty nor uncommon and you cannot mortify many men more than by dragging out an unwilling ay very pretty indeed sir a charming boy or such a saying was far above his years truly which kind of yawning applause is sometimes by your attention being strongly fixed to your story mistaken for approbation and you thereupon launch out farther upon the same subject when your hearers are scarce able to conceal their inattention besides dont you consider that another man may have as great fondness for his as you have for yours and while your children are the wittiest the beautifullest the hopefullest in england do you not tacitly reflect upon every other mans children in the company  to me i grant you full liberty to say whatever you please nay several little tricks you tell of patty and tommy are agreeable enough to me and some i think even entertaining but to others have a close guard upon yourself lest when you try to get your children admired you should get yourself despised let you and me as father and uncle keep all their little whimsies to ourselves for as strangers share not in the affection and expense attending them why should they partake in the entertainment they afford  i hope my constant behavior has convinced you of my sincere regard for your interest and reputation what i have said i mean for your benefit and you know me too well to think otherwise of  your tenderly affectionate brother   letter lxix from a father to a daughter in dislike of her intentions to marry at too early an age dear sally i was greatly surprised at the letter you sent me last week i was willing to believe i saw in you for your years so much of your late dear mothers temper prudence and virtuous disposition that i refused several advantageous offers of changing my own condition purely for your sake and will you now convince me so early that i have no return to expect from you but that the moment a young fellow throws himself in your way you have nothing else to do but to give me notice to provide a fortune for you for that you intend to be of no further use and service to me this in plain english is the meaning of your notification for i suppose your young man does not intend to marry you without a fortune and can you then think that a father has nothing to do but to confer benefits on his children without being entitled to expect any return from them  to be sure i had proposed at a proper time to find a husband for you but i thought i had yet three or four years to come for consider sally you are not fully sixteen years of age and a wife believe me ought to have some better qualifications than an agreeable person to preserve a husbands esteem though it often is enough to attract a lovers notice  have you experience enough think you discreetly to conduct the affairs of a family i thought you as yet not quite capable to manage  house and i am sure my judgment always took a bias in your favor  besides let me tell you i have great exceptions to the person and think him by no means the man i would choose for your husband for which if it be not too late i will give good reasons  on the whole you must expect if you marry without my consent to live without my assistance think it not hard your disappointment cannot be greater than mine if you will proceed i have never used violent measures to you on any occasion and shall not on this but yet i earnestly hope you will not hurry yourself to destruction and  perhaps to the grave by an action which a little consideration may so easily prevent i am  your afflicted father   letter lxx from a father to a daughter against a frothy french lover dear polly i cannot say i look upon mr la farriere in the same favorable light that you seem to do his frothy behavior may divert well enough as an acquaintance but is very unanswerable i think to the character of a husband especially an english husband which i take to be a graver character than a french one there is a difference in these gay gentlemen while they strive to please and when they expect to be obliged in all men this is too apparent but in those of a light turn it is more visible than in others if after marriage his present temper should continue when you are a careful mother he will look more like a son than a husband if entering into the world should change his disposition expect no medium he will be the most insipid mortal you can imagine if his spirits should be depressed by the accidents of life he is such a stranger to reflection the best counselor of the wise that from thence he will be unable to draw relief and adversity to such men is the more intolerable as their deportment is suited only to the smiles of success  he dances well writes very indifferently is an artist at cards but cannot cast accounts understands all the laws of chance but not one of the land has shown great skill in the improvement of his person yet none at all that i hear of his estate and though he makes a good figure in company has never yet studied the art of living at home he sings well but knows nothing of business he has long acted the part of a lover but may not find the same variety and entertainment in acting the husband is very gallant but may not be over affectionate and is so tender of himself that he will have little time to indulge any body else  these child are my sentiments of him you are not wholly ignorant of the world i desire to guide not to force your inclinations and hope your calm reason will banish all farther thoughts of this gentleman who however you may like him for a partner at a ball seems not so well qualified for a journey through the various trials from which no station can exempt the married state i am  your affectionate father   letter lxxi a modest lover desiring an aunts favor to her niece good madam i have several times that i have been happy in the company of your beloved niece thought to have spoken my mind and to declare to her the true value and affection i have for her but just as i have been about to speak my fears have vanquished my hopes and i have been obliged to suspend my purpose i have thrown out several hints that i thought would have led the way to a fuller disclosing of the secret that is too big for my breast and yet when i am near her is too important for utterance will you be so good madam to break way for me if i am not wholly disapproved of by you and prepare her dear mind for a declaration that i must make and yet know not how to begin  my fortune and expectations make me hope that i may not on those accounts be deemed unworthy and could i by half a line from your hand hope that there is no other bar i should be enabled to build on so desirable a foundation and to let your niece know how much my happiness depends upon her favor excuse dear madam i beseech you this trouble and this presumptuous request from  your most obliged and obedient servant   letter lxxii the aunts answer supposing the gentleman deserves encouragement sir i cannot say i have any dislike as to my own part to your proposal or your manner of making it whatever my niece may have because diffidence is generally the companion of merit and a token of respect she is a person of prudence and all her friends are so thoroughly convinced of it that her choice will have the weight it deserves with us all so i cannot say what will be the event of your declaration to her yet so far as i may take upon myself to do i will not deny your request but on her return to me tomorrow will break the ice as you desire not doubting your honor and the sincerity of your professions and i shall tell her moreover what i think of the advances you make i believe she has had the prudence to keep her heart entirely disengaged because she would otherwise have told me and is not so meanspirited as to be able to return tyranny and insult for true value when she is properly convinced of it whoever has the happiness permit me though her relation to call it so to meet with her favor will find this her character and that it is not owing to the fond partiality of sir  your friend and servant   letter lxxiii the answer supposing the gentleman is not approved sir i have intimated your request to my niece who thinks herself obliged to your good opinion of her but begs that you will give over all thoughts of applying to her on this subject she says she can by no means encourage your address it is better therefore to know this at first because it will save her and yourself farther trouble i am sir  your humble servant   letter lxxiv from a respectful lover to his mistress dear madam i have long struggled with the most honorable and respectful passion that ever filled the heart of man i have often tried to reveal it personally as often in this way but never till now could prevail upon my fears and doubts but i can no longer struggle with a secret that has given me so much torture to keep and yet hitherto more when i have endeavored to reveal it i never entertain the hope to see you without rapture but when i have that pleasure instead of being animated as i ought i am utterly confounded what can this be owing to but a diffidence in myself and an exalted opinion of your worthiness and is not this one strong token of ardent love yet if it be how various is the tormenting passion in its operations since some it inspires with courage while others it deprives of all necessary confidence i can only assure you madam that the heart of man never conceived a stronger or sincerer passion than mine for you if my reverence for you is my crime i am sure it has been my sufficient punishment i need not say my designs and motives are honorable who dare approach so much virtuous excellence with a supposition that such an assurance is necessary what my fortune is is well known and i am ready to stand the test of the strictest inquiry condescend madam to embolden my respectful passion by e favorable line that if what i here profess  hope further to have an opportunity to assure  of be found to be unquestionable truth then my humble address will not quite be unacceptable to you and thus you will for ever oblige dear madam  your passionate admirer and devoted servant   letter lxxv the answer sir if modesty be the greatest glory of our sex surely it cannot be blameworthy in yours for my own part i must think it the most amiable quality either man or woman can possess nor can there be in my opinion a true respect where there is not a diffidence of ones own merit and an high opinion of the persons we esteem  to say more on this occasion would little become me to say less would look as if i knew not how to pay that regard to modest merit which modest merit only deserves  you sir best know your own heart and if you are sincere and generous will receive as you ought this frankness from  your humble servant   letter lxxvi a humorous epistle of neighbourly occurrences and news to a bottlecompanion abroad dear bob i am glad to hear youre in the land of the living still you expect from me an account of what has happened among your old acquaintance since you have been abroad i will give it you and bating that two or three years always make vast alterations in mature life you would be surprised at the havoc and changes that small space of time has made in the circle of our acquaintance to begin them with myself i have had the misfortune to lose my son jo and my daughter judy is married and has brought me another jo jack kid of the fountain where we kept our club has lost his wife who was a special barkeeper got his maid prise with child  you remember the slut by her mincing airs  married her and is broke but not till he had with his horrid stum poisoned half the society we began to complain of his wine you know before you left us and i told him he should let us have neat who drank our gallons if he was honest to himself and if he was to regard conscience as well as interest must do less harm by dispensing his ratsbane to those who drank pints than to those honest fellows who swallowed gallons and in so handsome a dose of the one must take a too large quantity of the other but the dog was incorrigible for he went on brewing and poisoning till he killed his best customers and then what could he expect  why what followed for truly bob we began to tumble like rotten sheep as thus the dance was begun by that seasoned sinner tim brackley the halfpint man who was always sotting by himself with his whets in the morning his correctives after dinner and digesters at night and at last tipped off of one of the kitchenbenches in an apoplexy it is true he was not of our club though we might have taken warning by his fall as the saying is but were above it so the rot got among us and first honest laughing jack adams kicked up of a fever tom dandy fell into a jaundice and dropsy and when his doctors said he was mending slipped through their fingers in spite of their art and assurance roger harman the punster then tipped off the perch after very little warning and was followed in a week by arthur sykes ralph atkyns bid us goodbye in a few months after him and ben tomlyns who you remember would never go home sober tumbled down stairs and broke his collarbone his surgeon took him first a fever next then his doctor and then as it were of course death a natural round enough you will say bob his widow made a handsome burial for poor ben took on grievously and in five weeks married her journeyman jemmy hawkins was a long time ailing yet would not leave off so he died as one may say of a more natural death ralph rawlins sell sick after a large dose and had so narrow an escape that he was srightend into a regimen and now drinks asses milk of another complexion than that which gave him his malady and between physic and the hyp serves for a memento mori to others and neither lives nor dies himself while honest capt tinker who was deep gone in a consumption is in very little better case and if any thing saves him and me and the rest of our once numerous society it will be the bankruptcy of our worthy landlord for that has quite broke us up  so much for the club bob now to the neighborhood about us that you and i knew next best  jerry jenkyns the prim mercer has had a statute taken out against him and   s in the pound is all the result of his pragmatical fluttering dan pocock the draper has had an estate left him and quitted business while sam simpson the grocer has lost one in law and gone mad upon it see bob the ups and downs of this transitory state harry barlow the turkey merchant has left off to his nephew and now pines for want of employment joshua williams the cheesemonger a strange projecting fellow you know is carried out of his shop into a sponginghouse by his own maggots john jones the organist is married to sykess daughter peggy who proves an arrant shrew and has broke about his head his best cremona fiddle in the sight of half a dozen neighbors the wise of job johnson our swordcutler has elopd from him you know they always lived like dog and cat paul lanes daughter poll has had a bastard by squire wilsons coachman and the squires own daughter miss nelly has run away with her fathers postilion dick jenkyns that vile rake and beau is turned quaker and that still greater libertine peter mottram methodist while old satan to make up his loss in these two has subdued will wigley and tom allen who you know used to be very hopeful young fellows and are now rakes of the town tony williams i had like to have forgot he has cheated all our expectations having escaped the gallows and died a natural death after a hundred rogueries every one of which deserved hanging  parson matthews goes on preaching and living excellently and has still as many admirers as hearers but no preferment while old clumsy parson dromedary is made a dean and has hopes by his sisters means who is a favorite of a certain great man to be a bishop  as to news of a public nature the papers which no doubt you see in the monthly collections at least will inform you best of that by them however you will find very little judgment to be formed of our affairs or our ministers as to the one being or the other doing right or wrong for while some are made as black as devils on one side they are made as white as angels on the other they never did one good thing says the enemy they never did one bad one says the friend for my own part i think considering the undoubted truth of the maxim humanum est errare and how much easier it is to find a fault than to mend one the gentlemen in the administration will be well off if the public will middle the matter between the two extremes mean time one side goes on accusing without mercy the other acquitting without shame it is the business of one set of papers to bespatter and throw dirt and of the other to follow after them with a scrubbingbrush and a dishclout and after all  the one bedaubs so plentifully and the other wipes off so slovenly that let me be hanged bob if i would appear on change with the coat on my back that a certain great man stalks about in without concern when these dawbers and scowerers have done their worst and their best upon it but it is a great matter to be used to such a coat and a great happiness i will warrant your namesake thinks it that with all this rubbing and scrubbing it does not appear threadbare yet after twenty years wear and a hundred people trying to pick holes in it  but i have done with my news and my politics in which i was ever but a dabbler and having written a terrible long letter and given you as it were the world in miniature think it time to close it which i shall do with wishing that now our poisoning landlord kidd is broke and gone you were among us your old friends nowandthen to enliven us with your cheerful pipe as you used to do in the days of yore when we were all alive and merry and with this hearty wish i conclude myself dear bob  your old bottlecompanion and humble servant   letter lxxvii from a nephew to his aunt on his slow progress in a courtship affair dear aunt i have made my addresses in the best manner i can to miss dawley but have not the least room to boast of my success the account you gave me of her good sense and many uncommon qualifications will not permit me to arraign her conduct and the good opinion i have long entertained of myself makes me very slow in blaming my own i would have obeyed your orders to write to you sooner but knew not what to say and by waiting till i began to fear you would think me negligent i am in no better condition i first declared my regard for her in a manner i thought most suitable for that purpose she very encouragingly made me no answer and when i spoke again upon the subject she asked how you did and was glad to hear you were well being put out of my play i talked of indifferent things a good while and at last fell again upon the reason of my attending her she ordered the cloth to be laid and complaisantly hoped i would stay supper i had no more opportunity for that time  two days after i repeated my visit she received me at first politely but when i began to resume the subject i came upon she rung for the maid and bad her put on the teakettle about six visits passed before i could obtain one word to my business and the first thing she answered upon that head was that length of time was necessary to the making of an acquaintance that must not be either blushed at or repented of this she spoke with such an air of gravity as put what i would have replied quite out of my head yet next visit i began again i told her how happy i should think myself if i could be encouraged to hope for the smallest share of her favor but she made me such an odd answer as plainly demonstrated to me that i had more of her contempt than approbation this made me as earnest as she to wave the subject and so we went on upon the weather for a whole week before and when we had done that we talked politics and admiral vernon and lord cathcarts expedition and the like stuff took place so that in short after two months study how to accomplish the happiness you pointed out for me i find myself not one single step advanced for when i see her now we both talk with seeming satisfaction on any subject where love has no part but when that is introduced all her easy eloquence sinks into reserve  i would not determine to give up my address before i had your farther advice in hopes of which i am  honored madam your dutiful nephew   letter lxxviii the aunts answer encouraging him to persevere nephew robert i thought you had been better acquainted with the art of love than to be so easily out of heart that such a lady as miss dawley has not forbid your visits let me tell you is encouragement as much as you ought to expect she is a lady of fine sense and has had the advantage of as fine an education and you must not expect a lady of her prudence and merit will be won by general compliments or that her affection will be moved by the notion of a sudden and precipitate passion her judgment must be first touched for she views marriage as a serious thing by it her mother was made happy and her sister undone i injoin the continuation of your addresses for a more deserving lady than miss does not live and be sure at least to be more ambitious of appearing a man of sense than a lover when the latter is accepted on account of the former the lady does credit to her choice you young fellows have such notions of a ninedays courtship that if it were indulged by all women none would in a short time be thought obliging who did not make modesty submit to passion and discretion to compliment i desire to hear from you again a month hence and am in the mean time  your affectionate aunt   letter lxxix a gentleman to a lady professing an aversion to the tedious forms of courtship dear madam i remember that one of the ancients in describing a youth in love says he has neither wisdom enough to speak nor to hold his tongue if this be a just description the sincerity of my passion will admit of no dispute and whenever in your company i behave like a fool forget not that you are answerable for my incapacity having made bold to declare thus much i must presume to say that a favorable reception of this will i am certain make me more worthy your notice but your disdain would be what i believe myself incapable ever to surmount to try by idle fallacies and airy compliments to prevail on your judgment is a folly for any man to attempt who knows you no madam your good sense and endowments have raised you far above the necessity of practicing the mean artifices which prevail upon the less deserving of your sex you are not to be so lightly deceived and if you were give me leave to say i should not think you deserving of the trouble that would attend such an attempt  this i must own is no fashionable letter from one who i am sure loves up to the greatest hero of romance but as i would hope that the happiness i sue for should be lasting it is certainly most eligible to take no step to procure it but what will bear reflection for i should be happy to see you mine when we have both outlived the taste for every thing that has not virtue and reason to support it i am madam notwithstanding this unpolished address  your most respectful admirer and obedient servant   letter lxxx the ladys answer encouraging a farther declaration sir i am very little in love with the fashionable methods of courtship sincerity with me is preferable to compliments yet i see no reason why common decency should be discarded there is something so odd in your style that when i know whether you are in jest or earnest i shall be less at a loss to answer you mean time as there is abundant room for rising rather than sinking in your complaisance you may possibly have chosen wisely to begin first at the lowst end if this be the case i know not what your succeeding addresses may produce but i tell you fairly that your present make no great impression yet perhaps as much as you intended on  your humble serv   letter lxxxi the gentlemans reply more explicitly avowing his passion dearest madam now i have the hope of being not more despised for my acknowledged affection i declare to you with all the sincerity of a man of honor that i have long had a most sincere passion for you but i have seen gentlemen led such dances when they have given up their affections to the lovely tyrants of their hearts and could not help themselves that i had no courage to begin an address in the usual forms even to you of whose good sense and generosity i had nevertheless a great opinion you have favored me with a few lines which i most humbly thank you for and i do assure you madam if you will be pleased to encourage my humble suit you shall have so just an account of my circumstances and pretensions as i hope will entitle me to your favor in the honorable light in which i profess myself dear madam  your most obliged and faithful admirer be so good as to favor me with one line more to encourage my personal attendance if not disagreeable     letter lxxxii the ladys answer to his reply putting the matter on a sudden issue sir as we are both so well inclined to avoid unnecessary trouble as well as unnecessary compliments i think proper to acquaint you that mr johnson of pallmall has the management of all my affairs and is a man of such probity and honor that i do nothing in any matters without him i have no dislike to your person and if you approve of what mr johnson can acquaint you with in relation to me and i approve of his report in your favor i shall be far from showing any gentleman that i have either an insolent or a sordid spirit especially to such as do me the honor of their good opinion i am sir  your humble servant   letter lxxxiii a facetious young lady to her aunt ridiculing her serious lover dear aunt i am much obliged to you for the kindness you intended me in recommending mr leadbeater to me for a husband but i must be so free as to tell you he is a man no way suited to my inclination i despise it is true the idle rants of romance but am inclinable to think there may be an extreme on the other side of the question  the first time the honest man came to see me in the way you was pleased to put into his head was one sunday after sermon time he began with telling me what i found at my fingersends that it was very cold and politely blowed upon his i immediately perceived that his passion for me could not keep him warm and in complaisance to your recommendation conducted him to the fireside after he had pretty well rubbed heat into his hands he stood up with his back to the fire and with his hand behind him held up his coat that he might be warm all over and looking about him asked with the tranquillity of a man a twelvemonth married and just come off a journey how all friends did in the country i said i hoped very well but would be glad to warm my fingers cry mercy madam  and then he shuffled a little further from the fire and after two or three hems and a long pause   i have heard said he a most excellent sermon just now dr thomas is a fine man truly did you ever hear him madam no sir i generally go to my own parish church that is right madam to be sure what was your subject today the pharisee and the publican sir a very good one truly dr thomas would have made fine work upon that subject his text today was evil communications corrupt good manners a good subject sir i doubt not the doctor made a fine discourse upon it o ay madam he cannot make a bad one upon any subject i rung for the teakettle for thought i we shall have all the heads of the sermon immediately  at tea he gave me an account of all the religious societies unasked and how many boys they had put out prentice and girls they had taught to knit and sing psalms to all which i gave a nod of approbation and was just able to say for i began to be horribly in the vapors it was a very excellent charity o ay madam said he again for that is his word i find a very excellent one truly it is snatching so many brands out of the fire you are a contributor sir i doubt not o ay madam to be sure every good man would contribute to such a worthy charity to be sure no doubt sir a blessing attends upon all who promote so worthy a design o ay madam no doubt as you say i am sure i have sound it blessed be god and then he twangd his nose and lifted up his eyes as if in an ejaculation  o my good aunt what a man is here for a husband at last came the happy moment of his taking leave for i would not ask him to stay supper and moreover he talked of going to a lecture at st helens and then though i had had an opportunity of saying little more than yes and no all the time for he took the vapors he had put me into for devotion and gravity at least i believe he pressed my hand looked frightfully kind and gave me to understand as a mark of his favor that if upon further conversation and inquiry into my character he should happen to like me as well as he did from my behavior and person why ruly i need not fear in time being blessed with him for my husband  this my good aunt may be a mighty safe way of traveling toward the land of matrimony as far as i know but i cannot help wishing for a little more entertainment on our journey i am willing to believe mr leadbeater an honest man but am at the same time afraid his religious turn of temper however in itself commendable would better suit with a woman who centres all desert in a solemn appearance than with dear aunt  your greatly obliged kinswoman   letter lxxxiv her aunts answer reprehending her ludicrous turn of mind cousin jenny iam sorry you think mr leadbeater so unsuitable a lover he is a serious sober good man and surely when seriousness and sobriety make a necessary part of the duty of a good husband a good father and good master of a family those characters should not be the subjects of ridicule in persons of our sex especially who would reap the greatest advantage from them but he talks of the weather when he first sees you it seems and would you have him directly fall upon the subject of love the moment he beheld you  he visited you just after sermon on a sunday and was it so unsuitable for him to let you see that the duty of the day had made proper impressions upon him  his turn for promoting the religious societies which you speak so slightly of deserves more regard from every good person for that same turn is a kind of security to a woman that he who had a benevolent and religious heart could not make a bad man or a bad husband to put out poor boys to prentice to teach girls to sing psalms would be with very few a subject for ridicule for he that was so willing to provide for the children of others would take still greater care of his own  he gave you to understand that if he liked your character on inquiry as well as your person and behavior he should think himself very happy in such a wife for that i dare say was more like his language than that you put in his mouth and let me tell you it would have been a much stranger speech had so cautious and serious a man said without a thorough knowledge of your character that at the first sight he was over head and ears in love with you  i think allowing for the ridiculous turn your airy wit gives to this his first visit that by your own account he acted like a prudent a serious and a worthy man as he is and as one that thought flashy compliments beneath him in so serious an affair as this  i think cousin jenny this is not only a mighty safe way as you call it of traveling toward the land of matrimony but to the land of happiness with respect as well to the next world as this and it is to be hoped that the better entertainment you so much wish for on your journey may not lead you too much out of your way and divert your mind from the principal view which you ought to have to your journeys end  in short i could rather have wished that you could bring your mind nearer to his standard than that he should bring down his to your level and you would have found more satisfaction in it than you imagine could you have brought yourself to a little more of that solemn appearance which you treat so lightly and which i think in him is much more than mere appearance  upon the whole cousin jenny i am sorry that a woman of virtue and morals as you are should treat so ludicrously a serious and pious frame of mind in an age wherein good examples are so rare and so much wanted though at the same time i am far from offering to prescribe to you in so arduous an affair as a husband and wish you and mr leadbeater too since you are so differently disposed matched more suitably to each others mind than you are likely to be together for i am  your truly affectionate aunt   letter lxxxv from a gentleman to his mistress resenting her supposed coquetry madam beauty has charms which are not casily resisted but it is i presume in the power of the finest woman breathing to counterbalance all her charms by a conduct unworthy of them this manner of speaking madam is what i am apprehensive you have not been enough used to the advantages you possess independently of any act of your own cannot be any warrant for a behavior repugnant to honor and strict good manners i ventured to address myself to you madam upon motives truly honorable and best to be defended but suffer me to say that i never proposed to glory in adding one to the number of your public admirers or to be so tame as to subject myself to any usage and if this be your intention and this only i shall still admire you but must leave the flattering of your vanity to gentlemen who have more leisure and less sincerity than madam  your most obedient servant   letter lxxxvi the ladys angry answer sir by the letter i just now received from you i fansy you have been a little too hasty as well at too free in your conjectures about my conduct i hope it is such and will be always such as shall justify me to persons of honor of my own sex as well as yours you have surely sir a right to act as you please and at present however so have i how long i should have this liberty were i at your mercy this letter of yours gives me a most desirable and seasonable intimation  for goodness sake sir let me do as i think proper i see you will i sent not for you nor asked you to be one of the number you mention and if you think fit to withdraw your name from the list can i help it if i would ever so fain but could you not do this without resolving to affront me and to reflect on my conduct i am unworthy of your address i grant it  then you can forbear it perhaps i like to see the young fellows dying for me but since they can do it without impairing their health dont be so very angry at me in short sir you are your own master and heaven be thanked i am at present my own mistress and your wellmannerd letter will make me resolve to be so longer than perhaps i had otherwise resolved you see my follies in my conduct thank you sir for letting me know you do i see your sex in your letter thank you sir for that too so being thus much obliged to you in a double respect can i do otherwise than subscribe myself  your thankful servant   letter lxxxvii the gentlemans submissive reply dear madam i beg ten thousand pardons for my rash letter to you i wished too late i could have recalled it and when i had the favor of yours i was under double concern but indeed madam you treated me i thought too lightly and contempt is intolerable where a mind is so sincerely devoted i never saw a lady i could love before i saw you i never shall see another i wish to be mine and as i must love you whether i will or no i hope you will forgive my foolish petulance i am sure it was inspired by motives that however culpable in their effects are entitled to your forgiveness as to the cause i cannot meanly sue though to you dont let me undergo too heavy a penance for my rashness you can mould me to any form you please but dear lady let not my honest heart suffer the more torture because it is so devotedly at your service once again i ask a thousand pardons  what can i say more  i own i am hasty but it is most when i think myself slighted or used contemptuously by those i love such tempers madam are not the worst let me tell you and though i may be too ready to offend yet am i always as ready to repent and dear good madam let me be received to favor this once and i will be more cautious for the future for i am and ever must be whether you will allow it or not  your most devoted admirer and humble servant   letter lxxxviii the ladys forgiving return sir i cannot help answering your letter because you seem sensible of your fault if your temper is so captious your guard against it should be the stronger it is no very comfortable view let me tell you that one sees a person who wants to recommend himself to ones friendship so ready to take fire what has a woman to do in common discretion but to avoid while she can a prospect so unpleasing for if she knows she cannot bear disreputable imputations as indeed she ought not and that the gentleman is not able to contain himself whenever he is pleased to be moved from giving them why this truly affords a most comfortable appearance of a happy life however sir i cannot bear malice for a first fault though yet it looks like a temper even in a friend that one would rather fear than love but if it be never repeated at least till i give such reasons for it that neither charity nor a professed esteem can excuse i shall hope that what has happened may rather be of good than bad use to us both but indeed i must say that if you cannot avoid such disagreeable instances of your sensibility it will be justice to both now we are both free to think no more of  your humble servant   letter lxxxix ridiculing a romantic rhapsody in courtship sir my niece desires me to acquaint you that she received your celestial epistle last night as we were all sitting down to supper and she leaves it to me to answer it according to the effects it has produced you must know then that as soon as she had read it there appeared a more mavelous metamorphosis in her deportment than any we read of in ovid she put on high airs and talked in a lofty strain to us as well as to the maids nor knew she how to behave all the rest of the evening  you had so thoroughly proved her superior to all the deities of the ancients that she could not help fansying the homely viands that stood before her a banquet of paradise and when she put to her lips some of our common tabledrink it became immediately in her fancy nectar and ambrosia and she affected to sip rather than drink when by your generous aid she had thus raised herself far above mortality she began to despise our company and thought her grandmother and me too highly favored by her presence and spoke to us in such a tone as made us honest mortals amazed at her sudden elevation  in short sir as she has placed such a thorough confidence in you as to believe whatever you are pleased to tell her she begs you will never so far mortify her towering ambition as to treat her like any thing earthly  if then you would make yourself worthy of her favor you must in order to support the description you have given of her at least dart through the clouds or rise with the morninggoddess and attend in her airy chariot at her chamberwindow where you say all the graces wait so that you will not be displeased with your company  indeed she is under a concern which you must supply for what kind of birds you will find to draw her chariot for doves and peacocks she would scorn to borrow of venus and juno whom you make so much her inferiors  here she put on a royal air we will conclude our own letter ourself said she so taking pen in hand she writes as underneath  dont let me when the car is quite in readiness be rudely disturbed but tell mercury i would have him tap softly at my window i will rise in all my glory whip into my starry calash and rush through the regions of light till despising mortality we shall form some new constellation which some happy astrologer may perhaps in honor of us both style the twinklers of moorfields when i have chosen my new name i will deign to write it till when i can only style myself most obliging sir  your celestial etc   letter xc against a young ladys affecting manly airs and also censuring the modern ridinghabits dear betsey the improvement that is visible in your person since your going to bury gives me much pleasure and the dawning of fine sense and a good judgment that discovers itself in your conversation makes me hope to see every perfection of my sister your late excellent mother revived in you  yet one thing the duty of a tender uncle obliges me to blame in you and that is a certain affectation that of late obtains in your behavior of imitating the manners of the other sex and appearing more masculine than either the amiable softness of your person or sex can justify  i have been particularly offended let me tell you my dear at your new ridinghabit which is made so extravagantly in the mode that one cannot easily distinguish your sex by it for you neither look like a modest girl in it nor an agreeable boy  some conformity to the fashion is allowable but a cocked hat a laced jacket a fops peruke what strange metamorphoses do they make and then the air assumed with them so pert and so insipid at the same time makes upon the whole such a boygirl figure that i know of nothing that would become either the air or the dress but a young italian singer for such an one being neither man nor woman would possibly be best distinguished by this hermaphrodite appearance  in short i would have you remember my dear that as sure as any thing intrepid free and in a prudent degree bold becomes a man so whatever is soft tender and modest renders your sex amiable in this one instance we do not prefer our own likeness and the less you resemble us the more you are sure to charm for a masculine woman is a character as little creditable as becoming  i am no enemy to a proper presence of mind in company but would never have you appear bold talkative or assured modesty in the outward behavior is a strong prepossession in a ladys favor and without it all your perfections will be of little service either as to reputation or preferment you want not sense and i hope will take kindly these wellintended hints from  your affectionate uncle   letter xci letter of a father to a daughter relating to three persons of different characters proposed to him each for her husband with his recommendation of one in years dear polly i have three several proposals made me on your account and they are so particularly circumstanced that i cannot approve of one of them  the first is by mr aldridge for his son john who you know is very weak in his intellects and so apt to be misled that he wants a guardian for him in a wife and so does you the reputation to think you a proper person for that office but i think the worst weakness in the world in a husband is that of intellect and i should suffer much to have you linked to a man who has no head and is for that reason highly unworthy to be yours a foolish wife is much more tolerable because she can be kept up but a foolish husband will do what he pleases and go where he pleases and though he knew nothing else will think he knows too much to be controuled by his wife and will have this lesson taught him by rakes and libertines when he is capable of no other so i did not think it necessary so much as to consult you about him  the second is from mr gough for his son richard who has run through such a course of libertinism that he has hardly his fellow and has neither a sound head nor a sound body and is so far from being reclaimed that his father proposes a wife as the last hope for him and yet knows not whether he will accept of one if one can be found that would venture upon him so i could not think of suffering my daughter to stand either to the courtesy or lie at the mercy of so profligate a rake though it seems he vouchsafes to like you better as his father says than any one he ever saw which was the reason of the old mans application to me  the third was from mr tomkins whose nephew is as bad a sot as the other is a rake but who promises to reform if his uncle can procure my consent and yours but as you had refused his overtures when made to yourself without consulting me and for the very reasons i should have rejected him i would not trouble you about him but gave a total denial to the request of his uncle who desired that the matter might be brought on again by my authority and interposition  so my good girl has had hard fortune as one may say in the offers of three persons that it is impossible she should choose out of one so very a fool a second so profligate a rake and the third so vile a sot that there could be no thought of any of the three  but i have a fourth affair to mention to you against which there can lie but one objection and that is some disparity in years this is my good friend mr row as honest a man as ever lived a man of prudence a man of good fortune and easy circumstance master of a genteel house and business well respected by all the world and most by those who know him best a goodnatured man humane compassionate and though frugal not a niggard  now my dear daughter what think you of mr row  he has an high opinion of your prudence and discretion but wishes himself that you were either ten years older or he ten years younger  yet he thinks if you can get over that point he could make you one of the fondest of husbands and that there is not any thing but he could and would oblige you in  i too my dear wish there was a nearer agreement in years yet considering the hazards a young woman runs as the world goes from rakes sots and fools of every degree considering that in this matter there is but one only thing to be wished for and that all the grand desirables of life will be so well supplied considering too that he is a sightly a neat a personable man and has good health good spirits and good humor and is not yet got quite at the top of the hill of life considering all these things i say i think that one consideration might be given up for the many other more material ones which would be so well supplied in this match  say my dear daughter say freely what you think you will much oblige me if you can get this matter over but if you cannot and be so happy as i wish you  why then  i dont know what to say  but i must  i think  acquiesce but yet i could once more wish  but i will say no more till i have your answer but that i am  your most indulgent father   letter xcii her answer dutifully expostulating on the case honored sir i am sensible of the obligations which both nature and gratitude lay me under to obey your commands and am willing to do so at all events if what i have to offer be not thought sufficient to excuse my compliance  mr row is i believe possessed of all the merit you ascribe to him but be not displeased dear sir when i say that he seems not so proper an husband for me as for a woman of more years and experience  his advanced years give me leave to say will be far from being agreeable to me and will not my youth or at least the effects of it in some particulars be distasteful to him will not that innocent levity which is almost inseparable from my time of life appear to him in a more despisable light than perhaps it deserves for sir is not a likeness of years attended with a likeness of manners a likeness of humors an agreement in diversions and pleasures and thinking too and can such likenesses such agreements be naturally expected where the years on one side double the number of the other besides sir is not this defect if i may so call it a defect that will be far from mending by time  your great goodness and the tenderness i have always experienced from you have emboldened me to speak thus freely upon a concern that is of the highest importance to my future welfare which i know you have in view from more solid motives than i am capable of entertaining and if you still insist upon my obedience i will only take the liberty to observe that if i do marry mr row it will be entirely the effect of my duty to the best of fathers and not of an affection for a gentleman that i respect in every other light but that you propose him in and dear good sir consider then what misunderstandings and evil consequences may possibly arise from hence and render unhappy the future life of  your most dutiful daughter i am greatly obliged to you sir that you refused without consulting me the three strange overtures you mention     letter xciii his reply urgently enforcing but not compelling her compliance with his desire dear polly i am far from taking amiss what you have written in answer to my recommendation of my worthy friend mr row and i am sure if i was to show him your letter he would never permit you to be urged more on this head but my dear i own my wishes and my heart are engaged in his shall i say or in your own favor and i would hope that notwithstanding all you have written your good sense and that discretion for which you have been hitherto so deservedly noted may on mature reflection enable you to overcome the objection that would be insuperable to lighter and airier minds of your sex  such is the profligateness of the generality of young fellows of the present age that i own i look into the world with affrightment at the risques which a virtuous young woman has to encounter with on a change of condition which makes me dwell upon the point with the greater earnestness and you know my dear i can have no motive but your good  then child consider the reputation this match to all who know mr rowes worth will bring to your prudence and even to your sex for it is as much credit to a young lady to marry a worthy man older than herself as it is discredit for an old woman to marry a young man does my polly take my meaning the case is plain besides nobody thinks ten or twelve years difference in a mans age any thing out of the way so my dear it is not twenty years odds it is only ten at most  then again he is a goodnatured man there is a great deal in that you know  to be sure my dear it is my good opinion of your prudence that makes me endeavor to persuade you to this and i could be glad methinks to find that i have not too high a notion of your discretion in the preference i am willing to give it to that of all the young ladies i know  but if i am mistaken i mean if you cannot get over this one difficulty i shall be apt to think so surmountable does it seem to me that you have seen somebody you like and are prepossessed yet i cannot believe that neither because you know i have so tender a regard for your own option that you would have made me acquainted with it  yet after all far be it from me to compel your inclinations but if you should be so happy as to think with me that the many valuable qualitics mr row is possessed of are scarcely to be hoped for in a younger man as the world now goes you would make me very happy and i am persuaded you will never repent your choice  one thing more let me urge my dear for you see how my hearts upon it how many very virtuous young maidens have married for the sake of riches only a man much older much more disagreeable waspish humoursome diseased decrepit and yet have lived years without reproach and made themselves not unhappy and will not my dear daughter do as much to oblige her father and where health goodnature wisdom discretion and great circumstances meet to enforce the argument as others would do where not one of these advantages are in the case except the single article of riches only then my dear let mr row attend you two or three times before you absolutely set yourself against him and as i hope your affections are entirely disengaged you will soon see whether his conversation or proposals will not incline you in his favor considering all things that is to say considering the one thing against him and the many for him and if it cannot be i will entirely acquiesce being ever studious of your happiness as becomes  your indulgent father   letter xciv to a rich widow lady with children dissuading her from marrying a widower of meaner degree who has children also dear madam it is with some reluctance and great respect that i prevail on myself to give you this trouble the frequent visits mr clarkson makes you and the airs that gentleman gives himself have given birth to a report that a treaty of marriage between you is on foot and that in all probability it will be soon brought to effect  to be sure mr clarkson is not to be blamed to endeavor to procure for his wife a lady of your prudence good character and fortune but whether you will be able to avoid the censure of the world if you choose him for a husband is another point which greatly concerns you to consider of and affects me and all who wish you well  his fortune madam is not equal to yours supposing it to be better than the world reports it he has children so have you what inconveniences may not arise from hence especially as he is not thought to be one of the best and smoothesttemperd men in the world  his character is not equal in any respect to say the least for i would not detract from any mans merit to that of your late good spouse my dear friend who would have been much grieved if he had had but the least apprehension that the man he would not have accompanied with should succeed him in his bed  far be it from me dear madam if you are so disposed as to wish to hinder you from a change of condition with a suitable person but as your late spouse left his and your children so much in your power methinks you should take especial care how and to whom you communicate any part of that power and thereby give a right to control not only them but yourself must he not be partial to his own children and will he not expect that your complaisance to him should make you so too or at least be his childrens behavior what it will that it shall induce you to put them upon a par with your own his daughters will be spies upon your conduct and be you ever so kind to them will always suspect your partiality to your own and treat you as their motherinlaw and their father will believe all they shall suggest for that very reason and because he will judge though perhaps not allow for that you ought to prefer your own to his and this will be the source of perpetual uneasinesses between you consider dear madam whether your late affectionate spouse deserved from you that his children and your own should be put upon such difficulties in favor of those of any other person whatever  no doubt but you may make your own conditions with mr clarkson he will be glad to call you and your fortune his upon any terms but consider madam how difficult it may be whatever articles you make for a good wife who has been accustomed to think her interest the same with that of her husband to refuse to his importunities and perhaps to his convenience if not necessities those communications of fortune which you may reserve in your own power when they will make him easier in circumstance and more complaisant in temper and how hard it will be to deny a man any thing to whom you have given your person and to whom you have vowed duty and obedience but if you should have the resolution to refuse him what he may not be backward to ask do you think yourself so well able to bear that indifference if not worse which such a refusal may occasion and would you choose to have advantage taken of your tenderest hours either to induce you to acquiesce with importunities which complied with may hurt your children or to have those tender moments dashed with suspicions of selfishness and design for prudence will oblige you to be on your guard that even the highest acts of kindness and the strongest professions of affection may not be preparative arts to obtain from you concessions you ought not to make and how will the pure joys which flow from an unsuspected union of minds and interests the want whereof will make any matrimony unhappy be found in a state thus circumstantiated  if madam you are bent upon a change of condition your friends would wish first that you will be pleased absolutely to ascertain the fortunes of your children according to the design and will of their dear father as far as may legally be done either by choosing trustees for them or by such other way as shall put it out of a new husbands power to hurt them and when he shall know this is done you will have a better testimony of his affection as he will know what is and what is not yours and can hope for no more because it is not in your power to give more but how much more is it to be wished for your own sake as well as your childrens that if you do change it may be with a person who has no children and then what other children may be the results of your new marriage they will be your own as well as his and so be more properly entitled to your care and your kindness than any mans children by another wife can be  by this means madam most of the uneasinesses we every day see in families where are two sorts of children will be prevented or perhaps your present children will be grown up and out of the way before the other can interfere essentially with them or if not they will be naturalized as one may say to each other and having the same mother who has an equal interest in them all will expect and allow for an equal exertion of tenderness and favor to all  i will trouble you with no more at present on this head and am confident that when you consider maturely what i have written and the respectful manner in which i have ventured to give my opinion and my own disinterestedness besides and that i might still have urged other powerful motives which i forbear in honor to you you will have the goodness to excuse the liberty i have taken which is so suitable to the laws of friendship by which i am bound to be dear madam  your zealous wellwisher and humble servant   instructions to young orphan ladies as well as others how to judge of proposals of marriage made to them without their guardians or friends consent by their milaners mantuamakers or other gobetweens  a young orphan lady of an independent fortune receivable at age or day of marriage will hardly sail of several attempts to engage her affections and the following general rules and instructions will be of use to her on these occasions  in the first place she ought to mistrust all those who shall seek to set her against her guardian or those relations to whom her fortune or person is entrusted and next to be apprehensive of all such as privately want to be introduced to her and who avoid treating with her guardian first for his consent for she may be assured that if a young man has proposals to make which he himself thinks would be accepted by a person of years and experience he will apply in a regular way to her friends but if he has not he will hope to engage the young ladys affections by the means of her milaner her mantuamaker or her servant and so by bribes and promises endeavor to make his way to her favor in order to take advantage of her youth and inexperience for this is the constant method of fortunehunters to which many a worthy young lady of good sense and good fortune has owed her utter ruin  the following are generally the methods taken by this set of designers  these industrious gobetweens who hope to make a market of a young ladys affections generally by letter or word of mouth if they have opportunity set forth to the young lady  that there is a certain young gentleman of great merit of a handsome person and fine expectations or prosperous business who is fallen deeply in love with her and very probably the young lady having no bad opinion of herself and loving to be admired believes it very easily  that he has seen her at church or the opera the play the assembly etc and is impatient to make known his passion to her  that he is unwilling to apply to her guardian till he knows how his address will be received by herself  that besides it may very probably be the case that her guardian may form obstacles which may not be reasonable on her part to give into  that if he has daughters of his own he would perhaps rather see them married first  that he may not care to part with her fortune and the reputation and convenience the management of it may give him  that he may design to marry her when he thinks proper to some person agreeable to his own interest or inclinations without consulting hers as he ought  that therefore it would be best that her guardian should know nothing of the matter till she saw whether she could approve the gentleman or not  that even then she might encourage his address or disccountenance it as she pleased  that for her the proposers part she had no interest in the world one way or other and no view but to serve the young lady and to oblige a young gentleman so well qualified to make her happy and suchlike plausible assurances ending perhaps with desiring to bring on an interview or if that will not be admitted that she will receive a letter from him  this kind of introduction ought always to be suspected by a prudent young lady she ought with warmth and resentment to discourage the officious proposer she ought to acquaint her  that she is resolved never to give way to a proposal of this importance without the consent and approbation of her guardian or friends  that her good father or mother who had seen the world and had many years experience of her guardians honor and qualifications for such a trust knew what they did when they put her under his care  that he had always shown an honest and generous regard for her welfare  that she took it very unkindly of the proposer to offer to inspire her with doubts of his conduct when she had none herself nor reason for any  that it was time enough when he gave her reason to be apprehensive of his sinister designs or of his preferring his own interest to hers  that it was a very strange attempt to make her mistrust a friend a relation a gentleman who was chosen for this trust by her dear parents on many years experience of his honor and probity and of whose goodness to her for so long time past she herself had many proofs and this in favor of a person who had a visible interest to induce him to this application whose person she hardly knew if at all whose professions she could not judge of who began by such mean such groundless such unworthy insinuations who might or might not be the person he pretended and who wanted to induce her to prefer himself on no acquaintance at all to a gentleman she had so many years known and whose honor good character reputation and conscience were all engaged to her as so many pledges for his honorable behavior to her  that she the proposer and the young gentleman too must have a very indifferent opinion of her gratitude her prudence her discretion to make such an attempt upon her  that if he could approve himself to a man of years and experience who was not to be imposed upon by blind passion in the light he wanted to appear in to her why should he not apply to him first  that surely it was a very ungenerous as well as suspicious method of proceeding that he could find no other way to give her an opinion of himself but by endeavoring to depreciate the character of a gentleman who by this method plainly appeared to his own apprehension to stand in the way of his proceedings and that too before he had tried him and which showed that he himself had not hope of succeeding but by arts of delusion flattery and a clandestine address and had nothing but her own inadvertence and inexperience to build upon  that therefore it behoved her had she no other reason to reject with resentment and disdain a conduct so affrontive to her understanding as well as selfish and ungenerous in the proposer  that therefore she would not countenance any interview with a person capable of acting in such a manner nor receive any letter from him  and lastly that she desires never to hear of this matter again from her the proposer if she would have her retain for her that good opinion which she had hitherto had  this prudent reasoning and conduct will make the intervener quit her design upon the young lady if she is not wholly abandoned of all sense of shame and corrupted by high bribes and promises and in this case the young lady will judge how unfit such a person is either for her confident or acquaintance nor will the lady lose an humble servant worthy of being retained or encouraged for if he be the person he pretends he will directly apply to her guardian and have a high opinion of her prudence and discretion and if she hears no more of him she may conclude he could not make good his pretensions to a person of discernment and will have occasion to rejoice in escaping his designing arts with so little trouble to herself  if a lady has had actually a letter delivered her from such a pretender and that by means of a person who has any share in her confidence and wants a form of a letter to send to the recommender to discourage the proceeding the following which has been sent with good effect on a like occasion may be proper letter xcv mrs pratt i enclose the letter you put into my hands and hope it will be the last i shall ever receive from you or any body else on the like occasion i am entirely satisfied in the care and kindness of my guardian and shall encourage no proposal of this sort but what comes recommended to me by his approbation he knows the world i do not and that which is not fit for him to know is not fit for me to receive and i am sorry either you or the writer looks upon me in so weak a light as to imagine i would wish to take myself out of the hands of so experienced a friend to throw myself into those of a stranger yet i would not as this is the first attempt of the kind from you and that it may rather be the effect of inconsideration than design show it my guardian because he would not perhaps impute it to so favorable a motive in you as i am willing to do being  your friend and servant     if there be no gobetween but that a young fellow takes upon himself to send letters to teize a young lady to encourage his address by his romantic professions of his affection and regard for her and attributing such perfections to her as no one woman ever had and if she is desirous but knows not how to get rid of his troublesome importunity and that even a contemptuous silence which it is prudent for a young lady to show on such an occasion has no effect upon him nor yet that he will desist though she returns his letters unopend or in a blank cover after she happens to have read them then let the lady get some friend to write to him looking upon him as beneath her own notice for even a denial if given in writing under her own hand will encourage some presumptuous men or at least they may make some use of it to the ladys disadvantage and ought not to have it to boast that they have received a letter from her though ever so much to their own discredit if it were shown and the following may be the form letter xcvi sir you have thought fit to write to miss knollys twice or thrice in a very troublesome manner she cannot possibly so far forget what belongs to herself and character as to answer you any other way than by the contempt of silence yet since she cannot it seems be free from your impertinence she wishes you may be told that you must have as mean an opinion of her judgment as all who read your epistles must have of yours if you can expect success from such inconsistent rhapsodies  i will from myself venture to give you one piece of advice that the next person you pretend to address with your bright compositions you dont in them forget one ingredient which is common sense though you should be forced to borrow it i am  yours unknown     or if this be thought too affronting the following letter xcvii sir you are desired to send no more of your elaborate epistles to miss knollys you are quite mistaken in the lady she knows herself and by your letter she knows you so well that she sends it back that you may find some other person to send it to whose sentiments and understanding are better proportioned to your own i am sir etc     if the letters of the young fellow deserve less severity and are such as have not their foundation in romance and bombast but yet the lady thinks not proper to encourage his address this form may serve letter xcviii sir i am desired to acquaint you that miss knollys thinks herself obliged to every one who has a good opinion of her but begs that you will not ve yourself or her the trouble of any more etters for things are so circumstanced that she has neither inclination nor power to encourage your address i am sir  your humble servant unknown     if the lady has a mind to rebuke the attempt of a clandestine address to her and yet thinks the proposal not absolutely unworthy of attention did it come regularly to her by means of her father mother guardian etc this form may be observed letter xcix sir miss knollys desires you should be informed which she presumes you did not know that she can never think herself at her own disposal while she has so near and so good a friend to advise with as mr archer whose wisdom she much prefers to her own as his experience in the world and kindness to her make him deserve to be consulted in all her affairs of moment whatever shall appear fit to him will have great weight with her and there is but that one possible way to engage her attention i am sir  yours etc     or if the lady has not a guardian or father or mother but some friend in whom she can conside the following may be a proper form letter c sir it may not be amiss to acquaint you that miss knollys is so happy as to have a friend of experience and probity without whose advice she undertakes nothing of consequence it is mr salter of grace church street and she will not care to admit of any proposal of moment to her that has not passed his approbation this she hopes will save her and yourself the trouble of any further applications i am  your humble servant     or this letter ci sir mr salter of grace church street being a gentleman that miss knollys consults in all her affairs she refers to him all proposals that are or may be of importance to her and desires to receive no more letters or messages from you by any other hand i am  your humble servant unknown     letter cii from a towntenant to his landlord excusing delay of payment honored sir i am under a great concern that i cannot at present answer your just expectations i have sustained such heavy losses and met with such great disappointments of late that i must intrude another quarter on your goodness then whatever shifts i am put to you shall hear to more satisfaction than at present from sir  your most obliged humble servant   letter ciii from a country tenant to the same purpose honored sir the season has been so bad and i have had such unhappy accidents to encounter with in a sick family loss of cattle etc that i am obliged to trespass upon your patience a month or two longer the wheatharvest i hope will furnish me the means to answer your just expectations which will be a great contentment to  your honest tenant and humble servant   letter civ the landlords answer mr jacobs i have yours i hope you will be as good as your word at the expiration of the time you have mentioned i am unwilling to distress any honest man and i hope that i shall not meet with the worse usage for my forbearance for lenity abused even in generous tempers provokes returns that some people would call severe but should not be deemed such if just i am  yours etc   letter cv a threatening letter from a steward on delay of payment mr atkins i have mentioned your case to sir john as you requested he is exceedingly provoked at your usage and swears bloodily he will seize and throw you into gaol if he has not  0 l at least paid him by quarterday which is now at hand so you know what you have to trust to and i would have you avoid the consequences at any rate for he is resolved otherwise to do as he says of this i assure you who am  yours etc   letter cvi the poor tenants moving answer good mr taverner i am at my wits end almost on what you write but if i am to be ruined with my numerous family and a poor industrious but ailing wife how can i help it for i cannot possibly raise  0 l any manner of way by the time you mention i hope sir john will not be so hardhearted for if god almighty our common landlord should be equally hard upon us what would become of us all forgive my boldness to talk of god almighty to his honor in this free manner  i would do it if it was to be done but you know sir what a season we have had and an honester tenant his honor will never have that i am sure of but if money will not rise what can i do should i sell my team and my utensils for labor there is an end of all i shall have no means left me then wherewith to pay his honor or any body else if his honor will not be moved but will seize pray good mr taverner prevail on him not to throw me into gaol for a prison pays no debts but let my poor wife and six small children lie in the barn till i can get a little daylabour for that must be all i can have to trust to if his honor seizes i hear my man william that was has just taken a farm may be he will employ his poor ruined master if i am not imprisoned but if i be why then the parish must do something for my poor children though i hoped they would never trouble it lay these things before his honor good sir and forgive this trouble from  his honors honest though unfortunate tenant   letter cvii the stewards reply giving more time mr atkins i have laid your letter and your case before sir john he is moved with it and says he will have patience another quarter to see what you will do consider man however that gentlemen live at a great expense are obliged to keep up their port and if their tenants fail them why then they must fail their tradesmen and suffer in their credit you have good crops of all kinds on the ground and surely may by next quarter raise  0 or  0l though you could not raise  0l in a fortnight this sir john will expect at least i can tell you and you may comply with it from the produce of so good a farm surely i am  yours etc   letter cviii the poor mans thankful letter in return god bless his honor and god bless you mr taverner that is all i can say we will now set our hands to the plough as the saying is with cheerful hearts and try what can be done i am sure i and my wife and children too though three of them can but lisp their prayers shall morning noon and night pray to god for his honors health and prosperity as well as for you and yours and to enable me to be just to his expectations i am sure it would be the pride of my heart to pay every body his honor especially i have not run behindhand for want of industry that all my neighbors know but losses and sickness i could not help and nobody could live more frugal and sparing than both my wife and i indeed we have hardly allowed ourselves clothes to our backs nor for our children neither tight and clean and wholesome as they may appear to those who see them and we will continue to live so low as may only keep us in heart to do our labor until we are got beforehand which god grant but all this i told you before mr taverner and so will say no more but i will do all i can and god give a blessing to my labors as i mean honestly so no more but that i am sir  your everobliged servant   letter cix an offer of assistance to a friend who has received great losses by a persons failure dear sir i am exceedingly concerned at the great loss which you have lately sustained by the failure of mr tranter i hope you behave under it like the man of prudence you have always shown yourself and as one who knows how liable all men are to misfortunes i think it incumbent on this occasion not to console you by words only but in the spirit and with the cheerfulness of a most sincere friend to offer my service to answer any present demand so far as  00 l goes which you shall have the use of freely for a twelvemonth or more if your affairs require it and will even strain a point rather than not oblige you if more be necessary to your present situation you will do me great pleasure in accepting this offer as freely as it is kindly meant by dear sir  yours most faithfully   letter cx the friends answer accepting the kind offer my dear friend how shall i find words to express the grateful sense i have of your goodness this is an instance of true friendship indeed i accept most thankfully of some part of your generous offer and will give you my bond payable in a year for  00l which is at present all i have occasion for and if i did not know i could then if not before answer your goodness as it deserves i would not accept of the favor this loss is very heavy and affecting to me as you may suppose yet your generous friendship is no small comfort to me in it for so good a friend is capable of making any calamity light i am dear sir  your most faithful and obliged humble servant   letter cxi the friends answer supposing he has no occasion dear sir a thousand thanks to you for your generous offer and kind advice i have been not a little affected at the unexpected failure of a man all the world thought as good as the bank but at present i have no occasion for your friendly assistance if i should i know no one in the world i would sooner choose to be obliged to for i am dear kind sir  your most obliged humble servant   letter cxii of consolation to a friend in prison for debt dear sir i am exceedingly concerned to hear that the severity of your creditors has laid you under confinement but there is one comfort results from it that the utmost stretch of their revenge cannot carry them farther and that when a man is got to the undermost part of fortunes wheel he may rise but cannot sink lower you now know the worst and have nothing to do but to support your misfortune with that true magnanimity which becomes a noble mind long very long have you been laboring under great difficulties and so have been enured to misfortunes and you have looked forward with such anxiety and pain to the hard lot that has now befallen you that it is impossible the bearing of it can be equal to the apprehensions you had of it you see all around you too many unhappy objects reduced to the same distress and you see them either extricating themselves from those difficulties as i hope you soon will or learning to bear them with a true christian resignation for well does the wise man observe that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong nor riches to a man of understanding and it will yield you some consolation when you reflect that this life is but a state of probation and he that meets with misfortunes here may by a proper use of them and by gods grace be entitled to a blessed hope when a prosperous state may make a man forgetful of his duty and so reap no other good but what he finds in this transitory life remember my friend that the school of affliction is the school of wisdom and so behave under this trying calamity as to say with the royal prophet it is good for me that i was afflicted  i think myself however not a little unhappy that my circumstances will not permit me to assist you on this grievous occasion in the way a friend would choose to do if he was able but if by my personal attendance on any of your creditors or friends i can do you pleasure or service i beg you to command me for in whatever is in my poor power i am and shall ever be  your faithful friend and servant   letter cxiii in answer to the preceding dear sir i now experience fully the truth of the honest english phrase that a friend in need is a friend in deed you have filled me with such unspeakable comfort to find that i am not abandoned by all my old acquaintance that in a great measure your seasonable kindness will enable me to pursue the advice you give me  it is too late to look back now on the steps that have brought me to this abject condition no doubt were i to live my life over again i could do much better for myself than i have done and should hardly run into some of the failings that have helped to bring such heavy misfortunes upon me but my comfort is i ever had an honest intention and never was a sot or a spendthrist but yet who knows if i had avoided some mistakes that i might not have fallen into as bad another way so i must acquiesce in the dispensation and pray to god in his own good time to deliver me from it  what is most grievous to me in this matter is my poor wife and children who have deserved a happier fate had it been in my power to have done better for them than now i am ever likely to do  as to your kind offer my dear friend i will beg to see you as often as may not be detrimental to your own affairs i care not how seldom i see my dear wife neither her heart nor mine can bear the grief that oppresses us when we think of our happier days and prospects and see them all concluded within these bars and bolts and lattices so that we sink one another still lower every doleful visit the dear good woman makes me but your visits my friend will be of singular use and comfort to me as your presence and kind advice will be to her as often as you can to save us both the mortification of seeing one another so often as my affairs will otherwise require her to come to this dismal place for i cannot open my mind to any body but you and her i will also get you to go to mr maddox my principal creditor and one or two more i will tell you about what and only fear i shall be too troublesome to you but you are so kind as to offer your service in this way and i am reduced to the sad necessity of pushing myself upon you without the least hope of ever having it in my power to show you as i wish to do how much i am  your grateful though unhappy servant   letter cxiv to a person of note in acknowledgment of great benefits received honored sir permit me to approach you with the thankful acknowledgments of a grateful heart on the favor and benefit your goodness has conferred upon me it shall be the business of my whole life to the utmost of my power to deserve it and my whole family which you have made happy by your bounty will every day join with me in prayers to god to bless you with the continuance of your valuable health a long life and all worldly honor for so it will become us to do for the unmerited favors conferred upon honored sir  your most dutiful servant   letter cxv another for favors of not so high yet of a generous nature worthy sir i should appear ungrateful if i did not add this further trouble to those i have already given you of acknowledging your goodness to me in this last instance of it may god almighty return to you sir one hundredfold the benefit you have conferred upon me and give me opportunity by my future services to show my grateful heart and how much i am worthy sir  your forever obliged and dutiful servant   letter cxvi an excuse to a person who wants to borrow money sir i am very sorry that your request comes to me at a time when i am so pressed by my own affairs that i cannot with any convenience comply with it i hope sir you will therefore excuse  your most humble servant   letter cxvii on the same subject sir i have on an urgent occasion been obliged to borrow a sum of money myself within ten days past hence you will judge of my want of capacity rather than inclination to comply with your request for i am  your sincere friend   letter cxviii on the same subject sir it is with no little pain that i am obliged to lay open to you on occasion of the loan you request of me my own inability i shall make very hard shift to answer some necessary demands which must be complied with by a certain time and so can only say i am sorry i have it not in my power to show you how sincerely i am  your most humble servant   letter cxix to a friend in compliance with his request to borrow a sum of money sir you have highly obliged me in the request you make me i most cheerfully comply with it and enclose a note for the requested sum payable on sight and am not a little glad it is in my power to show you how much i am  your faithful friend and servant   letter cxx another on the same occasion limiting the repayment to a certain time sir the intimation you give me that the sum of  0 pounds will be of great use to you and that you shall be able to repay it in four months makes me resolve to put myself to some difficulty to oblige you accordingly i enclose a bank note to that amount but i must in the name of friendship beg of you to return it me unused if you think you cannot keep your word in the repayment for my accommodating you with this sum is rather at present a greater testimony of my inclination than ability to serve you for i am  your affectionate friend and servant   letter cxxi to a friend on a breach of promise in not returning money lent in his exigence sir when you applied to me in your streights for assistance and made such strong promises of returning in four months what i advanced little did i think you would give me the irksome occasion either of reminding you of your promise or of acquainting you with the streights in which my friendship for you has involved myself i have always endeavored to manage my affairs with so much prudence as to keep within myself the power of answering demands upon me without troubling my friends and i told you i must expect you would keep your word exactly to the four months or else i should be distressed as bad as you were when you applied to me six months passed and you took no manner of notice of the matter when i was forced to remind you of it having been put to it as i told you i should you took a fortnight longer under still stronger promises of performance and three weeks are now expired and your second promises are still as much to be performed as your first is this kind is this friendly is it grateful sir let me ask you and ought i to be made to suffer in my credit who was so ready to save yours  when too mine had been in no danger had i not put out of my own power what actually was then in it i will only say that if any consideration remains with you for one so truly your friend let me immediately be paid and take from me the cruel necessity of reproaching you for ingratitude and myself for folly who am sir  your unkindly used etc   letter cxxii to a friend who had promised to lend a sum of money to answer a critical exigence and drove it off to the last dear sir you were so kind as to tell me a fortnight ago that you would lend me one hundred pounds on my bond to answer a demand that my credit would be otherwise a sufferer by and you were pleased to say you would have me look no further and that i should certainly have it in time i have looked no further sir and the day of payment approaching you cannot imagine how my mind has suffered by being not absolutely sure of having the money to answer the demand i hope sir nothing has happened to make you alter your mind for at this short notice i shall not know to whom to apply to raise it in the utmost perturbation of mind for fear of the worst my credit being wholly at stake i beg your answer which i hope will be to the satisfaction of sir  your obliged humble servant   letter cxxiii the answer excusing the pain he had given his friend by his remissness dear sir i will attend you this afternoon with the money which i had always great pleasure in the thought of supplying you with and i am most heartily vexed with myself for giving you the pain and uneasiness that must have attended a mind so punctual as yours and in a case so critically circumstanced but i hope you will forgive me though i can hardly forgive myself i am sir as well on this as on any other occasion in my power  your sincere friend and servant   letter cxxiv to one who upon a very short acquaintance and without any visible merit but assurance wants to borrow a sum of money sir you did me the favor of inquiring for me two or three times while i was out of town and among my letters i find one from you desiring the loan of  0 guineas you must certainly have mistaken yourself or me very much to think we were enough known to each other for such a traniaction i was twice in your company i was delighted with your conversation you seemed as much pleased with mine and if we both acted with honor the obligation is mutual and there can be no room to suppose me your debtor i have no churlish nor avaritious heart i will venture to say but there must be bounds to every thing and discretion is as necessary in conferring as in receiving a kindness to a friend my helping hand ought to be lent when his necessities require it you cannot think our intimacy enough to commence that relation and should i answer the demands of every new acquaintance i should soon want power to oblige my old friends and even to serve myself surely sir a gentleman of your merit cannot be so little beloved as to be forced to seek to a new acquaintance and to have no better friend than one of yesterday i will not do you the injury to suppose that you have not many who have the best reasons from long knowledge to oblige you and by your application to me i cannot think bashfulness should stand in your way to them be this as it may it does not at all suit my convenience to comply with your request and so i must beg you to excuse  yours etc   letter cxxv a gentleman to a lady who humourously resents his mistresss fondness of a monkey and indifference to himself madam i must be under the less regret for the contempt with which you receive my addresses when your favor is wholly engrossed by so wretched a rival for ought a rational man to wonder he is received with neglect and slight by a lady who can be taken up with the admiration of a chattering monkey but pray be so good as to permit me to reason the matter a little with you i would ask you then by what extraordinary endowment this happy creature has found means to engross your favor extravagance is never commendable but while i am dying beneath your frowns how can you be profuse in your caresses to so mean a competitor condescend to view us in the same light what valuable qualification is mr pug endowed with which i am destitute of what can he do which i cannot perform though with less agility to full as good purpose is it a recommendation in him that he wears no breeches for my part i will most willingly surrender mine at your feet be impartial for once place us together before you view our faces our airs our shapes and our language if he be handsomer than i which on a strict scrutiny i hope will not be allowed him neither pray try our wits however acute he may be i can assure you i reckon myself no fool if i was i should less resent the preference you give against me i will sing or dance with him for his ears turn him loose to me i will sight him if that be necessary to obtain your favor or do any thing in the world to show you how much i am and shall ever be if you will permit it  your very humble admirer   letter cxxvi a sailor to his betrothed mistress barbados oct   my dear peggy if you think of me half so often as i do of you it will be every hour for you are never out of my thoughts and when i am asleep i constantly dream of my dear peggy i wear my halfbit of gold always at my heart tied to a blue ribbon round my neck for true blue my dearest love is the color of colors to me where my dearest do you put yours i hope you are careful of it for it would be a bad omen to lose it  i hope you hold in the same mind still my dearest dear for god will never bless you if you break the vows you have made to me as to your ever faithful william i would sooner have my heart torn from my breast than it should harbor a wish for any other woman besides my peggy o my dearest love you are the joy of my life my thoughts are all of you you are with me in all i do and my hope and my wish is only to be yours god send it may be so  our captain talks of sailing soon for england and then and then  my dearest peggy  o how i rejoice how my heart beats with delight that makes me i cannot tell how when i think of arriving in england and joining hands with my peggy as we have hearts before i hope i am sure i speak for one  john arthur in the good ship elizabeth capt winterton which is returning to england as i hope we shall soon promises to deliver this into your own dear hand and he will bring you too six bottles of citronwater as a token of my love it is fit for the finest ladies taste it is so good and it is what they saly ladies drink when they can get it  john says he will have one sweet kiss of my dearest peggy for his care and pains so let him my best love for i am not of a jealous temper i have a better opinion of my dearest than so  but oh that i was in his place  one kiss should not serve my turn though i hope it may his  yet if he takes two i will forgive him one for me and one for himself for i love john dearly and so you may well think well what shall i say more  or rather what shall i say next for i have an hundred things crouding in upon me when i write to my dearest and alas one has so few opportunities  but yet i must leave off for i have written to the bottom of my paper love then to all friends and duty to both our mothers concludes me  your faithful lover till death   letter cxxvii her answer dear william for so i may call you now we are sure and so my mother says this is to let you know that nothing shall prevail upon me to alter my promise made to you when we parted with heavy hearts enough that is true and yet i had a little inkling given me that mr alfords son the carpenter would be glad to make love to me but do you think i would suffer it no indeed for i doubt not your loyalty to me and do you think i will not be as loyal to you  to be sure i will these sailors run such sad chances said one that you and i both know they may return and they may not well i will trust in god for that who has returned safe to his friends their dear billy so many a time and often they will have a mistress in every land they come to said they all are not such naughty men said i and i will trust billy oliver all the world over for why cannot men be as faithful as women tro and for me i am sure no love shall ever touch my heart but yours  god send us a happy meeting let who will speak against sailors they are the glory and the safeguard of the land and what would have become of old england long ago but for them i am sure the lazy goodfornothing landlubbers would never have protected us from our cruel foes so sailors are and ever shall be esteemed by me and of all sailors my dear billy oliver believe this truth from  your faithful etc p s i had this letter writ in readiness to send you as i had opportunity and the captains lady undertakes to send it with here is that is very kind and condescending is it not     letter cxxviii a seaofficer to his wife portmahon october    my dear life i take the opportunity afforded me by captain copythorne who is returning to england to let you know that i am in perfect health at present god be praised though i have with many of the crew been down of the bloody flux occasioned by being a little too free with the new wines and fruit of these countries and yet i thought i was very moderate in both our captain continues very civil and kind and places his principal confidence in me and i endeavor so to behave on the occasion as to avoid incurring the envy of every one and indeed have the good fortune to be generally respected  captain copythorne is so kind as to carry to you a token of my affection which is a small parcel of cyprus wine that i believe will be agreeable to your best friend mrs simpson to whom therefore you may present half and keep the other for your own use the captain has also fifty dollars to present you with from me only paying out of them the duty for the wine for it is but just that it should be so if he cannot meet with favor in so small a parcel for what the law of the land which protects us all gives to the king is as much his due however other people act as any part of my private property which is secured to me by the same law is mine and i am convinced that if every one acted up to this just principle there need not be so many taxes as there are and the fair trader and all honest men would be the better for it  i hope my dear jackey and nancy continue in good health and dutiful and come on in their schooling for that will stand them in stead perhaps when the poor matters we are enabled to do for them may not be worth trusting to  i long to see my dear betty god give us a happy meeting if it be his blessed will but i believe it will hardly be till we have humbled the proud jack spaniard which god also grant for that nation has been very vile and base to us honest englishmen this concludes me at present  your everloving husband love and service to all friends     letter cxxix a wife to her husband at sea my dear i think it a long time since i have had the comfort and satisfaction of hearing of your welfare often and often do i reflect on the unhappiness of us poor women who are married to seafaring men every wind that blows every pirate we hear of and now in time of war every hour of our lives the dread of enemies alarms us gods providence is our reliance and so it ought for nothing else can sustain us through our different apprehensions every day we live but to be sure the unhappiness is still greater to such as love one another as we always did i hope when it shall please god to return you safe to my wishes that you will take no more of these very long voyages if you can help it the trips to hotland or france are so pretty that they rather add to than diminish ones comforts but oh these long long voyages yet in time of war people cannot do as they will and i must be contented and the more when i see that the fine ladies of captains commodores and admirals are no better off than your poor jenny  we have had the misfortune to lose uncle james since you went he was a landman out of the dangers you run yet as i hope god has preserved you while he is dead and gone so we see there is nothing to be said for it when our time is come they talk of my aunts marrying again and she has a courtier comes to her because she is aforehand in the world and yet uncle james has not yet been dead three months fie upon her i say though she is my aunt for she had a good husband of him as to you and i my dear i hope god will spare us to one another for you are my first love and shall be my last cousin barns had the misfortune to break his leg but is in a good way jenny adams is to be married next week to john lascells this is all the news among our acquaintance for i am sure it is none to tell you that i am  your faithful and loving wife   letter cxxx to a father on his neglect of his childrens education dear sir i am under a concern to see such a remissnes as every body takes notice of in the education of your children they are brought up it is true to little offices in your business which keep them active and may make them in some degree of present though poor use to you but i am sorry to say of none to themselves with regard to their future prospects which is what a worthy parent always has in view  there is a proper time for every thing and children are not early initiated into their d and those parts of learning which are proper to their particular years they must necessarily be discouraged and set behind every one of their school fellows though much younger than themselves and you know not sir what a laudable emulation you by this means destroy than which nothing is of greater force to children to induce them to attend to their book nor what a disgrace you involve them in with respect to children among children for the biggest and eldest to be so much outdone by the least and youngest  nor is the consequence of this defect confined to the schoolage as i may call it for as they grow up they will be looked upon in an equally discouraging and disadvantageous light by all who converse with them which must of course throw them into the company of the dregs of mankind for how will they be able to converse or correspond with those whose acquaintance it is most worth their while to cultivate and indeed they will probably be so conscious of their unfitness to bear a part in worthy conversation that to keep themselves in countenance they will of their own accord shun the better company and associate with the worst and what may be the consequence of this a wise man and a good father would tremble to think of especially when he has to reflect upon himself as the cause of it let it be what it will  then sir it is to be considered that without a tolerable education they can be only fit for mean and sordid employments hear what the wise man says to this very purpose how can he get wisdom that holds the plough and that glories in the goad that drives oxen and is occupied in their labors and whose talk is of bullocks he gives his mind to make furrows and is diligent to give the kine fodder so every carpenter and workmaster that labors night and day  the smith also sitting by the anvil and considering the ironwork the vapor of the fire wastes his flesh  the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears  so does the potter sitting at his work and turning the wheel about with his feet  he fashioneth the clay with his arm and boweth down his strength before his feet these as he observes are useful in their way but their minds being wholly engrossed by their labors they shall not be sought for in public council nor sit high in the congregation  they cannot declare justice and judgment and they shall not be found where parables are spoken that is they shall be confined to the drudgery of their own servile station and will be entitled neither to honor nor respect as they might have been had they had an education to qualify them for more respectable businesses and you will consider sir in a closer light as to us who live in the present age and in this great city that there is hardly a creditable or profitable employment in london where a tolerable knowledge of accounts and penmanship in particular is not required consider also what opportunities they may lose by this neglect of their education in case they should fail in the business they are put to of getting comfortable and genteel bread in some merchants comptinghouse or in some one of the several offices about this great metropolis as bookkeepers clerks accomptants etc  and with regard more immediately to yourself how can you expect when they know you could do better for them but that their behavior to you will be of a piece with the rest for if they are not polished by learning but are left to a kind of instinct rather is it to be expected that they should behave to you and their mother with that sense of their obligations which learning inculcates nor indeed will they have those obligations to you which other children have to their parents who take care to give them opportunities of improvement which are denied to yours consider dear sir what a contemptible character even among the sordid vulgar that of an illiterate fellow is and what respect on the contrary a man of letters is treated with by his equals as well as inferiors and when you lay all these plain reasons and observations together i make no doubt but you will endeavor to retrieve lost time and be advised in this material point which i can have no interest in by  your sincere friend and servant   letter cxxxi from a young maiden abandoned by her lover for the sake of a greater fortune mr john i must take up my pen and write though perhaps you will only scoff at me for so doing but when i have said what i have to say then i shall have eased my mind and will endeavor to forget you for ever i have had so many cautions given me against the false hearts of men and was so often told how they will vow and forswear themselves that i ought to have been on my guard that is true and indeed so i was a great while you know it well but you courted me so long vowed so earnestly and seemed so much in love with me that it was first pity in me that made me listen to you and oh this nasty pity how soon did it bring  but i will not say love neither i thought if all the young men in the world besides proved false yet it was impossible you should ah poor silly creature that i was to think though every body flattered me with being sightly enough i could hold a heart so sordidly bent on interest as i always saw yours to be but that thought i though it is a meanness i dont like yet will it be a security of his making a frugal husband in an age so fruitful of spendthrifts  but at length it has proved that you can prefer polly bambridge and leave poor me only because she has a greater portion than i have  i say nothing against polly i wish her well indeed i do and i wish you no harm neither but as you knew polly before why could you not have made to yourself a merit with her without going so far with me what need you have so often begged and prayed sighed and vowed never leaving me day nor night till you had got me foolishly to believe and pity you and so after your courtship to me was made a towntalk then you could leave me to be laughed at by every one i slighted for you was this just was this well done think you  here i cannot go out of doors but i have some one or other simpering and sneering at me and i have had two willowgarlands sent me so i have  but what poor stuff in some of my own sex too is this to laugh at and deride me for your baseness i can call my heart to witness to my virtue in thought in word and in deed and must i be ridiculed for a false one who gives himself airs at my expense and at the expense of his own truth and honor indeed you cannot say the least ill of me that is my comfort i defy the world to say any thing to blast my character why then should i suffer in the worlds eye for your baseness   i seek not to move you to return to the fidelity you have vowed for by this time may hap you would be as base to polly as you have been to me if you did and i wish her no willowgarlands i will assure you but yet let me desire you to speak of me with decency that is no more than i deserve well you know dont to bravethro the perfidy you have been guilty of mention me with such fleers as i hear you have done to several and pray call me none of your poor dear girls and i hope she will not take it to heart poor thing  with that insolence that so little becomes you and i have so little deserved i thought to have appealed to your conscience on what has passed between us when i began i thought to have put the matter home to you but i have run out into this length and now dont think it worth while to write much more for what is conscience to a man who could vow as you have done and act as you have done  go then mr john naughty man as you are i will try to forget you for ever rejoice in the smiles of your polly bambridge and glad your heart with the possession of an hundred or two of pounds more than i have and see what you will be the richer or happier a few years hence i wish no harm to you your conscience will be a greater trouble to you than i wish it to be if you are capable of reflecting and for your sake i will henceforth set myself up to be an adviser to all my sex never to give ear to a man unless they can be sure that his interest will be a security for his pretended affection to them i am though greatly injured and deceived naughty mr john  your wellwisher   letter cxxxii from a gentleman to his mistress who seeing no hopes of success respectfully withdraws his suit madam i make no doubt but this will be the welcomest letter that you ever received from me for it comes to assure you that it is the last trouble you will ever have from me nor should i have so long withheld from you this satisfaction had not the hope your brother gave me that in time i might meet with a happier fate made me willing to try every way to obtain your favor but i see all the hopes given me by his kind consideration for me and those that my own presumption had made me entertain are all in vain and i will therefore rid you of so troublesome an importuner having nothing to offer now but my ardent wishes for your happiness and these madam i will pursue you with to my lifes latest date  may you whenever you shall change your condition meet with a heart as passionately and as sincerely devoted to you as mine and may you be happy for many very many years in the man you can honor with your love for give me leave to say madam that in this my end will be in part answered because it was most sincerely your happiness i had in view as well as my own when i presumptuously hoped by contributing to the one to secure the other i am madam with the highest veneration  your most obedient humble servant   letter cxxxiii from a lady to a gentleman who had obtained all her friends consent urging him to decline his suit to her sir you have often importuned me to return marks of that consideration for you which you profess for me as my parents to whom i owe all duty encourage your address i wish i could i am hardly treated by them because i cannot what shall i do let me apply to you sir for my relief who have much good sense and i hope generosity yes sir let me bespeak your humanity to me and justice to yourself in this point and that shall be all i will ask in my favor i own you deserve a much better wife than i shall ever make but yet as love is not in ones own power if i have the misfortune to know i cannot love you will not justice to yourself if not pity to me oblige you to abandon your present purpose  but as to myself sir why should you make a poor creature unhappy in the displeasure of all her friends at present and still more unhappy if to avoid that she gives up her person where she cannot bestow her heart if you love me as you profess let me ask you sir is it for my sake or is it for your own  if for mine how can it be when i must be miserable if i am forced to marry where i cannot love  if for your own reflect sir on the selfishness of your love and judge if it deserves from me the return you wish  how sadly does this love already operate you love me so well that you make me miserable in the anger of my dearest friends  your love has already made them think me undutiful and instead of the fondness and endearment i used to be treated with by them i meet with nothing but chidings frowns slights and displeasure  and what is this love of yours to do for me hereafter  why hereafter sir it will be turned to hatred or indifference at least for then though i cannot give you my heart i shall have given you a title to it and you will have a lawful claim to its allegiance may it not then nay ought it not to be treated on the foot of a rebel and expect punishment as such instead of tenderness even were i to be treated with mercy with goodness with kindness by you and could not deserve or return it what a wretch would your love make me how would it involve me in the crying sin of ingratitude how would it destroy my reputation in the worlds eye that the best of husbands had the worst of wives  the kindest of men the unkindest of women   cease then i beseech you this hopeless this cruel pursuit  make some worthier person happy with your addresses that can be happy in them  by this means you will restore me if you decline as of your own motion to the condition you found me in the love of my parents and the esteem of my friends if you really love me this may be a hard task but it will be a most generous one  and there is some reason to expect it for who that truly loves wishes to make the object of his love miserable this must i be if you persist in your address and i shall know by your conduct on occasion of this uncommon request how to consider it and in what light to place you either as the most generous or the most ungenerous of men mean time i am sir most heartily though i cannot be what you would have me  your wellwisher and humble servant   letter cxxxiv the gentlemans answer to the ladys uncommon request dear madam i am exceedingly concerned that i cannot be as acceptable to you as i have the good fortune to find myself to your honored parents if madam i had reason to think it was owing to your prepossession in some happier mans favor i should utterly despair of it and should really think it would be unjust to myself and ungenerous to you to continue my address as therefore you have by your appeal to me in so uncommon a way endeavored to make me a party against myself and i have shown so much regard to you as to be willing to oblige you as far as i can may i not hope the favor of you to declare generously whether i owe my unhappiness to such a prepossession and whether your heart is given to some other  if this be the case you shall find all you wish on my part and i shall take a pride to plead against myself let me suffer ever so much by it to your father and mother but if not and you have taken any other disgusts to my person or behavior that there may be hope my utmost affection and assiduity or a contrary conduct may in time get the better of let me implore you to permit me still to continue my zealous respects to you for this i will say that there is not a man in the world who can address you with a sincerer and more ardent flame than dear madam  your affectionate admirer and humble servant   letter cxxxv the ladys reply in case of a prepossession sir i thank you for your kind assurance that you will befriend me in the manner i wish and i think i owe it to your generosity to declare that there is a person in the world that might i be left to my own choice i should prefer to all other men to this sir it is owing that your address cannot meet with the return it might otherwise deserve from me yet are things so circumstancd that while my friends prefer you and know nothing of the other i should find it very difficult to obtain their consents but your generous discontinuance without giving them the true reason for it will lay an obligation greater than i can express on  your most humble servant   letter cxxxvi the ladys reply in case of no prepossession or that she chooses not to avow it sir i am sorry to say that my disapprobation of your address is insuperable  yet cannot i but think myself beholden to you for the generosity of your answer to my earnest request i must beg you sir to give over your application but how can i say while i cannot help being of this mind that it is or is not owing to prepossession when you declare that in the one instance and that is very generous too you will oblige me but in the other you will not if i cannot return love for love be the motive what it will pray sir for your own sake as well as mine discontinue your address  in case of prepossession you say you can and you will oblige me let my unworthiness sir have the same effect upon you as if that prepossession were to be avowed this will inspire me with a gratitude that will always make me  your most obliged servant   letter cxxxvii a lady to a gentleman of superior fortune who after a long address in an honorable way proposes to live with her as a gallant sir after many unaccountable hesitations and concealed meanings that your mind seemed of late big with but hardly knew how to express you have at last spoken out all your mind and i know what i am to trust to i have that disdain of your proposal that an honest mind ought to have but i wish for my own sake and i will say for yours too because your honor is concerned in it so deeply that i had had at my first acquaintance with you such an instance of your plaindealing or rather baseness then i should have had no regret in letting you know how much i scorned the proposer and the proposal though i hope as it is a little time and reflection will make me for the sake of the latter abhor the former  however sir i must say you are very cruel to use me thus after you had by all the alluring professions of an honorable love inspired me with a grateful return and brought me to the freedom of owning it  nor yet will i be an hypocrite or deny my honest passion for that would be to lessen your guilt god is my witness i loved you beyond all your sex yet i loved you virtuously i loved you because i thought you virtuous and now though it may take some time and too much regret to get over yet do i hope your behavior will enable me to conquer my fond folly  ungenerous man to take advantage of your superior fortune to insult me thus when you had gained my affections what though i am not blessed with a worldly circumstance equal to what you might expect in a wife can you think my mind so base as to submit to be yours on unworthy terms go unworthy man and make your court to miss reynolds as you seem to threaten she has a fortune equal to your own and may you be happy together i should have been so had i never known you i never deceived you you knew my scanty fortune and yet pretended to prefer me to all my sex  on me you might have laid the highest obligation by raising me to a condition i was humble enough to think above me and i should have been on that account all gratitude all duty all acknowledgment on miss reynolds you will confer none her fortune will quit scores with yours and you must both in your union be strangers to the inexpressible pleasure of receiving or conferring of benefits but this is a pleasure which none but generous minds can taste that yours is not so witness your detested proposal after such solemn professions of faithful and honorable love and i have one consolation though a consolation i did not wish for that i am under no obligation but the contrary to such a man and am as much your superior as the person who would do no wrong is to one that will do nothing else send me however my letters that i may be assured my fond credulity will not be the subject of fresh insult and that perhaps to the person that shall be what you made me expect i should be i will send you all yours the last only excepted which as it may assist me to conquer my fond folly for you i hope you will allow me to keep though it is the abhorred of my soul  may you be happier than you have made me  is the last prayer you will have from  your too credulous wellwisher   letter cxxxviii a father to a daughter in service on hearing of her masters attempting her virtue my dear daughter i understand with great grief of heart that your master has made some attempts on your virtue and yet that you stay with him god grant that you have not already yielded to his base desires for when once a person has so far forgotten what belongs to himself or his character as to make such an attempt the very continuance with him and in his power and under the same roof is an encouragement to him to prosecute his designs and if he carries it better and more civil at present it is only the more certainly to undo you when he attacks you next consider my dear child your reputation is all you have to trust to and if you have not already which god forbid yielded to him leave it not to the hazard of another temptation but come away directly as you ought to have done on your own motion at the command of  your grieved and indulgent father   letter cxxxix the daughters answer honored father i received your letter yesterday and am sorry i stayed a moment in my masters house after his vile attempt but he was so full of his promises of never offering the like again that i hoped i might believe him nor have i yet seen any thing to the contrary but am so much convinced that i ought to have done as you say that i have this day left the house and hope to be with you soon after you will have received this letter i am  your dutiful daughter   letter cxl to a gentleman of fortune who has children dissuading him from a second marriage with a lady much younger than himself worthy sir you are pleased to inform me of your thoughts in relation to a change of your condition and to command me to give you freely my opinion of the conveniences and inconveniences that may follow from the inequality of years between you and the young lady you think of making your second wife indeed i am so much concerned for your happiness that had i heard of such your intention and had not your commands to be free on this head i think i should have run the risque of being thought impertinent and officious rather than not have expostulated with you on this occasion my objections sir are not so much to the gaiety of the lady as to her youth and the children you have already by your late excellent lady and when you remember that miss fanny your eldest daughter is near as old as the lady you think to make her mother i beg sir you will consider how your reputation as to prudence will suffer in the eye of the world without you as well as the look it will have to your children and domestics  nature justice decency and every branch of human prudence plead strongly against the union of lively youth with maturer years her temper may be very agreeable so indeed is yours  but may they be so to each other when they meet together in so close an union you are yet blessed with a good state of health but can you expect that it will be always so  or rather will not every year take from your constitution what it will add to hers for several years to come your years make you serious and solemn and you are past a relish for those pleasures and amusements which are but suitable to hers and which at the same age you yourself delighted in can you recall time past will it become you to resume the part which judgment has made you quit how aukwardly if you attempt it will you do this what censure will this subject you to how will it embolden the gay young fellows to make attempts that may notwithstanding the most unexceptionable conduct in the lady give you great uneasiness  if you cannot join in the innocent gaieties which you have long disused it would be in some measure cruel to deprive a young lady of her share of them at an age that will naturally make her expect and require them and yet will not even innocent liberties be matter of reproach to her and uneasiness to you if she takes them without you and would you choose to bear her company and indulge a youngold taste for gay scenes long contemned and so appear in a light to all that beheld you together either as her father or her jealous keeper and make it look to the world as if you yourself doubted her virtue out of your own presence suppose the scene at a gallant comedy that sprightly free joke which will make her smile will make you frown and so on in every other scene of life and amusement between you for a defect or inequality of whatever kind whenever a man is conscious of it let him carry it off as he may will always be present with him and like another conscience stare him in the face  your fortune it is true is so considerable that you may amply provide for all your children and yet make it worth a young ladys while who would study her interest preferably to any other consideration to oblige you but sir let me ask you can you who lived so happily with your late dear lady and had such constant proofs of her inviolable affection to your person content yourself with a counterfeit passion a mere selfish affection in a wife and can you think that so young a lady can love you like her who grew on in life in hope in desires with you and who from a reciprocal youth passed agreeably together grew equally mature and had both but one view between you to wit a young family growing up the common offspring of your mutual affections and who were the binding and so long as her life lasted the indissoluble cement of your loves and your interests  if she can she will be a contradiction to all experience and you will be happy against all reasonable expectation  if she cannot will you be content with a selfish an interested civility instead of true love and which cannot possibly so much as look like love but by the dissimulation and hypocrisy of your bosom companion   when i look back on what i have written i begin to be afraid of your displeasure on a double account for the nature and for the length of this epistle though you have commanded me to speak my mind yet having several other material points to touch upon and relying upon your excuse for my good intentions for what view can i have in the liberty i take but your happiness i will beg leave to pursue the subject in another letter and to conclude this though a little abruptly with the assurance that as your request nobody shall see what i write but yourself and that i am sir  your affectionate humble servant   letter cxli the same subject pursued sir i will now take the liberty to continue my subject and my humble expostulations upon it and i will suppose two cases very if not equally probable to wit that you may or may not have children by your new lady and to judge in both cases how the happiness of your remaining life may be affected by either in the first place if you should have children by her to say nothing of the misunderstandings and jealousies this may create between your lady and your present children which may greatly affect your own happiness are you so well able to support at these years with credit and satisfaction that character which so peculiarly befits a young husband to a young wife and will it not naturally strike you that your own children by that time will make a better figure in such a circumstance than yourself will you be so well able to go through the same troubles the same anxieties the same hopes fears and affections both to the pregnant mother and afterward to the infant progeny that you have so happily got over and will not what was then called laudable love be now deemed dotage and uxoriousness  providence seems to have designed the youthful portion of a mans life for mutual endearments and propagation of his family the maturer part for education counsel or advice and will you sir invert the design of it will you call back the days of sense into the years of intellect watch over the baby in the cradle when you should form the mind of the grown person  how unequal will you be to this part to what you once were  as you will not have the same dispositions about you you cannot have the same joy at a pleasing incident but will have possibly a superadded weight of sorrow on any sad event as years will have added to your reflection as experience will have contracted your hope and as you will have seen the vanity of all worldly expectations  then my dear sir consider if you should even get over this resumed province happily and have no material uneasiness from the lady on the account i have intimated to you is it not too probable that you may not live to see this young race brought up and if you should what animosities what uneasinesses may not ensue from the different interests into which your family will be divided and it may moreover be possible for you to have grandchildren older than some of your own by your new lady  but if we suppose that the occasion for this may not happen will the matter be mended by it  all young ladies expect and wish for children when they marry if she should not have any she will hardly be induced to think it her fault but the difference of years will tell her and all the world will join in it where to lay the blame deserved or not she will for want of so necessary an employment look abroad for amusements and diversions which however innocent in her first intentions may not always end so and if they do will be very unsuitable to your disposition and liking childbed matronizes the giddiest spirits and brings them to reflection sooner than any other event its consequences fill up the time and introduce different scenes of pleasure and amusement in the mind of a lady it draws her attention to more serious affairs it domesticates her as i may say and makes her associate with graver persons and such as are in the same scenes of life but where this is not she continues her youthful and giddy acquaintance classes herself as to her company and diversions as if in the single state still and looks for amusements out of herself and out of your house and you will be obliged to connive at a good deal more than you otherwise would because the difference of years will give as much consciousness to you as it will presumption to her and if there be any grievance between you she will think after all you can do it is of her side nor will time and years mend the matter but contrarily make it worse and worse  then another inconvenience may arise the lady if she has no children by you to prevent lying at the mercy of yours as she will call it will be making a separate interest to herself she will grow upon your indulgence and fondness she will cajole she will reproach she will tieze you into acts of bounty and profusion to her she will endeavor to build up a fortune out of yours to the prejudice of your family and all this for what end  only to make her a rich widow and to give her opportunity to triumph in conjunction perhaps with some young rake or profligate over your ashes and to make comparisons grievous to reflection at the expense of your fortune and memory in the new mans favor  forgive me dear sir these free hints my full mind which is thus ready to overflow through the zeal i have for your honor and welfare suggests many more to me which your cool reflection will not want and i have been already so prolix that i will only farther say that i am and shall ever be  your faithful and most affectionate friend and servant   letter cxlii against a second marriage where there are children on both sides dear sir you ask my opinion as to the thoughts you have entertained of making your addresses to the widow lockyer do you really ask it with an intent to take it or like the generality of the world only in hopes that my judgment falling in with your own may be a kind of justification or excuse for what you intend to do and are perhaps already resolved upon if so what do you do but lay a snare for me which may put an end to our friendship for men least of all bear control or contradiction in points of this nature when their hearts are actually determined and then indifference begins and disgust ends the bestcemented friendships  to say the truth i never was a friend to second marriages where there are children on one side and a likelihood of more but especially where there are children on both i have nothing to say as to the person or character of the lady you whom it most concerns are well satisfied of both or you would not have gone so far as to ask a friends advice on this occasion but since you do put it to me i will throw a few reasons together which have always had weight with me on these occasions and i hope you will not think the worse of your friend if he happen to differ a little from your own judgment  it must be confessed in the case you put that the circumstances on both sides are pretty equal that there is no great disparity in years that she has three children and you have four a round family however when they come together that she is very fond of her children and you at present of yours that you are not an illtemperd man and she is a goodtemperd woman and was a loving wife to her late spouse as you were an affectionate husband to yours well so far is very well and you will think perhaps very promising of a happy union and possibly you may think right at least you have much better grounds for it than many that do marry upon much worse and more unequal prospects  but consider sir what security have you that persons who have been always goodtemperd when they have nothing to thwart or try their temper will be still so when they have something that will  here at the very threshold of this adventure is a cause of great trial a trial which neither of you had before and consequently which neither of you know how you shall behave in she loves her children so she ought you love yours it is right so to do but see you not before i speak that this laudable separate love of either may become matter of great uneasiness to both you cannot either of you possibly expect more than common civility and outside kindness from the other she to yours you to hers and it will be happy enough if this task do not sufficiently try the discretion of both  it is impossible my friend but you must have very different views on each other  a pretty prospect to set out with in a matrimonial adventure her praises of her own children will be very sincere and lavish her praises of yours if she ever praises will be very suspicious and sparing and perhaps you must be as discreet as possible in the praises of your own the very clothes each wear the victuals they eat nay the very looks of either parent as they shall appear kind to their own or reserved to the others will afford room for inward heartburnings if not outward janglings i have seen many instances of these kinds  their different capacities one shall take their learning another not  their different tempers one shall be mild another insulting one smooth another rough  their different ages which will make one dictate while the other will not be prescribed to  will all afford cause of difference and when they come to an age fit for setting them out in the world if boys to apprentice you put jackey to a better trade than tommy and give more money with him and yet one trade or master may apparently deserve or require it the other not if girls in matrimony why should betsey be married before thomasine  let the eldest go first though perhaps the one has an humble servant the other none  ay i see poor thomasine must be contented with any body or any thing while betsey must be a lady  these are all still fresh causes of difference and uneasiness to you both  then will she actually or you will suspect it and that is as bad to your peace be constantly progging as the women call it for her children in order to make a private purse for them on any occasion that may happen or in case she shall outlive you  and if there be a third race of children from this marriage worse and worse still then the two former sets if they never joined together before now will make a common cause in this single point against the new race and must not this double your own and your wifes comforts think you  then must you be glad to lessen your family at home that you may lessen the number of so many spies and enemies to your repose the boys must be hurried out to the first thing that offers for them whether suitable or unsuitable to their genius or capacity and they generally thrive accordingly the girls to the first man that will take them whether he can provide for them or not as he ought and after a while they may come back to you though fitted out with a great expense quite destitute and undone with a farther increase to your family the too frequent consequences of precipitate marriages and then will a new scene commence for all the unprovidedfor will join against the poor unhappy one  this you will say is looking a great way forward it is so and what may never happen possibly it never may as to the last case but as it too often has happened and daily does happen a wise man will think a little about it while it is in his power to prevent it all  i have touched but upon a few of the consequences that may too probably follow from a new engagement yet i believe these if you are not absolutely determined will make you think a little if you are why then all the reasons that can be urged will signify nothing and in this case you should not have laid a snare for me to disoblige a person who is to step in between your friendship and mine and who will look upon me if she knows my mind as very probably she will for i hardly ever knew a secret of this kind kept as her enemy and so create a coolness and indifference between us which you cannot help if you would for if ever it be so and your lady receives me in a way that i have not been used to in your house i shall be very shy of visiting either you or her  if you require it and it will have any effect upon you i can enter still farther into this subject but i fansy i have said enough and perhaps more than you will thank me for but be that as it will i have answered your request and shown you peradventure at the expense of my discretion that i am in all things  your sincere friend and wellwisher   letter cxliii against a second marriage where there are children on one side and a likelihood of more dear sir you are inclined you tell me to give your children a mother instead of the good one they have lost or rather in plain english you should have said yourself a wife to supply your own loss and you ask my opinion on the subject without naming the person only intimating that she is a maiden lady no more than seven years younger than yourself and has a pretty middling fortune  i am glad you have not named the lady for now i shall stand clear of any imputation of personal prejudice let me say what i will i will therefore freely tell you my mind that i am always against second marriages where there are children on one or both sides and likely to be more unless there are such worldly reasons as make it absolutely prudent for a person to marry to establish his circumstances this is not your case for you are very easy in the world and besides the ladies of this age are so brought up that a man must not look for very extraordinary assistances in a wife with relation to her own children much less the children of another woman well but this lady is highly prudent goodhumored an excellent oeconomist and what not and so they are all my friend or at least we are apt to persuade ourselves so before they are married  but well suppose her all you say and all you think yet she will hardly i presume be divested of the passions common to human nature can you expect that though you give your children a mother you give them an own mother she may have prudence enough to do what she will think her duty by them but must she not be her own judge of what that is  and are you sure that what she calls so nay and for peacesake what you will be willing to call so too will be called so by your children as they grow up and even by the rest of the world but children you will say may be unreasonable and undutiful  very well sir  well suppose it so but will this make you happy let them have reason or not for their surmises and as she cannot plead nature for the regulator of her conduct toward them but common civility and prudence only at the very best will there not be two to one on the childrens side that they may be right but whoever may be right or wrong if you are made unhappy by it that is the essential point to you who by this second marriage have been the cause of it all  this is most certain her views must be quite contrary to those of your children it is true theirs will of consequence be likewise contrary to hers and yet both may be very reasonable too according to the character of each and is not this a pretty situation for you do you think for which side can you must you take the children as they grow up will be jealous of ill offices from her with you she will interpret those things which a natural mother would think nothing of as studied slights and will not their constant bickerings make you uneasy in your own family where uneasiness is the least tolerable as it is the place to which a man should retire for comfort when the world gives him cause of displeasure  and what pray may this probably end in why for quietnesssake you will possibly be obliged to separate them the motherinlaw should she be in fault you cannot part with the children then must turn out of course you must study after reconciling and patching up a hundred breaches to make some other provision for them and thus perhaps they are precipitated into a wide world and exposed to a thousand dangerous temptations and how can you forgive yourself if they should by this means become a prey to the designing attempts the boys of vicious women the girls of profligate men and how would it have grieved the heart of their indulgent mother could she have foreseen that her beloved spouse instead of supplying the loss of a mother to them should take from them his own immediate protection and that perhaps at a time of life when it was most necessary for their future good  this may very probably be more or less the case if there be no other difficulties than what may arise between your children and their motherinlaw but if as is most likely you should have children by this your second wife the case may be still worse she will then look upon yours by your first not only with a more indifferent but probably with a jealous eye she will be continually carking and laying up for her own and grudge every thing you lay out upon the others and when they are both grown up to any bigness what clashings and jarrings may not ensue between the offspring of the same father and two different mothers how will you be obliged to give a preference to the children of the latter wife against those of the former because the mother of the one set is present and partial and perhaps clamorous in their favor  that of the other absent silent dead forgotten  if love hides a multitude of faults as no doubt it does and indifference or perhaps as it may be hatred is quicksighted to every little slip how will hers be all angels yours  the worst she can call them  yet how can you help this you are married to the temper as well as to the woman and opposition it is likely will but make matters worse for what the sex cannot carry by reason or argument they will by obstinacy and teizing  then in the matter of making provision respectively for their future good how will your solicitudes for the one be constantly lessened for the other perpetually importuned nor must your own judgment in either case be so much the rule of your conduct as the fond partiality of your second wife for hers and it is far from being impossible that she may use your first children worse than she would do mere strangers for no other reason but because they have a better title to your regard and stand more in the way of her interest and views  these my good friend are some of the reasons i have to allege against second marriages where there are children on one side and a probability of having a second race as i hinted there may be reasons where a persons circumstances stand in need of the assistance that may be procured by this means to overbalance many of the inconveniences i have hinted at the lesser evil in this case is to be chosen and the party must make the best of the rest but this is not your case and so i refer the whole to your mature consideration and am sir  sincerely yours   letter cxliv advising a friend against going to law dear sir i am sorry to hear that the difference between you and mr archer is at last likely to be brought to a lawsuit i wish you would take it into your serious consideration before you begin because it will hardly be in your power to end it when you please for you immediately put the matter out of your own hands into the hands of those whose interest it is to protract the suit from term to term and who will as absolutely prescribe to you in it as your physician in a dangerous illness  the law my good friend i look upon more than any one thing as the proper punishment of an overhasty and perverse spirit as it is a punishment that follows an act of a mans own seeking and choosing you will not consent perhaps now to submit the matter in dispute to reference but let me tell you that after you have expended large sums of money and squandered away a deal of time in attendance on your lawyers and preparations for hearings one term after another you will probably be of another mind and be glad seven years hence to leave it to that arbitration which now you refuse he is happy who is wise by other mens misfortunes says the common adage and why when you have heard from all your acquaintance who have tried the experiment what a grievous thing the law is will you notwithstanding pay for that wisdom which you may have at the cost of others  the representation that was once hung up as a sign in the rolls liberty on one side of a man all in rags wringing his hands with a label importing that he had lost his suit and on the other a man that had not a rag left but stark naked capering and triumphing that he had carried his cause it is said that sir john tr master of the rolls caused this sign to be taken down on the clamor it occasioned among the lawyers  was a fine emblem of going to law and the infatuating madness of a litigious spirit  how excellent to this purpose is the advice of our blessed savior rather than seek this redress against any who would even take ones coat to give him his cloak also for besides the christian doctrine inculcated by this precept it will be found as the law is managed and the uncertainty that attends it even in the bestgrounded litigations that such a pacifick spirit may be deemed the only way to preserve the rest of ones garments and to prevent being stripped to the skin  moreover what wise man would rush upon a proceeding where the principal men of the profession though the oath they take if serjnts obliges them not to sign a sham plea nor plead in a cause against their own opinion are not ashamed under the specious but scandalous notion of doing the best they can for their client to undertake for the sake of a paltry fee to whiten over the blackest cause and to defeat the justest where your property may depend altogether upon the impudence of an eloquent pleader asserting any thing a perjured evidence swearing whatever will do for his suborners purpose where the tricks and mistakes of practisers and want of trifling forms may nonsuit you where deaths of persons made parties to the suit may cause all to begin again what wise man i say would subject himself to these vexations and common incidents in the law if he could any way avoid it together with the intolerable expenses and attendances consequent on a lawsuit besides the fears the cares the anxieties that revolve with every term and engross all a mans thoughts where legal proofs must be given to the plainest facts that a living man is living and identically himself and that a dead man is dead and buried by certificate where evidence must be brought at a great expense to hands and seals affixed to deeds and receipts that never were before questioned till a cause shall be split into several underones these tried term by term and years elapse before the main point comes to be argued though originally there was but one single point as you apprehended in the question as to the lawpart only observe the process first comes the declaration  dly a plea  dly demurrer to the plea  thly a joinder in demurrer  thly a rejoinder  thly a surrejoinder which sometimes is conclusive sometimes to begin all over again then may succeed trials upon the law part and trials upon the equity part oftentimes new trials or rehearings and these followed by writs of error  then you may be plunged into the bottomless gulf of chancery where you begin with bills and answers containing hundreds of sheets at exorbitant prices    lines in a sheet and   words in a line and a stamp to every sheet barefacedly so contrived to pick your pocket then follow all the train of examinations interrogatories exceptions bills amended references for scandal and impertinence new allegations new interrogatories new exceptions on pretense of insufficient answers replies rejoinders surrejoinders butters rebutters and surrebutters till at last when you have danced through this blessed round of preparation the trial before the master of the rolls comes next appeals follow from his honor to the chancellor then from the chancellor to the house of lords and sometimes the parties are sent down from thence for a new trial in the courts below  good heavens what wise man permit me to repeat would enter himself into this confounding circle of the law   i hope dear sir you will think of this matter most deliberately before you proceed in your present angry purpose and if you shall think proper to take my advice and avoid a lawsuit i am sure you will have reason to thank me for it and for the zeal wherewith i am  your sincere friend and servant   letter cxlv to a young lady cautioning her against keeping company with a gentleman of a bad character dear cousin the great respect i have and always had for you obliges me to take this freedom to let you know that the neighborhood begins to talk pretty freely of you and mr lory you have been seen with him at the play and after that at the r tavern a house of no good repute i assure you where you have staid with him till near twelve of clock at night you have likewise been with him at viponts at hampstead at vauxhall cupersgardens marylebon etc  i am sorry for these things because he has none of the best of characters having as i am well informed already ruined two if not three worthy tradesmens daughters and it is but too probable that he has no honorable design upon you for whatever he may promise you i am credibly assured that he is actually engaged with miss knapper whom you know very well indeed it is said he has  00 l per ann but if it be so he is very much involved in the world and at the rate he lives had he three times that estate would never be out of debt for he is downright extravagant a man of no conduct a perfect rattle whose words are not to be relied on in any respect and makes a common boast of the favors he has received from our sex whose faulty fondness is the constant subject of his ridicule  for all these reasons i beg of you dear cousin to avoid his company for though i am confident you will preserve your virtue yet my dear think what you will you may receive an incurable wound in your reputation i hope you will excuse this liberty which no other motive but zeal for your credit and welfare has occasioned and believe me to be  your faithful friend as well as affectionate cousin   letter cxlvi from a mother to her highspirited daughter who lives on uneasy terms with her husband dear nanny i am sorry with all my heart to hear of the frequent misunderstandings between your husband and you i hoped much better things from your prudence from my prudence you will say perhaps as if i thought all the fault was yours but my dear i dont think so i cannot think so and yet i may find fault with your want of prudence too for prudence will oblige a good wife to bear a little contradiction from her husband though not always just perhaps as well as to avoid giving offense suppose he is peevish petulant uneasy in his temper and on slight or no occasions as you may think must you be peevish and petulant because he is so how do you know what things may have happened to him abroad in the way of his business to make him so  or if it be only humor why must you be as bad as he that you find fault with is an ill temper in a husband so taking a thing that the wife who finds it intolerable to her must nevertheless imitate or assume it  the reason why you will not allow him to be oftener in the right and why you condemn as causeless his petulance and waspishness must proceed in a great measure from a slender opinion if not contempt of his judgment if you think him a man of sense it is impossible but you should allow that there may be some cause though you dont immediately penetrate it why he should be disturbed and it would be kind in you to suppose the best as that his tenderness for you will not let him communicate it to you rather than to imagine he is always in the wrong and always angry without reason but were it actually to be so are you commissioned to punish him with provocations and resentments as wrong and even more unbecoming in a wife if you love him as you ought you will extenuate his failings and draw into an advantageous light those actions which may be interpreted in his favor  but if as i heard you once say you will give him as good as he brings that you will not bear his unaccountable humors and suchlike vulgar and provoking expressions it must come to this point either you or he must give way one of your tempers must be subdued and overawed by the other if it be his case tired out by your resolute and sturdy behavior to succumb do you think this will either be a credit to him or to you what an abject  henpeckd the vulgar call it wretch will he be deemed what a termagant you he will be the jest of his companions and you be thought to excel  in what in a quality the most infamous to a woman next to that of an adulteress  but this i aver that meekness condescension forbearance are so far from being despisable qualities in our sex that they are the glory of it and what is meekness my dear if you are not to be tried by provocations what is condescension if you must always have your own way what is forbearance if you are to return injury for injury with the hostile spirit of a fierce enemy rather than to act with the sweet complacency of a tender wife who has vowed obedience and duty  but obedience and duty you will say in return for ill nature and ill usage yes my dear even were it to be so you ought for do you think you are never to condescend or give up your own humor to your husband a pretty sort of obedience that which shall be only shown where you are not thwarted but never where you are would not this be obedience to your own headstrong passions and not to him  so long as you can have your way in every thing you will be a mirror of condescension but when once you come to be contradicted why then you are at liberty to contradict again if he is out of the way in his humor you will never be in the way in yours if he gives you one unkind word he shall have two in return for you will give him as good as he brings if he is passionate you will be so too you will return provoking answers for reflecting words and so make your house a constant scene of confusion and your life uncomfortable and for what why to show how bravely you can return injury for injury how nobly you can contend for victory over your husband and how you can make him despised in his family as well by children as servants and yourself discredited by the poor victory suppose you were to win it by breaking his spirit  is this my dear the part of a tender wife to a husband nay is it the part of a christian to a christian where there is not the matrimonial obligation for are we not commanded to return good for evil and to pray for them that despightfully use us  and is not the wifes conversation to be coupled with fear and do we not vow reverence to a husband as our head  how can all this be if you are to return evil for evil to make yourself your own judge and jury and executioner too by acquitting yourself condemning him sentencing him and punishing him with all the severity of licentious speech provoking snappishness or the still more affecting deportment of sullen contemptuous silence let me on the whole beseech you for my sake who would be loath to be thought to have set you any bad example for your familys sake for your reputations sake as well as his to resolve on a different conduct make the good rule yours of never being out of humor when he is so first soften him by good temper then when softened expostulate mildly on the unreasonableness of his anger if you convince him thus he will take care of the like error or his present confession will strengthen your mild arguments against him in any thing else for the future he will see you advise him for his good he will have a greater opinion of your prudence and be more doubtful of his own he will see you contend not for victory or contradictionsake but for his own sake and depend upon it you will both reap the happy fruits of it in the comfort of your lives in the love of your own children in the reverence of your servants who will otherwise be listed in each contenders quarrel and be insolent judges of the conduct of both in the respect of your neighbors and friends and in the pleasure you will give to your relations who will visit and be visited by you both with that delight which nobody knows how to estimate so much as my dear nanny  your ever affectionate mother   letter cxlvii a lady to her friend a young widow lady who having buried a polite and excellent husband inclines to marry a less deserving gentleman and of unequal fortune dear madam were i to lay it down for a maxim that maids often mend their circumstances by marriage widows very rarely i believe i might be justified by every ones experience to what can the truth of this observation be owing is it to be supposed that widows have stronger passions than maids shall the proud lordly sex have it to boast that they are such estimable creatures that when once one of them has had the fortune to be chosen by a lady and has been taken from her by death she cannot live without taking another and finds herself obliged to accept of the next that offers through all disadvantages and every degree of inequality surely this cannot be the case surely a prudent a modest lady will not say this in so many words  much less then ought she to confess it by her actions which are much stronger than words for i believe no woman who ever entered the pale of matrimony with sprightly hopes about her found the possession  sex only considered equal to her expectations the maid may hope may fansy much in the commerce between the sexes from her meditating on the heightened scenes which pernicious novels and idle romances the poison of female minds abound with but the widow knows it is all freemasonry all empty hope flashy foolish unworthy unpermanent and but for the law of nature despicable  whence is it then that the wishing expecting maid should be more prudent than the knowing experienced widow should be better proof with raised imaginations against courtship or persuasion than one who well knows the transitory vanity and unsatisfactoriness of the end to which that courtship or persuasion tends  if it be said that this point is not so much the case as the settled life of matrimony which has been once so satisfactorily experienced let the circumstances of a lady who abounds in every thing answer this poor but common excuse and let the choice she makes of the person and fortune of her second husband which is generally as i have observed above in both cases far short of her former choice acquit or convict her as her conduct shall deserve  if a young widow indeed advantages herself and worsts not her children if she has any in her second adventure let her proceed she is justified to worldly prudence but this as i have said is so seldom the case even with widow ladies of modesty and discretion in other respects that i must own i have been often puzzled and confounded how to account for the motives of such an one reputably especially when she appears to me and all the world neither to have done honor to the memory of her late spouse to her family to herself nor as sometimes has been the case paid any regard to common decency how i say shall this be accounted for in a lady of prudence and virtue is it that as one extreme is said to border on another extreme joy treads on the heels of extreme sorrow it cannot be for as on one hand i am sure there can be no extreme joy in the matrimonial commerce so i fear where a woman can soon forget her departed spouse she cannot be sensible of extreme grief for his loss and if she will take upon her this latter part of the character and own the first was thus indifferent to her she shall have my consent to do any thing she has a mind to do and i will exempt her willingly from the observation of every other rule of prudence and decency  but in a case the direct reverse of this how shall we account for such a behavior how in particular if the charming the blooming miss bendish who was so coy a maiden and with so much difficulty won by the late amiable and conversible mr brooks with a fortune superior to her own should within a few months after his decease when blessed with an affluence left her by his generosity and affection for her be won by mr fownes a man less accomplished as to knowledge less amiable in his person less polite in his conversation and of a fortune so much beneath what was even her maiden one that her friends then would never have thought him worthy of her  how i say shall we account for this if it should be so is there a secret sympathy in tempers and dispositions that attracts each its like by motives imperceptible and unaccountable it cannot be in this case surely for can the polite mrs brooks be less polite for having been married to one of the bestbred and bestbehavd gentlemen in england and can she so soon get over forms as a widow for such a suitor as mr fownes which as a maid were so long before they could be dispensed with in favor of such a lover as mr brooks  is her soft and delicate mind as well all think it after all more on a level with that of the one gentleman than that of the other far more excellent one has she will the licentious ask stronger incentives to a married state as a widow than she had as a maid  it cannot be  what then shall we say to all this  for after all two years won not miss bendish to a gentleman of exalted worth and two months seem to have made a great progress with mrs brooks  and that in favor of a gentleman whom we all think unworthy of her at all  my dear bosomfriend my schoolfellow my companion as well in the maiden as in the matrimonial though i bless god not in the vidual state resolve me these questions answer to me for this conduct account to me for these seeming unaccountable motives and thereby justify yourself to your reputation to the memory of the dear departed to your own sex to the other sex so attentive as they both are to your conduct in this particular and lastly which will for ever oblige me to  your affectionate and faithful friend and servant   letter cxlviii from a gentleman strenuously expostulating with an old rich widow about to marry a very young gay gentleman madam i am very sorry to hear of the encouragement you give to the visits of young mr barnes because of the great difference in years between you i cannot help giving you the trouble of this expostulation though i am told and much affected i am with the news if it be true that the matter between you is so far gone that all i can say may too probably prove ineffectual  our sex madam in all your late husbands time has received an advantage and a credit from your conduct in the married state and now i wish it may not receive as great a disparagement since the prudent mrs bates thinks fit to countenance the addresses of one who was born after she was married and a mother and who can possibly have no other inducement than your fortune i believe madam you never knew one happy marriage of this sort in all your life and you will reflect that you will not be entitled to pity nor the young man to censure if he should prove the worst and most profligate of husbands to you for every one will censure you and acquit him should he even treat you with personal abuse and barbarity  besides it is well known that mr barnes is a young man of no very promising inclinations some young gentlemen are as grave and discreet at twentyfive as others at thirtyfive but he has all the vanity the gaiety the affectation of any one at his time of life and can you expect that he will treat you well that was never noted for treating his own mother very dutifully who by the way is younger than yourself advanced years are the constant subject of ridicule with such wild young fellows to their shame be it spoken and what can you expect when the very motives by which you shall be supposed to be acted in such a match will involve you in the deepest censure will make you the contempt of persons of all ages and both sexes and expose you to the low buffoonery even of the man you have chosen who instead of being your protector as a husband ought to be will probably be the person who will lead the jest that all will join in upon you in order to excuse his own sorbid choice  you owe it madam give me leave to say to the memory of your late worthy husband you owe it to your sex you owe it to yourself and your own interest and future good nay to decency i will venture to add to proceed no further in this affair it seems to me to be next to a degree of incest for a woman all hoary and greygoosed over by time or who will be soon so to expose herself to the embraces of a young fellow who is not so old as her first son would have been had he lived forgive me madam but i cannot help this plaindealing on the occasion if you proceed in giving encouragement to the boys address i expect not nor can i desire to be forgiven or to stand upon common terms with you if otherwise i am ready to ask your pardon but i cannot with patience think that mrs bates who has passed through every station hitherto with so much applause as well that of the prudent widow and exemplary matron as the affectionate wife should give so great a wound to our sex as she will do if she makes such a boy as mr barnes the successor to her late worthy husband and the master of her person and fortune by which act she will vow obedience to one who was in a cradle when she had children of her own who were rising from it and who would undoubtedly despise her in this light were it not for her wealth all of which that he can get at by force or fair means if he acts by you as others generally have done in the same circumstances will be squandered away upon rival objects more suitable to his youth while you will be the laughing stock and scorn of such as will revel in your spoils and triumph over you by the help of your own fortune mean time you will be so far from engaging the pity of your sex that the more considerate of them will shun and contemn you as one who has brought a disgrace upon it the men will despise and flout you and you will have nothing to do but to hide in a contemned obscurity that greygreen head which has so inconsiderately involved you in so much distress and to turn penitent for it and pray for an end to a miserable life which come when it will will give cause of joy and triumph to your young husband and very little sorrow to any other person  but i hope still for better things and i hope for pardon for this freedom for fain would i be thought by mrs bates  her affectionate and faithful friend and humble servant   the following eleven epistles may serve as models for letters to write by on the like occasion likewise to give a brief description of london and westminster to such as have not seen those cities and to point out to those who never were in town before what is most worthy of notice in it  letter cxlix from a young lady in town to her aunt in the country i describing the tower monument st pauls etc honored madam you will have me write you down accounts of what i see remarkable in and about london to keep me as you say out of idleness and to entertain my good friends in my absence i will obey though your good opinion of me i am sensible will be no small disadvantage to me for i shall convince you more effectually than ever of my defects and want of that ability to entertain my absent friends which their partiality had made them expect from me  to begin then my aunt and cousins carried me in the first place to see the tower of london which we have heard so much talk of in the country and which no one that visits this great town omits seeing it is situated by the thames side surrounded with an old wall about a mile in compass with a broad deep ditch which has generally more mud in it than water all round the outward wall are guns planted which on extraordinary occasions are fired as on more common ones they fire only rows of others which are fixed in the ground on the wharf by the thames at the entrance on the right hand we saw the collection of wild beasts kept there as lions panthers tigers etc also eagles vulturs etc  we were then carried to the mint where we saw the manner of coining money and striking medals etc from thence we went to the jewelhouse and were shown the crown and the other regalia which gave me no small pleasure as i had never seen these things before and heard so much talk of them  the horsearmory is a fine sight for here they show fifteen of our english monarchs on horseback all in rich armor attended with guards but i think this sight not comparable to the small armory for here pikes muskets swords halberds and pistols enough as they told us for threescore thousand men are all placed in such beautiful order and such various figures representing the sun star and garter halfmoons and suchlike that i was greatly delighted with the sight all the arms being bright and shining  we saw the train of artillery in what they call the grand storehouse filled with cannon and mortars all very fine a divingbell and other curiosities and i thought upon the whole that this great magazine of curiosities and stores was the most worthy of the notice of a stranger to london of any thing i had been shown  from hence they carried me to the monument built in remembrance of the fire of london a very curious pillar from the gallery of which we had a survey of the whole city but as it stands low i cannot say but i liked the prospect from st pauls cupola much better when i was carried up thither which was yesterday for that being the highest situation in the city and more in the center of london and westminster commands a finer view over both cities hampstead and highgate hills surrey the river etc the cathedral is a most noble building and i admired it not a little for its choir chapels dome whisperingplace vaults below and other curiosities too tedious to mention  this madam may serve for one letter and to show you how much i am desirous by my obedience to your commands to approve myself  your dutiful niece   letter cl from the same ii describing other remarkable places in and about london and westminster which are generally shown to strangers honored madam i have seen the customhouse a place of hurry and business with a crowded and inconvenient key compared to that of bristol st thomass and guys hospitals southwark all most noble charities st bartholomews a still nobler but which by its additional buildings seems to be in a way to swallow up its own revenues by pulling down their tenants houses which contributed means to support the charity smithfield also a spacious market for live cattle etc as i should have said i had leaden hall market a prodigy of its kind and the admiration of foreigners sadlerswells at islington i have been at and seen there the diversions of ropedancing volting singing music etc which i thought well enough for once islingtonwells or the new tunbridge i have been at the walks and rooms neat enough and good decorum observed in both  the bluecoat hospital i have also seen another noble charity and the pretty sight of the children at church and at supper of sunday night which much pleased me the charter house too another noble charity  also the guildhall of london a handsome building adorned with pictures and with the trophies of the duke of marlboroughs victory over the french and the preposterous wooden figures of the two famous giants the royal exchange likewise a very fine edifice but they say the statues of the kings and queens there are ill done except that of charles ii in the middle of the area and one or two more  i have also been carried to westminster hall and the two houses where the lords and commons meet they are by no means answerable to what i expected though the house of commons is the neatest and very convenient for hearing and seeing too westminster hall like guildhall is adorned with more of the duke of marlboroughs trophies and it has shops on each side for milaners booksellers and suchlike trades here the coronationfeast is kept and here are held as you know the courts of chancery kings bench common pleas and up stairs the court and offices of the exchequer  the abbey we are to see another time being obliged to dine at westminster with a friend of my cousins  somerset house in the strand i have seen noted for its pleasant garden fronting the river and it is indeed a fine palace itself designed for the residence of the queens dowager of england when we have such a personage marlborough house in the park is finely furnished and adorned with pictures of the dukes battles st jamess house is a poor palace for a king of england but it seems convenient on the inside buckingham house stands better than that for commanding the beautiful park and canal the treasury a fine new building white hall whose glory is the banqueting house justly admired for its architecture by inigo jones and inside painting by rubens it is a noble situation for a palace which were it to be built like this would be the most magnificent in the world  we took coach another time and were carried through the principal squares and new buildings about london and westminster which are highly worth seeing such as lincolns end square lincolns end fields st jamess square soho square hanover square cavendish square and grosvenor square with the multitude of stately buildings and noble streets contiguous to the latter a sight worthy of admiration  this madam may serve for a second letter and another instance though a poor one of that obedience which will always bind me to be  your dutiful niece   letter cli from the same iii describing chelsea hospital and kensington palace honored madam i have been carried by my obliging cousins to chelsea college about a mile from st jamess park and to kensington palace about two miles west from london  the college you know was founded by king charles ii and finished by the late king william for the reception of superannuated officers and soldiers it is situated on the banks of the thames its gardens extending quite down to the river it is a neat and stately building the front looking to the thames has a fine hall on one side and a neat chapel on the other with a noble pavilion as they call it between them the two sides are four stories high and have two wards in each story containing thirtysix neat bedrooms each for so many soldiers each corner of this main building is adorned with a fine pavilion being the governors lodging and council chamger lodgings for officers etc in the middle of the square is a brass statue of king charles ii on a marble pedestal  there are besides four other large and uniform wings one is the infirmary for the sick a second for maimed officers a third for officers of the college the fourth for servants the whole is a neat convenient and airy building well worth a strangers view  kensington palace is a very pretty summer retirement for the court it is adorned with fine pictures rich hangings and other ornaments but the gardens which have been much augmented of late years are delightful and we diverted ourselves in walking round them which gave me great pleasure and i could not but wish that you madam were with me because you love walking and would have been much pleased with these charming gardens which abound with fine walks etc a noble piece of water called the serpentine river but for what reason i know not it being a strait and not winding piece presents itself to view and there is lately a new road made through hydepark to kensington by the late q caroline to keep the gardens clear from dust in the summer and make them more private from horses passengers coaches etc for the old road in one part ran almost close to the wall a row of lamps from one end to the other of this road is placed on each side of it when the court is there which is a beauty as well as convenience  will this madam serve for a third letter on the subject you have prescribed to  your everdutiful niece   letter clii from the same iv describing greenwich park and the passage to it by water honored madam last tuesday being easter tuesday i went with my uncle aunt and cousins down the river on what they call a party of pleasure but with design principally to see greenwich park and hospital  we took water at the tower which i described in my first letter i was pretty much afraid of danger from anchors cables and suchlike as we passed by the great numbers of ships that lay in our way at first setting out but afterward the river looked very pleasant and the number of boats all rowing with the tide made the river look very agreeably  after sailing not many miles we come within sight of the dockyard at deptford where several large ships upon the stocks afforded a fine prospect as the naval strength of england is both its glory and its defense  next to deptford i was greatly pleased with the prospect of the royal hospital at greenwich for seamen grown old in the service of their country when we landed we went into this fine building and in the inside every thing in my judgment was perfectly agreeable to the magnificence of the outside allowing the one to be designed to do honor to the nation the other to support a number of necessitous people who ought to be the public care the great hall and the paintings in it are admirable but i know not whether they would not better suit a palace than an hospital and indeed this may be said of the whole building  from thence we went into the park where i beheld diverse odd scenes of holidayfolks here appeared a rakish young fellow with two or three women who looked like servantmaids the hero delighted the nymphs smiling round him  there a carefullooking father with his children on each side trains of admiring lovers readypaird followed one another in thronging crowds at the gate a seaofficer with a lady not overburdened with modesty in her behavior a crowd of city apprentices some with some without their lasses half a dozen beaux ogling all they met and several seemingly disconsolate virgins walking alone the concourse of middling objects pressed chiefly toward a high hill in the middle of the park where as they arrived their business was to take hold of hands and run down as fast as possible amidst the huzzas of a multitude of people who earnestly expected to see the women fall in hopes that their clothes would not lie so conveniently when they were down as might be wished  this madam is a diversion you would not expect so near the polite city of london but i assure you such a levity possessed almost every body assembled on this occasion as made the park though most beautiful in itself no way entertaining to  your most dutiful niece   letter cliii from the same v describing bethlehem hospital honored madam you tell me in your last that my descriptions and observations are very superficial and that both my uncle and yourself expect from me much better accounts than i have yet given you for i must deliver my opinion it seems on what i see as well as tell you what i have been shown it is well i left my bettermost subjects to the last such i mean as will best bear reflection and i must try what i can do to regain that reputation which your indulgence rather than my merit had formed for me in your kind thoughts  yet i doubt i shall not please you after all but it is my duty to try for it and it will be yours i had almost said to forgive imperfections which i should have concealed but for your undeserved good opinions of me which draw them into light  i have this afternoon been with my cousins to gratify the odd curiosity most people have to see bethlehem or bedlam hospital  a more affecting scene my eyes never beheld and surely madam any one inclined to be proud of human nature and to value themselves above others cannot go to a place that will more effectually convince them of their folly for there we see man destitute of every mark of reason and wisdom and levelled to the brute creation if not beneath it and all the remains of good sense or education serve only to make the unhappy person appear more deplorable  i had the shock of seeing the late polite and ingenious mr  in one of these woeful chambers we had heard you know of his being somewhat disordered but i did not expect to find him here no sooner did i put my face to the grate but he leaped from his bed and called me with frightful fervency to come into his room the surprise affected me pretty much and my confusion being observed by a crowd of strangers i heard it presently whispered that i was his sweetheart and the cause of his misfortune my cousin assured me such fancies were frequent upon these occasions but this accident drew so many eyes upon me as obliged me soon to quit the place  i was much at a loss to account for the behavior of the generality of people who were looking at these melancholy objects instead of the concern i think unavoidable at such a sight a sort of mirth appeared on their countenances and the distempered fancies of the miserable patients most unaccountably provoked mirth and loud laughter in the unthinking auditors and the many hideous roarings and wild motions of others seemed equally entertaining to them nay so shamefully inhuman were some among whom i am sorry to say it were several of my own sex as to endeavor to provoke the patients into rage to make them sport  i have been told this dreadful place is often used for the resort of lewd persons to meet and make assignments but that i cannot credit since the heart must be abandoned indeed that could be vicious amidst so many examples of misery and of such misery as being wholly involuntary may overtake the most secure  i am no great admirer of public charities as they are too often managed but if we consider the impossibility of poor peoples bearing this misfortune or providing suitably for the distempered at their own beings no praise can surely be too great for the founders and supporters of an hospital which none can visit without receiving the most melancholy proof of its being needful i am with respects where due honored madam  your most dutiful niece   letter cliv from the same vi diversions of vauxhall described honored madam i went on monday last to vauxhall gardens whither every body must go or appear a sort of monster in polite company for the convenience of waterage as well as of conversation we were a pretty large company and the evening proved serene and clear  the passage from somerset stairs where we took water was pleasant enough the thames at high water being a most beautiful river especially above westminster where the green banks and the open country afford a very agreeable prospect the place we landed at was crowded with boats and from the waterside to the gardens we walked through a double line of gaping watermen footmen old beggarwomen and children as soon as we entered the walks i was pleased with a sort of stage or scaffold raised at the entrance for the servants of the company to sit out of their masters way and yet within call of the waiters  the musickgallery and organ look perfectly polite and their being raised one story from the ground has a good effect upon the music the walks are well enough but environed with paltry wooden boards where i expected at least a good brickwall one part of the whole is thrown into walks only the other is on the sides filled with seats or arbours with painted backs on each of which is represented some scene of our most common plays or the youthful representation of the infant games etc i happened to have at my back honest hob come dripping wet out of the well and the young fellows under color of showing their taste in observing the beauties of the piece were so perpetually staring in our faces that cousin bet and i had little pleasure in our supper perhaps you will wonder at our supping in so open a place but i assure you madam no lady is too tender for so fashionable a repast my uncle treated us very cheerfully but i could not help grudging the expense he was at for when the reckoning was paid it amounted to no less than ten shillings a head which i think too dear as the entrancemoney must be sufficient to defray the house and music but as the whole is devoted to pleasure the expense seems rather to create satisfaction than distaste as it gives an opportunity to gallant people to oblige those they love or pretend to love in order most of them to pay themselves again with large interest  the figure of mr handel a great master of music stands on one side the gardens and looks pretty enough the music plays from five to ten about three tunes i believe i should have said pieces in an hour they are all reported to be the best performers who assist here but my rough ears cannot distinguish  about ten of clock many people think of home but the votaries of cupid i am told about that time visit the remotest walks and sigh out the soft passion in accents that may possibly be improved by the melting sweetness of the music  i would not have you from hence conclude any rudeness can be offered for at the termination of every walk through the whole garden is placed a man to protect the company from all manner of insult but when the place grows thin of company the lovers have a better chance to escape being laughed at on the appearance of any amorous symptom  soon after ten we returned to our boat and i found the passage extremely cold notwithstanding a covering over us i must own i wished to be at home long before i reached it for i was taken with such a shivering as did not leave me for two days  thus madam have i been at vauxhall with the crowd of fashionhunters but if nobody had a greater inclination than i have to go thither again that amusement would soon be given up  for i see more and more that do what i will nature never designed me to be polite and i can sincerely declare that i take more satisfaction in an eveningwalk with you up the westgrove where i am so often benefited by your good instructions than in the enchanting shades of the so much celebrated vauxhall i am honored madam  your most dutiful niece   letter clv from the same vii an account of westminsterabbey honored madam i have this afternoon been at westminsterabbey and not a little pleased with what i have seen there if there can be majesty in the grave here we see it and such was the solemn effect the sacred repository had upon me that i never found an awful reverence equal to what i felt on that occasion whatever be the intention of erecting these costly monuments they seem to me very capable of being made an excellent sermon to succeeding generations for here the most sumptuous piles serve only to show that every one of us must submit to the same fate that has overtaken those whom empire itself could not save and how humble ought the person to be who surveys the royal ruins of mortality preserved as if in a vain defiance of time to show nothing more than the certianty of our dissolution  these madam were my general sentiments on this occasion but as i know you expect more particular descriptions from me i will tell you what most struck my notice among the many remarkable curiosities to be here met with  among the royal monuments those of ancient date pleased me best because they look agreeable to what i read of the plain royalty of our former sovereigns i lamented the loss of henry the fifths head which being silver as they say was stolen during the civil war i much wonder it has never yet been supplied from some of his bustos he wanted not a head to speak in the metaphorical style while living and france can testify that his heart deserved all things of english men for he was the terror of the one and the glory of the other  henry the sevenths chapel in every part of it is surprisingly magnificent and beautiful and as far as i can judge of such things far surpasses all i have seen either of ancient or modern date  in this chapel is the chair in which our kings for many ages have been crowned it is very plain and looks as if it were not worth more than the forfeit paid for sitting in it  the body of queen catharine consort to henry the fifth was shown us in an open coffin and what remains of skin looks like black discolored parchment she is said to have been very beautiful and surely to view her now is a most effectual antidote against the vanity rising from that dangerous accomplishment  two ambassadors coffins are kept here said to be detained for want of having their debts discharged this indeed does little credit to the crown they served but i can scarce think it the dishonor designed them to be reposited among the remains of our kings though indeed several of them have their debts unpaid too as i am told  several effigies are preserved in wax particularly those of king william and his excellent queen mary as also very lately the truly royal queen anne to be sure this is no bad way for a few years to preserve their likeness but i know not whether such gay representations suit the solemnity of a sepulcher and yet some that stand here seem not to have deserved that distinction if it be deemed one in favor of their memories general monk if i were to judge would be one of those for his constant train of hypocrisy for a long time seemed a contradiction to the apostolical precept not to do evil that good may come of it a duchess of richmond who walked at king charles the seconds coronation never was remarkable for any thing as i can hear but that  a very costly effigy of the late duke of buckinghamshire is in this place who was somewhat remarkable in his time but chiefly for doing what pleased himself whether any body else was pleased or bettered by it or not and what is odd enough the present duchess stands by him her son too the last duke who died just before he came of age is distinguished with an ostentation superior to all the rest though all i can learn of him is that he was a hopeful young nobleman and the darling of his mother  general monk whom i mentioned before in a habit mourning the power of time stands in a posture so very fierce as to seem rather intended to scare children than for any other purpose  i had almost forgot his royal master king charles the second who stands in his garter robes and has long been admired by all comers it seems for restoring monarchy for i can remember no worthy actions in his history nor were we told any more by the person who exposed his image to our view  many reasons make it necessary for the wills of deceased persons to be literally observed though some instances of this kind do little honor to the deceased as a monument erected to the consort of a noble lord for whom a vacancy being left on his tomb as for his second wife she because she could not take the right hand of his first lady left strict order to be buried where her bones now lie and thereby has transmitted her pride and folly to succeeding ages  near this tomb is the figure of a lady bleeding to death by pricking her finger she was maid of honor to queen elizabeth and i think of the russel family it seems she got her fatal wound at her needle and such has been the care of the ladies who have succeeded her that not one has fallen under the like misfortune ever since  if i shall not quite tire you i will proceed with this subject in my next  and am mean time honored madam  your most dutiful niece   letter clvi from the same viii account of westminsterabbey continued honored madam i now trouble you with an account of what most struck my attention in the outward ails of westminsterabbey  at entering the northgate a monument of prodigious size and great expense stood on my lefthand it is that of john holles late duke of newcastle and all that is left him out of upwards of  0000 l a year as they tell me he had accumulated and the two heirs not much the richer for their shares of it neither i hope as we say in our country phrase it was honestly got  next to this is one consecrated to the memory of the duke that preceded him the last of his name of the cavendish family as the other was of the holles with the celebrated lady his duchess margaret a great writer and a great chemist you know we have her olio both lying side by side on a tomb made great by their names and distinguished by their adventures but as to outward grandeur wholly eclipsed by the former behind these is a large room or little chapel separated from the public places in which are reposited the holles family one of these gentlemen has at his feet the representation of a wild boar in token of his having killed one of those animals when he was on a croisade another has a large black patch over his righteye having lost an eye on the like expedition  not far from hence a fine monument stands to the memory of dr chamberlen a manmidwife of no great fame when living but who happened to have the esteem of the present duchess of buckingham who erected this to his memory  a magnificent monument stands near this of a lady whose name is carteret and some reports assign an odd cause for her death viz the late french kings saying a lady one of his nobles compared to her was the handsomest of the two  a fine monument of lord courcey stands near this on which we are told one of his ancestors had a privilege granted of wearing his hat before the king  here are several monuments of gentlemen who fell in the late wars col bringfield in particular who had his head shot off by a cannon ball as he was mounting the duke of marlborough who had a horse shot under him those of others who were famous for different talents as my favorite purcel and dr crofts for music decorate the north isle at the head of which stands sir godfrey kneller painter to his late majesty but with a copy of verses on it that judges say are not very extraordinary and yet mr popes name is affixed to them in a corner that answers to it on the south side of the westgate stands a curious resemblance of james craggs esquire secretary of state in    0 erected by a certain duchess for what reason is not said mr pope has been lavish of his praises much more being engraved on this gentlemans monument of his virtue etc than i ever heard anywhere else but they say he was a companionable man as some call it and easy of access  a small distance from this is a monument erected by another duchess sister of the former to the memory of mr congreve from the great esteem she bore him so here are three monuments erected to three favorites by three duchesses what a generous sex is ours who carry their esteem for the merit of those they favor beyond the grave on the same side of the church is a very slight monument of the great earl godolphin who was ld high treasurer during the prosperous part of queen annes reign and the mean appearance this makes when compared with those of mr craggs mr congreve dr chamberlen etc makes a spectator sensible that a judgment of the deceaseds merits must not be formed from their monuments nor as is to be hoped the gratitude and affection of their descendents either sir cloudesly shovel has great honor done him his monument being erected at the expense of his royal mistress but i thought he was a rough honest tar yet his effigies makes him a great beau with a fine flowing fullbottomd periwig such a one but much finer and more in buckle than that we have seen our lawyer mr kettleby wear at our assizes  mr thynnes murder is prettily represented on his tomb  but before i step into what is called the poets row i must return to the door of the choir on the northside of which is placed a noble monument of the great sir isaac newton which i humbly apprehend to be needless for has he not built for himself a much finer monument and a much more durable one than marble and will it not outlast this we see here and the abbey which contains it he lies in a contemplative posture leaning on the volumes that have made his name immortal opposite to him at the south entrance of the same door is a very grand pile to the memory of the late earl stanhope a brave soldier though unfortunate in one battle and a man of great probity  on one side of the poets are dr south and dr busby the one an humorous and witty divine the other as remarkable a schoolmaster being famous for his discipline and severity geoffry chaucer has reached us spencer is near him philips not far from spencer ben johnson is written on a poor bust and butler put up by a printer to make his own name famous bears him company i would fain not name matt prior but his monument is so beautiful and large and his busto so admirable being a present to the poet by the french king lewis xiv that i must not pass it over though poor man it serves only to proclaim his vanity being erected at his own desire and expense a sad instance of pride beyond the grave behind him stands mr gay in a place consecrated to mortality declaring life is a jest etc dryden has only his name on his bust milton has lately been put up by a gentleman who after the printers example abovementioned has a mind to engraft his own fame on the others stock but in this outdoes mr barber for after dedicating six single letters to the poets name milton he bestows many words upon his own not being content to name the little honors he the erector now enjoys but the lesser ones which he possessed in the former reign and from this example the architect who no doubt was paid for his labor has seven words to his fame declaring that rysbrack was the statuary who cut it here is fine engrafting work for you however miltons memory is a tree that will do honor to the weakest scyon that shall sprout from it or even to a dunghill were such a thing to lie at its root but of our poets i will add no more for shakespeare is not among them i am madam  your most obedient niece   letter clvii from the same ix on a concert or musical entertainment honored madam i went last night to see or rather to hear a new entertainment of music and must confess  is much disappointed of the pleasure i promised myself i cannot say but i liked two or three of the songs well enough and the music that was playing all the while i did not disapprove but pray madam can you tell me for i have already asked twenty not one of whom will answer me what is the reason of having every word spoken squeaked to  i cannot say a tune but to such a hum as makes me quite sick if it be the music that is valuable why must the words torture it and if the words be sought after wherefore should they be broken to pieces by notes that drown the sound and quite lose their sense what i mean is i believe called speaking in recitative but whence was this mode of speech taken in what country is it natural and if it be natural nowhere of what is it an imitation what are the marks of its excellencies and how shall we judge of its merit whence can arise any pleasure from hearing it and shall we find cause for excusing the time lost in such an unnatural amusement for myself i must own twas far from delighting me for as it was neither singing nor speaking i could not tell what to make of it for it was more like to make me cry than laugh i was so provoked when the twang of the harpsichord robbed me of the word the whole preceding line depended upon  i must confess myself for downright speaking or singing i hate mongrels unless my judgment be convinced by such reasons as i cannot for my life hit upon at present yet after all i begin to think i am betraying my ignorance all this time and so i will conclude myself madam  your most dutiful niece   letter clviii from the same x on the diversions of the playhouse honored madam now i have by your indulgence tarried in town till the approach of winter you will expect that i should give you a little account of the diversions of the stage to begin then my cousin william and his two sisters conducted me last night to the playhouse and we took places in the pit  you may believe i was agreeably surprised at the magnificence of the stage and its elegant ornaments and i was mightily pleased to see such a prodigious number of people seated with ease and conveniently placed to hear the natural pitch of a common voice i did not expect to find the music so near the audience but believe that the most proper situation to convey the sound over the whole theater  the play i saw was a comedy in which the parts acted by women had several speeches that i thought not quite consistent with the modesty of the sex and the freedom of their voice and gestures though perhaps suitable enough to the characters they represented were not so pleasing to a mind bent upon innocent amusement if not wholly upon instruction as speeches that put us not to the expense of a blush what hardship must it be to the minds of these women to enter first upon this employment how must their virtue and sure no woman is without virtue at her entrance into the world be shocked to offer themselves for the entertainment of six hundred men and to utter words which convey ideas too gross for a modest ear and such as would be difficult to hear in private company without confusion how hard then must the utterance of them be to a numerous and gay assembly and yet i am assured several women who get their bread upon the stage are strictly virtuous if such there are how great must be their merit when compared with that of the wicked ones of our sex who are liable to none of their certain and numerous temptations but yet where it can be avoided why should women expose themselves to certain dangers if there is a possibility of obtaining a tolerable subsistence without it and those who can live by performance upon the stage certainly require qualifications more than sufficient to subsist in safer and less dependent stations  the behavior of the men i did not so much wonder at for a becoming assurance in them is rather pleasing than disobliging nor did i perceive that so many expressions which are oftener miscalled arch than more truly named obscene were put into the mouths of the men as of the women though the reason the poets have for this i cannot guess  the conduct of the company i thought to the highest degree commendable the utmost decency was observed and i saw nothing disagreeable to the strictest politeness or good manners the awe given by so great an audience of persons of taste being too much to admit any thing but what is decent and obliging not that i think it advisable for women to go alone to the playhouse for the complaisance so fashionable at present affords a sort of occasion for laying them under such seeming obligations as cannot be returned and ought therefore not to be accepted  these dear madam are the rough thoughts on this occasion of  your dutiful niece   letter clix from the same xi the play and the low scenes of harlequinery after it described and exposed honored madam having as i told you in my last seen a comedy i was next carried by my cousin william and his kind sisters to a tragedy which was that of hamlet and i was greatly moved with the play and pleased with the action but the low scenes of harlequinery that were exhibited afterward filled me with high disgust insomuch that i could for their sake have wished i had not seen the other i will give you an account of this dismal piece of farcical dumb show  we were then presented with the most extraordinary gentleman i ever beheld who with the ugliest face and most apish behavior i ever saw had the most amazing success in his amors with ladies whose appearance deserved a more amiable gallant  my cousin william told me the name of this hero was mr harlequin but as you know billy has no great capacity you will be the less surprised to hear he answered not one question i asked him to my satisfaction  whom does that character represent cousin  harlequin  pray of what nation is the gentleman  france  what is his business on the stage  to be admired by every woman who sets eyes on him  why seem they so fond of him  because he is harlequin  why is his face black  harlequin s was never of any other color  who is the lady with whom he appears to be in the strictest engagement  colombine  who is she  colombine  whence came she pray cousin  from france  is she married or single  mostly married and at harlequin s service in spite of her husbands teeth  why so  because colombine is to be at his beck on every occasion  for what reason  because they never appear without one another  is this nature  it is fashion and that is as good  why dont these worthy persons favor us with a song  they never speak  how must i understand them  by the motion of their heads hands and heels  have they no tongues  they must not use them  why does he wear a wooden sword  it is his symbol to which whatever obstructs his wishes must give way  why  that he may come at colombine against all obstruction  why must they needs be together  that the people may laugh  wherefore should we laugh  because they are together  why does mr harlequin delight so much in jumping  to please his mistress  why does she admire him for that  because he can reach her over other mens shoulders  is that wit  we laugh at it  so you may but it is more like to set me a crying  youre a country lass cousin  you cousin are a town gentleman  by this madam you may guess at my entertainment we had just seen hamlet as i have said my heart was full of ophelias distress and the princes fate had shook my soul in this state of mind to sit two hours to see people run after one another as if they were bewitched only to cuckold a poor simplelooking husband put me so much out of patience that i shall not bear the sight of the stage for some time and indeed having now run through the diversions of the town i begin to be desirous of casting myself at your feet as becomes  your dutiful niece   letter clx from a country gentleman in town to his brother in the country describing a public execution in london dear brother i have this day been satisfying a curiosity i believe natural to most people by seeing an execution at tyburn the sight has had an extraordinary effect upon me which is more owing to the unexpected oddness of the scene than the affecting concern which is unavoidable in a thinking person at a spectacle so awful and so interesting to all who consider themselves of the same species with the unhappy sufferer  that i might the better view the prisoners and escape the pressure of the mob which is prodigious nay almost incredible if we consider the frequency of these executions in london which is once a month i mounted my horse and accompanied the melancholy cavalcade from newgate to the fatal tree the criminals were five in number i was much disappointed at the unconcern and carelessness that appeared in the faces of three of the unhappy wretches the countenances of the other two were spread with that horror and despair which is not to be wondered at in men whose period of life is so near with the terrible aggravation of its being hastened by their own voluntary indiscretion and misdeeds the exhortation spoken by the bellman from the wall of st sepulchres churchyard is well intended but the noise of the officers and the mob was so great and the silly curiosity of people climbing into the cart to take leave of the criminals made such a confused noise that i could not hear the words of the exhortation when spoken though they are as follow  all good people pray heartily to god for these poor sinners who now are going to their deaths for whom this great bell does toll  you that are condemned to die repent with lamentable tears ask mercy of the lord for the salvation of your own souls through the merits death and passion of jesus christ who now sits at the right hand of god to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto him   lord have mercy upon you christ have mercy upon you  which last words the bellman repeats three times  all the way up holborn the crowd was so great as at every twenty or thirty yards to obstruct the passage and wine notwithstanding a late good order against that practice was brought the malefactors who drank greedily of it which i thought did not suit well with their deplorable circumstances after this the three thoughtless young men who at first seemed not enough concerned grew most shamefully daring and wanton behaving themselves in a manner that would have been ridiculous in men in any circumstance whatever they swore laughed and talked obscenely and wished their wicked companions good luck with as much assurance as if their employment had been the most lawful  at the place of execution the scene grew still more shocking and the clergyman who attended was more the subject of ridicule than of their serious attention the psalm was sung amidst the curses and quarrelling of hundreds of the most abandoned and profligate of mankind upon whom so stupid are they to any sense of decency all the preparation of the unhappy wretches seems to serve only for subject of a barbarous kind of mirth altogether inconsistent with humanity and as soon as the poor creatures were half dead i was much surprised before such a number of peaceofficers to see the populace fall to halling and pulling the carcasses with so much earnestness as to occasion several warm rencounters and broken heads these i was told were the friends of the persons executed or such as for the sake of tumult chose to appear so and some persons sent by private surgeons to obtain bodies for dissection the contests between these were sierce and bloody and frightful to look at so that i made the best of my way out of the crowd and with some difficulty rode back among a large number of people who had been upon the same errand with myself the face of every one spoke a kind of mirth as if the spectacle they had beheld had afforded pleasure instead of pain which i am wholly unable to account for  in other nations common criminal exections are said to be little attended by any beside the necessary officers and the mournful friends but here all was hurry and confusion racket and noise praying and oaths swearing and singing psalms i am unwilling to impute this difference in our own to the practice of other nations to the cruelty of our natures to which foreigners however to our dishonor ascribe it in most instances let them say what they will we are humane beyond what other nations can boast but in this the behavior of my countrymen is past my accounting for every street and lane i pasted through bearing rather the face of a holiday than of that sorrow which i expected to see for the untimely deaths of five members of the community  one of the bodies was carried to the lodging of his wife who not being in the way to receive it they immediately hawked it about to every surgeon they could think of and when none would buy it they rubbed tar all over it and left it in a field hardly covered with earth  this is the best description i can give you of a scene that was no way entertaining to me and which i shall not again take so much pains to see i am dear brother  yours affectionately   advice of an aunt to a niece in relation to her conduct in the addresses made her by two gentlemen one a gay fluttering military coxcomb the other a man of sense and honor in five letters  letter clxi i the aunt to the niece desiring her own opinion of her two lovers dear lydia i am given to understand that you have two new admirers of very different tempers and professions the one capt tomkins of the guards the other mr rushford as i know mr rushford to be a sensible sedate worthy gentleman i am a little uneasy lest he should be discouraged for the other and yet as i know not the merits or qualifications of the captain i would not censure you or condemn him right or wrong this makes me desire your sentiments of both and that you will acquaint me to which you most incline i have a very high opinion of your prudence and can have no view in this request but your good only i must assure you that i have such an esteem for mr rushfords character that the other gentleman ought to be something more extraordinary than is to be generally met with in his profession to be preferred to him i hope you will think so too but be this as it will the frank declaration of your mind will be very obliging to  your truly affectionate aunt   letter clxii ii the nieces answer describing the behavior of the sensible lover honored aunt i have on so many occasions as well of this as other kinds been obliged to your kind concern for me that i should be very ungrateful if i concealed from you the least bias of my mind on so important an occasion i think truly with you that mr rushford is a very valuable gentleman yet he is overnice sometimes as to the company i see and would take upon him a little too much if i did not keep him at a distance and particularly is so uneasy about the captain that he wants me to forbear seeing him on any occasion now i think this is a little too prescribing for the time of our acquaintance and the small progress i have hitherto permitted to the intimacy between us for what is this but surrendering to him upon his own terms and that too before i am summoned in form nothing but a betrothed lover or a husband has surely a right to expect this observance and if i were to oblige him it is absolutely putting myself in his power before he convinces me how he will use it o my dear aunt these men i see even the worthiest of them are incroaching creatures  and a woman that would not be despised must not make her will too cheap an offering to that of her admirer then my dear aunt i know not how it was with you formerly but there is a pleasure in being admired that affects one very sensibly and i know not whether even mr rushford would say half the fine things he does if he had not a competitor that says nothing else and i think it a kind of robbery that a woman commits upon her pleasures if she too soon confines herself to one for she can be but once courted unless such an event happens that she must have a very bad heart that can wish for it and why should a woman absolutely bind herself to the terms of for better or for worse before she goes to church  i hope when the ceremony has passed i shall make a very good wife but why should i buckle to honor and obey when it is all the time i shall have to be honored and obeyed myself  indeed aunt i think there is a great deal in this and mr rushford gives himself wonderful grave airs already as i will give you an instance  but here the captain is come and i will give you an account of it in my next for i will lay before you faithfully all my proceedings with both gentlemen and their behavior and you will be enabled to judge from my account which i prefer were i not to declare myself as plainly as i am sure i ought to do in every particular demanded of me by so good an aunt i am madam  your truly dutiful and affectionate kinswoman   letter clxiii from the same iii containing the description of the behavior of the same gentleman which occasions a lovequarrel honored aunt i hope the suspense i gave you by my abrupt breaking off in my last will be forgiven i was going to give you an instance of mr rushfords grave airs he comes last thursday with great formality and calls himself my humble servant and i saw he was pleased to be displeased at something and so looked as grave as he only bowing my head and following my work for i was hemming a handkerchief you are very busy madam  yes sir  perhaps i break in upon you  not much sir  i am sorry if i do at all madam  you see i am pursuing my work as i was before you came  i do madam  very gravely said he  but i have known it otherwise when somebody else has been here  very likely sir  but then i did as i pleased  so i do now  and who shall control me  i beg pardon madam but it is my value for you  that makes you troublesome said i interrupting him  i am sorry for it madam  your humble servant  yours sir  so away he went  well thought i if thou art to be lost for this and must put me into bodily fear every time thou have a mind to be grave adieu to thee  in the evening he comes again  mrs betty is your lady disingaged could i be admitted to say one word to her i believe so sir madam mr rushford begs to be admitted to say one word to you he was at the door and heard me as i know do you introduce him said i with as much form as he to my presence he entered i rose up with my hands before me  i see you are angry with me madam  i am sorry for it sir said i sorry for your anger i hope madam  i should be sorry sir said i if any body should see me angry for nothing  i am sorry madam that you set as nothing one that has so much value for you mr rushford said i we have so many sorrys between us that i should be pleased with a few glads  why said he with this stiff set air do you delight to vex thus an heart that you can make sorry or glad at your pleasure  why am i sir to be treated capriciously and to have my conduct upbraided when you think proper to be out of humor  i out of humor madam  i thought so  was it in high good humor that you insulted me with that somebody else  i own madam i cannot bear to see you so gay so pleased and lively when that painted butterfly is here and so grave so laconick so reserved when i pay my respects to you prythee prythee mr rushford none of these prescribing airs  what right have i given you to use me thus  madam i hoped my address was not quite unwelcome  whatever your address is your prescriptions are  i cannot where i so much love bear such a difference as i always see in your temper when that flutterer is here to what i experience  the difference perhaps may be in the men not in the woman as how madam as how why said i he makes me laugh and if i was to give way to it your grave airs would make me cry  thank you madam said he what is sport to you is death to me  and so he sighed and took a turn or two about the room  i was standing all this time  he came and took my hand and looked so silly upon me i half pitied him i hope madam i dont keep you standing  yes you do sir  i beg madam you will not torture me with this contemptuous formality  i think i am the most complaisant creature breathing  to me madam do you mean  yes sir  you always mean something in your paradoxes madam may i ask your meaning now  when i last sat and pursued my work you were displeased i now stand and have nothing to do but to be entertained in such an agreeable manner as you shall think properest for me  yet you are not pleased  madam said he you put me quite beside my purposes  if i thought you would have it so i would sooner die than be so troublesome to you as i now have reason to think myself  if you have reason to think so i hope you are master of your own actions said i  do you forbid me your presence for ever madam  i do if you ask it sir was not this madam daring me to answer even worse  i ask it madam heaven is my witness it would be the heaviest thing that could befall me  you would not thus brave it from me if you thought so said i quite nettled  in this manner we went on till we had vexed one another to some purpose and then he was so good as to give me leave to sit down and i was so gracious as to permit him to sit by me and we parted with no displeasure on either side thus much for mr rushford and his grave airs my next shall let you into the qualifications of his competitor till when i am honored madam  your dutiful kinswoman   letter clxiv iv from the same describing her fluttering pretender honored madam inow give you some account of the captain he is a handsome person of a man of a good family heir to a good estate dresses well sings well dances well  so much for his good qualities as for his others he is insufferably vain talkative is always laughing especially at what he says himself and sometimes at the conceit of what he is going to say before he speaks he has such an undaunted assurance that there is no such thing as putting him out of countenance one instance i will give you  he is always admiring himself in the glass insomuch that while he is in the room i cannot peep into one without staring him in the face and one day rallying him on this i asked him how the glasses were fixed in a camp he replied without hesitation o madam the care our generals take to pitch our tents by the banks of some transparent stream serves very well for that purpose and then he laughed most egregiously for five or six minutes together  you may believe madam from what i have said that i give no great encouragement to his visits yet is there no such thing as getting rid of him for by all his conduct i plainly see he has swallowed the ridiculous opinion that the more averse a woman appears to a mans addresses the more ground he has to expect success and he seems so assured of winning me that i begin to be apprehensive every time he puts his hand in his pocket that he will pull out a license and a ring  if i admit him into my company i know not how to get rid of him if i cause myself to be denied he plants himself directly against my window that the whole neighborhood may know his business thus with or without my consent he will be either thought my reigning admirer or he will don quixote like have me for his dulcinea in spite of my teeth  he has three or four times showed away before mr rushford and as i cannot forbear heartily laughing at the airs he gives himself though for very different reasons from those by which his risible muscles are moved he thinks me pleased with him and what is more vexatious mr rushford thinks so too and grows serious and sullen as i instanced in my former  now madam what can i do i heartily despise my soldier i greatly regard mr rushfords good sense good breeding and other good qualities but to forbid this fop is what i am sure will have no weight with him for i have as good as done it several times and he tells me he will visit me whether i will or not as long as i am unmarried and to do it professedly in complaisance to mr rushford unless matters had gone further between us is putting myself absolutely in his power and declaring myself his before he asks me the question so may i not laugh on a little at the one and teize the others causeless jealousy do you think till i bring mr rushford to speak out so explicitly that a woman of some niceness as i pretend to be may be in no danger of mistaking him besides i think mr rushford a little too capricious and should be glad to break him of it lest if it ever should be our lot to come together that temper should improve upon him and be more troublesome from an husband than it is from an humble servant i should be glad my conduct might merit the approbation of so good a judge but if it do not i will endeavor to conform myself to your advice for i am and ever will be honored madam  your most dutiful niece   letter clxv v from the aunt containing solid advice and caution on this occasion dear lydia your last letter pleased me much better than your two former for your first held me in great suspense your second gave me concern for your rigorous treatment of poor mr rushford who it is plain loves you much but your third confirms me in the opinion i always entertained of your prudence in preferring a man of sense to a coxcomb  i must tell you that nothing could give me greater pleasure than to see you mr rushfords bride his fortune is good his person manly and agreeable and his behavior polite but in my opinion you have need of all your prudence and caution to avoid giving him a lasting disgust for i would have you always remember my dear that nothing can give such dislike to a man of wisdom and discernment as to make him imagine a fool is preferred to him  if mr rushford did not love you he would not be jealous of such a fop as you describe and it is enough to keep his passions awake when he sees you so grave and so severe as i may say to him and so facetious and cheerful with the other for many a woman of sense in other respects has been caught by some of those ridiculous airs that such empty laughers give themselves and if you should carry your jest too sar it might make him despise a levity as he would be apt to construe it which he would think unworthy of his addresses  i know it is but too natural to our sex to love to be admired but this humor when not properly bounded and guarded has many times cost us dear even the happiness of all our lives dont be afraid of obliging mr rushford in a point so material to his tranquillity and your own reputation as the forbidding the visits of your man of scarlet for as you intend not to encourage him and he has so undaunted an assurance founded on so much folly i think if you had no other humble servant it would not be reputable to receive this much less when you have one of so different a cast that light and darkness are not more opposite and a person must have a very indifferent regard to a man of merit who would not give up such a one to his request for the very thought of a competition with such a rival in so tender and nice a point must be disgusting to a man of sense  and besides you know not my dear but mr rushford may be deterred from a formal putting the question to you by the apprehension that you see his rival with too much approbation for can a man of his sense think of giving himself up absolutely to a person who seems to waver in her judgment which to prefer of two such competitors must not the mind that can hesitate one moment on such a decision appear unworthy of the character of his wife  and then as to teizing him for his jealousy and breaking him of it aforehand i doubt this savours a little too much of the ungenerous tempers of some of our sex who love to tyrannize when they can prudence in a lady is the best cure of jealousy in a gentleman and is the method you propose of laughing on with the captain and teizing a worthy man who undoubtedly loves you a mark of that prudence  indeed i fear if you go on thus you will either lose mr rushford or will be obliged to keep him at the expense of a submission after you have provoked him proportionable to the insult he will receive and this my dear kinswoman will be but little agreeable to the pride of our sex and a particular mortification to your own  one rule let me give you that the more obliging you are in the time of your power the more it will move a generous mind to indulge you in his and the time you may reckon yours may not be three months in proportion to thirty years of his or the whole life and pray my dear remember that young ladies assume a task they are very little qualified for when they set up to break tempers and manage husbands before they are married  your prudence will suggest to you a very proper conduct i am sure to secure a worthy husband without my writing a word more especially as i know it will teach you to overcome the little low pleasure which some of our sex take at your years in being admired and flattered and to conquer the little teizing pride of perplexing and torturing the heart of a worthy admirer when we think we have it in our power and so hoping soon to hear that you have banished the captain and are in the way to change the name of fenton for that of rushford i remain my dear niece  your affectionate aunt   letter clxvi from a lady to her false lover who after having braved all his friends expostulations at last is persuaded to abandon her for another of larger fortune sir it is a poor a very poor pretense that you make after what has passed between us that you must in compliance with the commands of your friends break off acquaintance with me how often have i advised you to this formerly how often have you vowed the impossibility of your doing it how have you in pursuance of this avowal braved your friends and defied their resentments in such a manner that gave them no hope of succeeding with you though i always blamed your disobliging way of doing it in regard to them as your relations but just as you had brought them to expect you would not be prevailed upon and they had so far acquiesced in your choice that i had received and returned visits from the principals of your family for you poorly to plead their menaces is such a jest as is not to be received without contempt and indignation  well i can guess at your motives  though you are too meanspirited to acknowledge them and that they are too mean to be acknowledged miss holles can explain them all by the help of a larger fortune than i have i have heard of your uncles proposal and your visit there  go on sir and welcome i have spirit enough to despise the man that could deceive me  but could you not for your own sake act this perfidious part in a more manly and more worthy manner could you not find a better reason than one you had always rejected when it was more your duty to observe it but must you when your vows to me had made it your duty to dispense with it then show your levity in adhering to it yet why do i expostulate with a person so little deserving expostulation you may think me angry because of my disappointment it is true it is a disappointment and i had a better opinion of you than this conduct shows you deserved or things should never have proceeded so far as they did but it is a disappointment i hope though no thanks to any part of your conduct but your meanness i shall soon get over and though i wish you no harm let us see if seven years hence you will be so many hundred pounds the richer as makes the difference to you between miss holles and her you have treated so unworthily and if that will make you happier i truly wish you may be so for i am not your enemy though you deserve not that i should style myself  your friend   letter clxvii from a gentleman to his lady whose overniceness in her house and uneasy temper with her servants make their lives uncomfortable my dear your kind concern for my absence is very obliging it is true i have already outstayd my intention by a week and i find the place i am in so very engaging and mr terry and his sister so agreeable that but to come to you i could willingly stay a month longer with them in short my dear mr terry lives just as i would wish to live and his sister who is his housekeeper is just what i would wish you to be in many particulars though no one in my opinion can equal you in others  you must know then that mr terry and i are quite happy in one another and when he has no visitors are indulged in a very pretty parlour which neither pail nor mop is permitted to enter for two or three days together and when we have company the dining room is at our service and the kind lady lets us smoke there without remarking upon the beastly fumes that we give the furniture not only so but if by a sudden turn of the pipe any one of us chances to bestrew the floor with burnt tobacco we are not broken in upon either by maid or broom and yet no room can be cleaner than we find that when we return to it from a walk in the gardens  and indeed i must acquaint you that i never saw a lady more prudently nice than mrs terry her person furniture and house are even patterns of neatness and good economy i never anywhere saw the one or the other outdone yet how can this be i marvel  for i have seen her pass over the mark of a dirty shoeheel upon a floor as white as a curd and never once rank the aggressor among the worst of slovens nay more than that i have seen her brother drop a few crumbs of bread and butter under his feet without so much as one corrective frown is not this strange my dear have batchelors from a sister more privileges than a married man from his wife  more than this it is true upon my honor incredible as it may seem to you the other day he happened to spill a glass of claret upon a fine damask tablecloth and broke the glass yet met with no other reproof than an agreeable laugh at his aukwardness and it was well it was he that did it who might do as he pleased with his own oh what a happy man thought i is this good old bachelor  but my dear prepare for more strange things still yesterday at dinner he was cutting up a good fat goose and by an unfortunate splash most grievously bespattered a rich gown his sister had on my heart ached upon this for truly i thought for a moment i was at home but good mrs terry convinced me of the contrary oh brother said she with a smile what a slip was that  but misfortunes will happen  and out she pulled her pocket hankerchief to wipe her gown i am sorry for it sister said he it cannot be helped returned she with a smile but i had a good mind to put you to some expense for this this was all she said and she kept her seat and eat her dinner in perfect good temper nay and looked as easy and as pleasant as she spoke  i must still further observe that though all things here are conducted with the greatest decorum and every servant in the house knows their duty and does it distinguishingly well yet i have never heard one high or angry word pass between mrs terry and the maids is not this surprising my dear what can it be owing to i thought for my share so much have i been used to a contrary management that no servant could do their duty unless the mistress of the family put herself out of humor with all the house either she is more fortunate than you in lighting of good servants or perhaps as persecution makes schismatics in the church so finding faults creates them in a family there may be something in this my dear for i have seen your maid jane blunder out of fear and blunder a second time to find she had blunderd and a third because she was put quite out and could not help it  then how has my poor deary been discomposed how have her charming features been even distorted with passion not a bit of the lily in her face for the crimson rose had swallowed it all up and an eye darting flames of indignation and woe mixed together and then breaking silence nobody ever had such torments of servants as i have alas poor deary how hard is thy hap  how much happier this good family for secure of an excuse rather than blame if a small fault should be committed in comes each servant as their duty requires all serene pleased cheerful as their mistress their eye is fixed upon her eye with a becoming confidence of pleasing and a nod or a beck does more with them than an hundred words  how can i my dear think of leaving such a delightful house and family as this  yet i long to see my beloved spouse and i will set out on monday next for that purpose with as great delight as ever i knew since i had the happiness to call you mine but pray my dear love let what i have said without the least design to offend or concern you a little impress you however let me have the satisfaction for both our sakes of seeing you get over some of those foibles that make us as effectually unhappy at times as if we had substantial evils to encounter with in short my dear let us think the house made for our use and not we for that and let us show our servants that while we would have them less faulty than they are we will ourselves try to be more perfect than we have hitherto been and not while we condemn their failings be guilty of much greater  justice prudence ease pleasure interest reputation all require this of us and could i hope what i have written will be attended to as i wish and mean it you cannot conceive the delight that will double upon me on my return to my dearest for it is my pride that i can style myself  yours ever most affectionately   letter clxviii from a gentleman who in a small fortune experiences the slights of his friends but being suddenly reputed to be rich is oppressed with the fawning caresses and adulation of those who had before neglected him dear sir i must for once postpone every thing i would say to you in order to make room for an account you little expect  what will you say when i tell you that a current report of my being immensely rich is the greatest misfortune i at present labor under nor do i find it so supportable as you may be apt to imagine the occasion was owing to the frequent slights i had received from the gentlewoman with whom i lodge and from others of my friends who believing that i lived up to my scanty fortune as in truth i do though i take care to be beholden to nobody and pay ready money for every thing could not treat me negligently enough i complained of this to that arch wag tony richards who told me he would change every ones behavior to me in a few days and he has done it effectually for what does he do but as a kind of secret acquaints my landlady that beside my poor little estate which you know to be my all he had lately discovered that i had twenty thousand pounds stock in one of our great companies  such was the force of his whimsical delusion that the very next morning i had a clean towel hung over my waterbottle though i never before had more than one a week during the twenty years i have lodged here  about a week after this my cousin tom who for the two years he has been in the temple has let me see him but three times came in a most complaisant manner plainer dressed than ever i had before seen him and begged if the length of the evening was in any degree burdensome i would permit him to wait upon me with such pieces of wit humor or entertainment as the town afforded the reading of which under my ear he was sure would be a great advantage to him and assured me that for a beginning he had presumed to bring the last new tragedy in his pocket i thanked my young spark upon which he is so much in earnest in his observances that three nights in a week he thus entertains me which will at least be of so much service as to keep him out of more expensive company and you cannot think what pains the rogue takes to read with the cadence he knows i admire and sits till his teeth chatter before he offers to look toward the fire  what you will still more wonder at sir john hookhim called upon me before christmas and though i have not had a visit from him these five years was so obliging as to run away with me in his chariot into hertfordshire to keep the holidays in his family where his lady treated me with the utmost respect and her daughters paid me their morning devoirs with the same deference as if i had been their grand papa no dinner was concluded upon without consulting my palate and the young gentlemen his sons are as ambitious of my hearing their exercises as if their fortunes depended upon my approbation  sir john acquainted me with every improvement he had made in his estate and assured me that his second son will my namesake has a genius singularly turned for managing country business had he not had the misfortune of having a brother born before him and gave me several reasons to believe that a fine estate which lay in the neighborhood and was then to be sold would be a great pennyworth i took the hint but said i had no inclination to purchase he shook his head at my thousands and told me that in his opinion a land estate was preferable to the best stock in the kingdom  when i came to town the  th of january i was no sooner out of sir johns chariot but my landlady in person informed me that since i had been absent i had so many presents sent me that she had been in an hundred fears for their spoiling i asked her the particulars and found five turkeys three chines three hampers of madeira for the gout two collars of brawn geese chickens hares and wildfowl to a large amount  at night i was welcomed to town by all my old acquaintance and about twenty almost new ones i was a little tired with my journey and had a slight cold besides which being observed one was running for a physician another for a surgeon to bleed me one thought an emetick not improper another recommended a gentle sweat or composing draught and amidst the general officiousness i could hear it whispered that if my will was not made delays might prove dangerous and in the morning five messengers after my welfare arrived before day  thus sir you see my peace is gone my tongue is of no use for no one believes me when i declare my real circumstances and under the happiness of a very small fortune i suffer all the afflictions attending a man immoderately rich and if you keep not your usual behavior i shall not know myself nor any man else since all my companions are become flatterers and all around me are so obsequious that it is impossible for me to know when i do right or wrong i am dear sir though thus whimsically situated  your real friend   letter clxix from one brother to another on the rash marriage of a beloved daughter of one of them to a profligate young fellow my dear brother i am exceedingly concerned for the rash step your daughter thomasin has made i know how it must affect you and i am myself not a little troubled at it but we see how unfit we are to choose for ourselves and oh how often are we punished by the enjoyment of our own wishes  you say you would rather have followed her corpse to the grave than that she should have thus thrown herself away on a rake a prodigal a sot and a fool as i as well as you know to be the character of the person she has chosen i would not afflict you my dear brother instead of pouring balm on the wounds of your mind but you will remember that it is scarce two years ago when you were no less anxiously disturbed on occasion of the violent fever which then endangered her life what vows did you not put up for her recovery what tumults of grief then agitated your afflicted mind and how do you know that then she was only restored at your incessant and importunate prayers but that otherwise god almighty knowing what was best for you both would have taken her away from this heavy evil this should teach us resignation to the divine will and that we are most unfit to choose for ourselves and even this affliction heavy as it is may be sent in order to wean you from a delight that you had too much set your heart upon  mean time you must not by too violent a resentment and reprobation of her which i find you are resolved upon add to the miseries she has chosen the poor creature will i fear too soon find her punishment in her choice and already i understand she is driven to great distress you know she has strong passions and your too great severity may precipitate her on her everlasting ruin when she becomes thoroughly sensible of the condition she has brought herself to from as happy prospects as any young lady could promise herself  let this prevail upon you to allow her necessaries for oh it is a sad thing for meagre want to stare in the face a young creature used to the fullest plenty especially when it is aggravated by the reflection that it is all owing to her own rashness and as it may not suit with your liking to appear yourself to allow her any thing at least till you see what use will be made of your favors i will undertake as from myself and on my own head to furnish if you please what is immediately necessary and from time to time give you a faithful account of the disposition in which she receives it and how her wretched deluder is affected by it  this is a task i should not be fond of but to prevent worse consequences and i must entreat you brother to weigh seriously the matter and as you abound let not the unhappy wretch who after all is your daughter want those necessaries of life which all your servants have in such plenty  i could not bear to be a witness of the great griefs which must tear asunder your heart struggling between paternal affection and just indignation which makes me choose to write to you and shall wait your resolution on this subject i am dear brother  yours most affectionately   letter clxx the afflicted father in answer to the preceding dear brother you are very kind in your intention yet very affecting in your just reproofs of my misplaced fondness for a creature so unworthy resignation to the divine will a noble a needful lesson is the doctrine you raise from it god give it me as i ought to have it time and his grace i hope will effect it but at present  oh brother you know not how i set my heart on this wretch that was my crime you will say and it is but just it should be my punishment do you as you please in what you propose i desire not the ungrateful creature should want yet let her too be pinched nothing else will make her sensible of her great offense  but dont let her be precipitated on any worse fate if a worse can be possible as it may with regard to another life yet let not her seducer be the better for the assistance he shall never riot in my substance let me know what you have done three months hence that i may retrench or add to what you shall advance as i shall see her behavior i say in three months for another reason because i may by that time i hope get more strength of mind and patience than at present possesses the heart of  your everaffectionate brother   letter clxxi to a father on the loss of his son who died under age my dear friend your lot i confess is hard exceeding hard to lose so promising and so hopeful a child as that dear boy was who so much engrossed the affections of yourself and spouse and a suitable grief on so trying an occasion ought to be indulged but yet not so as if you were bereft of all comfort and insensible to those other great mercies which god has bestowed upon you this my dear friend would be a sinful rejection of those blessings which remain to you as if like froward children you would have nothing because you could not have every thing you wished  look upon all the great families of the earth upon all your neighbors round you and see if they have not almost every one shed tears on this very occasion and then judge of the unreasonableness of too great a grief and what pretension you have to be exempted from those accidents to which royalty itself is liable i will not to alleviate your grief remind you of a topic which is however no less important than too frequently the case that he might not always have been so hopeful but might as he grew up many ways have administered bitterness to you but i think it surpasses all other comforts even those you hoped for from him that he is taken away at an age at which gods mercy renders his eternal happiness unquestionably certain and you and your mourning spouse have the pleasure to reflect that ye have been the happy means of adding one to the number of the blessed above and that he is gone before you but a little while to that place where all tears shall be wiped away and whither through the same infinite mercy you will in time follow him and enjoy him for ever  you have this comfort that he died a natural death that the work was god almightys who gave him to you and has but taken back what he lent you that you saw every thing done for his recovery that could be done and that it pleased god not to grant him to your prayers and why should you repine at the dispensation when you know the dispenser let it therefore be your duty on this trying occasion to show an entire acquiescence to the divine will such an acquiescence as may be exemplary to your good spouse whose weaker sex and mind want all the consolation your stronger reason can give her and at the same time it behooves you to show a thankful spirit for the mercies yet continued to you mercies that thousands have not to rejoice in lest god almighty should as a punishment deprive you of those you have still left  i beg you will take in good part these few lines which my affection for you has drawn from my pen and that you will believe me to be dear sir  your truly sympathizing friend and humble servant   letter clxxii to a father on the loss of a hopeful son who died at mans estate sir i am truly sorry for your loss so hopeful a son just arrived at mans estate and who was so great a comfort and assistance to you to be snatched away is what must administer to you the greatest grief of any thing that could possibly befall you  but alas yours is no new case the greatest families have been thus afflicted and with the aggravation to some of them that perhaps they have been deprived of their heirs and have not a son left to continue their name and honors the late queen anne when princess of denmark lost her beloved duke of gloucester not only her hopes but the hopes of the nation and the crown to which he seemed not only born but fashioned was obliged to be settled on that occasion upon a distant branch of the royal line  the great duke of marlborough who by his merit and his victories had raised a princely estate as well as titles had but one son the marquis of blandford on whom he and his duchess built all their hopes for the perpetuating of those new honors in their family and he was snatched away by death when he was at the university training up to become the dignities to which he was entitled  still more recent was the unhappy fate of a lady of the first quality in england her lord had a son lent to his advanced years this son was the last of that noble family and on his life depended all his fathers and his mothers hopes and on his living till of age a valuable part of the estate itself which otherwise was to fall to an illegitimate offspring what care was not used to preserve the noble youth an eminent physician was taken into the family to be made a constant watchman as it were over his health and exercises the young nobleman himself was hopeful dutiful and as distinguished in the graces of his mind as by his birth he traveled his indulgent mother traveled with him he made a campaign under his uncle the greatest general then surviving in an age of generals he again traveled to restore and confirm his health and all the noble mothers hopes and views were employed on the finding for her beloved son on his return a wife suitable to his quality and who might be a means to preserve one of the first families in the kingdom from utter extinction  what was the event of all her cares her hopes her vows her prospects  why just as the young nobleman had within a few months arrived at age and could have made those family settlements which were most desirable should be made and the want of which involved his noble mother in perplexing lawsuits which too turned against her it pleased god to deprive her of him and he died in a foreign land far distant from his fond mother who still more grievous if true for reasons of state as was said had been denied to accompany and attend him and so ended all her hopes of above twenty years standing and in him his family likewise  a still more recent calamity to a great family i might mention in the death of two hopeful children the only sons of their father and the only heirs male of one of the first families in the kingdom both snatched away in the space of a few hours of one another from healthy constitutions and no ailments previous to the sudden one that carried them off which was only believed to be a sore throat in vain were the consultations of the most eminent physicians and surgeons who gave attendance all night minutely to watch every change of the distemper in vain proved the assurance of the skilful to the fond parents that there was no danger death mocked all their hopes and when the first died in vain was he opened in order to find out if possible the cause of the fatal malady in order to administer with greater hopes of success remedies against it to preserve the other that other hopeful youth followed his brother and their fate deeply wounded the hearts of half a dozen noble families whose intimate relationship gave them a very near interest in the awful event  like instances of the loss of hopeful sons and of the only male heirs might be produced in other families of prime distinction in the list of the british nobility but i need not enumerate more to a mind considerate as yours which will reflect that death is a common lot from which no rank or degree is exempted and i hope these reflections and such as you will be able to add to them by your own reason and piety will serve to rebuke the overflowings of your grief and confine it to the natural channels into which both god and nature will indulge it to flow  i mention not to your enlightened mind you see the motives that nevertheless might be insisted on with great propriety on so grievous an occasion such as the uncertainty of life the gratitude you ought to show for having had your son so long continued to you as he was the great probability of his being happy in gods mercies by reason of his hopefulness and duty the early release he has met with from the troubles and chances of a changeable and transitory life his escape from the danger of the temptations which his virtue might have been tried with had he lived to maturer years that this your deprivation is gods work that he died not in a distant land and by an untimely death but that you had the satisfaction of knowing that every thing was done for him that could be done that his morals were still untainted and he was not cut off in the pursuit of some capital sin as has too often been the case with bold and daring spirits in the heat of their youthful passions and that he escaped the snares usually laid for young men by idle companions and vicious women which too often entangle and catch the unthinking mind these will be all suggested to you from your own better reason and to that secondarily as to a due resignation to the divine will primarily let me reser you on this trying occasion who am with a sympathizing affection dear sir  your sincere friend and humble servant   letter clxxiii to a with small variations the same arguments may be used to a husband on the death of his wife and on other melancholy occasions of the like nature widow on the death of her husband good madam allow me the liberty of condoling with you on the truly great and heavy loss you have sustained of an excellent husband all we who had the pleasure of his friendship mourn with you the irretrievable misfortune to us as well as to you but as there is no recalling it and as it is gods doing we must not repine at the dispensation but acquiesce in it and yet to say that neither you nor we ought to grieve for it would be absurd and unnatural sinful grief however we are commanded to shun and we ought to bless god that he was graciously pleased to continue him with us so long instead of mourning too heavily that we had not longer the pleasure of his agreeable conversation we were not born together and some of us must have gone first and i have sometimes been ready to think besides the life of glory that through gods mercies awaits the good that he is far happier than those he leaves behind him in this point that he is saved from the regret which fills the wounded hearts of his surviving friends of seeing them go before him as they have seen him go before them had he not died now a few years would have determined his useful life for the longest life is but a span and then the matter had he gone before us would have been as it is now  we may make our own lives miserable in bewailing his loss but we cannot do him good nor were he to know it pleasure you in particular madam who are now called upon to be both father and mother to the dear pledges of your mutual affection ought to take double care how you suffer immoderate grief to incapacitate you from this new and more arduous and necessary task for by this means you would not only do yourself hurt but double the loss which his dear children have already sustained in that of their father and would you madam make them motherless as well as fatherless  god forbid consider though this is a heavy case yet it is a common case and we must not repine that god almighty thought him ripe for heaven and put an end to his probatory state  with melancholy pleasure have i often on the loss of friends contemplated the excellent advice of the son of sirach who tells us how we ought to mourn on these occasions and how we ought to govern our mourning and reminds us most excellently that while we are grieving for our departed friends our own lives pass away and we are not you will permit me to transcribe his own excellent words as most suitable to the subject before us  my son says he let tears fall down over the dead and begin to lament and then cover his body according to the custom and neglect not his burial weep bitterly and make great moan and use lamentation as he is worthy  and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness for of heaviness comes death and the heaviness of the heart breaks strength in affliction also sorrow remains and the life of the poor or miserable or of those who make themselves so by mourning is the curse of the heart take therefore no heaviness to heart drive it away and remember  thy own last end forget it not for there is no turning again thou shall not do him good but hurt thyself remember my judgment saith the wise man speaking as if in the person of our late dear friend for thine also shall be so yesterday for me and today for thee when the dead is at rest let his remembrance rest and be comforted for him when his spirit is departed from him  to add any thing to this excellent advice would be in some measure to depreciate it i will therefore conclude with my prayers that god will enable you to bear as you ought and as all your friends wish and expect from you this truly heavy dispensation and that most particularly for the sake of your dear children by him and with assureing you of my service to the utmost of my ability for i am madam as well for theirs and your own sake as for his memorys sake  your faithful friend and humble servant   finis
