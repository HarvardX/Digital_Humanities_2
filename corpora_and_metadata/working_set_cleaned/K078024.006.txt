addition of new species of insects that fabricius has made in his latter works renders it difficult and in some instances impossible to refer them to the system of linnaeus and though we would at all times more willingly refer any new kind to that system and quote the fabrician account amongst the synonyms than adopt the new generic distinctions of fabricius or any other author we must not sacrifice propriety to predilection if linnaeus himself had noticed many of the newly discovered kinds he must have altered and improved his system to admit them which is a great excuse for fabricius having made so many genera  the little insect before us may be referred to the silpha genus of linnaeus but as his definition of the silphae has been subjected to so many objections and amendments of

of them amongst his dermestides and formed his genus peltis of such as have the thorax and elytra strongly margined and perfoliated antennae geoffroy described our present subject under the name tritoma fabricius afterward in his mantissa arranged it under ips a new genus formed from part of the silphae of linnaeus and dermestides of geoffroy in the entomologia systematica he has again separated the ips and made mycetophagus a new genus of fifteen species in which he includes this insect  to those who have adopted the system of fabricius it is unnecessary to say that the fundamental part of his arrangement is taken from the mouth of the insect which certainly is objectionable because that part is dry and very frequently injured or destroyed in insects that have been long in a

english entomologist has attempted to describe the peculiar habits of this tribe of insects and especially of sirex gigas the following particulars may be satisfactory to our readers  the extensive forests of germany furnished the accurate roesel with many opportunities of finding and observing the metamorphosis of insects that are rarely to be found in other parts of europe and this enabled him to favor the world with a particular description and series of figures of all the changes of sirex gigas in the bombyliorum et vesparum of his insecten belustigung his figure of the female insect agrees with that we have given the male is considerably smaller and has no sting this is a generical distinction  the sting of the female consists of three parts a sheath which divides into two parts or valves and a fine instrument somewhat resembling a needle it is with this instrument it wounds its enemies and the sting is said to cause an excruciating pain the microscope discovers this part to be beset with a number of very minute teeth like the edge of a saw with this sting the creature can pierce the wood of sound trees for we suspect it does not always deposit its eggs in such as are decayed but rather in such as will supply the larva with nourishment when it is hatched the eggs are laid in clusters of two or three hundred together they are of a pale yellow color about the thirtieth part of an inch in length and shaped like a weavers shuttle the larva lives in the body of the tree enlarging its habitation as it increases in size for it never leaves the tree till it

learn that fulgora europaea was the insect taken by mr hudson the other seems undetermined  the fulgora europaea very much resembles some of the cicadae in form and size and have therefore been probably overlooked by english collectors of insects fabricius describes it as a native of france and germany but it is very scarce in cabinets of foreign insects also perhaps it is not common in any country  this species does not exhibit any prominent features of its singular genus it has only a small conic hollow projection or lantern on the forepart of the head instead of the large projection that characterise most of the exotic fulgorae it is not unlikely however that it may possess though in a small degree the astonishing property of diffusing a radiance of light which particularly distinguish f lanternarid of south america f candelaria of china and several other species the light of some of these insects according to the reports of naturalists and travelers in foreign countries is sufficiently vivid and constant to answer many purposes some of the catholic missionaries assert that they could see distinctly to read and write by the light of one of them and that several of them being fastened together serve to light the indians when they travel in the night  the rostrum or beak through which the fulgorae europaea like others of the same genus sucks its nutriment seems
