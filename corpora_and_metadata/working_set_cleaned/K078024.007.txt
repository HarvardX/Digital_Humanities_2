crimson underwing phalaena nupta and dr berkenhout following harris or inattentive to the express language of the author he translated has made the same error in his synopsis of the natural history of

this proves that the linnaean species of pacta cannot be the same with that of the authors before quoted because in their species the upper part of the abdomen is hoary inclining to brown and not red

definitions for their perspicuity in general we must in some instances blame him for that inattention which has betrayed succeeding naturalists into errors and even absurdities the force of this remark however harsh it may appear will apply in a particular degree to the specific definition and quoted synonyms of papilio hyale and consequently to two other similar species involved in the same error  linnaeus gave the description of papilio hyale as above quoted in the systema natura from an insect in his own cabinet and quotes in the synonyms the butterfly figured by roesel vol   tab    fig     the works of that author being known in every part of europe the entomologists of that time received the figure as that of the true hyale and relying on the accuracy of the linnaean references the mistake has been overlooked to the present period fabricius who is the latest systematic writer on this science quotes the figures in roesel as linnaeus had himself in the first instance and he also refers to figures of the same insect in the works of cramer and schaeffer an error of such specious appearance could only be detected by a reference to the specimen in the linnaean cabinet at this time in the possession of dr smith and by this it appears that every author has mistaken the species of linnaeus and that linnaeus was himself mistaken in supposing the insect described was the same as that figured by roesel and to which he refers that the linnaean papilio hyale is what later authors have considered papilio palaeno and that the true papilio palaeno is not a british species  these errors are so complicated that we must examine the characters assigned to each species with the utmost attention and we shall then find his descriptions correct but the synonyms erroneous papilio hyale is described with yellow wings the color of the wings in the supposed hyale is not of that kind which linnaeus would have called yellow flavis but fulvis being of a deep orange color much inclining to red either of these expressions will certainly admit of great latitude but we must not therefore confound one with the other the two silver spots are not constant though it forms a part of the specific character we have seen in both the clouded yellow and clouded orange butterflies sometimes only one spot though in general it has two on the whole the linnaean description of papilio hyale seems to agree with the fictitious p palaeno of our collections and the specimen in the linnaean cabinet places it beyond conjecture  fabricius has not attended to the errors of former authors on this subject even in his last work syst ent he adds to the specific description of his p hyale mas margin alarm nigro immaculato foemina maculato the wings in the males have a broad black bar on the exterior margin in the female the bars are spotted  by this it is evident he alludes to the clouded orange for it is not so in the linnaean insect the broad bar of black being constantly spotted in both sexes we have also observed that the rare variety with white wings is only the female that which is yellow is the male the same is observed also of papilio rhamni or brimstone butterfly and as the males of all insects are more abundant than the females and the males of p hyale are rare the variety or sex with white wings must be extremely so these have been taken in a clover field in the month of august in company with the clouded orange  it may be proper to close this description with a few observations on the true papilio palaeno as the subject before us has hitherto passed under that name linnaeus says alis integerrimis flavis apice nigris margineque fulvis posticis subtus puncto argenteo this does not agree with or at least express the insect generally called palaeno and the specimen in the linnaean cabinet proves it to be a different species the p palaeno has no yellow spots on the black margins of the wings and the spot in the center of the anterior pair is small and shaped like a shuttle its native place is unknown a variety of the pale clouded yellow is found in america and by mistake is sometimes placed in cabinets as a british species  fig ii papilio edusa clouded orange butterfly lepidoptera papilio specific character and synonyms wings entire fulvous or orange with a black spot and margin of the same color on the under

argenteo fab ent syst   p    0      if our observations on the preceding species are satisfactory and conclusive the insect before us must be a distinct species and not the true p hyale for which it has ever been received this involves another interesting consideration for linnaeus must have been acquainted with this species as he refers to figures of it in several authors it is probable he considered it as a variety for it does not appear under another name in any part of his writings  fabricus has described a new species of butterfly under the name edusa in his last work ent syst which seems to agree with our insect and we are confirmed in our opinion by mr jones of chelsea who assisted fabricius with considerable information and assures us it is certainly the p edusa of that author  in a former part of this work we have given the male of this insect as p hyale the annexed figure represents the female having large yellow spots in the black border of the wings both this and the

dissenting from his authority it is incumbent to state our objections in the species insectorum of that author the p camilla with the linnaean specific character is made a variety b of sibilla the

for p camilla he refers to roesel tab    fig   and this agrees with our specimen except in the colors of the upper surface being somewhat paler so that we may conclude our english insect is not only the p camilla of linnaeus but also the b camilla of fabricius  the ultimate opinion of fabricius is however different for in the entomologia systematica since published camilla and sibilla stands a dictinct species and camilla is thus described alis dentatis atris cocruleo micantibus fascia utrinque maculari alba posticis fubtus basi argentea immaculata linn syst not           habitat in austria thus p camilla will no longer agree with our insect nor with that figured by roesel plate    fig   but if we refer to the systema naturae of linnaeus we discover another error for instead of the above quoted specific character linnaeus only says alis dentatis fuscis subconcoloribus albo fasciatis maculatisque angulo any rubro p         and this is clearly our insect  from this the whole of the fabrician account is obviously a complicated error of description and synonyms and without attempting to investigate it further we shall speak of both species as they appear to us  we consider the
