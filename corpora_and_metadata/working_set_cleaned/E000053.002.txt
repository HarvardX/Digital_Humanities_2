general     man fitted to form articulated sounds  god having designed man for a sociable creature made him not only with an inclination and under a necessity to have fellowship with those of his own kind but furnished him also with language which was to be the great instrument and common tie of society man therefore had by nature his organs so fashioned as to be fit to frame articulate sounds which we call words but this was not enough to produce language for parrots and several other birds will be taught to make articulate sounds distinct enough which yet by no means are capable of language     to use these sounds as signs of ideas  besides articulate sounds therefore it was further necessary that he should be able to use these sounds as signs of internal conceptions and to make them stand as marks for the ideas within his own mind whereby they might be made known to others and the thoughts of mens minds be conveyed from one to another     to make them general signs  but neither was this sufficient to make words so useful as they ought to be it is not enough for the perfection of language that sounds can be made signs of ideas unless those signs can be so made use of as to comprehend several particular things for the multiplication of words would have perplexed their use had every particular thing need of a distinct name to be signified by to remedy this inconvenience language had yet a further improvement in the use of general terms whereby one word was made to mark a multitude of particular existences which advantageous use of sounds was obtained only by the difference of the ideas they were made signs of those names becoming general which are made to stand for general ideas and those remaining particular where the ideas they are used for are particular     to make them signify the absence of positive ideas  besides these names which stand for ideas there be other words which men make use of not to signify any idea but the want or absence of some ideas simple or complex or all ideas together such as are nihil in latin and in english ignorance and barrenness all which negative or privative words cannot be said properly to belong to or signify no ideas for then they would be perfectly insignificant sounds but they relate to positive ideas and signify their absence     words ultimately derived from such as signify sensible ideas  it may also lead us a little towards the original of all our notions and knowledge if we remark how great a dependence our words have on common sensible ideas and how those which are made use of to stand for actions and notions quite removed from sense have their rise from thence and from obvious sensible ideas are transferred to more abstruse significations and made to stand for ideas that come not under the cognizance of our senses vg to imagine apprehend comprehend adhere conceive instil disgust disturbance tranquillity c are all words taken from the operations of sensible things and applied to certain modes of thinking spirit in its primary signification is breath angel a messenger and i doubt not but if we could trace them to their sources we should find in all languages the names which stand for things that fall not under our senses to have had their first rise from sensible ideas by which we may give some kind of guess what kind of notions they were and whence derived which filled their minds who were the first beginners of languages and how nature even in the naming of things unawares suggested to men the originals and principles of all their knowledge whilst to give names that might make known to others any operations they felt in themselves or any other ideas that came not under their senses they were fain to borrow words from ordinary known ideas of sensation by that means to make others the more easily to conceive those operations they experimented in themselves which made no outward sensible appearances and then when they had got known and agreed names to signify those internal operations of their own minds they were sufficiently furnished to make known by words all their other ideas since they could consist of nothing but either of outward sensible perceptions or of the inward operations of their minds about them we having as has been proved no ideas at all but what originally come either from sensible objects without or what we feel within ourselves from the inward workings of our own spirits of which we are conscious to ourselves within     distribution of subjects to be treated of  but to understand better the use and force of language as subservient to instruction and knowledge it will be convenient to consider  first to what it is that names in the use of language are immediately applied  secondly since all except proper names are general and so stand not particularly for this or that single thing but for sorts and ranks of things it will be necessary to consider in the next place what the sorts and kinds or if you rather like the latin names what the species and genera of things are wherein they consist and how they come to be made these being as they ought well looked into we shall the better come to find the right use of words the natural advantages and defects of language and the remedies that ought to be used to avoid the inconveniences of obscurity or uncertainty in the signification of words without which it is impossible to discourse with any clearness or order concerning knowledge which being conversant about propositions and those most commonly universal ones has greater connexion with words than perhaps is suspected these considerations therefore shall be the matter of the following chapters     chapter ii  of the signification of words     words are sensible signs necessary for communication of ideas  man though he have great variety of thoughts and such from which others as well as himself might receive profit and delight yet they are all within his own breast invisible and hidden from others nor can of themselves be made to appear the comfort and advantage of society not being to be had without communication of thoughts it was necessary that man should find out some external sensible signs whereof those invisible ideas which his thoughts are made up of might be made known to others for this purpose nothing was so fit either for plenty or quickness as those articulate sounds which with so much ease and variety he found himself able to make thus we may conceive how words which were by nature so well adapted to that purpose came to be made use of by men as the signs of their ideas not by any natural connexion that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas for then there would be but one language amongst all men but by a voluntary imposition whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea the use then of words is to be sensible marks of ideas and the ideas they stand for are their proper and immediate signification     words in their immediate signification are the sensible signs of his ideas who uses them  the use men have of these marks being either to record their own thoughts for the assistance of their own memory or as it were to bring out their ideas and lay them before the view of others words in their primary or immediate signification stand for nothing but the ideas in the mind of him that uses them how imperfectly soever or carelessly those ideas are collected from the things which they are supposed to represent when a man speaks to another it is that he may be understood and the end of speech is that those sounds as marks may make known his ideas to the hearer that then which words are the marks of are the ideas of the speaker nor can any one apply them as marks immediately to anything else but the ideas that he himself hath for this would be to make them signs of his own conceptions and yet apply them to other ideas which would be to make them signs and not signs of his ideas at the same time and so in effect to have no signification at all words being voluntary signs they cannot be voluntary signs imposed by him on things he knows not that would be to make them signs of nothing sounds without signification a man cannot make his words the signs either of qualities in things or of conceptions in the mind of another whereof he has none in his own till he has some ideas of his own he cannot suppose them to correspond with the conceptions of another man nor can he use any signs for them for thus they would be the signs of he knows not what which is in truth to be the signs of nothing but when he represents to himself other mens ideas by some of his own if he consent to give them the same names that other men do it is still to his own ideas to ideas that he has and not to ideas that he has not     examples of this  this is so necessary in the use of language that in this respect the knowing and the ignorant the learned and the unlearned use the words they speak with any meaning all alike they in every mans mouth stand for the ideas he has and which he would express by them a child having taken notice of nothing in the metal he hears called gold but the bright shining yellow colour he applies the word gold only to his own idea of that colour and nothing else and therefore calls the same colour in a peacocks tail gold another that hath better observed adds to shining yellow great weight and then the sound gold when he uses it stands for a complex idea of a shining yellow and a very weighty substance another adds to those qualities fusibility and then the word gold signifies to him a body bright yellow fusible and very heavy another adds malleability each of these uses equally the word gold when they have occasion to express the idea which they have applied it to but it is evident that each can apply it only to his own idea nor can he make it stand as a sign of such a complex idea as he has not     words are often secretly referred first to the ideas supposed to be in other mens minds  but though words as they are used by men can properly and immediately signify nothing but the ideas that are in the mind of the speaker yet they in their thoughts give them a secret reference to two other things  first they suppose their words to be marks of the ideas in the minds also of other men with whom they communicate for else they should talk in vain and could not be understood if the sounds they applied to one idea were such as by the hearer were applied to another which is to speak two languages but in this men stand not usually to examine whether the idea they and those they discourse with have in their minds be the same but think it enough that they use the word as they imagine in the common acceptation of that language in which they suppose that the idea they make it a sign of is precisely the same to which the understanding men of that country apply that name     secondly to the reality of things  secondly because men would not be thought to talk barely of their own imagination but of things as really they are therefore they often suppose the words to stand also for the reality of things but this relating more particularly to substances and their names as perhaps the former does to simple ideas and modes we shall speak of these two different ways of applying words more at large when we come to treat of the names of mixed modes and substances in particular though give me leave here to say that it is a perverting the use of words and brings unavoidable obscurity and confusion into their signification whenever we make them stand for anything but those ideas we have in our own minds     words by use readily excite ideas of their objects  concerning words also it is further to be considered  first that they being immediately the signs of mens ideas and by that means the instruments whereby men communicate their conceptions and express to one another those thoughts and imaginations they have within their own breasts there comes by constant use to be such a connexion between certain sounds and the ideas they stand for that the names heard almost as readily excite certain ideas as if the objects themselves which are apt to produce them did actually affect the senses which is manifestly so in all obvious sensible qualities and in all substances that frequently and familiarly occur to us     words are often used without signification and why  secondly that though the proper and immediate signification of words are ideas in the mind of the speaker yet because by familiar use from our cradles we come to learn certain articulate sounds very perfectly and have them readily on our tongues and always at hand in our memories but yet are not always careful to examine or settle their significations perfectly it often happens that men even when they would apply themselves to an attentive consideration do set their thoughts more on words than things nay because words are many of them learned before the ideas are known for which they stand therefore some not only children but men speak several words no otherwise than parrots do only because they have learned them and have been accustomed to those sounds but so far as words are of use and signification so far is there a constant connexion between the sound and the idea and a designation that the one stands for the other without which application of them they are nothing but so much insignificant noise     their signification perfectly arbitrary not the consequence of a natural connexion  words by long and familiar use as has been said come to excite in men certain ideas so constantly and readily that they are apt to suppose a natural connexion between them but that they signify only mens peculiar ideas and that by a perfect arbitrary imposition is evident in that they often fail to excite in others even that use the same language the same ideas we take them to be signs of and every man has so inviolable a liberty to make words stand for what ideas he pleases that no one hath the power to make others have the same ideas in their minds that he has when they use the same words that he does and therefore the great augustus himself in the possession of that power which ruled the world acknowledged he could not make a new latin word which was as much as to say that he could not arbitrarily appoint what idea any sound should be a sign of in the mouths and common language of his subjects it is true common use by a tacit consent appropriates certain sounds to certain ideas in all languages which so far limits the signification of that sound that unless a man applies it to the same idea he does not speak properly and let me add that unless a mans words excite the same ideas in the hearer which he makes them stand for in speaking he does not speak intelligibly but whatever be the consequence of any mans using of words differently either from their general meaning or the particular sense of the person to whom he addresses them this is certain their signification in his use of them is limited to his ideas and they can be signs of nothing else     chapter iii  of general terms       the greatest part of words are general terms  all things that exist being particulars it may perhaps be thought reasonable that words which ought to be conformed to things should be so tooi mean in their signification but yet we find quite the contrary the far greatest part of words that make all languages are general terms which has not been the effect of neglect or chance but of reason and necessity     that every particular thing should have a name for itself is impossible  first it is impossible that every particular thing should have a distinct peculiar name for the signification and use of words depending on that connexion which the mind makes between its ideas and the sounds it uses as signs of them it is necessary in the application of names to things that the mind should have distinct ideas of the things and retain also the particular name that belongs to every one with its peculiar appropriation to that idea but it is beyond the power of human capacity to frame and retain distinct ideas of all the particular things we meet with every bird and beast men saw every tree and plant that affected the senses could not find a place in the most capacious understanding if it be looked on as an instance of a prodigious memory that some generals have been able to call every soldier in their army by his proper name we may easily find a reason why men have never attempted to give names to each sheep in their flock or crow that flies over their heads much less to call every leaf of plants or grain of sand that came in their way by a peculiar name     and would be useless if it were possible  secondly if it were possible it would yet be useless because it would not serve to the chief end of language men would in vain heap up names of particular things that would not serve them to communicate their thoughts men learn names and use them in talk with others only that they may be understood which is then only done when by use or consent the sound i make by the organs of speech excites in another mans mind who hears it the idea i apply it to in mine when i speak it this cannot be done by names applied to particular things whereof i alone having the ideas in my mind the names of them could not be significant or intelligible to another who was not acquainted with all those very particular things which had fallen under my notice     a distinct name for every particular thing not fitted for enlargement of knowledge  thirdly but yet granting this also feasible which i think is not yet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement of knowledge which though founded in particular things enlarges itself by general views to which things reduced into sorts under general names are properly subservient these with the names belonging to them come within some compass and do not multiply every moment beyond what either the mind can contain or use requires and therefore in these men have for the most part stopped but yet not so as to hinder themselves from distinguishing particular things by appropriated names where convenience demands it and therefore in their own species which they have most to do with and wherein they have often occasion to mention particular persons they make use of proper names and there distinct individuals have distinct denominations     what things have proper names and why  besides persons countries also cities rivers mountains and other the like distinctions of place have usually found peculiar names and that for the same reason they being such as men have often as occasion to mark particularly and as it were set before others in their discourses with them and i doubt not but if we had reason to mention particular horses as often as as have reason to mention particular men we should have proper names for the one as familiar as for the other and bucephalus would be a word as much in use as alexander and therefore we see that amongst jockeys horses have their proper names to be known and distinguished by as commonly as their servants because amongst them there is often occasion to mention this or that particular horse when he is out of sight     how general words are made  the next thing to be considered ishow general words come to be made for since all things that exist are only particulars how come we by general terms or where find we those general natures they are supposed to stand for words become general by being made the signs of general ideas and ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of time and place and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence by this way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more individuals than one each of which having in it a conformity to that abstract idea is as we call it of that sort     shown by the way we enlarge our complex ideas from infancy  but to deduce this a little more distinctly it will not perhaps be amiss to trace our notions and names from their beginning and observe by what degrees we proceed and by what steps we enlarge our ideas from our first infancy there is nothing more evident than that the ideas of the persons children converse with to instance in them alone are like the persons themselves only particular the ideas of the nurse and the mother are well framed in their minds and like pictures of them there represent only those individuals the names they first gave to them are confined to these individuals and the names of nurse and mamma the child uses determine themselves to those persons afterwards when time and a larger acquaintance have made them observe that there are a great many other things in the world that in some common agreements of shape and several other qualities resemble their father and mother and those persons they have been used to they frame an idea which they find those many particulars do partake in and to that they give with others the name man for example and thus they come to have a general name and a general idea wherein they make nothing new but only leave out of the complex idea they had of peter and james mary and jane that which is peculiar to each and retain only what is common to them all     and further enlarge our complex ideas by still leaving out properties contained in them  by the same way that they come by the general name and idea of man they easily advance to more general names and notions for observing that several things that differ from their idea of man and cannot therefore be comprehended out under that name have yet certain qualities wherein they agree with man by retaining only those qualities and uniting them into one idea they have again another and more general idea to which having given a name they make a term of a more comprehensive extension which new idea is made not by any new addition but only as before by leaving out the shape and some other properties signified by the name man and retaining only a body with life sense and spontaneous motion comprehended under the name animal     general natures are nothing but abstract and partial ideas of more complex ones  that this is the way whereby men first formed general ideas and general names to them i think is so evident that there needs no other proof of it but the considering of a mans self or others and the ordinary proceedings of their minds in knowledge and he that thinks general natures or notions are anything else but such abstract and partial ideas of more complex ones taken at first from particular existences will i fear be at a loss where to find them for let any one effect and then tell me wherein does his idea of man differ from that of peter and paul or his idea of horse from that of bucephalus but in the leaving out something that is peculiar to each individual and retaining so much of those particular complex ideas of several particular existences as they are found to agree in of the complex ideas signified by the names man and horse leaving out but those particulars wherein they differ and retaining only those wherein they agree and of those making a new distinct complex idea and giving the name animal to it one has a more general term that comprehends with man several other creatures leave out of the idea of animal sense and spontaneous motion and the remaining complex idea made up of the remaining simple ones of body life and nourishment becomes a more general one under the more comprehensive term vivens and not to dwell longer upon this particular so evident in itself by the same way the mind proceeds to body substance and at last to being thing and such universal terms which stand for any of our ideas whatsoever to conclude this whole mystery of genera and species which make such a noise in the schools and are with justice so little regarded out of them is nothing else but abstract ideas more or less comprehensive with names annexed to them in all which this is constant and unvariable that every more general term stands for such an idea and is but a part of any of those contained under it    0 why the genus is ordinarily made use of in definitions  this may show us the reason why in the defining of words which is nothing but declaring their signification we make use of the genus or next general word that comprehends it which is not out of necessity but only to save the labour of enumerating the several simple ideas which the next general word or genus stands for or perhaps sometimes the shame of not being able to do it but though defining by genus and differentia i crave leave to use these terms of art though originally latin since they most properly suit those notions they are applied to i say though defining by the genus be the shortest way yet i think it may be doubted whether it be the best this i am sure it is not the only and so not absolutely necessary for definition being nothing but making another understand by words what idea the term defined stands for a definition is best made by enumerating those simple ideas that are combined in the signification of the term defined and if instead of such an enumeration men have accustomed themselves to use the next general term it has not been out of necessity or for greater clearness but for quickness and dispatch sake for i think that to one who desired to know what idea the word man stood for if it should be said that man was a solid extended substance having life sense spontaneous motion and the faculty of reasoning i doubt not but the meaning of the term man would be as well understood and the idea it stands for be at least as clearly made known as when it is defined to be a rational animal which by the several definitions of animal vivens and corpus resolves itself into those enumerated ideas i have in explaining the term man followed here the ordinary definition of the schools which though perhaps not the most exact yet serves well enough to my present purpose and one may in this instance see what gave occasion to the rule that a definition must consist of genus and differentia and it suffices to show us the little necessity there is of such a rule or advantage in the strict observing of it for definitions as has been said being only the explaining of one word by several others so that the meaning or idea it stands for may be certainly known languages are not always so made according to the rules of logic that every term can have its signification exactly and clearly expressed by two others experience sufficiently satisfies us to the contrary or else those who have made this rule have done ill that they have given us so few definitions conformable to it but of definitions more in the next chapter      general and universal are creatures of the understanding and belong not to the real existence of things  to return to general words it is plain by what has been said that general and universal belong not to the real existence of things but are the inventions and creatures of the understanding made by it for its own use and concern only signs whether words or ideas words are general as has been said when used for signs of general ideas and so are applicable indifferently to many particular things and ideas are general when they are set up as the representatives of many particular things but universality belongs not to things themselves which are all of them particular in their existence even those words and ideas which in their signification are general when therefore we quit particulars the generals that rest are only creatures of our own making their general nature being nothing but the capacity they are put into by the understanding of signifying or representing many particulars for the signification they have is nothing but a relation that by the mind of man is added to them      abstract ideas are the essences of genera and species  the next thing therefore to be considered is what kind of signification it is that general words have for as it is evident that they do not signify barely one particular thing for then they would not be general terms but proper names so on the other side it is as evident they do not signify a plurality for man and men would then signify the same and the distinction of numbers as the grammarians call them would be superfluous and useless that then which general words signify is a sort of things and each of them does that by being a sign of an abstract idea in the mind to which idea as things existing are found to agree so they come to be ranked under that name or which is all one be of that sort whereby it is evident that the essences of the sorts or if the latin word pleases better species of things are nothing else but these abstract ideas for the having the essence of any species being that which makes anything to be of that species and the conformity to the idea to which the name is annexed being that which gives a right to that name the having the essence and the having that conformity must needs be the same thing since to be of any species and to have a right to the name of that species is all one as for example to be a man or of the species man and to have right to the name man is the same thing again to be a man or of the species man and have the essence of a man is the same thing now since nothing can be a man or have a right to the name man but what has a conformity to the abstract idea the name man stands for nor anything be a man or have a right to the species man but what has the essence of that species it follows that the abstract idea for which the name stands and the essence of the species is one and the same from whence it is easy to observe that the essences of the sorts of things and consequently the sorting of things is the workmanship of the understanding that abstracts and makes those general ideas      they are the workmanship of the understanding but have their foundation in the similitude of things  i would not here be thought to forget much less to deny that nature in the production of things makes several of them alike there is nothing more obvious especially in the races of animals and all things propagated by seed but yet i think we may say the sorting of them under names is the workmanship of the understanding taking occasion from the similitude it observes amongst them to make abstract general ideas and set them up in the mind with names annexed to them as patterns or forms for in that sense the word form has a very proper signification to which as particular things existing are found to agree so they come to be of that species have that denomination or are put into that classis for when we say this is a man that a horse this justice that cruelty this a watch that a jack what do we else but rank things under different specific names as agreeing to those abstract ideas of which we have made those names the signs and what are the essences of those species set out and marked by names but those abstract ideas in the mind which are as it were the bonds between particular things that exist and the names they are to be ranked under and when general names have any connexion with particular beings these abstract ideas are the medium that unites them so that the essences of species as distinguished and denominated by us neither are nor can be anything but those precise abstract ideas we have in our minds and therefore the supposed real essences of substances if different from our abstract ideas cannot be the essences of the species we rank things into for two species may be one as rationally as two different essences be the essence of one species and i demand what are the alterations which may or may not be made in a horse or lead without making either of them to be of another species in determining the species of things by our abstract ideas this is easy to resolve but if any one will regulate himself herein by supposed real essences he will i suppose be at a loss and he will never be able to know when anything precisely ceases to be of the species of a horse or lead      each distinct abstract idea is a distinct essence  nor will any one wonder that i say these essences or abstract ideas which are the measures of name and the boundaries of species are the workmanship of the understanding who considers that at least the complex ones are often in several men different collections of simple ideas and therefore that is covetousness to one man which is not so to another nay even in substances where their abstract ideas seem to be taken from the things themselves they are not constantly the same no not in that species which is most familiar to us and with which we have the most intimate acquaintance it having been more than once doubted whether the foetus born of a woman were a man even so far as that it hath been debated whether it were or were not to be nourished and baptized which could not be if the abstract idea or essence to which the name man belonged were of natures making and were not the uncertain and various collection of simple ideas which the understanding put together and then abstracting it affixed a name to it so that in truth every distinct abstract idea is a distinct essence and the names that stand for such distinct ideas are the names of things essentially different thus a circle is as essentially different from an oval as a sheep from a goat and rain is as essentially different from snow as water from earth that abstract idea which is the essence of one being impossible to be communicated to the other and thus any two abstract ideas that in any part vary one from another with two distinct names annexed to them constitute two distinct sorts or if you please species as essentially different as any two of the most remote or opposite in the world      several significations of the word essence  but since the essences of things are thought by some and not without reason to be wholly unknown it may not be amiss to consider the several significations of the word essence  real essences  first essence may be taken for the very being of anything whereby it is what it is and thus the real internal but generally in substances unknown constitution of things whereon their discoverable qualities depend may be called their essence this is the proper original signification of the word as is evident from the formation of it essential in its primary notation signifying properly being and in this sense it is still used when we speak of the essence of particular things without giving them any name  nominal essences  secondly the learning and disputes of the schools having been much busied about genus and species the word essence has almost lost its primary signification and instead of the real constitution of things has been almost wholly applied to the artificial constitution of genus and species it is true there is ordinarily supposed a real constitution of the sorts of things and it is past doubt there must be some real constitution on which any collection of simple ideas coexisting must depend but it being evident that things are ranked under names into sorts or species only as they agree to certain abstract ideas to which we have annexed those names the essence of each genus or sort comes to be nothing but that abstract idea which the general or sortal if i may have leave so to call it from sort as i do general from genus name stands for and this we shall find to be that which the word essence imports in its most familiar use  these two sorts of essences i suppose may not unfitly be termed the one the real the other nominal essence      constant connexion between the name and nominal essence  between the nominal essence and the name there is so near a connexion that the name of any sort of things cannot be attributed to any particular being but what has this essence whereby it answers that abstract idea whereof that name is the sign      supposition that species are distinguished by their real essences useless  concerning the real essences of corporeal substances to mention these only there are if i mistake not two opinions the one is of those who using the word essence for they know not what suppose a certain number of those essences according to which all natural things are made and wherein they do exactly every one of them partake and so become of this or that species the other and more rational opinion is of those who look on all natural things to have a real but unknown constitution of their insensible parts from which flow those sensible qualities which serve us to distinguish them one from another according as we have occasion to rank them into sorts under common denominations the former of these opinions which supposes these essences as a certain number of forms or moulds wherein all natural things that exist are cast and do equally partake has i imagine very much perplexed the knowledge of natural things the frequent productions of monsters in all the species of animals and of changelings and other strange issues of human birth carry with them difficulties not possible to consist with this hypothesis since it is as impossible that two things partaking exactly of the same real essence should have different properties as that two figures partaking of the same real essence of a circle should have different properties but were there no other reason against it yet the supposition of essences that cannot be known and the making of them nevertheless to be that which distinguishes the species of things is so wholly useless and unserviceable to any part of our knowledge that that alone were sufficient to make us lay it by and content ourselves with such essences of the sorts or species of things as come within the reach of our knowledge which when seriously considered will be found as i have said to be nothing else but those abstract complex ideas to which we have annexed distinct general names      real and nominal essence  essences being thus distinguished into nominal and real we may further observe that in the species of simple ideas and modes they are always the same but in substances always quite different thus a figure including a space between three lines is the real as well as nominal essence of a triangle it being not only the abstract idea to which the general name is annexed but the very essentia or being of the thing itself that foundation from which all its properties flow and to which they are all inseparably annexed but it is far otherwise concerning that parcel of matter which makes the ring on my finger wherein these two essences are apparently different for it is the real constitution of its insensible parts on which depend all those properties of colour weight fusibility fixedness c which are to be found in it which constitution we know not and so having no particular idea of having no name that is the sign of it but yet it is its colour weight fusibility fixedness c which makes it to be gold or gives it a right to that name which is therefore its nominal essence since nothing can be called gold but what has a conformity of qualities to that abstract complex idea to which that name is annexed but this distinction of essences belonging particularly to substances we shall when we come to consider their names have an occasion to treat of more fully      essences ingenerable and incorruptible  that such abstract ideas with names to them as we have been speaking of are essences may further appear by what we are told concerning essences viz that they are all ingenerable and incorruptible which cannot be true of the real constitutions of things which begin and perish with them all things that exist besides their author are all liable to change especially those things we are acquainted with and have ranked into bands under distinct names or ensigns thus that which was grass today is tomorrow the flesh of a sheep and within a few days after becomes part of a man in all which and the like changes it is evident their real essencei e that constitution whereon the properties of these several things dependedis destroyed and perishes with them but essences being taken for ideas established in the mind with names annexed to them they are supposed to remain steadily the same whatever mutations the particular substances are liable to for whatever becomes of alexander and bucephalus the ideas to which man and horse are annexed are supposed nevertheless to remain the same and so the essences of those species are preserved whole and undestroyed whatever changes happen to any or all of the individuals of those species by this means the essence of a species rests safe and entire without the existence of so much as one individual of that kind for were there now no circle existing anywhere in the world as perhaps that figure exists not anywhere exactly marked out yet the idea annexed to that name would not cease to be what it is nor cease to be as a pattern to determine which of the particular figures we meet with have or have not a right to the name circle and so to show which of them by having that essence was of that species and though there neither were nor had been in nature such a beast as an unicorn or such a fish as a mermaid yet supposing those names to stand for complex abstract ideas that contained no inconsistency in them the essence of a mermaid is as intelligible as that of a man and the idea of an unicorn as certain steady and permanent as that of a horse from what has been said it is evident that the doctrine of the immutability of essences proves them to be only abstract ideas and is founded on the relation established between them and certain sounds as signs of them and will always be true as long as the same name can have the same signification    0 recapitulation  to conclude this is that which in short i would say viz that all the great business of genera and species and their essences amounts to no more but thisthat men making abstract ideas and settling them in their minds with names annexed to them do thereby enable themselves to consider things and discourse of them as it were in bundles for the easier and readier improvement and communication of their knowledge which would advance but slowly were their words and thoughts confined only to particulars     chapter iv  of the names of simple ideas     names of simple ideas modes and substances have each something peculiar  though all words as i have shown signify nothing immediately but the ideas in the mind of the speaker yet upon a nearer survey we shall find the names of simple ideas mixed modes under which i comprise relations too and natural substances have each of them something peculiar and different from the other for example     first names of simple ideas and of substances intimate real existence  first the names of simple ideas and substances with the abstract ideas in the mind which they immediately signify intimate also some real existence from which was derived their original pattern but the names of mixed modes terminate in the idea that is in the mind and lead not the thoughts any further as we shall see more at large in the following chapter     secondly names of simple ideas and modes signify always both real and nominal essences  secondly the names of simple ideas and modes signify always the real as well as nominal essence of their species but the names of natural substances signify rarely if ever anything but barely the nominal essences of those species as we shall show in the chapter that treats of the names of substances in particular     thirdly names of simple ideas are undefinable  thirdly the names of simple ideas are not capable of any definition the names of all complex ideas are it has not that i know been yet observed by anybody what words are and what are not capable of being defined the want whereof is as i am apt to think not seldom the occasion of great wrangling and obscurity in mens discourses whilst some demand definitions of terms that cannot be defined and others think they ought not to rest satisfied in an explication made by a more general word and its restriction or to speak in terms of art by a genus and difference when even after such definition made according to rule those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of the meaning of the word than they had before this at least i think that the showing what words are and what are not capable of definitions and wherein consists a good definition is not wholly besides our present purpose and perhaps will afford so much light to the nature of these signs and our ideas as to deserve a more particular consideration     if all names were definable it would be a process in infinitum  i will not here trouble myself to prove that all terms are not definable from that progress in infinitum which it will visibly lead us into if we should allow that all names could be defined for if the terms of one definition were still to be defined by another where at last should we stop but i shall from the nature of our ideas and the signification of our words show why some names can and others cannot be defined and which they are     what a definition is  i think it is agreed that a definition is nothing else but the showing the meaning of one word by several other not synonymous terms the meaning of words being only the ideas they are made to stand for by him that uses them the meaning of any term is then showed or the word is defined when by other words the idea it is made the sign of and annexed to in the mind of the speaker is as it were represented or set before the view of another and thus its signification ascertained this is the only use and end of definitions and therefore the only measure of what is or is not a good definition     simple ideas why undefinable  this being premised i say that the names of simple ideas and those only are incapable of being defined the reason whereof is this that the several terms of a definition signifying several ideas they can all together by no means represent an idea which has no composition at all and therefore a definition which is properly nothing but the showing the meaning of one word by several others not signifying each the same thing can in the names of simple ideas have no place     instances scholastic definitions of motion  the not observing this difference in our ideas and their names has produced that eminent trifling in the schools which is so easy to be observed in the definitions they give us of some few of these simple ideas for as to the greatest part of them even those masters of definitions were fain to leave them untouched merely by the impossibility they found in it what more exquisite jargon could the wit of man invent than this definitionthe act of a being in power as far forth as in power which would puzzle any rational man to whom it was not already known by its famous absurdity to guess what word it could ever be supposed to be the explication of if tully asking a dutchman what beweeginge was should have received this explication in his own language that it was actus entis in potentia quatenus in potentia i ask whether any one can imagine he could thereby have understood what the word beweeginge signified or have guessed what idea a dutchman ordinarily had in his mind and would signify to another when he used that sound     modern definition of motion  nor have the modern philosophers who have endeavoured to throw off the jargon of the schools and speak intelligibly much better succeeded in defining simple ideas whether by explaining their causes or any otherwise the atomists who define motion to be a passage from one place to another what do they more than put one synonymous word for another for what is passage other than motion and if they were asked what passage was how would they better define it than by motion for is it not at least as proper and significant to say passage is a motion from one place to another as to say motion is a passage c this is to translate and not to define when we change two words of the same signification one for another which when one is better understood than the other may serve to discover what idea the unknown stands for but is very far from a definition unless we will say every english word in the dictionary is the definition of the latin word it answers and that motion is a definition of motus nor will the successive application of the parts of the superficies of one body to those of another which the cartesians give us prove a much better definition of motion when well examined    0 definitions of light  the act of perspicuous as far forth as perspicuous is another peripatetic definition of a simple idea which though not more absurd than the former of motion yet betrays its uselessness and insignificancy more plainly because experience will easily convince any one that it cannot make the meaning of the word light which it pretends to define at all understood by a blind man but the definition of motion appears not at first sight so useless because it escapes this way of trial for this simple idea entering by the touch as well as sight it is impossible to show an example of any one who has no other way to get the idea of motion but barely by the definition of that name those who tell us that light is a great number of little globules striking briskly on the bottom of the eye speak more intelligibly than the schools but yet these words never so well understood would make the idea the word light stands for no more known to a man that understands it not before than if one should tell him that light was nothing but a company of little tennisballs which fairies all day long struck with rackets against some mens foreheads whilst they passed by others for granting this explication of the thing to be true yet the idea of the cause of light if we had it never so exact would no more give us the idea of light itself as it is such a particular perception in us than the idea of the figure and motion of a sharp piece of steel would give us the idea of that pain which it is able to cause in us for the cause of any sensation and the sensation itself in all the simple ideas of one sense are two ideas and two ideas so different and distant one from another that no two can be more so and therefore should des cartess globules strike never so long on the retina of a man who was blind by a gutta serena he would thereby never have any idea of light or anything approaching it though he understood never so well what little globules were and what striking on another body was and therefore the cartesians very well distinguish between that light which is the cause of that sensation in us and the idea which is produced in us by it and is that which is properly light      simple ideas why undefinable further explained  simple ideas as has been shown are only to be got by those impressions objects themselves make on our minds by the proper inlets appointed to each sort if they are not received this way all the words in the world made use of to explain or define any of their names will never be able to produce in us the idea it stands for for words being sounds can produce in us no other simple ideas than of those very sounds nor excite any in us but by that voluntary connexion which is known to be between them and those simple ideas which common use has made them the signs of he that thinks otherwise let him try if any words can give him the taste of a pine apple and make him have the true idea of the relish of that celebrated delicious fruit so far as he is told it has a resemblance with any tastes whereof he has the ideas already in his memory imprinted there by sensible objects not strangers to his palate so far may he approach that resemblance in his mind but this is not giving us that idea by a definition but exciting in us other simple ideas by their known names which will be still very different from the true taste of that fruit itself in light and colours and all other simple ideas it is the same thing for the signification of sounds is not natural but only imposed and arbitrary and no definition of light or redness is more fitted or able to produce either of those ideas in us than the sound light or red by itself for to hope to produce an idea of light or colour by a sound however formed is to expect that sounds should be visible or colours audible and to make the ears do the office of all the other senses which is all one as to say that we might taste smell and see by the ears a sort of philosophy worthy only of sancho panza who had the faculty to see dulcinea by hearsay and therefore he that has not before received into his mind by the proper inlet the simple idea which any word stands for can never come to know the signification of that word by any other words or sounds whatsoever put together according to any rules of definition the only way is by applying to his senses the proper object and so producing that idea in him for which he has learned the name already a studious blind man who had mightily beat his head about visible objects and made use of the explication of his books and friends to understand those names of light and colours which often came in his way bragged one day that he now understood what scarlet signified upon which his friend demanding what scarlet was the blind man answered it was like the sound of a trumpet just such an understanding of the name of any other simple idea will he have who hopes to get it only from a definition or other words made use of to explain it      the contrary shown in complex ideas by instances of a statue and rainbow  the case is quite otherwise in complex ideas which consisting of several simple ones it is in the power of words standing for the several ideas that make that composition to imprint complex ideas in the mind which were never there before and so make their names be understood in such collections of ideas passing under one name definition or the teaching the signification of one word by several others has place and may make us understand the names of things which never came within the reach of our senses and frame ideas suitable to those in other mens minds when they use those names provided that none of the terms of the definition stand for any such simple ideas which he to whom the explication is made has never yet had in his thought thus the word statue may be explained to a blind man by other words when picture cannot his senses having given him the idea of figure but not of colours which therefore words cannot excite in him this gained the prize to the painter against the statuary each of which contending for the excellency of his art and the statuary bragging that his was to be preferred because it reached further and even those who had lost their eyes could yet perceive the excellency of it the painter agreed to refer himself to the judgment of a blind man who being brought where there was a statue made by the one and a picture drawn by the other he was first led to the statue in which he traced with his hands all the lineaments of the face and body and with great admiration applauded the skill of the workman but being led to the picture and having his hands laid upon it was told that now he touched the head and then the forehead eyes nose c as his hand moved over the parts of the picture on the cloth without finding any the least distinction whereupon he cried out that certainly that must needs be a very admirable and divine piece of workmanship which could represent to them all those parts where he could neither feel nor perceive anything      colours indefinable to the bornblind  he that should use the word rainbow to one who knew all those colours but yet had never seen that phenomenon would by enumerating the figure largeness position and order of the colours so well define that word that it might be perfectly understood but yet that definition how exact and perfect soever would never make a blind man understand it because several of the simple ideas that make that complex one being such as he never received by sensation and experience no words are able to excite them in his mind      complex ideas definable only when the simple ideas of which they consist have been got from experience  simple ideas as has been shown can only be got by experience from those objects which are proper to produce in us those perceptions when by this means we have our minds stored with them and know the names for them then we are in a condition to define and by definition to understand the names of complex ideas that are made up of them but when any term stands for a simple idea that a man has never yet had in his mind it is impossible by any words to make known its meaning to him when any term stands for an idea a man is acquainted with but is ignorant that that term is the sign of it then another name of the same idea which he has been accustomed to may make him understand its meaning but in no case whatsoever is any name of any simple idea capable of a definition      fourthly names of simple ideas of less doubtful meaning than those of mixed modes and substances  fourthly but though the names of simple ideas have not the help of definition to determine their signification yet that hinders not but that they are generally less doubtful and uncertain than those of mixed modes and substances because they standing only for one simple perception men for the most part easily and perfectly agree in their signification and there is little room for mistake and wrangling about their meaning he that knows once that whiteness is the name of that colour he has observed in snow or milk will not be apt to misapply that word as long as he retains that idea which when he has quite lost he is not apt to mistake the meaning of it but perceives he understands it not there is neither a multiplicity of simple ideas to be put together which makes the doubtfulness in the names of mixed modes nor a supposed but an unknown real essence with properties depending thereon the precise number whereof is also unknown which makes the difficulty in the names of substances but on the contrary in simple ideas the whole signification of the name is known at once and consists not of parts whereof more or less being put in the idea may be varied and so the signification of name be obscure or uncertain      simple ideas have few ascents in linea praedicamentali  fifthly this further may be observed concerning simple simple ideas and their names that they have but few ascents in linea praedicamentali as they call it from the lowest species to the summum genus the reason whereof is that the lowest species being but one simple idea nothing can be left out of it that so the difference being taken away it may agree with some other thing in one idea common to them both which having one name is the genus of the other two vg there is nothing that can be left out of the idea of white and red to make them agree in one common appearance and so have one general name as rationality being left out of the complex idea of man makes it agree with brute in the more general idea and name of animal and therefore when to avoid unpleasant enumerations men would comprehend both white and red and several other such simple ideas under one general name they have been fain to do it by a word which denotes only the way they get into the mind for when white red and yellow are all comprehended under the genus or name colour it signifies no more but such ideas as are produced in the mind only by the sight and have entrance only through the eyes and when they would frame yet a more general term to comprehend both colours and sounds and the like simple ideas they do it by a word that signifies all such as come into the mind only by one sense and so the general term quality in its ordinary acceptation comprehends colours sounds tastes smells and tangible qualities with distinction from extension number motion pleasure and pain which make impressions on the mind and introduce their ideas by more senses than one      sixthly names of simple ideas not arbitrary but perfectly taken from the existence of things  sixthly the names of simple ideas substances and mixed modes have also this difference that those of mixed modes stand for ideas perfectly arbitrary those of substances are not perfectly so but refer to a pattern though with some latitude and those of simple ideas are perfectly taken from the existence of things and are not arbitrary at all which what difference it makes in the significations of their names we shall see in the following chapters  simple modes  the names of simple modes differ little from those of simple ideas     chapter v  of the names of mixed modes and relations      mixed modes stand for abstract ideas as other general names  the names of mixed modes being general they stand as has been shewed for sorts or species of things each of which has its peculiar essence the essences of these species also as has been shewed are nothing but the abstract ideas in the mind to which the name is annexed thus far the names and essences of mixed modes have nothing but what is common to them with other ideas but if we take a little nearer survey of them we shall find that they have something peculiar which perhaps may deserve our attention     first the abstract ideas they stand for are made by the understanding  the first particularity i shall observe in them is that the abstract ideas or if you please the essences of the several species of mixed modes are made by the understanding wherein they differ from those of simple ideas in which sort the mind has no power to make any one but only receives such as are presented to it by the real existence of things operating upon it     secondly made arbitrarily and without patterns  in the next place these essences of the species of mixed modes are not only made by the mind but made very arbitrarily made without patterns or reference to any real existence wherein they differ from those of substances which carry with them the supposition of some real being from which they are taken and to which they are conformable but in its complex ideas of mixed modes the mind takes a liberty not to follow the existence of things exactly it unites and retains certain collections as so many distinct specific ideas whilst others that as often occur in nature and are as plainly suggested by outward things pass neglected without particular names or specifications nor does the mind in these of mixed modes as in the complex idea of substances examine them by the real existence of things or verify them by patterns containing such peculiar compositions in nature to know whether his idea of adultery or incest be right will a man seek it anywhere amongst things existing or is it true because any one has been witness to such an action no but it suffices here that men have put together such a collection into one complex idea that makes the archetype and specific idea whether ever any such action were committed in rerum natura or no     how this is done  to understand this right we must consider wherein this making of these complex ideas consists and that is not in the making any new idea but putting together those which the mind had before wherein the mind does these three things first it chooses a certain number secondly it gives them connexion and makes them into one idea thirdly it ties them together by a name if we examine how the mind proceeds in these and what liberty it takes in them we shall easily observe how these essences of the species of mixed modes are the workmanship of the mind and consequently that the species themselves are of mens making     evidently arbitrary in that the idea is often before the existence  nobody can doubt but that these ideas of mixed modes are made by a voluntary collection of ideas put together in the mind independent from any original patterns in nature who will but reflect that this sort of complex ideas may be made abstracted and have names given them and so a species be constituted before any one individual of that species ever existed who can doubt but the ideas of sacrilege or adultery might be framed in the minds of men and have names given them and so these species of mixed modes be constituted before either of them was ever committed and might be as well discoursed of and reasoned about and as certain truths discovered of them whilst yet they had no being but in the understanding as well as now that they have but too frequently a real existence whereby it is plain how much the sorts of mixed modes are the creatures of the understanding where they have a being as subservient to all the ends of real truth and knowledge as when they really exist and we cannot doubt but lawmakers have often made laws about species of actions which were only the creatures of their own understandings beings that had no other existence but in their own minds and i think nobody can deny but that the resurrection was a species of mixed modes in the mind before it really existed     instances murder incest stabbing  to see how arbitrarily these essences of mixed modes are made by the mind we need but take a view of almost any of them a little looking into them will satisfy us that it is the mind that combines several scattered independent ideas into one complex one and by the common name it gives them makes them the essence of a certain species without regulating itself by any connexion they have in nature for what greater connexion in nature has the idea of a man than the idea of a sheep with killing that this is made a particular species of action signified by the word murder and the other not or what union is there in nature between the idea of the relation of a father with killing than that of a son or neighbour that those are combined into one complex idea and thereby made the essence of the distinct species parricide whilst the other makes no distinct species at all but though they have made killing a mans father or mother a distinct species from killing his son or daughter yet in some other cases son and daughter are taken in too as well as father and mother and they are all equally comprehended in the same species as in that of incest thus the mind in mixed modes arbitrarily unites into complex ideas such as it finds convenient whilst others that have altogether as much union in nature are left loose and never combined into one idea because they have no need of one name it is evident then that the mind by its free choice gives a connexion to a certain number of ideas which in nature have no more union with one another than others that it leaves out why else is the part of the weapon the beginning of the wound is made with taken notice of to make the distinct species called stabbing and the figure and matter of the weapon left out i do not say this is done without reason as we shall see more by and by but this i say that it is done by the free choice of the mind pursuing its own ends and that therefore these species of mixed modes are the workmanship of the understanding and there is nothing more evident than that for the most part in the framing these ideas the mind searches not its patterns in nature nor refers the ideas it makes to the real existence of things but puts such together as may best serve its own purposes without tying itself to a precise imitation of anything that really exists     but still subservient to the end of language and not made at random  but though these complex ideas or essences of mixed modes depend on the mind and are made by it with great liberty yet they are not made at random and jumbled together without any reason at all though these complex ideas be not always copied from nature yet they are always suited to the end for which abstract ideas are made and though they be combinations made of ideas that are loose enough and have as little union in themselves as several other to which the mind never gives a connexion that combines them into one idea yet they are always made for the convenience of communication which is the chief end of language the use of language is by short sounds to signify with ease and dispatch general conceptions wherein not only abundance of particulars may be contained but also a great variety of independent ideas collected into one complex one in the making therefore of the species of mixed modes men have had regard only to such combinations as they had occasion to mention one to another those they have combined into distinct complex ideas and given names to whilst others that in nature have as near a union are left loose and unregarded for to go no further than human actions themselves if they would make distinct abstract ideas of all the varieties which might be observed in them the number must be infinite and the memory confounded with the plenty as well as overcharged to little purpose it suffices that men make and name so many complex ideas of these mixed modes as they find they have occasion to have names for in the ordinary occurrence of their affairs if they join to the idea of killing the idea of father or mother and so make a distinct species from killing a mans son or neighbour it is because of the different heinousness of the crime and the distinct punishment is due to the murdering a mans father and mother different to what ought to be inflicted on the murder of a son or neighbour and therefore they find it necessary to mention it by a distinct name which is the end of making that distinct combination but though the ideas of mother and daughter are so differently treated in reference to the idea of killing that the one is joined with it to make a distinct abstract idea with a name and so a distinct species and the other not yet in respect of carnal knowledge they are both taken in under incest and that still for the same convenience of expressing under one name and reckoning of one species such unclean mixtures as have a peculiar turpitude beyond others and this to avoid circumlocutions and tedious descriptions     whereof the intranslatable words of divers languages are a proof  a moderate skill in different languages will easily satisfy one of the truth of this it being so obvious to observe great store of words in one language which have not any that answer them in another which plainly shows that those of one country by their customs and manner of life have found occasion to make several complex ideas and given names to them which others never collected into specific ideas this could not have happened if these species were the steady workmanship of nature and not collections made and abstracted by the mind in order to naming and for the convenience of communication the terms of our law which are not empty sounds will hardly find words that answer them in the spanish or italian no scanty languages much less i think could any one translate them into the caribbee or westoe tongues and the versura of the romans or corban of the jews have no words in other languages to answer them the reason whereof is plain from what has been said nay if we look a little more nearly into this matter and exactly compare different languages we shall find that though they have words which in translations and dictionaries are supposed to answer one another yet there is scarce one often amongst the names of complex ideas especially of mixed modes that stands for the same precise idea which the word does that in dictionaries it is rendered by there are no ideas more common and less compounded than the measures of time extension and weight and the latin names hora pes libra are without difficulty rendered by the english names hour foot and pound but yet there is nothing more evident than that the ideas a roman annexed to these latin names were very far different from those which an englishman expresses by those english ones and if either of these should make use of the measures that those of the other language designed by their names he would be quite out in his account these are too sensible proofs to be doubted and we shall find this much more so in the names of more abstract and compounded ideas such as are the greatest part of those which make up moral discourses whose names when men come curiously to compare with those they are translated into in other languages they will find very few of them exactly to correspond in the whole extent of their significations     this shows species to be made for communication  the reason why i take so particular notice of this is that we may not be mistaken about genera and species and their essences as if they were things regularly and constantly made by nature and had a real existence in things when they appear upon a more wary survey to be nothing else but an artifice of the understanding for the easier signifying such collections of ideas as it should often have occasion to communicate by one general term under which divers particulars as far forth as they agreed to that abstract idea might be comprehended and if the doubtful signification of the word species may make it sound harsh to some that i say the species of mixed modes are made by the understanding yet i think it can by nobody be denied that it is the mind makes those abstract complex ideas to which specific names are given and if it be true as it is that the mind makes the patterns for sorting and naming of things i leave it to be considered who makes the boundaries of the sort or species since with me species and sort have no other difference than that of a latin and english idiom    0 in mixed modes it is the name that ties the combination of simple ideas together and makes it a species  the near relation that there is between species essences and their general name at least in mixed modes will further appear when we consider that it is the name that seems to preserve those essences and give them their lasting duration for the connexion between the loose parts of those complex ideas being made by the mind this union which has no particular foundation in nature would cease again were there not something that did as it were hold it together and keep the parts from scattering though therefore it be the mind that makes the collection it is the name which is as it were the knot that ties them fast together what a vast variety of different ideas does the word triumphus hold together and deliver to us as one species had this name been never made or quite lost we might no doubt have had descriptions of what passed in that solemnity but yet i think that which holds those different parts together in the unity of one complex idea is that very word annexed to it without which the several parts of that would no more be thought to make one thing than any other show which having never been made but once had never been united into one complex idea under one denomination how much therefore in mixed modes the unity necessary to any essence depends on the mind and how much the continuation and fixing of that unity depends on the name in common use annexed to it i leave to be considered by those who look upon essences and species as real established things in nature       suitable to this we find that men speaking of mixed modes seldom imagine or take any other for species of them but such as are set out by name because they being of mans making only in order to naming no such species are taken notice of or supposed to be unless a name be joined to it as the sign of mans having combined into one idea several loose ones and by that name giving a lasting union to the parts which would otherwise cease to have any as soon as the mind laid by that abstract idea and ceased actually to think on it but when a name is once annexed to it wherein the parts of that complex idea have a settled and permanent union then is the essence as it were established and the species looked on as complete for to what purpose should the memory charge itself with such compositions unless it were by abstraction to make them general and to what purpose make them general unless it were that they might have general names for the convenience of discourse and communication thus we see that killing a man with a sword or a hatchet are looked on as no distinct species of action but if the point of the sword first enter the body it passes for a distinct species where it has a distinct name as in england in whose language it is called stabbing but in another country where it has not happened to be specified under a peculiar name it passes not for a distinct species but in the species of corporeal substances though it be the mind that makes the nominal essence yet since those ideas which are combined in it are supposed to have an union in nature whether the mind joins them or not therefore those are looked on as distinct species without any operation of the mind either abstracting or giving a name to that complex idea      for the originals of our mixed modes we look no further than the mind which also shows them to be the workmanship of the understanding  conformable also to what has been said concerning the essences of the species of mixed modes that they are the creatures of the understanding rather than the works of nature conformable i say to this we find that their names lead our thoughts to the mind and no further when we speak of justice or gratitude we frame to ourselves no imagination of anything existing which we would conceive but our thoughts terminate in the abstract ideas of those virtues and look not further as they do when we speak of a horse or iron whose specific ideas we consider not as barely in the mind but as in things themselves which afford the original patterns of those ideas but in mixed modes at least the most considerable parts of them which are moral beings we consider the original patterns as being in the mind and to those we refer for the distinguishing of particular beings under names and hence i think it is that these essences of the species of mixed modes are by a more particular name called notions as by a peculiar right appertaining to the understanding      their being made by the understanding without patterns shows the reason why they are so compounded  hence likewise we may learn why the complex ideas of mixed modes are commonly more compounded and decompounded than those of natural substances because they being the workmanship of the understanding pursuing only its own ends and the conveniency of expressing in short those ideas it would make known to another it does with great liberty unite often into one abstract idea things that in their nature have no coherence and so under one term bundle together a great variety of compounded and decompounded ideas thus the name of procession what a great mixture of independent ideas of persons habits tapers orders motions sounds does it contain in that complex one which the mind of man has arbitrarily put together to express by that one name whereas the complex ideas of the sorts of substances are usually made up of only a small number of simple ones and in the species of animals these two viz shape and voice commonly make the whole nominal essence      names of mixed modes stand alway for their real essences which are the workmanship of our minds  another thing we may observe from what has been said is that the names of mixed modes always signify when they have any determined signification the real essences of their species for these abstract ideas being the workmanship of the mind and not referred to the real existence of things there is no supposition of anything more signified by that name but barely that complex idea the mind itself has formed which is all it would have expressed by it and is that on which all the properties of the species depend and from which alone they all flow and so in these the real and nominal essence is the same which of what concernment it is to the certain knowledge of general truth we shall see hereafter      why their names are usually got before their ideas  this also may show us the reason why for the most part the names of mixed modes are got before the ideas they stand for are perfectly known because there being no species of these ordinarily taken notice of but what have names and those species or rather their essences being abstract complex ideas made arbitrarily by the mind it is convenient if not necessary to know the names before one endeavour to frame these complex ideas unless a man will fill his head with a company of abstract complex ideas which others having no names for he has nothing to do with but to lay by and forget again i confess that in the beginning of languages it was necessary to have the idea before one gave it the name and so it is still where making a new complex idea one also by giving it a new name makes a new word but this concerns not languages made which have generally pretty well provided for ideas which men have frequent occasion to have and communicate and in such i ask whether it be not the ordinary method that children learn the names of mixed modes before they have their ideas what one of a thousand ever frames the abstract ideas of glory and ambition before he has heard the names of them in simple ideas and substances i grant it is otherwise which being such ideas as have a real existence and union in nature the ideas and names are got one before the other as it happens      reason of my being so large on this subject  what has been said here of mixed modes is with very little difference applicable also to relations which since every man himself may observe i may spare myself the pains to enlarge on especially since what i have here said concerning words in this third book will possibly be thought by some to this be much more than what so slight a subject required i allow it might be brought into a narrower compass but i was willing to stay my reader on an argument that appears to me new and a little out of the way i am sure it is one i thought not of when i began to write that by searching it to the bottom and turning it on every side some part or other might meet with every ones thoughts and give occasion to the most averse or negligent to reflect on a general miscarriage which though of great consequence is little taken notice of when it is considered what a pudder is made about essences and how much all sorts of knowledge discourse and conversation are pestered and disordered by the careless and confused use and application of words it will perhaps be thought worth while thoroughly to lay it open and i shall be pardoned if i have dwelt long on an argument which i think therefore needs to be inculcated because the faults men are usually guilty of in this kind are not only the greatest hindrances of true knowledge but are so well thought of as to pass for it men would often see what a small pittance of reason and truth or possibly none at all is mixed with those huffing opinions they are swelled with if they would but look beyond fashionable sounds and observe what ideas are or are not comprehended under those words with which they are so armed at all points and with which they so confidently lay about them i shall imagine i have done some service to truth peace and learning if by any enlargement on this subject i can make men reflect on their own use of language and give them reason to suspect that since it is frequent for others it may also be possible for them to have sometimes very good and approved words in their mouths and writings with very uncertain little or no signification and therefore it is not unreasonable for them to be wary herein themselves and not to be unwilling to have them examined by others with this design therefore i shall go on with what i have further to say concerning this matter     chapter vi  of the names of substances     the common names of substances stand for sorts  the common names of substances as well as other general terms stand for sorts which is nothing else but the being made signs of such complex ideas wherein several particular substances do or might agree by virtue of which they are capable of being comprehended in one common conception and signified by one name i say do or might agree for though there be but one sun existing in the world yet the idea of it being abstracted so that more substances if there were several might each agree in it it is as much a sort as if there were as many suns as there are stars they want not their reasons who think there are and that each fixed star would answer the idea the name sun stands for to one who was placed in a due distance which by the way may show us how much the sorts or if you please genera and species of things for those latin terms signify to me no more than the english word sort depend on such collections of ideas as men have made and not on the real nature of things since it is not impossible but that in propriety of speech that might be a sun to one which is a star to another     the essence of each sort of substance is our abstract idea to which the name is annexed  the measure and boundary of each sort or species whereby it is constituted that particular sort and distinguished from others is that we call its essence which is nothing but that abstract idea to which the name is annexed so that everything contained in that idea is essential to that sort this though it be all the essence of natural substances that we know or by which we distinguish them into sorts yet i call it by a peculiar name the nominal essence to distinguish it from the real constitution of substances upon which depends this nominal essence and all the properties of that sort which therefore as has been said may be called the real essence vg the nominal essence of gold is that complex idea the word gold stands for let it be for instance a body yellow of a certain weight malleable fusible and fixed but the real essence is the constitution of the insensible parts of that body on which those qualities and all the other properties of gold depend how far these two are different though they are both called essence is obvious at first sight to discover     the nominal and real essence different  for though perhaps voluntary motion with sense and reason joined to a body of a certain shape be the complex idea to which i and others annex the name man and so be the nominal essence of the species so called yet nobody will say that complex idea is the real essence and source of all those operations which are to be found in any individual of that sort the foundation of all those qualities which are the ingredients of our complex idea is something quite different and had we such a knowledge of that constitution of man from which his faculties of moving sensation and reasoning and other powers flow and on which his so regular shape depends as it is possible angels have and it is certain his maker has we should have a quite other idea of his essence than what now is contained in our definition of that species be it what it will and our idea of any individual man would be as far different from what it is now as is his who knows all the springs and wheels and other contrivances within of the famous clock at strasburg from that which a gazing countryman has of it who barely sees the motion of the hand and hears the clock strike and observes only some of the outward appearances     nothing essential to individuals  that essence in the ordinary use of the word relates to sorts and that it is considered in particular beings no further than as they are ranked into sorts appears from hence that take but away the abstract ideas by which we sort individuals and rank them under common names and then the thought of anything essential to any of them instantly vanishes we have no notion of the one without the other which plainly shows their relation it is necessary for me to be as i am god and nature has made me so but there is nothing i have is essential to me an accident or disease may very much alter my colour or shape a fever or fall may take away my reason or memory or both and an apoplexy leave neither sense nor understanding no nor life other creatures of my shape may be made with more and better or fewer and worse faculties than i have and others may have reason and sense in a shape and body very different from mine none of these are essential to the one or the other or to any individual whatever till the mind refers it to some sort or species of things and then presently according to the abstract idea of that sort something is found essential let any one examine his own thoughts and he will find that as soon as he supposes or speaks of essential the consideration of some species or the complex idea signified by some general name comes into his mind and it is in reference to that that this or that quality is said to be essential so that if it be asked whether it be essential to me or any other particular corporeal being to have reason i say no no more than it is essential to this white thing i write on to have words in it but if that particular being be to be counted of the sort man and to have the name man given it then reason is essential to it supposing reason to be a part of the complex idea the name man stands for as it is essential to this thing i write on to contain words if i will give it the name treatise and rank it under that species so that essential and not essential relate only to our abstract ideas and the names annexed to them which amounts to no more than this that whatever particular thing has not in it those qualities which are contained in the abstract idea which any general term stands for cannot be ranked under that species nor be called by that name since that abstract idea is the very essence of that species     the only essences perceived by us in individual substances are those qualities which entitle them to receive their names  thus if the idea of body with some people be bare extension or space then solidity is not essential to body if others make the idea to which they give the name body to be solidity and extension then solidity is essential to body that therefore and that alone is considered as essential which makes a part of the complex idea the name of a sort stands for without which no particular thing can be reckoned of that sort nor be entitled to that name should there be found a parcel of matter that had all the other qualities that are in iron but wanted obedience to the loadstone and would neither be drawn by it nor receive direction from it would any one question whether it wanted anything essential it would be absurd to ask whether a thing really existing wanted anything essential to it or could it be demanded whether this made an essential or specific difference or no since we have no other measure of essential or specific but our abstract ideas and to talk of specific differences in nature without reference to general ideas in names is to talk unintelligibly for i would ask any one what is sufficient to make an essential difference in nature between any two particular beings without any regard had to some abstract idea which is looked upon as the essence and standard of a species all such patterns and standards being quite laid aside particular beings considered barely in themselves will be found to have all their qualities equally essential and everything in each individual will be essential to it or which is more nothing at all for though it may be reasonable to ask whether obeying the magnet be essential to iron yet i think it is very improper and insignificant to ask whether it be essential to the particular parcel of matter i cut my pen with without considering it under the name iron or as being of a certain species and if as has been said our abstract ideas which have names annexed to them are the boundaries of species nothing can be essential but what is contained in those ideas     even the real essences of individual substances imply potential sorts  it is true i have often mentioned a real essence distinct in substances from those abstract ideas of them which i call their nominal essence by this real essence i mean that real constitution of anything which is the foundation of all those properties that are combined in and are constantly found to coexist with the nominal essence that particular constitution which everything has within itself without any relation to anything without it but essence even in this sense relates to a sort and supposes a species for being that real constitution on which the properties depend it necessarily supposes a sort of things properties belonging only to species and not to individuals v g supposing the nominal essence of gold to be a body of such a peculiar colour and weight with malleability and fusibility the real essence is that constitution of the parts of matter on which these qualities and their union depend and is also the foundation of its solubility in aqua regia and other properties accompanying that complex idea here are essences and properties but all upon supposition of a sort or general abstract idea which is considered as immutable but there is no individual parcel of matter to which any of these qualities are so annexed as to be essential to it or inseparable from it that which is essential belongs to it as a condition whereby it is of this or that sort but take away the consideration of its being ranked under the name of some abstract idea and then there is nothing necessary to it nothing inseparable from it indeed as to the real essences of substances we only suppose their being without precisely knowing what they are but that which annexes them still to the species is the nominal essence of which they are the supposed foundation and cause     the nominal essence bounds the species to us  the next thing to be considered is by which of those essences it is that substances are determined into sorts or species and that it is evident is by the nominal essence for it is that alone that the name which is the mark of the sort signifies it is impossible therefore that anything should determine the sorts of things which we rank under general names but that idea which that name is designed as a mark for which is that as has been shown which we call nominal essence why do we say this is a horse and that a mule this is an animal that an herb how comes any particular thing to be of this or that sort but because it has that nominal essence or which is all one agrees to that abstract idea that name is annexed to and i desire any one but to reflect on his own thoughts when he hears or speaks any of those or other names of substances to know what sort of essences they stand for     the nature of species as formed by us  and that the species of things to us are nothing but the ranking them under distinct names according to the complex ideas in us and not according to precise distinct real essences in them is plain from hencethat we find many of the individuals that are ranked into one sort called by one common name and so received as being of one species have yet qualities depending on their real constitutions as far different one from another as from others from which they are accounted to differ specifically this as it is easy to be observed by all who have to do with natural bodies so chemists especially are often by sad experience convinced of it when they sometimes in vain seek for the same qualities in one parcel of sulphur antimony or vitriol which they have found in others for though they are bodies of the same species having the same nominal essence under the same name yet do they often upon severe ways of examination betray qualities so different one from another as to frustrate the expectation and labour of very wary chemists but if things were distinguished into species according to their real essences it would be as impossible to find different properties in any two individual substances of the same species as it is to find different properties in two circles or two equilateral triangles that is properly the essence to us which determines every particular to this or that classis or which is the same thing to this or that general name and what can that be else but that abstract idea to which that name is annexed and so has in truth a reference not so much to the being of particular things as to their general denominations     not the real essence or texture of parts which we know not  nor indeed can we rank and sort things and consequently which is the end of sorting denominate them by their real essences because we know them not our faculties carry us no further towards the knowledge and distinction of substances than a collection of those sensible ideas which we observe in them which however made with the greatest diligence and exactness we are capable of yet is more remote from the true internal constitution from which those qualities flow than as i said a countrymans idea is from the inward contrivance of that famous clock at strasburg whereof he only sees the outward figure and motions there is not so contemptible a plant or animal that does not confound the most enlarged understanding though the familiar use of things about us take off our wonder yet it cures not our ignorance when we come to examine the stones we tread on or the iron we daily handle we presently find we know not their make and can give no reason of the different qualities we find in them it is evident the internal constitution whereon their properties depend is unknown to us for to go no further than the grossest and most obvious we can imagine amongst them what is that texture of parts that real essence that makes lead and antimony fusible wood and stones not what makes lead and iron malleable antimony and stones not and yet how infinitely these come short of the fine contrivances and inconceivable real essences of plants or animals every one knows the workmanship of the allwise and powerful god in the great fabric of the universe and every part thereof further exceeds the capacity and comprehension of the most inquisitive and intelligent man than the best contrivance of the most ingenious man doth the conceptions of the most ignorant of rational creatures therefore we in vain pretend to range things into sorts and dispose them into certain classes under names by their real essences that are so far from our discovery or comprehension a blind man may as soon sort things by their colours and he that has lost his smell as well distinguish a lily and a rose by their odours as by those internal constitutions which he knows not he that thinks he can distinguish sheep and goats by their real essences that are unknown to him may be pleased to try his skill in those species called cassiowary and querechinchio and by their internal real essences determine the boundaries of those species without knowing the complex idea of sensible qualities that each of those names stand for in the countries where those animals are to be found    0 not the substantial form which know not  those therefore who have been taught that the several species of substances had their distinct internal substantial forms and that it was those forms which made the distinction of substances into their true species and genera were led yet further out of the way by having their minds set upon fruitless inquiries after substantial forms wholly unintelligible and whereof we have scarce so much as any obscure or confused conception in general      that the nominal essence is that only whereby we distinguish species of substances further evident from our ideas of finite spirits and of god  that our ranking and distinguishing natural substances into species consists in the nominal essences the mind makes and not in the real essences to be found in the things themselves is further evident from our ideas of spirits for the mind getting only by reflecting on its own operations those simple ideas which it attributes to spirits it hath or can have no other notion of spirit but by attributing all those operations it finds in itself to a sort of beings without consideration of matter and even the most advanced notion we have of god is but attributing the same simple ideas which we have got from reflection on what we find in ourselves and which we conceive to have more perfection in them than would be in their absence attributing i say those simple ideas to him in an unlimited degree thus having got from reflecting on ourselves the idea of existence knowledge power and pleasureeach of which we find it better to have than to want and the more we have of each the betterjoining all these together with infinity to each of them we have the complex idea of an eternal omniscient omnipotent infinitely wise and happy being and though we are told that there are different species of angels yet we know not how to frame distinct specific ideas of them not out of any conceit that the existence of more species than one of spirits is impossible but because having no more simple ideas nor being able to frame more applicable to such beings but only those few taken from ourselves and from the actions of our own minds in thinking and being delighted and moving several parts of our bodies we can no otherwise distinguish in our conceptions the several species of spirits one from another but by attributing those operations and powers we find in ourselves to them in a higher or lower degree and so have no very distinct specific ideas of spirits except only of god to whom we attribute both duration and all those other ideas with infinity to the other spirits with limitation nor as i humbly conceive do we between god and them in our ideas put any difference by any number of simple ideas which we have of one and not of the other but only that of infinity all the particular ideas of existence knowledge will power and motion c being ideas derived from the operations of our minds we attribute all of them to all sorts of spirits with the difference only of degrees to the utmost we can imagine even infinity when we would frame as well as we can an idea of the first being who yet it is certain is infinitely more remote in the real excellency of his nature from the highest and perfectest of all created beings than the greatest man nay purest seraph is from the most contemptible part of matter and consequently must infinitely exceed what our narrow understandings can conceive of him      of finite spirits there are probably numberless species in a continuous series of gradations  it is not impossible to conceive nor repugnant to reason that there may be many species of spirits as much separated and diversified one from another by distinct properties whereof we have no ideas as the species of sensible things are distinguished one from another by qualities which we know and observe in them that there should be more species of intelligent creatures above us than there are of sensible and material below us is probable to me from hence that in all the visible corporeal world we see no chasms or gaps all quite down from us the descent is by easy steps and a continued series of things that in each remove differ very little one from the other there are fishes that have wings and are not strangers to the airy region and there are some birds that are inhabitants of the water whose blood is cold as fishes and their flesh so like in taste that the scrupulous are allowed them on fishdays there are animals so near of kin both to birds and beasts that they are in the middle between both amphibious animals link the terrestrial and aquatic together seals live at land and sea and porpoises have the warm blood and entrails of a hog not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids or seamen there are some brutes that seem to have as much knowledge and reason as some that are called men and the animal and vegetable kingdoms are so nearly joined that if you will take the lowest of one and the highest of the other there will scarce be perceived any great difference between them and so on till we come to the lowest and the most inorganical parts of matter we shall find everywhere that the several species are linked together and differ but in almost insensible degrees and when we consider the infinite power and wisdom of the maker we have reason to think that it is suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe and the great design and infinite goodness of the architect that the species of creatures should also by gentle degrees ascend upward from us toward his infinite perfection as we see they gradually descend from us downwards which if it be probable we have reason then to be persuaded that there are far more species of creatures above us than there are beneath we being in degrees of perfection much more remote from the infinite being of god than we are from the lowest state of being and that which approaches nearest to nothing and yet of all those distinct species for the reasons abovesaid we have no clear distinct ideas      the nominal essence that of the species as conceived by us proved from water and ice  but to return to the species of corporeal substances if i should ask any one whether ice and water were two distinct species of things i doubt not but i should be answered in the affirmative and it cannot be denied but he that says they are two distinct species is in the right but if an englishman bred in jamaica who perhaps had never seen nor heard of ice coming into england in the winter find the water he put in his basin at night in a great part frozen in the morning and not knowing any peculiar name it had should call it hardened water i ask whether this would be a new species to him different from water and i think it would be answered here it would not be to him a new species no more than congealed jelly when it is cold is a distinct species from the same jelly fluid and warm or than liquid gold in the furnace is a distinct species from hard gold in the hands of a workman and if this be so it is plain that our distinct species are nothing but distinct complex ideas with distinct names annexed to them it is true every substance that exists has its peculiar constitution whereon depend those sensible qualities and powers we observe in it but the ranking of things into species which is nothing but sorting them under several titles is done by us according to the ideas that we have of them which though sufficient to distinguish them by names so that we may be able to discourse of them when we have them not present before us yet if we suppose it to be done by their real internal constitutions and that things existing are distinguished by nature into species by real essences according as we distinguish them into species by names we shall be liable to great mistakes      difficulties in the supposition of a certain number of real essences  to distinguish substantial beings into species according to the usual supposition that there are certain precise essences or forms of things whereby all the individuals existing are by nature distinguished into species these things are necessary      a crude supposition  first to be assured that nature in the production of things always designs them to partake of certain regulated established essences which are to be the models of all things to be produced this in that crude sense it is usually proposed would need some better explication before it can fully be assented to      monstrous births  secondly it would be necessary to know whether nature always attains that essence it designs in the production of things the irregular and monstrous births that in divers sorts of animals have been observed will always give us reason to doubt of one or both of these      are monsters really a distinct species  thirdly it ought to be determined whether those we call monsters be really a distinct species according to the scholastic notion of the word species since it is certain that everything that exists has its particular constitution and yet we find that some of these monstrous productions have few or none of those qualities which are supposed to result from and accompany the essence of that species from whence they derive their originals and to which by their descent they seem to belong      men can have no ideas of real essences  fourthly the real essences of those things which we distinguish into species and as so distinguished we name ought to be known ie we ought to have ideas of them but since we are ignorant in these four points the supposed real essences of things stand us not in stead for the distinguishing substances into species      our nominal essences of substances not perfect collections of the properties that flow from the real essence  fifthly the only imaginable help in this case would be that having framed perfect complex ideas of the properties of things flowing from their different real essences we should thereby distinguish them into species but neither can this be done for being ignorant of the real essence itself it is impossible to know all those properties that flow from it and are so annexed to it that any one of them being away we may certainly conclude that that essence is not there and so the thing is not of that species we can never know what is the precise number of properties depending on the real essence of gold any one of which failing the real essence of gold and consequently gold would not be there unless we knew the real essence of gold itself and by that determined that species by the word gold here i must be understood to design a particular piece of matter v g the last guinea that was coined for if it should stand here in its ordinary signification for that complex idea which i or any one else calls gold i e for the nominal essence of gold it would be jargon so hard is it to show the various meaning and imperfection of words when we have nothing else but words to do it by    0 hence names independent of real essence  by all which it is clear that our distinguishing substances into species by names is not at all founded on their real essences nor can we pretend to range and determine them exactly into species according to internal essential differences      but stand for such collections of simple ideas as we have made the name stand for  but since as has been remarked we have need of general words though we know not the real essences of things all we can do is to collect such a number of simple ideas as by examination we find to be united together in things existing and thereof to make one complex idea which though it be not the real essence of any substance that exists is yet the specific essence to which our name belongs and is convertible with it by which we may at least try the truth of these nominal essences for example there be that say that the essence of body is extension if it be so we can never mistake in putting the essence of anything for the thing itself let us then in discourse put extension for body and when we would say that body moves let us say that extension moves and see how ill it will look he that should say that one extension by impulse moves another extension would by the bare expression sufficiently show the absurdity of such a notion the essence of anything in respect of us is the whole complex idea comprehended and marked by that name and in substances besides the several distinct simple ideas that make them up the confused one of substance or of an unknown support and cause of their union is always a part and therefore the essence of body is not bare extension but an extended solid thing and so to say an extended solid thing moves or impels another is all one and as intelligible as to say body moves or impels likewise to say that a rational animal is capable of conversation is all one as to say a man but no one will say that rationality is capable of conversation because it makes not the whole essence to which we give the name man     our abstract ideas are to us the measures of the species we make in instance in that of man  there are creatures in the world that have shapes like ours but are hairy and want language and reason there are naturals amongst us that have perfectly our shape but want reason and some of them language too there are creatures as it is said sit fides penes authorem but there appears no contradiction that there should be such that with language and reason and a shape in other things agreeing with ours have hairy tails others where the males have no beards and others where the females have if it be asked whether these be all men or no all of human species it is plain the question refers only to the nominal essence for those of them to whom the definition of the word man or the complex idea signified by that name agrees are men and the other not but if the inquiry be made concerning the supposed real essence and whether the internal constitution and frame of these several creatures be specifically different it is wholly impossible for us to answer no part of that going into our specific idea only we have reason to think that where the faculties or outward frame so much differs the internal constitution is not exactly the same but what difference in the real internal constitution makes a specific difference it is in vain to inquire whilst our measures of species be as they are only our abstract ideas which we know and not that internal constitution which makes no part of them shall the difference of hair only on the skin be a mark of a different internal specific constitution between a changeling and a drill when they agree in shape and want of reason and speech and shall not the want of reason and speech be a sign to us of different real constitutions and species between a changeling and a reasonable man and so of the rest if we pretend that distinction of species or sorts is fixedly established by the real frame and secret constitutions of things      species in animals not distinguished by generation  nor let any one say that the power of propagation in animals by the mixture of male and female and in plants by seeds keeps the supposed real species distinct and entire for granting this to be true it would help us in the distinction of the species of things no further than the tribes of animals and vegetables what must we do for the rest but in those too it is not sufficient for if history lie not women have conceived by drills and what real species by that measure such a production will be in nature will be a new question and we have reason to think this is not impossible since mules and jumarts the one from the mixture of an ass and a mare the other from the mixture of a bull and a mare are so frequent in the world i once saw a creature that was the issue of a cat and a rat and had the plain marks of both about it wherein nature appeared to have followed the pattern of neither sort alone but to have jumbled them both together to which he that shall add the monstrous productions that are so frequently to be met with in nature will find it hard even in the race of animals to determine by the pedigree of what species every animals issue is and be at a loss about the real essence which he thinks certainly conveyed by generation and has alone a right to the specific name but further if the species of animals and plants are to be distinguished only by propagation must i go to the indies to see the sire and dam of the one and the plant from which the seed was gathered that produced the other to know whether this be a tiger or that tea      not by substantial forms  upon the whole matter it is evident that it is their own collections of sensible qualities that men make the essences of their several sorts of substances and that their real internal structures are not considered by the greatest part of men in the sorting them much less were any substantial forms ever thought on by any but those who have in this one part of the world learned the language of the schools and yet those ignorant men who pretend not any insight into the real essences nor trouble themselves about substantial forms but are content with knowing things one from another by their sensible qualities are often better acquainted with their differences can more nicely distinguish them from their uses and better know what they expect from each than those learned quicksighted men who look so deep into them and talk so confidently of something more hidden and essential      the specific essences that are common made by men  but supposing that the real essences of substances were discoverable by those that would severely apply themselves to that inquiry yet we could not reasonably think that the ranking of things under general names was regulated by those internal real constitutions or anything else but their obvious appearances since languages in all countries have been established long before sciences so that they have not been philosophers or logicians or such who have troubled themselves about forms and essences that have made the general names that are in use amongst the several nations of men but those more or less comprehensive terms have for the most part in all languages received their birth and signification from ignorant and illiterate people who sorted and denominated things by those sensible qualities they found in them thereby to signify them when absent to others whether they had an occasion to mention a sort or a particular thing      therefore very various and uncertain in the ideas of different men  since then it is evident that we sort and name substances by their nominal and not by their real essences the next thing to be considered is how and by whom these essences come to be made as to the latter it is evident they are made by the mind and not by nature for were they natures workmanship they could not be so various and different in several men as experience tells us they are for if we will examine it we shall not find the nominal essence of any one species of substances in all men the same no not of that which of all others we are the most intimately acquainted with it could not possibly be that the abstract idea to which the name man is given should be different in several men if it were of natures making and that to one it should be animal rationale and to another animal implume bipes latis unguibus he that annexes the name man to a complex idea made up of sense and spontaneous motion joined to a body of such a shape has thereby one essence of the species man and he that upon further examination adds rationality has another essence of the species he calls man by which means the same individual will be a true man to the one which is not so to the other i think there is scarce any one will allow this upright figure so well known to be the essential difference of the species man and yet how far men determine of the sorts of animals rather by their shape than descent is very visible since it has been more than once debated whether several human foetuses should be preserved or received to baptism or no only because of the difference of their outward configuration from the ordinary make of children without knowing whether they were not as capable of reason as infants cast in another mould some whereof though of an approved shape are never capable of as much appearance of reason all their lives as is to be found in an ape or an elephant and never give any signs of being acted by a rational soul whereby it is evident that the outward figure which only was found wanting and not the faculty of reason which nobody could know would be wanting in its due season was made essential to the human species the learned divine and lawyer must on such occasions renounce his sacred definition of animal rationale and substitute some other essence of the human species monsieur menage furnishes us with an example worth the taking notice of on this occasion when the abbot of saint martin says he was born he had so little of the figure of a man that it bespake him rather a monster it was for some time under deliberation whether he should be baptized or no however he was baptized and declared a man provisionally till time should show what he would prove nature had moulded him so untowardly that he was called all his life the abbot malotru ie illshaped he was of caen menagiana       0 this child we see was very near being excluded out of the species of man barely by his shape he escaped very narrowly as he was and it is certain a figure a little more oddly turned had cast him and he had been executed as a thing not to be allowed to pass for a man and yet there can be no reason given why if the lineaments of his face had been a little altered a rational soul could not have been lodged in him why a visage somewhat longer or a nose flatter or a wider mouth could not have consisted as well as the rest of his ill figure with such a soul such parts as made him disfigured as he was capable to be a dignitary in the church      nominal essences of particular substances are undetermined by nature and therefore various as men vary  wherein then would i gladly know consist the precise and unmovable boundaries of that species it is plain if we examine there is no such thing made by nature and established by her amongst men the real essence of that or any other sort of substances it is evident we know not and therefore are so undetermined in our nominal essences which we make ourselves that if several men were to be asked concerning some oddlyshaped foetus as soon as born whether it were a man or no it is past doubt one should meet with different answers which could not happen if the nominal essences whereby we limit and distinguish the species of substances were not made by man with some liberty but were exactly copied from precise boundaries set by nature whereby it distinguished all substances into certain species who would undertake to resolve what species that monster was of which is mentioned by licetus lib i c   with a mans head and hogs body or those other which to the bodies of men had the heads of beasts as dogs horses c if any of these creatures had lived and could have spoke it would have increased the difficulty had the upper part to the middle been of human shape and all below swine had it been murder to destroy it or must the bishop have been consulted whether it were man enough to be admitted to the font or no as i have been told it happened in france some years since in somewhat a like case so uncertain are the boundaries of species of animals to us who have no other measures than the complex ideas of our own collecting and so far are we from certainly knowing what a man is though perhaps it will be judged great ignorance to make any doubt about it and yet i think i may say that the certain boundaries of that species are so far from being determined and the precise number of simple ideas which make the nominal essence so far from being settles and perfectly known that very material doubts may still arise about it and i imagine none of the definitions of the word man which we yet have nor descriptios of that sort of animal are so perfect and exact as to satisfy a considerate inquisitive person much less to obtain a general consent and to be that which men would everywhere stick by in the decision of cases and determining of life and death baptism or no baptism in productions that mights happen      but not so arbitrary as mixed modes  but though these nominal essences of substances are made by the mind they are not yet made so arbitrarily as those of mixed modes to the making of any nominal essence it is necessary first that the ideas whereof it consists have such a union as to make but one idea how compounded soever secondly that the particular ideas so united be exactly the same neither more nor less for if two abstract complex ideas differ either in number or sorts of their component parts they make two different and not one and the same essence in the first of these the mind in making its complex ideas of substances only follows nature and puts none together which are not supposed to have a union in nature nobody joins the voice of a sheep with the shape of a horse nor the colour of lead with the weight and fixedness of gold to be the complex ideas of any real substances unless he has a mind to fill his head with chimeras and his discourse with unintelligible words men observing certain qualities always joined and existing together therein copied nature and of ideas so united made their complex ones of substances for though men may make what complex ideas they please and give what names to them they will yet if they will be understood when they speak of things really existing they must in some degree conform their ideas to the things they would speak of or else mens language will be like that of babel and every mans words being intelligible only to himself would no longer serve to conversation and the ordinary affairs of life if the ideas they stand for be not some way answering the common appearances and agreement of substances as they really exist      our nominal essences of substances usually consist of a few obvious qualities observed in things  secondly though the mind of man in making its complex ideas of substances never puts any together that do not really or are not supposed to coexist and so it truly borrows that union from nature yet the number it combines depends upon the various care industry or fancy of him that makes it men generally content themselves with some few sensible obvious qualities and often if not always leave out others as material and as firmly united as those that they take of sensible substances there are two sorts one of organized bodies which are propagated by seed and in these the shape is that which to us is the leading quality and most characteristical part that determines the species and therefore in vegetables and animals an extended solid substance of such a certain figure usually serves the turn for however some men seem to prize their definition of animal rationale yet should there a creature be found that had language and reason but partaked not of the usual shape of a man i believe it would hardly pass for a man how much soever it were animal rationale and if balaams ass had all his life discoursed as rationally as he did once with his master i doubt yet whether any one would have thought him worthy the name man or allowed him to be of the same species with himself as in vegetables and animals it is the shape so in most other bodies not propagated by seed it is the colour we most fix on and are most led by thus where we find the colour of gold we are apt to imagine all the other qualities comprehended in our complex idea to be there also and we commonly take these two obvious qualities viz shape and colour for so presumptive ideas of several species that in a good picture we readily say this is a lion and that a rose this is a gold and that a silver goblet only by the different figures and colours represented to the eye by the pencil    0 yet imperfect as they thus are they serve for common converse  but though this serves well enough for gross and confused conceptions and inaccurate ways of talking and thinking yet men are far enough from having agreed on the precise number of simple ideas or qualities belonging to any sort of things signified by its name nor is it a wonder since it requires much time pains and skill strict inquiry and long examination to find out what and how many those simple ideas are which are constantly and inseparably united in nature and are always to be found together in the same subject most men wanting either time inclination or industry enough for this even to some tolerable degree content themselves with some few obvious and outward appearances of things thereby readily to distinguish and sort them for the common affairs of life and so without further examination give them names or take up the names already in use which though in common conversation they pass well enough for the signs of some few obvious qualities coexisting are yet far enough from comprehending in a settled signification a precise number of simple ideas much less all those which are united in nature he that shall consider after so much stir about genus and species and such a deal of talk of specific differences how few words we have yet settled definitions of may with reason imagine that those forms which there hath been so much noise made about are only chimeras which give us no light into the specific natures of things and he that shall consider how far the names of substances are from having significations wherein all who use them do agree will have reason to conclude that though the nominal essences of substances are all supposed to be copied from nature yet they are all or most of them very imperfect since the composition of those complex ideas are in several men very different and therefore that these boundaries of species are as men and not as nature makes them if at least there are in nature any such prefixed bounds it is true that many particular substances are so made by nature that they have agreement and likeness one with another and so afford a foundation of being ranked into sorts but the sorting of things by us or the making of determinate species being in order to naming and comprehending them under general terms i cannot see how it can be properly said that nature sets the boundaries of the species of things or if it be so our boundaries of species are not exactly conformable to those in nature for we having need of general names for present use stay not for a perfect discovery of all those qualities which would best show us their most material differences and agreements but we ourselves divide them by certain obvious appearances into species that we may the easier under general names communicate our thoughts about them for having no other knowledge of any substance but of the simple ideas that are united in it and observing several particular things to agree with others in several of those simple ideas we make that collection our specific idea and give it a general name that in recording our thoughts and in our discourse with others we may in one short word designate all the individuals that agree in that complex idea without enumerating the simple ideas that make it up and so not waste our time and breath in tedious descriptions which we see they are fain to do who would discourse of any new sort of things they have not yet a name for      essences of species under the same name very different in different minds  but however these species of substances pass well enough in ordinary conversation it is plain that this complex idea wherein they observe several individuals to agree is by different men made very differently by some more and others less accurately in some this complex idea contains a greater and in others a smaller number of qualities and so is apparently such as the mind makes it the yellow shining colour makes gold to children others add weight malleableness and fusibility and others yet other qualities which they find joined with that yellow colour as constantly as its weight and fusibility for in all these and the like qualities one has as good a right to be put into the complex idea of that substance wherein they are all joined as another and therefore different men leaving out or putting in several simple ideas which others do not according to their various examination skill or observation of that subject have different essences of gold which must therefore be of their own and not of natures making      the more general our ideas of substances are the more incomplete and partial they are  if the number of simple ideas that make the nominal essence of the lowest species or first sorting of individuals depends on the mind of man variously collecting them it is much more evident that they do so in the more comprehensive classes which by the masters of logic are called genera these are complex ideas designedly imperfect and it is visible at first sight that several of those qualities that are to be found in the things themselves are purposely left out of generical ideas for as the mind to make general ideas comprehending several particulars leaves out those of time and place and such other that make them incommunicable to more than one individual so to make other yet more general ideas that may comprehend different sorts it leaves out those qualities that distinguish them and puts into its new collection only such ideas as are common to several sorts the same convenience that made men express several parcels of yellow matter coming from guinea and peru under one name sets them also upon making of one name that may comprehend both gold and silver and some other bodies of different sorts this is done by leaving out those qualities which are peculiar to each sort and retaining a complex idea made up of those that are common to them all to which the name metal being annexed there is a genus constituted the essence whereof being that abstract idea containing only malleableness and fusibility with certain degrees of weight and fixedness wherein some bodies of several kinds agree leaves out the colour and other qualities peculiar to gold and silver and the other sorts comprehended under the name metal whereby it is plain that men follow not exactly the patterns set them by nature when they make their general ideas of substances since there is no body to be found which has barely malleableness and fusibility in it without other qualities as inseparable as those but men in making their general ideas seeking more the convenience of language and quick dispatch by short and comprehensive signs than the true and precise nature of things as they exist have in the framing their abstract ideas chiefly pursued that end which was to be furnished with store of general and variously comprehensive names so that in this whole business of genera and species the genus or more comprehensive is but a partial conception of what is in the species and the species but a partial idea of what is to be found in each individual if therefore any one will think that a man and a horse and an animal and a plant c are distinguished by real essences made by nature he must think nature to be very liberal of these real essences making one for body another for an animal and another for a horse and all these essences liberally bestowed upon bucephalus but if we would rightly consider what is done in all these genera and species or sorts we should find that there is no new thing made but only more or less comprehensive signs whereby we may be enabled to express in a few syllables great numbers of particular things as they agree in more or less general conceptions which we have framed to that purpose in all which we may observe that the more general term is always the name of a less complex idea and that each genus is but a partial conception of the species comprehended under it so that if these abstract general ideas be thought to be complete it can only be in respect of a certain established relation between them and certain names which are made use of to signify them and not in respect of anything existing as made by nature      this all accommodated to the end of the speech  this is adjusted to the true end of speech which is to be the easiest and shortest way of communicating our notions for thus he that would discourse of things as they agreed in the complex idea of extension and solidity needed but use the word body to denote all such he that to these would join others signified by the words life sense and spontaneous motion needed but use the word animal to signify all which partaked of those ideas and he that had made a complex idea of a body with life sense and motion with the faculty of reasoning and a certain shape joined to it needed but use the short monosyllable man to express all particulars that correspond to that complex idea this is the proper business of genus and species and this men do without any consideration of real essences or substantial forms which come not within the reach of our knowledge when we think of those things nor within the signification of our words when we discourse with others      instance in cassowaries  were i to talk with any one of a sort of birds i lately saw in st jamess park about three or four feet high with a covering of something between feathers and hair of a dark brown colour without wings but in the place thereof two or three little branches coming down like sprigs of spanish broom long great legs with feet only of three claws and without a tail i must make this description of it and so may make others understand me but when i am told that the name of it is cassuaris i may then use that word to stand in discourse for all my complex idea mentioned in that description though by that word which is now become a specific name i know no more of the real essence or constitution of that sort of animals than i did before and knew probably as much of the nature of that species of birds before i learned the name as many englishmen do of swans or herons which are specific names very well known of sorts of birds common in england      men determine the sorts of substances which may be sorted variously  from what has been said it is evident that men make sorts of things for it being different essences alone that make different species it is plain that they who make those abstract ideas which are the nominal essences do thereby make the species or sort should there be a body found having all the other qualities of gold except malleableness it would no doubt be made a question whether it were gold or not ie whether it were of that species this could be determined only by that abstract idea to which every one annexed the name gold so that it would be true gold to him and belong to that species who included not malleableness in his nominal essence signified by the sound gold and on the other side it would not be true gold or of that species to him who included malleableness in his specific idea and who i pray is it that makes these diverse species even under one and the same name but men that make two different abstract ideas consisting not exactly of the same collection of qualities nor is it a mere supposition to imagine that a body may exist wherein the other obvious qualities of gold may be without malleableness since it is certain that gold itself will be sometimes so eager as artists call it that it will as little endure the hammer as glass itself what we have said of the putting in or leaving out of malleableness in the complex idea the name gold is by any one annexed to may be said of its peculiar weight fixedness and several other the like qualities for whatever is left out or put in it is still the complex idea to which that name is annexed that makes the species and as any particular parcel of matter answers that idea so the name of the sort belongs truly to it and it is of that species and thus anything is true gold perfect metal all which determination of the species it is plain depends on the understanding of man making this or that complex idea      nature makes the similitudes of substances  this then in short is the case nature makes many particular things which do agree one with another in many sensible qualities and probably too in their internal frame and constitution but it is not this real essence that distinguishes them into species it is men who taking occasion from the qualities they find united in them and wherein they observe often several individuals to agree range them into sorts in order to their naming for the convenience of comprehensive signs under which individuals according to their conformity to this or that abstract idea come to be ranked as under ensigns so that this is of the blue that the red regiment this is a man that a drill and in this i think consists the whole business of genus and species      the manner of sorting particular beings the work of fallible men though nature makes things alike  i do not deny but nature in the constant production of particular beings makes them not always new and various but very much alike and of kin one to another but i think it nevertheless true that the boundaries of the species whereby men sort them are made by men since the essences of the species distinguished by different names are as has been proved of mans making and seldom adequate to the internal nature of the things they are taken from so that we may truly say such a manner of sorting of things is the workmanship of men      each abstract idea with a name to it makes a nominal essence  one thing i doubt not but will seem very strange in this doctrine which is that from what has been said it will follow that each abstract idea with a name to it makes a distinct species but who can help it if truth will have it so for so it must remain till somebody can show us the species of things limited and distinguished by something else and let us see that general terms signify not our abstract ideas but something different from them i would fain know why a shock and a hound are not as distinct species as a spaniel and an elephant we have no other idea of the different essence of an elephant and a spaniel than we have of the different essence of a shock and a hound all the essential difference whereby we know and distinguish them one from another consisting only in the different collection of simple ideas to which we have given those different names      how genera and species are related to naming  how much the making of species and genera is in order to general names and how much general names are necessary if not to the being yet at least to the completing of a species and making it pass for such will appear besides what has been said above concerning ice and water in a very familiar example a silent and a striking watch are but one species to those who have but one name for them but he that has the name watch for one and clock for the other and distinct complex ideas to which those names belong to him they are different species it will be said perhaps that the inward contrivance and constitution is different between these two which the watchmaker has a clear idea of and yet it is plain they are but one species to him when he has but one name for them for what is sufficient in the inward contrivance to make a new species there are some watches that are made with four wheels others with five is this a specific difference to the workman some have strings and physics and others none some have the balance loose and others regulated by a spiral spring and others by hogs bristles are any or all of these enough to make a specific difference to the workman that knows each of these and several other different contrivances in the internal constitutions of watches it is certain each of these hath a real difference from the rest but whether it be an essential a specific difference or no relates only to the complex idea to which the name watch is given as long as they all agree in the idea which that name stands for and that name does not as a generical name comprehend different species under it they are not essentially nor specifically different but if any one will make minuter divisions from differences that he knows in the internal frame of watches and to such precise complex ideas give names that shall prevail they will then be new species to them who have those ideas with names to them and can by those differences distinguish watches into these several sorts and then watch will be a generical name but yet they would be no distinct species to men ignorant of clockwork and the inward contrivances of watches who had no other idea but the outward shape and bulk with the marking of the hours by the hand for to them all those other names would be but synonymous terms for the same idea and signify no more nor no other thing but a watch just thus i think it is in natural things nobody will doubt that the wheels or springs if i may so say within are different in a rational man and a changeling no more than that there is a difference in the frame between a drill and a changeling but whether one or both these differences be essential or specifical is only to be known to us by their agreement or disagreement with the complex idea that the name man stands for for by that alone can it be determined whether one or both or neither of those be a man    0 species of artificial things less confused than natural  from what has been before said we may see the reason why in the species of artificial things there is generally less confusion and uncertainty than in natural because an artificial thing being a production of man which the artificer designed and therefore well knows the idea of the name of it is supposed to stand for no other idea nor to import any other essence than what is certainly to be known and easy enough to be apprehended for the idea or essence of the several sorts of artificial things consisting for the most part in nothing but the determinate figure of sensible parts and sometimes motion depending thereon which the artificer fashions in matter such as he finds for his turn it is not beyond the reach of our faculties to attain a certain idea thereof and so settle the signification of the names whereby the species of artificial things are distinguished with less doubt obscurity and equivocation than we can in things natural whose differences and operations depend upon contrivances beyond the reach of our discoveries      artificial things of distinct species  i must be excused here if i think artificial things are of distinct species as well as natural since i find they are as plainly and orderly ranked into sorts by different abstract ideas with general names annexed to them as distinct one from another as those of natural substances for why should we not think a watch and pistol as distinct species one from another as a horse and a dog they being expressed in our minds by distinct ideas and to others by distinct appellations      substances alone of all our several sorts of ideas have proper names  this is further to be observed concerning substances that they alone of all our several sorts of ideas have particular or proper names whereby one only particular thing is signified because in simple ideas modes and relations it seldom happens that men have occasion to mention often this or that particular when it is absent besides the greatest part of mixed modes being actions which perish in their birth are not capable of a lasting duration as substances which are the actors and wherein the simple ideas that make up the complex ideas designed by the name have a lasting union      difficult to lead another by words into the thoughts of things stripped of those abstract ideas we give them  i must beg pardon of my reader for having dwelt so long upon this subject and perhaps with some obscurity but i desire it may be considered how difficult it is to lead another by words into the thoughts of things stripped of those specifical differences we give them which things if i name not i say nothing and if i do name them i thereby rank them into some sort or other and suggest to the mind the usual abstract idea of that species and so cross my purpose for to talk of a man and to lay by at the same time the ordinary signification of the name man which is our complex idea usually annexed to it and bid the reader consider man as he is in himself and as he is really distinguished from others in his internal constitution or real essence that is by something he knows not what looks like trifling and yet thus one must do who would speak of the supposed real essences and species of things as thought to be made by nature if it be but only to make it understood that there is no such thing signified by the general names which substances are called by but because it is difficult by known familiar names to do this give me leave to endeavour by an example to make the different consideration the mind has of specific names and ideas a little more clear and to show how the complex ideas of modes are referred sometimes to archetypes in the minds of other intelligent beings or which is the same to the signification annexed by others to their received names and sometimes to no archetypes at all give me leave also to show how the mind always refers its ideas of substances either to the substances themselves or to the signification of their names as to the archetypes and also to make plain the nature of species or sorting of things as apprehended and made use of by us and of the essences belonging to those species which is perhaps of more moment to discover the extent and certainty of our knowledge than we at first imagine      instances of mixed modes names kinneah and niouph  let us suppose adam in the state of a grown man with a good understanding but in a strange country with all things new and unknown about him and no other faculties to attain the knowledge of them but what one of this age has now he observes lamech more melancholy than usual and imagines it to be from a suspicion he has of his wife adah whom he most ardently loved that she had too much kindness for another man adam discourses these his thoughts to eve and desires her to take care that adah commit not folly and in these discourses with eve he makes use of these two new words kinneah and niouph in time adams mistake appears for he finds lamechs trouble proceeded from having killed a man but yet the two names kinneah and niouph the one standing for suspicion in a husband of his wifes disloyalty to him and the other for the act of committing disloyalty lost not their distinct significations it is plain then that here were two distinct complex ideas of mixed modes with names to them two distinct species of actions essentially different i ask wherein consisted the essences of these two distinct species of actions and it is plain it consisted in a precise combination of simple ideas different in one from the other i ask whether the complex idea in adams mind which he called kinneah were adequate or not and it is plain it was for it being a combination of simple ideas which he without any regard to any archetype without respect to anything as a pattern voluntarily put together abstracted and gave the name kinneah to to express in short to others by that one sound all the simple ideas contained and united in that complex one it must necessarily follow that it was an adequate idea his own choice having made that combination it had all in it he intended it should and so could not but be perfect could not but be adequate it being referred to no other archetype which it was supposed to represent      these words kinneah and niouph by degrees grew into common use and then the case was somewhat altered adams children had the same faculties and thereby the same power that he had to make what complex ideas of mixed modes they pleased in their own minds to abstract them and make what sounds they pleased the signs of them but the use of names being to make our ideas within us known to others that cannot be done but when the same sign stands for the same idea in two who would communicate their thoughts and discourse together those therefore of adams children that found these two words kinneah and niouph in familiar use could not take them for insignificant sounds but must needs conclude they stood for something for certain ideas abstract ideas they being general names which abstract ideas were the essences of the species distinguished by those names if therefore they would use these words as names of species already established and agreed on they were obliged to conform the ideas in their minds signified by these names to the ideas that they stood for in other mens minds as to their patterns and archetypes and then indeed their ideas of these complex modes were liable to be inadequate as being very apt especially those that consisted of combinations of many simple ideas not to be exactly conformable to the ideas in other mens minds using the same names though for this there be usually a remedy at hand which is to ask the meaning of any word we understand not of him that uses it it being as impossible to know certainly what the words jealousy and adultery which i think answer hebrew and hebrew stand for in another mans mind with whom i would discourse about them as it was impossible in the beginning of language to know what kinneah and niouph stood for in another mans mind without explication they being voluntary signs in every one      instances of a species of substance named zahab  let us now also consider after the same manner the names of substances in their first application one of adams children roving in the mountains lights on a glittering substance which pleases his eye home he carries it to adam who upon consideration of it finds it to be hard to have a bright yellow colour and an exceeding great weight these perhaps at first are all the qualities he takes notice of in it and abstracting this complex idea consisting of a substance having that peculiar bright yellowness and a weight very great in proportion to its bulk he gives the name zahab to denominate and mark all substances that have these sensible qualities in them it is evident now that in this case adam acts quite differently from what he did before in forming those ideas of mixed modes to which he gave the names kinneah and niouph for there he put ideas together only by his own imagination not taken from the existence of anything and to them he gave names to denominate all things that should happen to agree to those his abstract ideas without considering whether any such thing did exist or not the standard there was of his own making but in the forming his idea of this new substance he takes the quite contrary course here he has a standard made by nature and therefore being to represent that to himself by the idea he has of it even when it is absent he puts in no simple idea into his complex one but what he has the perception of from the thing itself he takes care that his idea be conformable to this archetype and intends the name should stand for an idea so conformable       this piece of matter thus denominated zahab by adam being quite different from any he had seen before nobody i think will deny to be a distinct species and to have its peculiar essence and that the name zahab is the mark of the species and a name belonging to all things partaking in that essence but here it is plain the essence adam made the name zahab stand for was nothing but a body hard shining yellow and very heavy but the inquisitive mind of man not content with the knowledge of these as i may say superficial qualities puts adam upon further examination of this matter he therefore knocks and beats it with flints to see what was discoverable in the inside he finds it yield to blows but not easily separate into pieces he finds it will bend without breaking is not now ductility to be added to his former idea and made part of the essence of the species that name zahab stands for further trials discover fusibility and fixedness are not they also by the same reason that any of the others were to be put into the complex idea signified by the name zahab if not what reason will there be shown more for the one than the other if these must then all the other properties which any further trials shall discover in this matter ought by the same reason to make a part of the ingredients of the complex idea which the name zahab stands for and so be the essence of the species marked by that name which properties because they are endless it is plain that the idea made after this fashion by this archetype will be always inadequate      the abstract ideas of substances always imperfect and therefore various  but this is not all it would also follow that the names of substances would not only have as in truth they have but would also be supposed to have different significations as used by different men which would very much cumber the use of language for if every distinct quality that were discovered in any matter by any one were supposed to make a necessary part of the complex idea signified by the common name given to it it must follow that men must suppose the same word to signify different things in different men since they cannot doubt but different men may have discovered several qualities in substances of the same denomination which others know nothing of      therefore to fix the nominal species real essence supposed  to avoid this therefore they have supposed a real essence belonging to every species from which these properties all flow and would have their name of the species stand for that but they not having any idea of that real essence in substances and their words signifying nothing but the ideas they have that which is done by this attempt is only to put the name or sound in the place and stead of the thing having that real essence without knowing what the real essence is and this is that which men do when they speak of species of things as supposing them made by nature and distinguished by real essences    0 which supposition is of no use  for let us consider when we affirm that all gold is fixed either it means that fixedness is a part of the definition i e part of the nominal essence the word gold stands for and so this affirmation all gold is fixed contains nothing but the signification of the term gold or else it means that fixedness not being a part of the definition of the gold is a property of that substance itself in which case it is plain that the word gold stands in the place of a substance having the real essence of a species of things made by nature in which way of substitution it has so confused and uncertain a signification that though this propositiongold is fixedbe in that sense an affirmation of something real yet it is a truth will always fail us in its particular application and so is of no real use or certainty for let it be ever so true that all gold i e all that has the real essence of gold is fixed what serves this for whilst we know not in this sense what is or is not gold for if we know not the real essence of gold it is impossible we should know what parcel of matter has that essence and so whether it be true gold or no      conclusion  to conclude what liberty adam had at first to make any complex ideas of mixed modes by no other pattern but by his own thoughts the same have all men ever since had and the same necessity of conforming his ideas of substances to things without him as to archetypes made by nature that adam was under if he would not wilfully impose upon himself the same are all men ever since under too the same liberty also that adam had of affixing any new name to any idea the same has any one still especially the beginners of languages if we can imagine any such but only with this difference that in places where men in society have already established a language amongst them the significations of words are very warily and sparingly to be altered because men being furnished already with names for their ideas and common use having appropriated known names to certain ideas an affected misapplication of them cannot but be very ridiculous he that hath new notions will perhaps venture sometimes on the coining of new terms to express them but men think it a boldness and it is uncertain whether common use will ever make them pass for current but in communication with others it is necessary that we conform the ideas we make the vulgar words of any language stand for to their known proper significations which i have explained at large already or else to make known that new signification we apply them to     chapter vii  of particles     particles connect parts or whole sentences together  besides words which are names of ideas in the mind there are a great many others that are made use of to signify the connexion that the mind gives to ideas or to propositions one with another the mind in communicating its thoughts to others does not only need signs of the ideas it has then before it but others also to show or intimate some particular action of its own at that time relating to those ideas this it does several ways as is and is not are the general marks of the mind affirming or denying but besides affirmation or negation without which there is in words no truth or falsehood the mind does in declaring its sentiments to others connect not only the parts of propositions but whole sentences one to another with their several relations and dependencies to make a coherent discourse     in right use of particles consists the art of wellspeaking  the words whereby it signifies what connexion it gives to the several affirmations and negations that it unites in one continued reasoning or narration are generally called particles and it is in the right use of these that more particularly consists the clearness and beauty of a good style to think well it is not enough that a man has ideas clear and distinct in his thoughts nor that he observes the agreement or disagreement of some of them but he must think in train and observe the dependence of his thoughts and reasonings upon one another and to express well such methodical and rational thoughts he must have words to show what connexion restriction distinction opposition emphasis c he gives to each respective part of his discourse to mistake in any of these is to puzzle instead of informing his hearer and therefore it is that those words which are not truly by themselves the names of any ideas are of such constant and indispensable use in language and do much contribute to mens well expressing themselves     they say what relation the mind gives to its own thoughts  this part of grammar has been perhaps as much neglected as some others overdiligently cultivated it is easy for men to write one after another of cases and genders moods and tenses gerunds and supines in these and the like there has been great diligence used and particles themselves in some languages have been with great show of exactness ranked into their several orders but though prepositions and conjunctions c are names well known in grammar and the particles contained under them carefully ranked into their distinct subdivisions yet he who would show the right use of particles and what significancy and force they have must take a little more pains enter into his own thoughts and observe nicely the several postures of his mind in discoursing     they are all marks of some action or intimation of the mind  neither is it enough for the explaining of these words to render them as is usual in dictionaries by words of another tongue which come nearest to their signification for what is meant by them is commonly as hard to be understood in one as another language they are all marks of some action or intimation of the mind and therefore to understand them rightly the several views postures stands turns limitations and exceptions and several other thoughts of the mind for which we have either none or very deficient names are diligently to be studied of these there is a great variety much exceeding the number of particles that most languages have to express them by and therefore it is not to be wondered that most of these particles have divers and sometimes almost opposite significations in the hebrew tongue there is a particle consisting of but one single letter of which there are reckoned up as i remember seventy i am sure above fifty several significations     instance in but  but is a particle none more familiar in our language and he that says it is a discretive conjunction and that it answers to sed latin or mais in french thinks he has sufficiently explained it but yet it seems to me to intimate several relations the mind gives to the several propositions or parts of them which it joins by this monosyllable  first but to say no more here it intimates a stop of the mind in the course it was going before it came quite to the end of it  secondly i saw but two plants here it shows that the mind limits the sense to what is expressed with a negation of all other  thirdlyyou pray but it is not that god would bring you to the true religion  fourthly but that he would confirm you in your own the first of these buts intimates a supposition in the mind of something otherwise than it should be the latter shows that the mind makes a direct opposition between that and what goes before it  fifthly all animals have sense but a dog is an animal here it signifies little more but that the latter proposition is joined to the former as the minor of a syllogism     this matter of the use of particles but lightly touched here  to these i doubt not might be added a great many other significations of this particle if it were my business to examine it in its full latitude and consider it in all the places it is to be found which if one should do i doubt whether in all those manners it is made use of it would deserve the title of discretive which grammarians give to it but i intend not here a full explication of this sort of signs the instances i have given in this one may give occasion to reflect on their use and force in language and lead us into the contemplation of several actions of our minds in discoursing which it has found a way to intimate to others by these particles some whereof constantly and others in certain constructions have the sense of a whole sentence contained in them     chapter viii  of abstract and concrete terms      abstract terms predicated one on another and why  the ordinary words of language and our common use of them would have given us light into the nature of our ideas if they had been but considered with attention the mind as has been shown has a power to abstract its ideas and so they become essences general essences whereby the sorts of things are distinguished now each abstract idea being distinct so that of any two the one can never be the other the mind will by its intuitive knowledge perceive their difference and therefore in propositions no two whole ideas can ever be affirmed one of another this we see in the common use of language which permits not any two abstract words or names of abstract ideas to be affirmed one of another for how near of kin soever they may seem to be and how certain soever it is that man is an animal or rational or white yet every one at first hearing perceives the falsehood of these propositions humanity is animality or rationality or whiteness and this is as evident as any of the most allowed maxims all our affirmations then are only in concrete which is the affirming not one abstract idea to be another but one abstract idea to be joined to another which abstract ideas in substances may be of any sort in all the rest are little else but of relations and in substances the most frequent are of powers vg a man is white signifies that the thing that has the essence of a man has also in it the essence of whiteness which is nothing but a power to produce the idea of whiteness in one whose eyes can discover ordinary objects or a man is rational signifies that the same thing that hath the essence of a man hath also in it the essence of rationality ie a power of reasoning     they show the difference of our ideas  this distinction of names shows us also the difference of our ideas for if we observe them we shall find that our simple ideas have all abstract as well as concrete names the one whereof is to speak the language of grammarians a substantive the other an adjective as whiteness white sweetness sweet the like also holds in our ideas of modes and relations as justice just equality equal only with this difference that some of the concrete names of relations amongst men chiefly are substantives as paternitas pater whereof it were easy to render a reason but as to our ideas of substances we have very few or no abstract names at all for though the schools have introduced animalitas humanitas corporietas and some others yet they hold no proportion with that infinite number of names of substances to which they never were ridiculous enough to attempt the coining of abstract ones and those few that the schools forged and put into the mouths of their scholars could never yet get admittance into common use or obtain the license of public approbation which seems to me at least to intimate the confession of all mankind that they have no ideas of the real essences of substances since they have not names for such ideas which no doubt they would have had had not their consciousness to themselves of their ignorance of them kept them from so idle an attempt and therefore though they had ideas enough to distinguish gold from a stone and metal from wood yet they but timorously ventured on such terms as aurietas and saxietas metallietas and lignietas or the like names which should pretend to signify the real essences of those substances whereof they knew they had no ideas and indeed it was only the doctrine of substantial forms and the confidence of mistaken pretenders to a knowledge that they had not which first coined and then introduced animalitas and humanitas and the like which yet went very little further than their own schools and could never get to be current amongst understanding men indeed humanitas was a word in familiar use amongst the romans but in a far different sense and stood not for the abstract essence of any substance but was the abstracted name of a mode and its concrete humanus not homo     chapter ix  of the imperfection of words     words are used for recording and communicating our thoughts  from what has been said in the foregoing chapters it is easy to perceive what imperfection there is in language and how the very nature of words makes it almost unavoidable for many of them to be doubtful and uncertain in their significations to examine the perfection or imperfection of words it is necessary first to consider their use and end for as they are more or less fitted to attain that so they are more or less perfect we have in the former part of this discourse often upon occasion mentioned a double use of words  first one for the recording of our own thoughts  secondly the other for the communicating of our thoughts to others     any words will serve for recording  as to the first of these for the recording our own thoughts for the help of our own memories whereby as it were we talk to ourselves any words will serve the turn for since sounds are voluntary and indifferent signs of any ideas a man may use what words he pleases to signify his own ideas to himself and there will be no imperfection in them if he constantly use the same sign for the same idea for then he cannot fail of having his meaning understood wherein consists the right use and perfection of language     communication by words either for civil or philosophical purposes  secondly as to communication by words that too has a double use  i civil  ii philosophical first by their civil use i mean such a communication of thoughts and ideas by words as may serve for the upholding common conversation and commerce about the ordinary affairs and conveniences of civil life in the societies of men one amongst another  secondly by the philosophical use of words i mean such a use of them as may serve to convey the precise notions of things and to express in general propositions certain and undoubted truths which the mind may rest upon and be satisfied with in its search after true knowledge these two uses are very distinct and a great deal less exactness will serve in the one than in the other as we shall see in what follows     the imperfection of words is the doubtfulness or ambiguity of their signification which is caused by the sort of ideas they stand for  the chief end of language in communication being to be understood words serve not well for that end neither in civil nor philosophical discourse when any word does not excite in the hearer the same idea which it stands for in the mind of the speaker now since sounds have no natural connexion with our ideas but have all their signification from the arbitrary imposition of men the doubtfulness and uncertainty of their signification which is the imperfection we here are speaking of has its cause more in the ideas they stand for than in any incapacity there is in one sound more than in another to signify any idea for in that regard they are all equally perfect  that then which makes doubtfulness and uncertainty in the signification of some more than other words is the difference of ideas they stand for     natural causes of their imperfection especially in those that stand for mixed modes and for our ideas of substances  words having naturally no signification the idea which each stands for must be learned and retained by those who would exchange thoughts and hold intelligible discourse with others in any language but this is the hardest to be done where  first the ideas they stand for are very complex and made up of a great number of ideas put together  secondly where the ideas they stand for have no certain connexion in nature and so no settled standard anywhere in nature existing to rectify and adjust them by  thirdly when the signification of the word is referred to a standard which standard is not easy to be known  fourthly where the signification of the word and the real essence of the thing are not exactly the same  these are difficulties that attend the signification of several words that are intelligible those which are not intelligible at all such as names standing for any simple ideas which another has not organs or faculties to attain as the names of colours to a blind man or sounds to a deaf man need not here be mentioned  in all these cases we shall find an imperfection in words which i shall more at large explain in their particular application to our several sorts of ideas for if we examine them we shall find that the names of mixed modes are most liable to doubtfulness and imperfection for the two first of these reasons and the names of substances chiefly for the two latter     the names of mixed modes doubtful  first the names of mixed modes are many of them liable to great uncertainty and obscurity in their signification  i because the ideas they stand for are so complex  because of that great composition these complex ideas are often made up of to make words serviceable to the end of communication it is necessary as has been said that they excite in the hearer exactly the same idea they stand for in the mind of the speaker without this men fill one anothers heads with noise and sounds but convey not thereby their thoughts and lay not before one another their ideas which is the end of discourse and language but when a word stands for a very complex idea that is compounded and decompounded it is not easy for men to form and retain that idea so exactly as to make the name in common use stand for the same precise idea without any the least variation hence it comes to pass that mens names of very compound ideas such as for the most part are moral words have seldom in two different men the same precise signification since one mans complex idea seldom agrees with anothers and often differs from his ownfrom that which he had yesterday or will have tomorrow     secondly because they have no standards in nature  because the names of mixed modes for the most part want standards in nature whereby men may rectify and adjust their significations therefore they are very various and doubtful they are assemblages of ideas put together at the pleasure of the mind pursuing its own ends of discourse and suited to its own notions whereby it designs not to copy anything really existing but to denominate and rank things as they come to agree with those archetypes or forms it has made he that first brought the word sham or wheedle or banter in use put together as he thought fit those ideas he made it stand for and as it is with any new names of modes that are now brought into any language so it was with the old ones when they were first made use of names therefore that stand for collections of ideas which the mind makes at pleasure must needs be of doubtful signification when such collections are nowhere to be found constantly united in nature nor any patterns to be shown whereby men may adjust them what the word murder or sacrilege c signifies can never be known from things themselves there be many of the parts of those complex ideas which are not visible in the action itself the intention of the mind or the relation of holy things which make a part of murder or sacrilege have no necessary connexion with the outward and visible action of him that commits either and the pulling the trigger of the gun with which the murder is committed and is all the action that perhaps is visible has no natural connexion with those other ideas that make up the complex one named murder they have their union and combination only from the understanding which unites them under one name but uniting them without any rule or pattern it cannot be but that the signification of the name that stands for such voluntary collections should be often various in the minds of different men who have scarce any standing rule to regulate themselves and their notions by in such arbitrary ideas     common use or propriety not a sufficient remedy  it is true common use that is the rule of propriety may be supposed here to afford some aid to settle the signification of language and it cannot be denied but that in some measure it does common use regulates the meaning of words pretty well for common conversation but nobody having an authority to establish the precise signification of words nor determine to what ideas any one shall annex them common use is not sufficient to adjust them to philosophical discourses there being scarce any name of any very complex idea to say nothing of others which in common use has not a great latitude and which keeping within the bounds of propriety may not be made the sign of far different ideas besides the rule and measure of propriety itself being nowhere established it is often matter of dispute whether this or that way of using a word be propriety of speech or no from all which it is evident that the names of such kind of very complex ideas are naturally liable to this imperfection to be of doubtful and uncertain signification and even in men that have a mind to understand one another do not always stand for the same idea in speaker and hearer though the names glory and gratitude be the same in every mans mouth through a whole country yet the complex collective idea which every one thinks on or intends by that name is apparently very different in men using the same language     the way of learning these names contributes also to their doubtfulness  the way also wherein the names of mixed modes are ordinarily learned does not a little contribute to the doubtfulness of their signification for if we will observe how children learn languages we shall find that to make them understand what the names of simple ideas or substances stand for people ordinarily show them the thing whereof they would have them have the idea and then repeat to them the name that stands for it as white sweet milk sugar cat dog but as for mixed modes especially the most material of them moral words the sounds are usually learned first and then to know what complex ideas they stand for they are either beholden to the explication of others or which happens for the most part are left to their own observation and industry which being little laid out in the search of the true and precise meaning of names these moral words are in most mens mouths little more than bare sounds or when they have any it is for the most part but a very loose and undetermined and consequently obscure and confused signification and even those themselves who have with more attention settled their notions do yet hardly avoid the inconvenience to have them stand for complex ideas different from those which other even intelligent and studious men make them the signs of where shall one find any either controversial debate or familiar discourse concerning honour faith grace religion church c wherein it is not easy to observe the different notions men have of them which is nothing but this that they are not agreed in the signification of those words nor have in their minds the same complex ideas which they make them stand for and so all the contests that follow thereupon are only about the meaning of a sound and hence we see that in the interpretation of laws whether divine or human there is no end comments beget comments and explications make new matter for explications and of limiting distinguishing varying the signification of these moral words there is no end these ideas of mens making are by men still having the same power multiplied in infinitum many a man who was pretty well satisfied of the meaning of a text of scripture or clause in the code at first reading has by consulting commentators quite lost the sense of it and by these elucidations given rise or increase to his doubts and drawn obscurity upon the place i say not this that i think commentaries needless but to show how uncertain the names of mixed modes naturally are even in the mouths of those who had both the intention and the faculty of speaking as clearly as language was capable to express their thoughts    0 hence unavoidable obscurity in ancient authors  what obscurity this has unavoidably brought upon the writings of men who have lived in remote ages and different countries it will be needless to take notice since the numerous volumes of learned men employing their thoughts that way are proofs more than enough to show what attention study sagacity and reasoning are required to find out the true meaning of ancient authors but there being no writings we have any great concernment to be very solicitous about the meaning of but those that contain either truths we are required to believe or laws we are to obey and draw inconveniences on us when we mistake or transgress we may be less anxious about the sense of other authors who writing but their own opinions we are under no greater necessity to know them than they to know ours our good or evil depending not on their decrees we may safely be ignorant of their notions and therefore in the reading of them if they do not use their words with a due clearness and perspicuity we may lay them aside and without any injury done them resolve thus with ourselves  si non vis intelligi debes negligi      names of substances of doubtful signification because the ideas they stand for relate to the reality of things  if the signification of the names of mixed modes be uncertain because there be no real standards existing in nature to which those ideas are referred and by which they may be adjusted the names of substances are of a doubtful signification for a contrary reason viz because the ideas they stand for are supposed conformable to the reality of things and are referred to as standards made by nature in our ideas of substances we have not the liberty as in mixed modes to frame what combinations we think fit to be the characteristical notes to rank and denominate things by in these we must follow nature suit our complex ideas to real existences and regulate the signification of their names by the things themselves if we will have our names to be signs of them and stand for them here it is true we have patterns to follow but patterns that will make the signification of their names very uncertain for names must be of a very unsteady and various meaning if the ideas they stand for be referred to standards without us that either cannot be known at all or can be known but imperfectly and uncertainly      names of substances referred i to real essences that cannot be known  the names of substances have as has been shown a double reference in their ordinary use  first sometimes they are made to stand for and so their signification is supposed to agree to the real constitution of things from which all their properties flow and in which they all centre but this real constitution or as it is apt to be called essence being utterly unknown to us any sound that is put to stand for it must be very uncertain in its application and it will be impossible to know what things are or ought to be called a horse or antimony when those words are put for real essences that we have no ideas of at all and therefore in this supposition the names of substances being referred to standards that cannot be known their significations can never be adjusted and established by those standards      secondly to coexisting qualities which are known but imperfectly  secondly the simple ideas that are found to coexist in substances being that which their names immediately signify these as united in the several sorts of things are the proper standards to which their names are referred and by which their significations may be best rectified but neither will these archetypes so well serve to this purpose as to leave these names without very various and uncertain significations because these simple ideas that coexist and are united in the same subject being very numerous and having all an equal right to go into the complex specific idea which the specific name is to stand for men though they propose to themselves the very same subject to consider yet frame very different ideas about it and so the name they use for it unavoidably comes to have in several men very different significations the simple qualities which make up the complex ideas being most of them powers in relation to changes which they are apt to make in or receive from other bodies are almost infinite he that shall but observe what a great variety of alterations any one of the baser metals is apt to receive from the different application only of fire and how much a greater number of changes any of them will receive in the hands of a chymist by the application of other bodies will not think it strange that i count the properties of any sort of bodies not easy to be collected and completely known by the ways of inquiry which our faculties are capable of they being therefore at least so many that no man can know the precise and definite number they are differently discovered by different men according to their various skill attention and ways of handling who therefore cannot choose but have different ideas of the same substance and therefore make the signification of its common name very various and uncertain for the complex ideas of substances being made up of such simple ones as are supposed to coexist in nature every one has a right to put into his complex idea those qualities he has found to be united together for though in the substance of gold one satisfies himself with colour and weight yet another thinks solubility in aqua regia as necessary to be joined with that colour in his idea of gold as any one does its fusibility solubility in aqua regia being a quality as constantly joined with its colour and weight as fusibility or any other others put into it ductility or fixedness c as they have been taught by tradition or experience who of all these has established the right signification of the word gold or who shall be the judge to determine each has his standard in nature which he appeals to and with reason thinks he has the same right to put into his complex idea signified by the word gold those qualities which upon trial he has found united as another who has not so well examined has to leave them out or a third who has made other trials has to put in others for the union in nature of these qualities being the true ground of their union in one complex idea who can say one of them has more reason to be put in or left out than another from hence it will unavoidably follow that the complex ideas of substances in men using the same names for them will be very various and so the significations of those names very uncertain      thirdly to coexisting qualities which are known but imperfectly  besides there is scarce any particular thing existing which in some of its simple ideas does not communicate with a greater and in others a less number of particular beings who shall determine in this case which are those that are to make up the precise collection that is to be signified by the specific name or can with any just authority prescribe which obvious or common qualities are to be left out or which more secret or more particular are to be put into the signification of the name of any substance all which together seldom or never fail to produce that various and doubtful signification in the names of substances which causes such uncertainty disputes or mistakes when we come to a philosophical use of them      with this imperfection they may serve for civil but not well for philosophical use  it is true as to civil and common conversation the general names of substances regulated in their ordinary signification by some obvious qualities as by the shape and figure in things of known seminal propagation and in other substances for the most part by colour joined with some other sensible qualities do well enough to design the things men would be understood to speak of and so they usually conceive well enough the substances meant by the word gold or apple to distinguish the one from the other but in philosophical inquiries and debates where general truths are to be established and consequences drawn from positions laid down there the precise signification of the names of substances will be found not only not to be well established but also very hard to be so for example he that shall make malleability or a certain degree of fixedness a part of his complex idea of gold may make propositions concerning gold and draw consequences from them that will truly and clearly follow from gold taken in such a signification but yet such as another man can never be forced to admit nor be convinced of their truth who makes not malleableness or the same degree of fixedness part of that complex idea that the name gold in his use of it stands for      instance liquor  this is a natural and almost unavoidable imperfection in almost all the names of substances in all languages whatsoever which men will easily find when once passing from confused or loose notions they come to more strict and close inquiries for then they will be convinced how doubtful and obscure those words are in their signification which in ordinary use appeared very clear and determined i was once in a meeting of very learned and ingenious physicians where by chance there arose a question whether any liquor passed through the filaments of the nerves the debate having been managed a good while by variety of arguments on both sides i who had been used to suspect that the greatest part of disputes were more about the signification of words than a real difference in the conception of things desired that before they went any further on in this dispute they would first examine and establish amongst them what the word liquor signified they at first were a little surprised at the proposal and had they been persons less ingenious they might perhaps have taken it for a very frivolous or extravagant one since there was no one there that thought not himself to understand very perfectly what the word liquor stood for which i think too none of the most perplexed names of substances however they were pleased to comply with my motion and upon examination found that the signification of that word was not so settled or certain as they had all imagined but that each of them made it a sign of a different complex idea this made them perceive that the main of their dispute was about the signification of that term and that they differed very little in their opinions concerning some fluid and subtle matter passing through the conduits of the nerves though it was not so easy to agree whether it was to be called liquor or no a thing which when considered they thought it not worth the contending about      instance gold  how much this is the case in the greatest part of disputes that men are engaged so hotly in i shall perhaps have an occasion in another place to take notice let us only here consider a little more exactly the forementioned instance of the word gold and we shall see how hard it is precisely to determine its signification i think all agree to make it stand for a body of a certain yellow shining colour which being the idea to which children have annexed that name the shining yellow part of a peacocks tail is properly to them gold others finding fusibility joined with that yellow colour in certain parcels of matter make of that combination a complex idea to which they give the name gold to denote a sort of substances and so exclude from being gold all such yellow shining bodies as by fire will be reduced to ashes and admit to be of that species or to be comprehended under that name gold only such substances as having that shining yellow colour will by fire be reduced to fusion and not to ashes another by the same reason adds the weight which being a quality as straightly joined with that colour as its fusibility he thinks has the same reason to be joined in its idea and to be signified by its name and therefore the other made up of body of such a colour and fusibility to be imperfect and so on of all the rest wherein no one can show a reason why some of the inseparable qualities that are always united in nature should be put into the nominal essence and others left out or why the word gold signifying that sort of body the ring on his finger is made of should determine that sort rather by its colour weight and fusibility than by its colour weight and solubility in aqua regia since the dissolving it by that liquor is as inseparable from it as the fusion by fire and they are both of them nothing but the relation which that substance has to two other bodies which have a power to operate differently upon it for by what right is it that fusibility comes to be a part of the essence signified by the word gold and solubility but a property of it or why is its colour part of the essence and its malleableness but a property that which i mean is this that these being all but properties depending on its real constitution and nothing but powers either active or passive in reference to other bodies no one has authority to determine the signification of the word gold as referred to such a body existing in nature more to one collection of ideas to be found in that body than to another whereby the signification of that name must unavoidably be very uncertain since as has been said several people observe several properties in the same substance and i think i may say nobody all and therefore we have but very imperfect descriptions of things and words have very uncertain significations      the names of simple ideas the least doubtful  from what has been said it is easy to observe what has been before remarked viz that the names of simple ideas are of all others the least liable to mistakes and that for these reasons first because the ideas they stand for being each but one single perception are much easier got and more clearly retained than the more complex ones and therefore are not liable to the uncertainty which usually attends those compounded ones of substances and mixed modes in which the precise number of simple ideas that make them up are not easily agreed so readily kept in mind and secondly because they are never referred to any other essence but barely that perception they immediately signify which reference is that which renders the signification of the names of substances naturally so perplexed and gives occasion to so many disputes men that do not perversely use their words or on purpose set themselves to cavil seldom mistake in any language which they are acquainted with the use and signification of the name of simple ideas white and sweet yellow and bitter carry a very obvious meaning with them which every one precisely comprehends or easily perceives he is ignorant of and seeks to be informed but what precise collection of simple ideas modesty or frugality stand for in anothers use is not so certainly known and however we are apt to think we well enough know what is meant by gold or iron yet the precise complex idea others make them the signs of is not so certain and i believe it is very seldom that in speaker and hearer they stand for exactly the same collection which must needs produce mistakes and disputes when they are made use of in discourses wherein men have to do with universal propositions and would settle in their minds universal truths and consider the consequences that follow from them      and next to them simple modes  by the same rule the names of simple modes are next to those of simple ideas least liable to doubt and uncertainty especially those of figure and number of which men have so clear and distinct ideas who ever that had a mind to understand them mistook the ordinary meaning of seven or a triangle and in general the least compounded ideas in every kind have the least dubious names    0 the most doubtful are the names of very compounded mixed modes and substances  mixed modes therefore that are made up but of a few and obvious simple ideas have usually names of no very uncertain signification but the names of mixed modes which comprehend a great number of simple ideas are commonly of a very doubtful and undetermined meaning as has been shown the names of substances being annexed to ideas that are neither the real essences nor exact representations of the patterns they are referred to are liable to yet greater imperfection and uncertainty especially when we come to a philosophical use of them      why this imperfection charged upon words  the great disorder that happens in our names of substances proceeding for the most part from our want of knowledge and inability to penetrate into their real constitutions it may probably be wondered why i charge this as an imperfection rather upon our words than understandings this exception has so much appearance of justice that i think myself obliged to give a reason why i have followed this method i must confess then that when i first began this discourse of the understanding and a good while after i had not the least thought that any consideration of words was at all necessary to it but when having passed over the original and composition of our ideas i began to examine the extent and certainty of our knowledge i found it had so near a connexion with words that unless their force and manner of signification were first well observed there could be very little said clearly and pertinently concerning knowledge which being conversant about truth had constantly to do with propositions and though it terminated in things yet it was for the most part so much by the intervention of words that they seemed scarce separable from our general knowledge at least they interpose themselves so much between our understandings and the truth which it would contemplate and apprehend that like the medium through which visible objects pass the obscurity and disorder do not seldom cast a mist before our eyes and impose upon our understandings if we consider in the fallacies men put upon themselves as well as others and the mistakes in mens disputes and notions how great a part is owing to words and their uncertain or mistaken significations we shall have reason to think this no small obstacle in the way to knowledge which i conclude we are the more carefully to be warned of because it has been so far from being taken notice of as an inconvenience that the arts of improving it have been made the business of mens study and obtained the reputation of learning and subtilty as we shall see in the following chapter but i am apt to imagine that were the imperfections of language as the instrument of knowledge more thoroughly weighed a great many of the controversies that make such a noise in the world would of themselves cease and the way to knowledge and perhaps peace too lie a great deal opener than it does      this should teach us moderation in imposing our own sense of old authors  sure i am that the signification of words in all languages depending very much on the thoughts notions and ideas of him that uses them must unavoidably be of great uncertainty to men of the same language and country this is so evident in the greek authors that he that shall peruse their writings will find in almost every one of them a distinct language though the same words but when to this natural difficulty in every country there shall be added different countries and remote ages wherein the speakers and writers had very different notions tempers customs ornaments and figures of speech c every one of which influenced the signification of their words then though to us now they are lost and unknown it would become us to be charitable one to another in our interpretations or misunderstandings of those ancient writings which though of great concernment to be understood are liable to the unavoidable difficulties of speech which if we except the names of simple ideas and some very obvious things is not capable without a constant defining the terms of conveying the sense and intention of the speaker without any manner of doubt and uncertainty to the hearer and in discourses of religion law and morality as they are matters of the highest concernment so there will be the greatest difficulty      especially of the old and new testament scriptures  the volumes of interpreters and commentators on the old and new testament are but too manifest proofs of this though everything said in the text be infallibly true yet the reader may be nay cannot choose but be very fallible in the understanding of it nor is it to be wondered that the will of god when clothed in words should be liable to that doubt and uncertainty which unavoidably attends that sort of conveyance when even his son whilst clothed in flesh was subject to all the frailties and inconveniences of human nature sin excepted and we ought to magnify his goodness that he hath spread before all the world such legible characters of his works and providence and given all mankind so sufficient a light of reason that they to whom this written word never came could not whenever they set themselves to search either doubt of the being of a god or of the obedience due to him since then the precepts of natural religion are plain and very intelligible to all mankind and seldom come to be controverted and other revealed truths which are conveyed to us by books and languages are liable to the common and natural obscurities and difficulties incident to words methinks it would become us to be more careful and diligent in observing the former and less magisterial positive and imperious in imposing our own sense and interpretations of the latter     chapter x  of the abuse of words     woeful abuse of words  besides the imperfection that is naturally in language and the obscurity and confusion that is so hard to be avoided in the use of words there are several wilful faults and neglects which men are guilty of in this way of communication whereby they render these signs less clear and distinct in their signification than naturally they need to be     first words are often employed without any or without clear ideas  first in this kind the first and most palpable abuse is the using of words without clear and distinct ideas or which is worse signs without anything signified of these there are two sorts  i some words introduced without clear ideas annexed to them even in their first original  one may observe in all languages certain words that if they be examined will be found in their first original and their appropriated use not to stand for any clear and distinct ideas these for the most part the several sects of philosophy and religion have introduced for their authors or promoters either affecting something singular and out of the way of common apprehensions or to support some strange opinions or cover some weakness of their hypothesis seldom fail to coin new words and such as when they come to be examined may justly be called insignificant terms for having either had no determinate collection of ideas annexed to them when they were first invented or at least such as if well examined will be found inconsistent it is no wonder if afterwards in the vulgar use of the same party they remain empty sounds with little or no signification amongst those who think it enough to have them often in their mouths as the distinguishing characters of their church or school without much troubling their heads to examine what are the precise ideas they stand for i shall not need here to heap up instances every mans reading and conversation will sufficiently furnish him or if he wants to be better stored the great mintmasters of this kind of terms i mean the schoolmen and metaphysicians under which i think the disputing natural and moral philosophers of these latter ages may be comprehended have wherewithal abundantly to content him     ii other words to which ideas were annexed at first used afterwards without distinct meanings  others there be who extend this abuse yet further who take so little care to lay by words which in their primary notation have scarce any clear and distinct ideas which they are annexed to that by an unpardonable negligence they familiarly use words which the propriety of language has affixed to very important ideas without any distinct meaning at all wisdom glory grace c are words frequent enough in every mans mouth but if a great many of those who use them should be asked what they mean by them they would be at a stand and not know what to answer a plain proof that though they have learned those sounds and have them ready at their tongues ends yet there are no determined ideas laid up in their minds which are to be expressed to others by them     this occasioned by men learning names before they have the ideas the names belong to  men having been accustomed from their cradles to learn words which are easily got and retained before they knew or had framed the complex ideas to which they were annexed or which were to be found in the things they were thought to stand for they usually continue to do so all their lives and without taking the pains necessary to settle in their minds determined ideas they use their words for such unsteady and confused notions as they have contenting themselves with the same words other people use as if their very sound necessarily carried with it constantly the same meaning this though men make a shift with in the ordinary occurrences of life where they find it necessary to be understood and therefore they make signs till they are so yet this insignificancy in their words when they come to reason concerning either their tenets or interest manifestly fills their discourse with abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon especially in moral matters where the words for the most part standing for arbitrary and numerous collections of ideas not regularly and permanently united in nature their bare sounds are often only thought on or at least very obscure and uncertain notions annexed to them men take the words they find in use amongst their neighbours and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for use them confidently without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning whereby besides the ease of it they obtain this advantage that as in such discourses they seldom are in the right so they are as seldom to be convinced that they are in the wrong it being all one to go about to draw those men out of their mistakes who have no settled notions as to dispossess a vagrant of his habitation who has no settled abode this i guess to be so and every one may observe in himself and others whether it be so or not     secondly unsteady application of them  secondly another great abuse of words is inconstancy in the use of them it is hard to find a discourse written on any subject especially of controversy wherein one shall not observe if he read with attention the same words and those commonly the most material in the discourse and upon which the argument turns used sometimes for one collection of simple ideas and sometimes for another which is a perfect abuse of language words being intended for signs of my ideas to make them known to others not by any natural signification but by a voluntary imposition it is plain cheat and abuse when i make them stand sometimes for one thing and sometimes for another the wilful doing whereof can be imputed to nothing but great folly or greater dishonesty and a man in his accounts with another may with as much fairness make the characters of numbers stand sometimes for one and sometimes for another collection of units vg this character   stand sometimes for three sometimes for four and sometimes for eight as in his discourse or reasoning make the same words stand for different collections of simple ideas if men should do so in their reckonings i wonder who would have to do with them one who would speak thus in the affairs and business of the world and call   sometimes seven and sometimes nine as best served his advantage would presently have clapped upon him one of the two names men are commonly disgusted with and yet in arguings and learned contests the same sort of proceedings passes commonly for wit and learning but to me it appears a greater dishonesty than the misplacing of counters in the casting up a debt and the cheat the greater by how much truth is of greater concernment and value than money     thirdly affected obscurity as in the peripatetic and other sects of philosophy  thirdly another abuse of language is an affected obscurity by either applying old words to new and unusual significations or introducing new and ambiguous terms without defining either or else putting them so together as may confound their ordinary meaning though the peripatetick philosophy has been most eminent in this way yet other sects have not been wholly clear of it there are scarce any of them that are not cumbered with some difficulties such is the imperfection of human knowledge which they have been fain to cover with obscurity of terms and to confound the signification of words which like a mist before peoples eyes might hinder their weak parts from being discovered that body and extension in common use stand for two distinct ideas is plain to any one that will but reflect a little for were their signification precisely the same it would be as proper and as intelligible to say the body of an extension as the extension of a body and yet there are those who find it necessary to confound their signification to this abuse and the mischiefs of confounding the signification of words logic and the liberal sciences as they have been handled in the schools have given reputation and the admired art of disputing hath added much to the natural imperfection of languages whilst it has been made use of and fitted to perplex the signification of words more than to discover the knowledge and truth of things and he that will look into that sort of learned writings will find the words there much more obscure uncertain and undetermined in their meaning than they are in ordinary conversation     logic and dispute have much contributed to this  this is unavoidably to be so where mens parts and learning are estimated by their skill in disputing and if reputation and reward shall attend these conquests which depend mostly on the fineness and niceties of words it is no wonder if the wit of man so employed should perplex involve and subtilize the signification of sounds so as never to want something to say in opposing or defending any question the victory being adjudged not to him who had truth on his side but the last word in the dispute     calling it subtlety  this though a very useless skill and that which i think the direct opposite to the ways of knowledge hath yet passed hitherto under the laudable and esteemed names of subtlety and acuteness and has had the applause of the schools and encouragement of one part of the learned men of the world and no wonder since the philosophers of old the disputing and wrangling philosophers i mean such as lucian wittily and with reason taxes and the schoolmen since aiming at glory and esteem for their great and universal knowledge easier a great deal to be pretended to than really acquired found this a good expedient to cover their ignorance with a curious and inexplicable web of perplexed words and procure to themselves the admiration of others by unintelligible terms the apter to produce wonder because they could not be understood whilst it appears in all history that these profound doctors were no wiser nor more useful than their neighbours and brought but small advantage to human life or the societies wherein they lived unless the coining of new words where they produced no new things to apply them to or the perplexing or obscuring the signification of old ones and so bringing all things into question and dispute were a thing profitable to the life of man or worthy commendation and reward     this learning very little benefits society  for notwithstanding these learned disputants these allknowing doctors it was to the unscholastic statesman that the governments of the world owed their peace defence and liberties and from the illiterate and contemned mechanic a name of disgrace that they received the improvements of useful arts nevertheless this artificial ignorance and learned gibberish prevailed mightily in these last ages by the interest and artifice of those who found no easier way to that pitch of authority and dominion they have attained than by amusing the men of business and ignorant with hard words or employing the ingenious and idle in intricate disputes about unintelligible terms and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth besides there is no such way to gain admittance or give defence to strange and absurd doctrines as to guard them round about with legions of obscure doubtful and undefined words which yet make these retreats more like the dens of robbers or holes of foxes than the fortresses of fair warriors which if it be hard to get them out of it is not for the strength that is in them but the briars and thorns and the obscurity of the thickets they are beset with for untruth being unacceptable to the mind of man there is no other defence left for absurdity but obscurity    0 but destroys the instruments of knowledge and communication  thus learned ignorance and this art of keeping even inquisitive men from true knowledge hath been propagated in the world and hath much perplexed whilst it pretended to inform the understanding for we see that other wellmeaning and wise men whose education and parts had not acquired that acuteness could intelligibly express themselves to one another and in its plain use make a benefit of language but though unlearned men well enough understood the words white and black c and had constant notions of the ideas signified by those words yet there were philosophers found who had learning and subtlety enough to prove that snow was black ie to prove that white was black whereby they had the advantage to destroy the instruments and means of discourse conversation instruction and society whilst with great art and subtlety they did no more but perplex and confound the signification of words and thereby render language less useful than the real defects of it had made it a gift which the illiterate had not attained to      as useful as to confound the sound that the letters of the alphabet stand for  these learned men did equally instruct mens understandings and profit their lives as he who should alter the signification of known characters and by a subtle device of learning far surpassing the capacity of the illiterate dull and vulgar should in his writing show that he could put a for b and d for e c to the no small admiration and benefit of for his reader it being as senseless to put black which is a word agreed on to stand for one sensible idea to put it i say for another or the contrary idea ie to call snow black as to put this mark a which is a character agreed on to stand for one modification of sound made by a certain motion of the organs of speech for b which is agreed on to stand for another modification of sound made by another certain mode of the organs of speech      this art has perplexed religion and justice  nor hath this mischief stopped in logical niceties or curious empty speculations it hath invaded the great concernments of human life and society obscured and perplexed the material truths of law and divinity brought confusion disorder and uncertainty into the affairs of mankind and if not destroyed yet in a great measure rendered useless these two great rules religion and justice what have the greatest part of the comments and disputes upon the laws of god and man served for but to make the meaning more doubtful and perplex the sense what have been the effect of those multiplied curious distinctions and acute niceties but obscurity and uncertainty leaving the words more unintelligible and the reader more at a loss how else comes it to pass that princes speaking or writing to their servants in their ordinary commands are easily understood speaking to their people in their laws are not so and as i remarked before doth it not often happen that a man of an ordinary capacity very well understands a text or a law that he reads till he consults an expositor or goes to counsel who by that time he hath done explaining them makes the words signify either nothing at all or what he pleases      and ought not to pass for learning  whether any byinterests of these professions have occasioned this i will not here examine but i leave it to be considered whether it would not be well for mankind whose concernment it is to know things as they are and to do what they ought and not to spend their lives in talking about them or tossing words to and frowhether it would not be well i say that the use of words were made plain and direct and that language which was given us for the improvement of knowledge and bond of society should not be employed to darken truth and unsettle peoples rights to raise mists and render unintelligible both morality and religion or that at least if this will happen it should not be thought learning or knowledge to do so      iv fourthly by taking words for things  fourthly another great abuse of words is the taking them for things this though it in some degree concerns all names in general yet more particularly affects those of substances to this abuse those men are most subject who most confine their thoughts to any one system and give themselves up into a firm belief of the perfection of any received hypothesis whereby they come to be persuaded that the terms of that sect are so suited to the nature of things that they perfectly correspond with their real existence who is there that has been bred up in the peripatetick philosophy who does not think the ten names under which are ranked the ten predicaments to be exactly conformable to the nature of things who is there of that school that is not persuaded that substantial forms vegetative souls abhorrence of a vacuum intentional species c are something real these words men have learned from their very entrance upon knowledge and have found their masters and systems lay great stress upon them and therefore they cannot quit the opinion that they are conformable to nature and are the representations of something that really exists the platonists have their soul of the world and the epicureans their endeavor towards motion in their atoms when at rest there is scarce any sect in philosophy has not a distinct set of terms that others understand not but yet this gibberish which in the weakness of human understanding serves so well to palliate mens ignorance and cover their errors comes by familiar use amongst those of the same tribe to seem the most important part of language and of all other the terms the most significant and should aerial and oetherial vehicles come once by the prevalency of that doctrine to be generally received anywhere no doubt those terms would make impressions on mens minds so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such things as much as peripatetick forms and intentional species have heretofore done    instance in matter  how much names taken for things are apt to mislead the understanding the attentive reading of philosophical writers would abundantly discover and that perhaps in words little suspected of any such misuse i shall instance in one only and that a very familiar one how many intricate disputes have there been about matter as if there were some such thing really in nature distinct from body as it is evident the word matter stands for an idea distinct from the idea of body for if the ideas these two terms stood for were precisely the same they might indifferently in all places be put for one another but we see that though it be proper to say there is one matter of all bodies one cannot say there is one body of all matters we familiarly say one body is bigger than another but it sounds harsh and i think is never used to say one matter is bigger than another whence comes this then viz from hence that though matter and body be not really distinct but wherever there is the one there is the other yet matter and body stand for two different conceptions whereof the one is incomplete and but a part of the other for body stands for a solid extended figured substance whereof matter is but a partial and more confused conception it seeming to me to be used for the substance and solidity of body without taking in its extension and figure and therefore it is that speaking of matter we speak of it always as one because in truth it expressly contains nothing but the idea of a solid substance which is everywhere the same everywhere uniform this being our idea of matter we no more conceive or speak of different matters in the world than we do of different solidities though we both conceive and speak of different bodies because extension and figure are capable of variation but since solidity cannot exist without extension and figure the taking matter to be the name of something really existing under that precision has no doubt produced those obscure and unintelligible discourses and disputes which have filled the heads and books of philosophers concerning materia prima which imperfection or abuse how far it may concern a great many other general terms i leave to be considered this i think i may at least say that we should have a great many fewer disputes in the world if words were taken for what they are the signs of our ideas only and not for things themselves for when we argue about matter or any the like term we truly argue only about the idea we express by that sound whether that precise idea agree to anything really existing in nature or no and if men would tell what ideas they make their words stand for there could not be half that obscurity or wrangling in the search or support of truth that there is      this makes errors lasting  but whatever inconvenience follows from this mistake of words this i am sure that by constant and familiar use they charm men into notions far remote from the truth of things it would be a hard matter to persuade any one that the words which his father or schoolmaster the parson of the parish or such a reverend doctor used signified nothing that really existed in nature which perhaps is none of the least causes that men are so hardly drawn to quit their mistakes even in opinions purely philosophical and where they have no other interest but truth for the words they have a long time been used to remaining firm in their minds it is no wonder that the wrong notions annexed to them should not be removed      fifthly by setting them in the place of what they cannot signify  v fifthly another abuse of words is the setting them in the place of things which they do or can by no means signify we may observe that in the general names of substances whereof the nominal essences are only known to us when we put them into propositions and affirm or deny anything about them we do most commonly tacitly suppose or intend they should stand for the real essence of a certain sort of substances for when a man says gold is malleable he means and would insinuate something more than this that what i call gold is malleable though truly it amounts to no more but would have this understood viz that gold ie what has the real essence of gold is malleable which amounts to thus much that malleableness depends on and is inseparable from the real essence of gold but a man not knowing wherein that real essence consists the connexion in his mind of malleableness is not truly with an essence he knows not but only with the sound gold he puts for it thus when we say that animal rationale is and animal imflume bipes latis unguibus is not a good definition of a man it is plain we suppose the name man in this case to stand for the real essence of a species and would signify that a rational animal better described that real essence than a twolegged animal with broad nails and without feathers for else why might not plato as properly make the word word in greek or man stand for his complex idea made up of the idea of a body distinguished from others by a certain shape and other outward appearances as aristotle make the complex idea to which he gave the name word in greek or man of body and the faculty of reasoning joined together unless the name word in greek or man were supposed to stand for something else than what it signifies and to be put in the place of some other thing than the idea a man professes he would express by it      vi putting them for the real essences of substances  it is true the names of substances would be much more useful and propositions made in them much more certain were the real essences of substances the ideas in our minds which those words signified and it is for want of those real essences that our words convey so little knowledge or certainty in our discourses about them and therefore the mind to remove that imperfection as much as it can makes them by a secret supposition to stand for a thing having that real essence as if thereby it made some nearer approaches to it for though the word man or gold signify nothing truly but a complex idea of properties united together in one sort of substances yet there is scarce anybody in the use of these words but often supposes each of those names to stand for a thing having the real essence on which these properties depend which is so far from diminishing the imperfection of our words that by a plain abuse it adds to it when we would make them stand for something which not being in our complex idea the name we use can no ways be the sign of      hence we think change of our complex ideas of substances not to change their species  this shows us the reason why in mixed modes any of the ideas that make the composition of the complex one being left out or changed it is allowed to be another thing ie to be of another species as is plain in chancemedley manslaughter murder parricide c the reason whereof is because the complex idea signified by that name is the real as well as nominal essence and there is no secret reference of that name to any other essence but that but in substances it is not so for though in that called gold one puts into his complex idea what another leaves out and vice versa yet men do not usually think that therefore the species is changed because they secretly in their minds refer that name and suppose it annexed to a real immutable essence of a thing existing on which those properties depend he that adds to his complex idea of gold that of fixedness and solubility in aqua regia which he put not in it before is not thought to have changed the species but only to have a more perfect idea by adding another simple idea which is always in fact joined with those other of which his former complex idea consisted but this reference of the name to a thing whereof we have not the idea is so far from helping at all that it only serves the more to involve us in difficulties for by this tacit reference to the real essence of that species of bodies the word gold which by standing for a more or less perfect collection of simple ideas serves to design that sort of body well enough in civil discourse comes to have no signification at all being put for somewhat whereof we have no idea at all and so can signify nothing at all when the body itself is away for however it may be thought all one yet if well considered it will be found a quite different thing to argue about gold in name and about a parcel in the body itself vg a piece of leafgold laid before us though in discourse we are fain to substitute the name for the thing    0 the cause of this abuse a supposition of natures working always regularly in setting boundaries to species  that which i think very much disposes men to substitute their names for the real essences of species is the supposition before mentioned that nature works regularly in the production of things and sets the boundaries to each of those species by giving exactly the same real internal constitution to each individual which we rank under one general name whereas any one who observes their different qualities can hardly doubt that many of the individuals called by the same name are in their internal constitution as different one from another as several of those which are ranked under different specific names this supposition however that the same precise and internal constitution goes always with the same specific name makes men forward to take those names for the representatives of those real essences though indeed they signify nothing but the complex ideas they have in their minds when they use them so that if i may so say signifying one thing and being supposed for or put in the place of another they cannot but in such a kind of use cause a great deal of uncertainty in mens discourses especially in those who have thoroughly imbibed the doctrine of substantial forms whereby they firmly imagine the several species of things to be determined and distinguished      this abuse contains two false suppositions  but however preposterous and absurd it be to make our names stand for ideas we have not or which is all one essences that we know not it being in effect to make our words the signs of nothing yet it is evident to any one who ever so little reflects on the use men make of their words that there is nothing more familiar when a man asks whether this or that thing he sees let it be a drill or a monstrous foetus be a man or no it is evident the question is not whether that particular thing agree to his complex idea expressed by the name man but whether it has in it the real essence of a species of things which he supposes his name man to stand for in which way of using the names of substances there are these false suppositions contained  first that there are certain precise essences according to which nature makes all particular things and by which they are distinguished into species that everything has a real constitution whereby it is what it is and on which its sensible qualities depend is past doubt but i think it has been proved that this makes not the distinction of species as we rank them nor the boundaries of their names  secondly this tacitly also insinuates as if we had ideas of these proposed essences for to what purpose else is it to inquire whether this or that thing have the real essence of the species man if we did not suppose that there were such a specifick essence known which yet is utterly false and therefore such application of names as would make them stand for ideas which we have not must needs cause great disorder in discourses and reasonings about them and be a great inconvenience in our communication by words      vi sixthly by proceeding upon the supposition that the words we use have a certain and evident signification which other men cannot but understand  sixthly there remains yet another more general though perhaps less observed abuse of words and that is that men having by a long and familiar use annexed to them certain ideas they are apt to imagine so near and necessary a connexion between the names and signification they use them in that they forwardly suppose one cannot but understand what their meaning is and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the words delivered as if it were past doubt that in the use of those common received sounds the speaker and hearer had necessarily the same precise ideas whence presuming that when they have in discourse used any term they have thereby as it were set before others the very thing they talked of and so likewise taking the words of others as naturally standing for just what they themselves have been accustomed to apply them to they never trouble themselves to explain their own or understand clearly others meaning from whence commonly proceeds noise and wrangling without improvement or information whilst men take words to be the constant regular marks of agreed notions which in truth are no more but the voluntary and unsteady signs of their own ideas and yet men think it strange if in discourse or where it is often absolutely necessary in dispute one sometimes asks the meaning of their terms though the arguings one may every day observe in conversation make it evident that there are few names of complex ideas which any two men use for the same just precise collection it is hard to name a word which will not be a clear instance of this life is a term none more familiar any one almost would take it for an affront to be asked what he meant by it and yet if it comes in question whether a plant that lies ready formed in the seed have life whether the embryo in an egg before incubation or a man in a swoon without sense or motion be alive or no it is easy to perceive that a clear distinct settled idea does not always accompany the use of so known a word as that of life is some gross and confused conceptions men indeed ordinarily have to which they apply the common words of their language and such a loose use of their words serves them well enough in their ordinary discourses or affairs but this is not sufficient for philosophical inquiries knowledge and reasoning require precise determinate ideas and though men will not be so importunately dull as not to understand what others say without demanding an explication of their terms nor so troublesomely critical as to correct others in the use of the words they receive from them yet where truth and knowledge are concerned in the case i know not what fault it can be to desire the explication of words whose sense seems dubious or why a man should be ashamed to own his ignorance in what sense another man uses his words since he has no other way of certainly knowing it but by being informed this abuse of taking words upon trust has nowhere spread so far nor with so ill effects as amongst men of letters the multiplication and obstinacy of disputes which have so laid waste the intellectual world is owing to nothing more than to this ill use of words for though it be generally believed that there is great diversity of opinions in the volumes and variety of controversies the world is distracted with yet the most i can find that the contending learned men of different parties do in their arguings one with another is that they speak different languages for i am apt to imagine that when any of them quitting terms think upon things and know what they think they think all the same though perhaps what they would have be different      the ends of language first to convey our ideas  to conclude this consideration of the imperfection and abuse of language the ends of language in our discourse with others being chiefly these three first to make known one mans thoughts or ideas to another secondly to do so with as much ease and quickness as possible and thirdly thereby to convey the knowledge of things language is either abused or deficient when it fails of any of these three  first words fail in the first of these ends and lay not open one mans ideas to anothers view   when men have names in their mouths without any determinate ideas in their minds whereof they are the signs or   when they apply the common received names of any language to ideas to which the common use of that language does not apply them or   when they apply them very unsteadily making them stand now for one and by and by for another idea      secondly to do it with quickness  secondly men fail of conveying their thoughts with the quickness and ease that may be when they have complex ideas without having any distinct names for them this is sometimes the fault of the language itself which has not in it a sound yet applied to such a signification and sometimes the fault of the man who has not yet learned the name for that idea he would show another      thirdly therewith to convey the knowledge of things  thirdly there is no knowledge of things conveyed by mens words when their ideas agree not to the reality of things though it be a defect that has its original in our ideas which are not so conformable to the nature of things as attention study and application might make them yet it fails not to extend itself to our words too when we use them as signs of real beings which yet never had any reality or existence      how mens words fail in all these first when used without any ideas  first he that hath words of any language without distinct ideas in his mind to which he applies them does so far as he uses them in discourse only make a noise without any sense or signification and how learned soever he may seem by the use of hard words or learned terms is not much more advanced thereby in knowledge than he would be in learning who had nothing in his study but the bare titles of books without possessing the contents of them for all such words however put into discourse according to the right construction of grammatical rules or the harmony of wellturned periods do yet amount to nothing but bare sounds and nothing else      secondly when complex ideas are without names annexed to them  secondly he that has complex ideas without particular names for them would be in no better case than a bookseller who had in his warehouse volumes that lay there unbound and without titles which he could therefore make known to others only by showing the loose sheets and communicate them only by tale this man is hindered in his discourse for want of words to communicate his complex ideas which he is therefore forced to make known by an enumeration of the simple ones that compose them and so is fain often to use twenty words to express what another man signifies in one      thirdly when the same sign is not put for the same idea  thirdly he that puts not constantly the same sign for the same idea but uses the same word sometimes in one and sometimes in another signification ought to pass in the schools and conversation for as fair a man as he does in the market and exchange who sells several things under the same name      fourthly when words are diverted from their common use  fourthly he that applies the words of any language to ideas different from those to which the common use of that country applies them however his own understanding may be filled with truth and light will not by such words be able to convey much of it to others without defining his terms for however the sounds are such as are familiarly known and easily enter the ears of those who are accustomed to them yet standing for other ideas than those they usually are annexed to and are wont to excite in the mind of the hearers they cannot make known the thoughts of him who thus uses them    0 fifthly when they are names of fantastical imaginations  fifthly he that imagined to himself substances such as never have been and filled his head with ideas which have not any correspondence with the real nature of things to which yet he gives settled and defined names may fill his discourse and perhaps another mans head with the fantastical imaginations of his own brain but will be very far from advancing thereby one jot in real and true knowledge      summary  he that hath names without ideas wants meaning in his words and speaks only empty sounds he that hath complex ideas without names for them wants liberty and dispatch in his expressions and is necessitated to use periphrases he that uses his words loosely and unsteadily will either be not minded or not understood he that applies his names to ideas different from their common use wants propriety in his language and speaks gibberish and he that hath the ideas of substances disagreeing with the real existence of things so far wants the materials of true knowledge in his understanding and hath instead thereof chimeras      how mens words fail when they stand for substances  in our notions concerning substances we are liable to all the former inconveniences v g he that uses the word tarantula without having any imagination or idea of what it stands for pronounces a good word but so long means nothing at all by it   he that in a newlydiscovered country shall see several sorts of animals and vegetables unknown to him before may have as true ideas of them as of a horse or a stag but can speak of them only by a description till he shall either take the names the natives call them by or give them names himself   he that uses the word body sometimes for pure extension and sometimes for extension and solidity together will talk very fallaciously   he that gives the name horse to that idea which common usage calls mule talks improperly and will not be understood   he that thinks the name centaur stands for some real being imposes on himself and mistakes words for things      how when they stand for modes and relations  in modes and relations generally we are liable only to the four first of these inconveniences viz   i may have in my memory the names of modes as gratitude or charity and yet not have any precise ideas annexed in my thoughts to those names   i may have ideas and not know the names that belong to them v g i may have the idea of a mans drinking till his colour and humour be altered till his tongue trips and his eyes look red and his feet fail him and yet not know that it is to be called drunkenness   i may have the ideas of virtues or vices and names also but apply them amiss v g when i apply the name frugality to that idea which others call and signify by this sound covetousness   i may use any of those names with inconstancy   but in modes and relations i cannot have ideas disagreeing to the existence of things for modes being complex ideas made by the mind at pleasure and relation being but by way of considering or comparing two things together and so also an idea of my own making these ideas can scarce be found to disagree with anything existing since they are not in the mind as the copies of things regularly made by nature nor as properties inseparably flowing from the internal constitution or essence of any substance but as it were patterns lodged in my memory with names annexed to them to denominate actions and relations by as they come to exist but the mistake is commonly in my giving a wrong name to my conceptions and so using words in a different sense from other people i am not understood but am thought to have wrong ideas of them when i give wrong names to them only if i put in my ideas of mixed modes or relations any inconsistent ideas together i fill my head also with chimeras since such ideas if well examined cannot so much as exist in the mind much less any real being ever be denominated from them      seventhly language is often abused by figurative speech  since wit and fancy find easier entertainment in the world than dry truth and real knowledge figurative speeches and allusion in language will hardly be admitted as an imperfection or abuse of it i confess in discourses where we seek rather pleasure and delight than information and improvement such ornaments as are borrowed from them can scarce pass for faults but yet if we would speak of things as they are we must allow that all the art of rhetoric besides order and clearness all the artificial and figurative application of words eloquence hath invented are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas move the passions and thereby mislead the judgment and so indeed are perfect cheats and therefore however laudable or allowable oratory may render them in harangues and popular addresses they are certainly in all discourses that pretend to inform or instruct wholly to be avoided and where truth and knowledge are concerned cannot but be thought a great fault either of the language or person that makes use of them what and how various they are will be superfluous here to take notice the books of rhetoric which abound in the world will instruct those who want to be informed only i cannot but observe how little the preservation and improvement of truth and knowledge is the care and concern of mankind since the arts of fallacy are endowed and preferred it is evident how much men love to deceive and be deceived since rhetoric that powerful instrument of error and deceit has its established professors is publicly taught and has always been had in great reputation and i doubt not but it will be thought great boldness if not brutality in me to have said thus much against it eloquence like the fair sex has too prevailing beauties in it to suffer itself ever to be spoken against and it is in vain to find fault with those arts of deceiving wherein men find pleasure to be deceived     chapter xi  of the remedies of the foregoing imperfections and abuses of words     remedies are worth seeking  the natural and improved imperfections of languages we have seen above at large and speech being the great bond that holds society together and the common conduit whereby the improvements of knowledge are conveyed from one man and one generation to another it would well deserve our most serious thoughts to consider what remedies are to be found for the inconveniences above mentioned     are not easy to find  i am not so vain as to think that any one can pretend to attempt the perfect reforming the languages of the world no not so much as of his own country without rendering himself ridiculous to require that men should use their words constantly in the same sense and for none but determined and uniform ideas would be to think that all men should have the same notions and should talk of nothing but what they have clear and distinct ideas of which is not to be expected by any one who hath not vanity enough to imagine he can prevail with men to be very knowing or very silent and he must be very little skilled in the world who thinks that a voluble tongue shall accompany only a good understanding or that mens talking much or little should hold proportion only to their knowledge     but yet necessary to those who search after truth  but though the market and exchange must be left to their own ways of talking and gossipings not be robbed of their ancient privilege though the schools and men of argument would perhaps take it amiss to have anything offered to abate the length or lessen the number of their disputes yet methinks those who pretend seriously to search after or maintain truth should think themselves obliged to study how they might deliver themselves without obscurity doubtfulness or equivocation to which mens words are naturally liable if care be not taken     misuse of words the great cause of errors  for he that shall well consider the errors and obscurity the mistakes and confusion that are spread in the world by an ill use of words will find some reason to doubt whether language as it has been employed has contributed more to the improvement or hindrance of knowledge amongst mankind how many are there that when they would think on things fix their thoughts only on words especially when they would apply their minds to moral matters and who then can wonder if the result of such contemplations and reasonings about little more than sounds whilst the ideas they annex to them are very confused and very unsteady or perhaps none at all who can wonder i say that such thoughts and reasonings end in nothing but obscurity and mistake without any clear judgment or knowledge     has made men more conceited and obstinate  this inconvenience in an ill use of words men suffer in their own private meditations but much more manifest are the disorders which follow from it in conversation discourse and arguings with others for language being the great conduit whereby men convey their discoveries reasonings and knowledge from one to another he that makes an ill use of it though he does not corrupt the fountains of knowledge which are in things themselves yet he does as much as in him lies break or stop the pipes whereby it is distributed to the public use and advantage of mankind he that uses words without any clear and steady meaning what does he but lead himself and others into errors and he that designedly does it ought to be looked on as an enemy to truth and knowledge and yet who can wonder that all the sciences and parts of knowledge have been so overcharged with obscure and equivocal terms and insignificant and doubtful expressions capable to make the most attentive or quicksighted very little or not at all the more knowing or orthodox since subtlety in those who make profession to teach or defend truth hath passed so much for a virtue a virtue indeed which consisting for the most part in nothing but the fallacious and illusory use of obscure or deceitful terms is only fit to make men more conceited in their ignorance and more obstinate in their errors     addicted to wrangling about sounds  let us look into the books of controversy of any kind there we shall see that the effect of obscure unsteady or equivocal terms is nothing but noise and wrangling about sounds without convincing or bettering a mans understanding for if the idea be not agreed on betwixt the speaker and hearer for which the words stand the argument is not about things but names as often as such a word whose signification is not ascertained betwixt them comes in use their understandings have no other object wherein they agree but barely the sound the things that they think on at that time as expressed by that word being quite different     instance bat and bird  whether a bat be a bird or no is not a question whether a bat be another thing than indeed it is or have other qualities than indeed it has for that would be extremely absurd to doubt of but the question is i either between those that acknowledged themselves to have but imperfect ideas of one or both of this sort of things for which these names are supposed to stand and then it is a real inquiry concerning the nature of a bird or a bat to make their yet imperfect ideas of it more complete by examining whether all the simple ideas to which combined together they both give name bird be all to be found in a bat but this is a question only of inquirers not disputers who neither affirm nor deny but examine or   it is a question between disputants whereof the one affirms and the other denies that a bat is a bird and then the question is barely about the signification of one or both these words in that they not having both the same complex ideas to which they give these two names one holds and the other denies that these two names may be affirmed one of another were they agreed in the signification of these two names it were impossible they should dispute about them for they would presently and clearly see were that adjusted between them whether all the simple ideas of the more general name bird were found in the complex idea of a bat or no and so there could be no doubt whether a bat were a bird or no and here i desire it may be considered and carefully examined whether the greatest part of the disputes in the world are not merely verbal and about the signification of words and whether if the terms they are made in were defined and reduced in their signification as they must be where they signify anything to determined collections of the simple ideas they do or should stand for those disputes would not end of themselves and immediately vanish i leave it then to be considered what the learning of disputation is and how well they are employed for the advantage of themselves or others whose business is only the vain ostentation of sounds i e those who spend their lives in disputes and controversies when i shall see any of those combatants strip all his terms of ambiguity and obscurity which every one may do in the words he uses himself i shall think him a champion for knowledge truth and peace and not the slave of vainglory ambition or a party     remedies  to remedy the defects of speech before mentioned to some degree and to prevent the inconveniences that follow from them i imagine the observation of these following rules may be of use till somebody better able shall judge it worth his while to think more maturely on this matter and oblige the world with his thoughts on it   first remedy to use no word without an idea annexed to it  first a man shall take care to use no word without a signification no name without an idea for which he makes it stand this rule will not seem altogether needless to any one who shall take the pains to recollect how often he has met with such words as instinct sympathy and antipathy c in the discourse of others so made use of as he might easily conclude that those that used them had no ideas in their minds to which they applied them but spoke them only as sounds which usually served instead of reasons on the like occasions not but that these words and the like have very proper significations in which they may be used but there being no natural connexion between any words and any ideas these and any other may be learned by rote and pronounced or writ by men who have no ideas in their minds to which they have annexed them and for which they make them stand which is necessary they should if men would speak intelligibly even to themselves alone     second remedy to have distinct determinate ideas annexed to words especially in mixed modes  secondly it is not enough a man uses his words as signs of some ideas those he annexes them to if they be simple must be clear and distinct if complex must be determinate ie the precise collection of simple ideas settled in the mind with that sound annexed to it as the sign of that precise determined collection and no other this is very necessary in names of modes and especially moral words which having no settled objects in nature from whence their ideas are taken as from their original are apt to be very confused justice is a word in every mans mouth but most commonly with a very undetermined loose signification which will always be so unless a man has in his mind a distinct comprehension of the component parts that complex idea consists of and if it be decompounded must be able to resolve it still only till he at last comes to the simple ideas that make it up and unless this be done a man makes an ill use of the word let it be justice for example or any other i do not say a man needs stand to recollect and make this analysis at large every time the word justice comes in his way but this at least is necessary that he have so examined the signification of that name and settled the idea of all its parts in his mind that he can do it when he pleases if any one who makes his complex idea of justice to be such a treatment of the person or goods of another as is according to law hath not a clear and distinct idea what law is which makes a part of his complex idea of justice it is plain his idea of justice itself will be confused and imperfect this exactness will perhaps be judged very troublesome and therefore most men will think they may be excused from settling the complex ideas of mixed modes so precisely in their minds but yet i must say till this be done it must not be wondered that they have a great deal of obscurity and confusion in their own minds and a great deal of wrangling in their discourse with others    0 and distinct and conformable ideas in words that stand for substances  in the names of substances for a right use of them something more is required than barely determined ideas in these the names must also be conformable to things as they exist but of this i shall have occasion to speak more at large by and by this exactness is absolutely necessary in inquiries after philosophical knowledge and in controversies about truth and though it would be well too if it extended itself to common conversation and the ordinary affairs of life yet i think that is scarce to be expected vulgar notions suit vulgar discourses and both though confused enough yet serve pretty well the market and the wake merchants and lovers cooks and tailors have words wherewithal to dispatch their ordinary affairs and so i think might philosophers and disputants too if they had a mind to understand and to clearly understood      third remedy to apply words to such ideas as common use has annexed them to  thirdly it is not enough that men have ideas determined ideas for which they make these signs stand but they must also take care to apply their words as near as may be to such ideas as common use has annexed them to for words especially of languages already framed being no mans private possession but the common measure of commerce and communication it is not for any one at pleasure to change the stamp they are current in nor alter the ideas they are affixed to or at least when there is a necessity to do so he is bound to give notice of it mens intentions in speaking are or at least should be to be understood which cannot be without frequent explanations demands and other the like incommodious interruptions where men do not follow common use propriety of speech is that which gives our thoughts entrance into other mens minds with the greatest ease and advantage and therefore deserves some part of our care and study especially in the names of moral words the proper signification and use of terms is best to be learned from those who in their writings and discourses appear to have had the clearest notions and applied to them their terms with the exactest choice and fitness this way of using a mans words according to the propriety of the language though it have not always the good fortune to be understood yet most commonly leaves the blame of it on him who is so unskilful in the language he speaks as not to understand it when made use of as it ought to be      fourth remedy to declare the meaning in which we use them  fourthly but because common use has not so visibly annexed any signification to words as to make men know always certainly what they precisely stand for and because men in the improvement of their knowledge come to have ideas different from the vulgar and ordinary received ones for which they must either make new words which men seldom venture to do for fear of being thought guilty of affectation or novelty or else must use old ones in a new signification therefore after the observation of the foregoing rules it is sometimes necessary for the ascertaining the signification of words to declare their meaning where either common use has left it uncertain and loose as it has in most names of very complex ideas or where the term being very material in the discourse and that upon which it chiefly turns is liable to any doubtfulness or mistake      and that in three ways  as the ideas mens words stand for are of different sorts so the way of making known the ideas they stand for when there is occasion is also different for though defining be thought the proper way to make known the proper signification of words yet there are some words that will not be defined as there are others whose precise meaning cannot be made known but by definition and perhaps a third which partake somewhat of both the other as we shall see in the names of simple ideas modes and substances      in simple ideas either by synonymous terms or by showing examples  i first when a man makes use of the name of any simple idea which he perceives is not understood or is in danger to be mistaken he is obliged by the laws of ingenuity and the end of speech to declare his meaning and make known what idea he makes it stand for this as has been shown cannot be done by definition and therefore when a synonymous word fails to do it there is but one of these ways left first sometimes the naming the subject wherein that simple idea is to be found will make its name to be understood by those who are acquainted with that subject and know it by that name so to make a countryman understand what feuillemorte colour signifies it may suffice to tell him it is the colour of withered leaves falling in autumn secondly but the only sure way of making known the signification of the name of any simple idea is by presenting to his senses that subject which may produce it in his mind and make him actually have the idea that word stands for      in mixed modes by definition  ii secondly mixed modes especially those belonging to morality being most of them such combinations of ideas as the mind puts together of its own choice and whereof there are not always standing patterns to be found existing the signification of their names cannot be made known as those of simple ideas by any showing but in recompense thereof may be perfectly and exactly defined for they being combinations of several ideas that the mind of man has arbitrarily put together without reference to any archetypes men may if they please exactly know the ideas that go to each composition and so both use these words in a certain and undoubted signification and perfectly declare when there is occasion what they stand for this if well considered would lay great blame on those who make not their discourses about moral things very clear and distinct for since the precise signification of the names of mixed modes or which is all one the real essence of each species is to be known they being not of natures but mans making it is a great negligence and perverseness to discourse of moral things with uncertainty and obscurity which is more pardonable in treating of natural substances where doubtful terms are hardly to be avoided for a quite contrary reason as we shall see by and by      morality capable of demonstration  upon this ground it is that i am bold to think that morality is capable of demonstration as well as mathematics since the precise real essence of the things moral words stand for may be perfectly known and so the congruity and incongruity of the things themselves be certainly discovered in which consists perfect knowledge nor let any one object that the names of substances are often to be made use of in morality as well as those of modes from which will arise obscurity for as to substances when concerned in moral discourses their divers natures are not so much inquired into as supposed vg when we say that man is subject to law we mean nothing by man but a corporeal rational creature what the real essence or other qualities of that creature are in this case is no way considered and therefore whether a child or changeling be a man in a physical sense may amongst the naturalists be as disputable as it will it concerns not at all the moral man as i may call him which is this immovable unchangeable idea a corporeal rational being for were there a monkey or any other creature to be found that had the use of reason to such a degree as to be able to understand general signs and to deduce consequences about general ideas he would no doubt be subject to law and in that sense be a man how much soever he differed in shape from others of that name the names of substances if they be used in them as they should can no more disturb moral than they do mathematical discourses where if the mathematician speaks of a cube or globe of gold or of any other body he has his clear settled idea which varies not though it may by mistake be applied to a particular body to which it belongs not      definitions can make moral discourse clear  this i have here mentioned by the by to show of what consequence it is for men in their names of mixed modes and consequently in all their moral discourses to define their words when there is occasion since thereby moral knowledge may be brought to so great clearness and certainty and it must be great want of ingenuousness to say no worse of it to refuse to do it since a definition is the only way whereby the precise meaning of moral words can be known and yet a way whereby their meaning may be known certainly and without leaving any room for any contest about it and therefore the negligence or perverseness of mankind cannot be excused if their discourses in morality be not much more clear than those in natural philosophy since they are about ideas in the mind which are none of them false or disproportionate they having no external beings for the archetypes which they are referred to and must correspond with it is far easier for men to frame in their minds an idea which shall be the standard to which they will give the name justice with which pattern so made all actions that agree shall pass under that denomination than having seen aristides to frame an idea that shall in all things be exactly like him who is as he is let men make what idea they please of him for the one they need but know the combination of ideas that are put together in their own minds for the other they must inquire into the whole nature and abstruse hidden constitution and various qualities of a thing existing without them      and is the only way in which the meaning of mixed modes can be made known  another reason that makes the defining of mixed modes so necessary especially of moral words is what i mentioned a little before viz that it is the only way whereby the signification of the most of them can be known with certainty for the ideas they stand for being for the most part such whose component parts nowhere exist together but scattered and mingled with others it is the mind alone that collects them and gives them the union of one idea and it is only by words enumerating the several simple ideas which the mind has united that we can make known to others what their names stand for the assistance of the senses in this case not helping us by the proposal of sensible objects to show the ideas which our names of this kind stand for as it does often in the names of sensible simple ideas and also to some degree in those of substances      in substances both by showing and by defining  iii thirdly for the explaining the signification of the names of substances as they stand for the ideas we have of their distinct species both the forementioned ways viz of showing and defining are requisite in many cases to be made use of for there being ordinarily in each sort some leading qualities to which we suppose the other ideas which make up our complex idea of that species annexed we forwardly give the specific name to that thing wherein that characteristic mark is found which we take to be the most distinguishing idea of that species these leading or characteristical as i may call them ideas in the sorts of animals and vegetables are as has been before remarked ch vi section    and ch ix section    mostly figure and in inanimate bodies colour and in some both together now    0 ideas of the leading qualities of substances are best got by showing  these leading sensible qualities are those which make the chief ingredients of our specific ideas and consequently the most observable and invariable part in the definitions of our specific names as attributed to sorts of substances coming under our knowledge for though the sound man in its own nature be as apt to signify a complex idea made up of animality and rationality united in the same subject as to signify any other combination yet used as a mark to stand for a sort of creatures we count of our own kind perhaps the outward shape is as necessary to be taken into our complex idea signified by the word man as any other we find in it and therefore why platos animal implume bipes latis unguibus should not be a good definition of the name man standing for that sort of creatures will not be easy to show for it is the shape as the leading quality that seems more to determine that species than a faculty of reasoning which appears not at first and in some never and if this be not allowed to be so i do not know how they can be excused from murder who kill monstrous births as we call them because of an unordinary shape without knowing whether they have a rational soul or no which can be no more discerned in a wellformed than illshaped infant as soon as born and who is it has informed us that a rational soul can inhabit no tenement unless it has just such a sort of frontispiece or can join itself to and inform no sort of body but one that is just of such an outward structure      and can hardly be made known otherwise  now these leading qualities are best made known by showing and can hardly be made known otherwise for the shape of a horse or cassowary will be but rudely and imperfectly imprinted on the mind by words the sight of the animals doth it a thousand times better and the idea of the particular colour of gold is not to be got by any description of it but only by the frequent exercise of the eyes about as is evident in those who are used to this metal who frequently distinguish true from counterfeit pure from adulterate by the sight where others who have as good eyes but yet by use have not got the precise nice idea of that peculiar yellow shall not perceive any difference the like may be said of those other simple ideas peculiar in their kind to any substance for which precise ideas there are no peculiar names the particular ringing sound there is in gold distinct from the sound of other bodies has no particular name annexed to it no more than the particular yellow that belongs to that metal      the ideas of the powers of substances are best known by definition  but because many of the simple ideas that make up our specific ideas of substances are powers which lie not obvious to our senses in the things as they ordinarily appear therefore in the signification of our names of substances some part of the signification will be better made known by enumerating those simple ideas than by showing the substance itself for he that to the yellow shining colour of gold got by sight shall from my enumerating them have the ideas of great ductility fusibility fixedness and solubility in aqua regia will have a perfecter idea of gold than he can have by seeing a piece of gold and thereby imprinting in his mind only its obvious qualities but if the formal constitution of this shining heavy ductile thing from whence all these its properties flow lay open to our senses as the formal constitution or essence of a triangle does the signification of the word gold might as easily be ascertained as that of triangle      a reflection on the knowledge of corporeal things possessed by spirits separate from bodies  hence we may take notice how much the foundation of all our knowledge of corporeal things lies in our senses for how spirits separate from bodies whose knowledge and ideas of these things are certainly much more perfect than ours know them we have no notion no idea at all the whole extent of our knowledge or imagination reaches not beyond our own ideas limited to our ways of perception though yet it be not to be doubted that spirits of a higher rank than those immersed in flesh may have as clear ideas of the radical constitution of substances as we have of a triangle and so perceive how all their properties and operations flow from thence but the manner how they come by that knowledge exceeds our conceptions      ideas of substances must also be conformable to things  fourthly but though definitions will serve to explain the names of substances as they stand for our ideas yet they leave them not without great imperfection as they stand for things for our names of substances being not put barely for our ideas but being made use of ultimately to represent things and so are put in their place their signification must agree with the truth of things as well as with mens ideas and therefore in substances we are not always to rest in the ordinary complex idea commonly received as the signification of that word but must go a little further and inquire into the nature and properties of the things themselves and thereby perfect as much as we can our ideas of their distinct species or else learn them from such as are used to that sort of things and are experienced in them for since it is intended their names should stand for such collections of simple ideas as do really exist in things themselves as well as for the complex idea in other mens minds which in their ordinary acceptation they stand for therefore to define their names right natural history is to be inquired into and their properties are with care and examination to be found out for it is not enough for the avoiding inconveniences in discourse and arguings about natural bodies and substantial things to have learned from the propriety of the language the common but confused or very imperfect idea to which each word is applied and to keep them to that idea in our use of them but we must by acquainting ourselves with the history of that sort of things rectify and settle our complex idea belonging to each specific name and in discourse with others if we find them mistake us we ought to tell what the complex idea is that we make such a name stand for this is the more necessary to be done by all those who search after knowledge and philosophical verity in that children being taught words whilst they have but imperfect notions of things apply them at random and without much thinking and seldom frame determined ideas to be signified by them which custom it being easy and serving well enough for the ordinary affairs of life and conversation they are apt to continue when they are men and so begin at the wrong end learning words first and perfectly but make the notions to which they apply those words afterwards very overtly by this means it comes to pass that men speaking the language of their country ie according to grammar rules of that language do yet speak very improperly of things themselves and by their arguing one with another make but small progress in the discoveries of useful truths and the knowledge of things as they are to be found in themselves and not in our imaginations and it matters not much for the improvement of our knowledge how they are called      not easy to be made so  it were therefore to be wished that men versed in physical inquiries and acquainted with the several sorts of natural bodies would set down those simple ideas wherein they observe the individuals of each sort constantly to agree this would remedy a great deal of that confusion which comes from several persons applying the same name to a collection of a smaller or greater number of sensible qualities proportionably as they have been more or less acquainted with or accurate in examining the qualities of any sort of things which come under one denomination but a dictionary of this sort containing as it were a natural history requires too many hands as well as too much time cost pains and sagacity ever to be hoped for and till that be done we must content ourselves with such definitions of the names of substances as explain the sense men use them in and it would be well where there is occasion if they would afford us so much this yet is not usually done but men talk to one another and dispute in words whose meaning is not agreed between them out of a mistake that the significations of common words are certainly established and the precise ideas they stand for perfectly known and that it is a shame to be ignorant of them both which suppositions are false no names of complex ideas having so settled determined significations that they are constantly used for the same precise ideas nor is it a shame for a man to have a certain knowledge of anything but by the necessary ways of attaining it and so it is no discredit not to know what precise idea any sound stands for in another mans mind without he declare it to me by some other way than barely using that sound there being no other way without such a declaration certainly to know it indeed the necessity of communication by language brings men to an agreement in the signification of common words within some tolerable latitude that may serve for ordinary conversation and so a man cannot be supposed wholly ignorant of the ideas which are annexed to words by common use in a language familiar to him but common use being but a very uncertain rule which reduces itself at last to the ideas of particular men proves often but a very variable standard but though such a dictionary as i have above mentioned will require too much time cost and pains to be hoped for in this age yet methinks it is not unreasonable to propose that words standing for things which are known and distinguished by their outward shapes should be expressed by little draughts and prints made of them a vocabulary made after this fashion would perhaps with more ease and in less time teach the true signification of many terms especially in languages of remote countries or ages and settle truer ideas in mens minds of several things whereof we read the names in ancient authors than all the large and laborious comments of learned critics naturalists that treat of plants and animals have found the benefit of this way and he that has had occasion to consult them will have reason to confess that he has a clearer idea of apium or ibex from a little print of that herb or beast than he could have from a long definition of the names of either of them and so no doubt he would have of strigil and sistrum if instead of currycomb and cymbal which are the english names dictionaries render them by he could see stamped in the margin small pictures of these instruments as they were in use amongst the ancients toga tunica pallium are words easily translated by gown coat and cloak but we have thereby no more true ideas of the fashion of those habits amongst the romans than we have of the faces of the tailors who made them such things as these which the eye distinguishes by their shapes would be best let into the mind by draughts made of them and more determine the signification of such words than any other words set for them or made use of to define them but this is only by the bye      v fifth remedy to use the same word constantly in the same sense  fifthly if men will not be at the pains to declare the meaning of their words and definitions of their terms are not to be had yet this is the least that can be expected that in all discourses wherein one man pretends to instruct or convince another he should use the same word constantly in the same sense if this were done which nobody can refuse without great disingenuity many of the books extant might be spared many of the controversies in dispute would be at an end several of those great volumes swollen with ambiguous words now used in one sense and by and by in another would shrink into a very narrow compass and many of the philosophers to mention no other as well as poets works might be contained in a nutshell      when not so used the variation is to be explained  but after all the provision of words is so scanty in respect to that infinite variety of thoughts that men wanting terms to suit their precise notions will notwithstanding their utmost caution be forced often to use the same word in somewhat different senses and though in the continuation of a discourse or the pursuit of an argument there can be hardly room to digress into a particular definition as often as a man varies the signification of any term yet the import of the discourse will for the most part if there be no designed fallacy sufficiently lead candid and intelligent readers into the true meaning of it but where there is not sufficient to guide the reader there it concerns the writer to explain his meaning and show in what sense he there uses that term     book iv  of knowledge and probability synopsis of the fourth book  lockes review of the different sorts of ideas or appearances of what exists that can be entertained in a human understanding and of their relations to words leads in the fourth book to an investigation of the extent and validity of the knowledge that our ideas bring within our reach and into the nature of faith in probability by which assent is extended beyond knowledge for the conduct of life he finds ch i ii that knowledge is either an intuitive a demonstrative or a sensuous perception of absolute certainty in regard to one or other of four sorts of agreement or disagreement on the part of ideas  of each idea with itself as identical and different from every other   in their abstract relations to one another   in their necessary connexions as qualities and powers coexisting in concrete substances and   as revelations to us of the final realities of existence the unconditional certainty that constitutes knowledge is perceptible by man only in regard to the first second and fourth of these four sorts in all general propositions only in regard to the first and second that is to say in identical propositions and in those which express abstract relations of simple or mixed modes in which nominal and real essences coincide e g propositions in pure mathematics and abstract morality chh iii vviii the fourth sort which express certainty as to realities of existence

conversant about our ideas only  since the mind in all its thoughts and reasonings hath no other immediate object but its own ideas which it alone does or can contemplate it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them     knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas  knowledge then seems to me to be nothing but the perception of the connexion of and agreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas in this alone it consists  where this perception is there is knowledge and where it is not there though we may fancy guess or believe yet we always come short of knowledge for when we know that white is not black what do we else but perceive that these two ideas do not agree when we possess ourselves with the utmost security of the demonstration that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones what do we more but perceive that equality to two right ones does necessarily agree to and is inseparable from the three angles of a triangle     this agreement or disagreement may be any of four sorts  but to understand a little more distinctly wherein this agreement or disagreement consists i think we may reduce it all to these four sorts  i identity or diversity ii relation iii coexistence or necessary connexion iv real existence     first of identity or diversity in ideas  first as to the first sort of agreement or disagreement viz identity or diversity it is the first act of the mind when it has any sentiments or ideas at all to perceive its ideas and so far as it perceives them to know each what it is and thereby also to perceive their difference and that one is not another this is so absolutely necessary that without it there could be no knowledge no reasoning no imagination no distinct thoughts at all by this the mind clearly and infallibly perceives each idea to agree with itself and to be what it is and all distinct ideas to disagree i e the one not to be the other and this it does without pains labour or deduction but at first view by its natural power of perception and distinction and though men of art have reduced this into those general rules what is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be for ready application in all cases wherein there may be occasion to reflect on it yet it is certain that the first exercise of this faculty is about particular ideas a man infallibly knows as soon as ever he has them in his mind that the ideas he calls white and round are the very ideas they are and that they are not other ideas which he calls red or square nor can any maxim or proposition in the world make him know it clearer or surer than he did before and without any such general rule this then is the first agreement or disagreement which the mind perceives in its ideas which it always perceives at first sight and if there ever happen any doubt about it it will always be found to be about the names and not the ideas themselves whose identity and diversity will always be perceived as soon and clearly as the ideas themselves are nor can it possibly be otherwise     secondly of abstract relations between ideas  secondly the next sort of agreement or disagreement the mind perceives in any of its ideas may i think be called relative and is nothing but the perception of the relation between any two ideas of what kind soever whether substances modes or any other for since all distinct ideas must eternally be known not to be the same and so be universally and constantly denied one of another there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all if we could not perceive any relation between our ideas and find out the agreement or disagreement they have one with another in several ways the mind takes of comparing them     thirdly of their necessary coexistence in substances  thirdly the third sort of agreement or disagreement to be found in our ideas which the perception of the mind is employed about is coexistence or noncoexistence in the same subject and this belongs particularly to substances thus when we pronounce concerning gold that it is fixed our knowledge of this truth amounts to no more but this that fixedness or a power to remain in the fire unconsumed is an idea that always accompanies and is joined with that particular sort of yellowness weight fusibility malleableness and solubility in aqua regia which make our complex idea signified by the word gold     fourthly of real existence agreeing to any idea  fourthly the fourth and last sort is that of actual real existence agreeing to any idea  within these four sorts of agreement or disagreement is i suppose contained all the knowledge we have or are capable of for all the inquiries we can make concerning any of our ideas all that we know or can affirm concerning any of them is that it is or is not the same with some other that it does or does not always coexist with some other idea in the same subject that it has this or that relation with some other idea or that it has a real existence without the mind thus blue is not yellow is of identity two triangles upon equal bases between two parallels are equal is of relation iron is susceptible of magnetical impressions is of coexistence god is is of real existence though identity and coexistence are truly nothing but relations yet they are such peculiar ways of agreement or disagreement of our ideas that they deserve well to be considered as distinct heads and not under relation in general since they are so different grounds of affirmation and negation as will easily appear to any one who will but reflect on what is said in several places of this essay  i should now proceed to examine the several degrees of our knowledge but that it is necessary first to consider the different acceptations of the word knowledge     knowledge is either actual or habitual  there are several ways wherein the mind is possessed of truth each of which is called knowledge  i there is actual knowledge which is the present view the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas or of the relation they have one to another  ii a man is said to know any proposition which having been once laid before his thoughts he evidently perceived the agreement or disagreement of the ideas whereof it consists and so lodged it in his memory that whenever that proposition comes again to be reflected on he without doubt or hesitation embraces the right side assents to and is certain of the truth of it this i think one may call habitual knowledge and thus a man may be said to know all those truths which are lodged in his memory by a foregoing clear and full perception whereof the mind is assured past doubt as often as it has occasion to reflect on them for our finite understandings being able to think clearly and distinctly but on one thing at once if men had no knowledge of any more than what they actually thought on they would all be very ignorant and he that knew most would know but one truth that being all he was able to think on at one time     habitual knowledge is of two degrees  of habitual knowledge there are also vulgarly speaking two degrees  first the one is of such truths laid up in the memory as whenever they occur to the mind it actually perceives the relation is between those ideas and this is in all those truths whereof we have an intuitive knowledge where the ideas themselves by an immediate view discover their agreement or disagreement one with another  secondly the other is of such truths whereof the mind having been convinced it retains the memory of the conviction without the proofs thus a man that remembers certainly that he once perceived the demonstration that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones is certain that he knows it because he cannot doubt the truth of it in his adherence to a truth where the demonstration by which it was at first known is forgot though a man may be thought rather to believe his memory than really to know and this way of entertaining a truth seemed formerly to me like something between opinion and knowledge a sort of assurance which exceeds bare belief for that relies on the testimony of anotheryet upon a due examination i find it comes not short of perfect certainty and is in effect true knowledge that which is apt to mislead our first thoughts into a mistake in this matter is that the agreement or disagreement of the ideas in this case is not perceived as it was at first by an actual view of all the intermediate ideas whereby the agreement or disagreement of those in the proposition was at first perceived but by other intermediate ideas that show the agreement or disagreement of the ideas contained in the proposition whose certainty we remember for example in this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones one who has seen and clearly perceived the demonstration of this truth knows it to be true when that demonstration is gone out of his mind so that at present it is not actually in view and possibly cannot be recollected but he knows it in a different way from what he did before the agreement of the two ideas joined in that proposition is perceived but it is by the intervention of other ideas than those which at first produced that perception he remembers ie he knows for remembrance is but the reviving of some past knowledge that he was once certain of the truth of this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones the immutability of the same relations between the same immutable things is now the idea that shows him that if the three angles of a triangle were once equal to two right ones they will always be equal to two right ones and hence he comes to be certain that what was once true in the case is always true what ideas once agreed will always agree and consequently what he once knew to be true he will always know to be true as long as he can remember that he once knew it upon this ground it is that particular demonstrations in mathematics afford general knowledge if then the perception that the same ideas will eternally have the same habitudes and relations be not a sufficient ground of knowledge there could be no knowledge of general propositions in mathematics for no mathematical demonstration would be any other than particular and when a man had demonstrated any proposition concerning one triangle or circle his knowledge would not reach beyond that particular diagram if he would extend it further he must renew his demonstration in another instance before he could know it to be true in another like triangle and so on by which means one could never come to the knowledge of any general propositions nobody i think can deny that mr newton certainly knows any proposition that he now at any time reads in his book to be true though he has not in actual view that admirable chain of intermediate ideas whereby he at first discovered it to be true such a memory as that able to retain such a train of particulars may be well thought beyond the reach of human faculties when the very discovery perception and laying together that wonderful connexion of ideas is found to surpass most readers comprehension but yet it is evident the author himself knows the proposition to be true remembering he once saw the connexion of those ideas as certainly as he knows such a man wounded another remembering that he saw him run him through but because the memory is not always so clear as actual perception and does in all men more or less decay in length of time this amongst other differences is one which shows that demonstrative knowledge is much more imperfect than intuitive as we shall see in the following chapter     chapter ii  of the degrees of our knowledge     of the degrees or differences in clearness of our knowledge i intuitive  all our knowledge consisting as i have said in the view the mind has of its own ideas which is the utmost light and greatest certainty we with our faculties and in our way of knowledge are capable of it may not be amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence the different clearness of our knowledge seems to me to lie in the different way of perception the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas for if we will reflect on our own ways of thinking we will find that sometimes the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately by themselves without the intervention of any other and this i think we may call intuitive knowledge for in this the mind is at no pains of proving or examining but perceives the truth as the eye doth light only by being directed towards it thus the mind perceives that white is not black that a circle is not a triangle that three are more than two and equal to one and two such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the ideas together by bare intuition without the intervention of any other idea and this kind of knowledge is the clearest and most certain that human frailty is capable of this part of knowledge is irresistible and like bright sunshine forces itself immediately to be perceived as soon as ever the mind turns its view that way and leaves no room for hesitation doubt or examination but the mind is presently filled with the clear light of it it is on this intuition that depends all the certainty and evidence of all our knowledge which certainty every one finds to be so great that he cannot imagine and therefore not require a greater for a man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater certainty than to know that any idea in his mind is such as he perceives it to be and that two ideas wherein he perceives a difference are different and not precisely the same he that demands a greater certainty than this demands he knows not what and shows only that he has a mind to be a sceptic without being able to be so certainty depends so wholly on this intuition that in the next degree of knowledge which i call demonstrative this intuition is necessary in all the connexions of the intermediate ideas without which we cannot attain knowledge and certainty     ii demonstrative  the next degree of knowledge is where the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of any ideas but not immediately though wherever the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas there be certain knowledge yet it does not always happen that the mind sees that agreement or disagreement which there is between them even where it is discoverable and in that case remains in ignorance and at most gets no further than a probable conjecture the reason why the mind cannot always perceive presently the agreement or disagreement of two ideas is because those ideas concerning whose agreement or disagreement the inquiry is made cannot by the mind be so put together as to show it in this case then when the mind cannot so bring its ideas together as by their immediate comparison and as it were juxtaposition or application one to another to perceive their agreement or disagreement it is fain by the intervention of other ideas one or more as it happens to discover the agreement or disagreement which it searches and this is that which we call reasoning thus the mind being willing to know the agreement or disagreement in bigness between the three angles of a triangle and two right ones cannot by an immediate view and comparing them do it because the three angles of a triangle cannot be brought at once and be compared with any other one or two angles and so of this the mind has no immediate no intuitive knowledge in this case the mind is fain to find out some other angles to which the three angles of a triangle have an equality and finding those equal to two right ones comes to know their equality to two right ones     demonstration depends on clearly perceived proofs  those intervening ideas which serve to show the agreement of any two others are called proofs and where the agreement and disagreement is by this means plainly and clearly perceived it is called demonstration it being shown to the understanding and the mind made to see that it is so a quickness in the mind to find out these intermediate ideas that shall discover the agreement or disagreement of any other and to apply them right is i suppose that which is called sagacity     as certain but not so easy and ready as intuitive knowledge  this knowledge by intervening proofs though it be certain yet the evidence of it is not altogether so clear and bright nor the assent so ready as in intuitive knowledge for though in demonstration the mind does at last perceive the agreement or disagreement of the ideas it considers yet it is not without pains and attention there must be more than one transient view to find it a steady application and pursuit are required to this discovery and there must be a progression by steps and degrees before the mind can in this way arrive at certainty and come to perceive the agreement or repugnancy between two ideas that need proofs and the use of reason to show it     the demonstrated conclusion not without doubt precedent to the demonstration  another difference between intuitive and demonstrative knowledge is that though in the latter all doubt be removed when by the intervention of the intermediate ideas the agreement or disagreement is perceived yet before the demonstration there was a doubt which in intuitive knowledge cannot happen to the mind that has its faculty of perception left to a degree capable of distinct ideas no more than it can be a doubt to the eye that can distinctly see white and black whether this ink and this paper be all of a colour if there be sight in the eyes it will at first glimpse without hesitation perceive the words printed on this paper different from the colour of the paper and so if the mind have the faculty of distinct perception it will perceive the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that produce intuitive knowledge if the eyes have lost the faculty of seeing or the mind of perceiving we in vain inquire after the quickness of sight in one or clearness of perception in the other     not so clear as intuitive knowledge  it is true the perception produced by demonstration is also very clear yet it is often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full assurance that always accompany that which i call intuitive like a face reflected by several mirrors one to another where as long as it retains the similitude and agreement with the object it produces a knowledge but it is still in every successive reflection with a lessening of that perfect clearness and distinctness which is in the first till at last after many removes it has a great mixture of dimness and is not at first sight so knowable especially to weak eyes thus it is with knowledge made out by a long train of proof     each step in demonstrated knowledge must have intuitive evidence  now in every step reason makes in demonstrative knowledge there is an intuitive knowledge of that agreement or disagreement it seeks with the next intermediate idea which it uses as a proof for if it were not so that yet would need a proof since without the perception of such agreement or disagreement there is no knowledge produced if it be perceived by itself it is intuitive knowledge if it cannot be perceived by itself there is need of some intervening idea as a common measure to show their agreement or disagreement by which it is plain that every step in reasoning that produces knowledge has intuitive certainty which when the mind perceives there is no more required but to remember it to make the agreement or disagreement of the ideas concerning which we inquire visible and certain so that to make anything a demonstration it is necessary to perceive the immediate agreement of the intervening ideas whereby the agreement or disagreement of the two ideas under examination whereof the one is always the first and the other the last in the account is found this intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate ideas in each step and progression of the demonstration must also be carried exactly in the mind and a man must be sure that no part is left out which because in long deductions and the use of many proofs the memory does not always so readily and exactly retain therefore it comes to pass that this is more imperfect than intuitive knowledge and men embrace often falsehood for demonstrations     hence the mistake ex praecognitis et praeconcessis  the necessity of this intuitive knowledge in each step of scientifical or demonstrative reasoning gave occasion i imagine to that mistaken axiom that all reasoning was ex praecognitis et praeconcessis which how far it is a mistake i shall have occasion to show more at large when i come to consider propositions and particularly those propositions which are called maxims and to show that it is by a mistake that they are supposed to be the foundations of all our knowledge and reasonings     demonstration not limited to ideas of mathematical quantity  it has been generally taken for granted that mathematics alone are capable of demonstrative certainty but to have such an agreement or disagreement as may intuitively be perceived being as i imagine not the privilege of the ideas of number extension and figure alone it may possibly be the want of due method and application in us and not of sufficient evidence in things that demonstration has been thought to have so little to do in other parts of knowledge and been scarce so much as aimed at by any but mathematicians for whatever ideas we have wherein the mind can perceive the immediate agreement or disagreement that is between them there the mind is capable of intuitive knowledge and where it can perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by an intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement they have with any intermediate ideas there the mind is capable of demonstration which is not limited to ideas of extension figure number and their modes    0 why it has been thought to be so limited  the reason why it has been generally sought for and supposed to be only in those i imagine has been not only the general usefulness of those sciences but because in comparing their equality or excess the modes of numbers have every the least difference very clear and perceivable and though in extension every the least excess is not so perceptible yet the mind has found out ways to examine and discover demonstratively the just equality of two angles or extensions or figures and both these i e numbers and figures can be set down by visible and lasting marks wherein the ideas under consideration are perfectly determined which for the most part they are not where they are marked only by names and words      modes of qualities not demonstrable like modes of quantity  but in other simple ideas whose modes and differences are made and counted by degrees and not quantity we have not so nice and accurate a distinction of their differences as to perceive or find ways to measure their just equality or the least differences for those other simple ideas being appearances of sensations produced in us by the size figure number and motion of minute corpuscles singly insensible their different degrees also depend upon the variation of some or of all those causes which since it cannot be observed by us in particles of matter whereof each is too subtile to be perceived it is impossible for us to have any exact measures of the different degrees of these simple ideas for supposing the sensation or idea we name whiteness be produced in us by a certain number of globules which having a verticity about their own centres strike upon the retina of the eye with a certain degree of rotation as well as progressive swiftness it will hence easily follow that the more the superficial parts of any body are so ordered as to reflect the greater number of globules of light and to give them the proper rotation which is fit to produce this sensation of white in us the more white will that body appear that from an equal space sends to the retina the greater number of such corpuscles with that peculiar sort of motion i do not say that the nature of light consists in very small round globules nor of whiteness in such a texture of parts as gives a certain rotation to these globules when it reflects them for i am not now treating physically of light or colours but this i think i may say that i cannot and i would be glad any one would make intelligible that he did conceive how bodies without us can any ways affect our senses but by the immediate contact of the sensible bodies themselves as in tasting and feeling or the impulse of some sensible particles coming from them as in seeing hearing and smelling by the different impulse of which parts caused by their different size figure and motion the variety of sensations is produced in us      particles of light and simple ideas of colour  whether then they be globules or no or whether they have a verticity about their own centres that produces the idea of whiteness in us this is certain that the more particles of light are reflected from a body fitted to give them that peculiar motion which produces the sensation of whiteness in us and possibly too the quicker that peculiar motion isthe whiter does the body appear from which the greatest number are reflected as is evident in the same piece of paper put in the sunbeams in the shade and in a dark hole in each of which it will produce in us the idea of whiteness in far different degrees      the secondary qualities of things not discovered by demonstration  not knowing therefore what number of particles nor what motion of them is fit to produce any precise degree of whiteness we cannot demonstrate the certain equality of any two degrees of whiteness because we have no certain standard to measure them by nor means to distinguish every the least real difference the only help we have being from our senses which in this point fail us but where the difference is so great as to produce in the mind clearly distinct ideas whose differences can be perfectly retained there these ideas or colours as we see in different kinds as blue and red are as capable of demonstration as ideas of number and extension what i have here said of whiteness and colours i think holds true in all secondary qualities and their modes      iii sensitive knowledge of the particular existence of finite beings without us  these two viz intuition and demonstration are the degrees of our knowledge whatever comes short of one of these with what assurance soever embraced is but faith or opinion but not knowledge at least in all general truths there is indeed another perception of the mind employed about the particular existence of finite beings without us which going beyond bare probability and yet not reaching perfectly to either of the foregoing degrees of certainty passes under the name of knowledge there can be nothing more certain than that the idea we receive from an external object is in our minds this is intuitive knowledge but whether there be anything more than barely that idea in our minds whether we can thence certainly infer the existence of anything without us which corresponds to that idea is that whereof some men think there may be a question made because men may have such ideas in their minds when no such thing exists no such object affects their senses but yet here i think we are provided with an evidence that puts us past doubting for i ask any one whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different perception when he looks on the sun by day and thinks on it by night when he actually tastes wormwood or smells a rose or only thinks on that savour or odour we as plainly find the difference there is between any idea revived in our minds by our own memory and actually coming into our minds by our senses as we do between any two distinct ideas if any one say a dream may do the same thing and all these ideas may be produced in us without any external objects he may please to dream that i make him this answeri that it is no great matter whether i remove his scruple or no where all is but dream reasoning and arguments are of no use truth and knowledge nothing   that i believe he will allow a very manifest difference between dreaming of being in the fire and being actually in it but yet if he be resolved to appear so sceptical as to maintain that what i call being actually in the fire is nothing but a dream and that we cannot thereby certainly know that any such thing as fire actually exists without us i answer that we certainly finding that pleasure or pain follows upon the application of certain objects to us whose existence we perceive or dream that we perceive by our senses this certainty is as great as our happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment to know or to be so that i think we may add to the two former sorts of knowledge this also of the existence of particular external objects by that perception and consciousness we have of the actual entrance of ideas from them and allow these three degrees of knowledge viz intuitive demonstrative and sensitive in each of which there are different degrees and ways of evidence and certainty      knowledge not always clear where the ideas that enter into it are clear  but since our knowledge is founded on and employed about our ideas only will it not follow from thence that it is conformable to our ideas and that where our ideas are clear and distinct or obscure and confused our knowledge will be so too to which i answer no for our knowledge consisting in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas its clearness or obscurity consists in the clearness or obscurity of that perception and not in the clearness or obscurity of the ideas themselves v g a man that has as clear ideas of the angles of a triangle and of equality to two right ones as any mathematician in the world may yet have but a very obscure perception of their agreement and so have but a very obscure knowledge of it but ideas which by reason of their obscurity or otherwise are confused cannot produce any clear or distinct knowledge because as far as any ideas are confused so far the mind cannot perceive clearly whether they agree or disagree or to express the same thing in a way less apt to be misunderstood he that hath not determined ideas to the words he uses cannot make propositions of them of whose truth he can be certain     chapter iii  of the extent of human knowledge     extent of our knowledge  knowledge as has been said lying in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas it follows from hence that   first it extends no further than we have ideas  first we can have knowledge no further than we have ideas     secondly it extends no further than we can perceive their agreement or disagreement  secondly that we can have no knowledge further than we can have perception of that agreement or disagreement which perception being   either by intuition or the immediate comparing any two ideas or   by reason examining the agreement or disagreement of two ideas by the intervention of some others or   by sensation perceiving the existence of particular things hence it also follows     thirdly intuitive knowledge extends itself not to all the relation of all our ideas  thirdly that we cannot have an intuitive knowledge that shall extend itself to all our ideas and all that we would know about them because we cannot examine and perceive all the relations they have one to another by juxtaposition or an immediate comparison one with another thus having the ideas of an obtuse and an acute angled triangle both drawn from equal bases and between parallels i can by intuitive knowledge perceive the one not to be the other but cannot that way know whether they be equal or no because their agreement or disagreement in equality can never be perceived by an immediate comparing them the difference of figure makes their parts incapable of an exact immediate application and therefore there is need of some intervening qualities to measure them by which is demonstration or rational knowledge     fourthly nor does demonstrative knowledge  fourthly it follows also from what is above observed that our rational knowledge cannot reach to the whole extent of our ideas because between two different ideas we would examine we cannot always find such mediums as we can connect one to another with an intuitive knowledge in all the parts of the deduction and wherever that fails we come short of knowledge and demonstration     fifthly sensitive knowledge narrower than either  fifthly sensitive knowledge reaching no further than the existence of things actually present to our senses is yet much narrower than either of the former     sixthly our knowledge therefore narrower than our ideas  sixthly from all which it is evident that the extent of our knowledge comes not only short of the reality of things but even of the extent of our own ideas though our knowledge be limited to our ideas and cannot exceed them either in extent or perfection and though these be very narrow bounds in respect of the extent of allbeing and far short of what we may justly imagine to be in some even created understandings not tied down to the dull and narrow information that is to be received from some few and not very acute ways of perception such as are our senses yet it would be well with us if our knowledge were but as large as our ideas and there were not many doubts and inquiries concerning the ideas we have whereof we are not nor i believe ever shall be in this world resolved nevertheless i do not question but that human knowledge under the present circumstances of our beings and constitutions may be carried much further than it has hitherto been if men would sincerely and with freedom of mind employ all that industry and labour of thought in improving the means of discovering truth which they do for the colouring or support of falsehood to maintain a system interest or party they are once engaged in but yet after all i think i may without injury to human perfection be confident that our knowledge would never reach to all we might desire to know concerning those ideas we have nor be able to surmount all the difficulties and resolve all the questions that might arise concerning any of them we have the ideas of a square a circle and equality and yet perhaps shall never be able to find a circle equal to a square and certainly know that it is so we have the ideas of matter and thinking but possibly shall never be able to know whether any mere material being thinks or no it being impossible for us by the contemplation of our own ideas without revelation to discover whether omnipotency has not given to some systems of matter fitly disposed a power to perceive and think or else joined and fixed to matter so disposed a thinking immaterial substance it being in respect of our notions not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive that god can if he pleases superadd to matter a faculty of thinking than that he should superadd to it another substance with a faculty of thinking since we know not wherein thinking consists nor to what sort of substances the almighty has been pleased to give that power which cannot be in any created being but merely by the good pleasure and bounty of the creator for i see no contradiction in it that the first eternal thinking being or omnipotent spirit should if he pleased give to certain systems of created senseless matter put together as he thinks fit some degrees of sense perception and thought though as i think i have proved lib iv ch  0 section    c it is no less than a contradiction to suppose matter which is evidently in its own nature void of sense and thought should be that eternal firstthinking being what certainty of knowledge can any one have that some perceptions such as v g pleasure and pain should not be in some bodies themselves after a certain manner modified and moved as well as that they should be in an immaterial substance upon the motion of the parts of body body as far as we can conceive being able only to strike and affect body and motion according to the utmost reach of our ideas being able to produce nothing but motion so that when we allow it to produce pleasure or pain or the idea of a colour or sound we are fain to quit our reason go beyond our ideas and attribute it wholly to the good pleasure of our maker for since we must allow he has annexed effects to motion which we can no way conceive motion able to produce what reason have we to conclude that he could not order them as well to be produced in a subject we cannot conceive capable of them as well as in a subject we cannot conceive the motion of matter can any way operate upon i say not this that i would any way lessen the belief of the souls immateriality i am not here speaking of probability but knowledge and i think not only that it becomes the modesty of philosophy not to pronounce magisterially where we want that evidence that can produce knowledge but also that it is of use to us to discern how far our knowledge does reach for the state we are at present in not being that of vision we must in many things content ourselves with faith and probability and in the present question about the immateriality of the soul if our faculties cannot arrive at demonstrative certainty we need not think it strange all the great ends of morality and religion are well enough secured without philosophical proofs of the souls immateriality since it is evident that he who made us at the beginning to subsist here sensible intelligent beings and for several years continued us in such a state can and will restore us to the like state of sensibility in another world and make us capable there to receive the retribution he has designed to men according to their doings in this life and therefore it is not of such mighty necessity to determine one way or the other as some overzealous for or against the immateriality of the soul have been forward to make the world believe who either on the one side indulging too much their thoughts immersed altogether in matter can allow no existence to what is not material or who on the other side finding not cogitation within the natural powers of matter examined over and over again by the utmost intention of mind have the confidence to concludethat omnipotency itself cannot give perception and thought to a substance which has the modification of solidity he that considers how hardly sensation is in our thoughts reconcilable to extended matter or existence to anything that has no extension at all will confess that he is very far from certainly knowing what his soul is it is a point which seems to me to be put out of the reach of our knowledge and he who will give himself leave to consider freely and look into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis will scarce find his reason able to determine him fixedly for or against the souls materiality since on which side soever he views it either as an unextended substance or as a thinking extended matter the difficulty to conceive either will whilst either alone is in his thoughts still drive him to the contrary side an unfair way which some men take with themselves who because of the inconceivableness of something they find in one throw themselves violently into the contrary hypothesis though altogether as unintelligible to an unbiassed understanding this serves not only to show the weakness and the scantiness of our knowledge but the insignificant triumph of such sort of arguments which drawn from our own views may satisfy us that we can find no certainty on one side of the question but do not at all thereby help us to truth by running into the opposite opinion which on examination will be found clogged with equal difficulties for what safety what advantage to any one is it for the avoiding the seeming absurdities and to him unsurmountable rubs he meets with in one opinion to take refuge in the contrary which is built on something altogether as inexplicable and as far remote from his comprehension it is past controversy that we have in us something that thinks our very doubts about what it is confirm the certainty of its being though we must content ourselves in the ignorance of what kind of being it is and it is in vain to go about to be sceptical in this as it is unreasonable in most other cases to be positive against the being of anything because we cannot comprehend its nature for i would fain know what substance exists that has not something in it which manifestly baffles our understandings other spirits who see and know the nature and inward constitution of things how much must they exceed us in knowledge to which if we add larger comprehension which enables them at one glance to see the connexion and agreement of very many ideas and readily supplies to them the intermediate proofs which we by single and slow steps and long poring in the dark hardly at last find out and are often ready to forget one before we have hunted out another we may guess at some part of the happiness of superior ranks of spirits who have a quicker and more penetrating sight as well as a larger field of knowledge  but to return to the argument in hand our knowledge i say is not only limited to the paucity and imperfections of the ideas we have and which we employ it about but even comes short of that too but how far it reaches let us now inquire     how far our knowledge reaches  the affirmations or negations we make concerning the ideas we have may as i have before intimated in general be reduced to these four sorts viz identity coexistence relation and real existence i shall examine how far our knowledge extends in each of these     firstly our knowledge of identity and diversity in ideas extends as far as our ideas themselves  first as to identity and diversity in this way of agreement or disagreement of our ideas our intuitive knowledge is as far extended as our ideas themselves and there can be no idea in the mind which it does not presently by an intuitive knowledge perceive to be what it is and to be different from any other     secondly of their coexistence extends only a very little way  secondly as to the second sort which is the agreement or disagreement of our ideas in coexistence in this our knowledge is very short though in this consists the greatest and most material part of our knowledge concerning substances for our ideas of the species of substances being as i have showed nothing but certain collections of simple ideas united in one subject and so coexisting together vg our idea of flame is a body hot luminous and moving upward of gold a body heavy to a certain degree yellow malleable and fusible for these or some such complex ideas as these in mens minds do these two names of the different substances flame and gold stand for when we would know anything further concerning these or any other sort of substances what do we inquire but what other qualities or powers these substances have or have not which is nothing else but to know what other simple ideas do or do not coexist with those that make up that complex idea    0 because the connexion between simple ideas in substances is for the most part unknown  this how weighty and considerable a part soever of human science is yet very narrow and scarce any at all the reason whereof is that the simple ideas whereof our complex ideas of substances are made up are for the most part such as carry with them in their own nature no visible necessary connexion or inconsistency with any other simple ideas whose coexistence with them we would inform ourselves about      especially of the secondary qualities of bodies  the ideas that our complex ones of substances are made up of and about which our knowledge concerning substances is most employed are those of their secondary qualities which depending all as has been shown upon the primary qualities of their minute and insensible parts or if not upon them upon something yet more remote from our comprehension it is impossible we should know which have a necessary union or inconsistency one with another for not knowing the root they spring from not knowing what size figure and texture of parts they are on which depend and from which result those qualities which make our complex idea of gold it is impossible we should know what other qualities result from or are incompatible with the same constitution of the insensible parts of gold and so consequently must always coexist with that complex idea we have of it or else are inconsistent with it      because necessary connexion between any secondary and the primary qualities is undiscoverable by us  besides this ignorance of the primary qualities of the insensible parts of bodies on which depend all their secondary qualities there is yet another and more incurable part of ignorance which sets us more remote from a certain knowledge of the coexistence or incoexistence if i may so say of different ideas in the same subject and that is that there is no discoverable connexion between any secondary quality and those primary qualities which it depends on      we have no perfect knowledge of their primary qualities  that the size figure and motion of one body should cause a change in the size figure and motion of another body is not beyond our conception the separation of the parts of one body upon the intrusion of another and the change from rest to motion upon impulse these and the like seem to have some connexion one with another and if we knew these primary qualities of bodies we might have reason to hope we might be able to know a great deal more of these operations of them one upon another but our minds not being able to discover any connexion betwixt these primary qualities of bodies and the sensations that are produced in us by them we can never be able to establish certain and undoubted rules of the consequence or coexistence of any secondary qualities though we could discover the size figure or motion of those invisible parts which immediately produce them we are so far from knowing what figure size or motion of parts produce a yellow colour a sweet taste or a sharp sound that we can by no means conceive how any size figure or motion of any particles can possibly produce in us the idea of any colour taste or sound whatsoever there is no conceivable connexion between the one and the other      and seek in vain for certain and universal knowledge of unperceived qualities in substances  in vain therefore shall we endeavour to discover by our ideas the only true way of certain and universal knowledge what other ideas are to be found constantly joined with that of our complex idea of any substance since we neither know the real constitution of the minute parts on which their qualities do depend nor did we know them could we discover any necessary connexion between them and any of the secondary qualities which is necessary to be done before we can certainly know their necessary coexistence so that let our complex idea of any species of substances be what it will we can hardly from the simple ideas contained in it certainly determine the necessary coexistence of any other quality whatsoever our knowledge in all these inquiries reaches very little further than our experience indeed some few of the primary qualities have a necessary dependence and visible connexion one with another as figure necessarily supposes extension receiving or communicating motion by impulse supposes solidity but though these and perhaps some others of our ideas have yet there are so few of them that have a visible connexion one with another that we can by intuition or demonstration discover the coexistence of very few of the qualities that are to be found united in substances and we are left only to the assistance of our senses to make known to us what qualities they contain for of all the qualities that are coexistent in any subject without this dependence and evident connexion of their ideas one with another we cannot know certainly any two to coexist any further than experience by our senses informs us thus though we see the yellow colour and upon trial find the weight malleableness fusibility and fixedness that are united in a piece of gold yet because no one of these ideas has any evident dependence or necessary connexion with the other we cannot certainly know that where any four of these are the fifth will be there also how highly probable soever it may be because the highest probability amounts not to certainty without which there can be no true knowledge for this coexistence can be no further known than it is perceived and it cannot be perceived but either in particular subjects by the observation of our senses or in general by the necessary connexion of the ideas themselves      of repugnancy to coexist our knowledge is larger  as to the incompatibility or repugnancy to coexistence we may know that any subject may have of each sort of primary qualities but one particular at once vg each particular extension figure number of parts motion excludes all other of each kind the like also is certain of all sensible ideas peculiar to each sense for whatever of each kind is present in any subject excludes all other of that sort vg no one subject can have two smells or two colours at the same time to this perhaps will be said has not an opal or the infusion of lignum nephriticum two colours at the same time to which i answer that these bodies to eyes differently placed may at the same time afford different colours but i take liberty also to say that to eyes differently placed it is different parts of the object that reflect the particles of light and therefore it is not the same part of the object and so not the very same subject which at the same time appears both yellow and azure for it is as impossible that the very same particle of any body should at the same time differently modify or reflect the rays of light as that it should have two different figures and textures at the same time      our knowledge of the coexistence of power in bodies extends but a very little way  but as to the powers of substances to change the sensible qualities of other bodies which make a great part of our inquiries about them and is no inconsiderable branch of our knowledge i doubt as to these whether our knowledge reaches much further than our experience or whether we can come to the discovery of most of these powers and be certain that they are in any subject by the connexion with any of those ideas which to us make its essence because the active and passive powers of bodies and their ways of operating consisting in a texture and motion of parts which we cannot by any means come to discover it is but in very few cases we can be able to perceive their dependence on or repugnance to any of those ideas which make our complex one of that sort of things i have here instanced in the corpuscularian hypothesis as that which is thought to go furthest in an intelligible explication of those qualities of bodies and i fear the weakness of human understanding is scarce able to substitute another which will afford us a fuller and clearer discovery of the necessary connexion and coexistence of the powers which are to be observed united in several sorts of them this at least is certain that whichever hypothesis be clearest and truest for of that it is not my business to determine our knowledge concerning corporeal substances will be very little advanced by any of them till we are made to see what qualities and powers of bodies have a necessary connexion or repugnancy one with another which in the present state of philosophy i think we know but to a very small degree and i doubt whether with those faculties we have we shall ever be able to carry our general knowledge i say not particular experience in this part much further experience is that which in this part we must depend on and it were to be wished that it were more improved we find the advantages some mens generous pains have this way brought to the stock of natural knowledge and if others especially the philosophers by fire who pretend to it had been so wary in their observations and sincere in their reports as those who call themselves philosophers ought to have been our acquaintance with the bodies here about us and our insight into their powers and operations had been yet much greater      of the powers that coexist in spirits yet narrower  if we are at a loss in respect of the powers and operations of bodies i think it is easy to conclude we are much more in the dark in reference to spirits whereof we naturally have no ideas but what we draw from that of our own by reflecting on the operations of our own souls within us as far as they can come within our observation but how inconsiderable a rank the spirits that inhabit our bodies hold amongst those various and possibly innumerable kinds of nobler beings and how far short they come of the endowments and perfections of cherubim and seraphim and infinite sorts of spirits above us is what by a transient hint in another place i have offered to my readers consideration      thirdly of relations between abstracted ideas it is not easy to say how far our knowledge extends  thirdly as to the third sort of our knowledge viz the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas in any other relation this as it is the largest field of our knowledge so it is hard to determine how far it may extend because the advances that are made in this part of knowledge depending on our sagacity in finding intermediate ideas that may show the relations and habitudes of ideas whose coexistence is not considered it is a hard matter to tell when we are at an end of such discoveries and when reason has all the helps it is capable of for the finding of proofs or examining the agreement or disagreement of remote ideas they that are ignorant of algebra cannot imagine the wonders in this kind are to be done by it and what further improvements and helps advantageous to other parts of knowledge the sagacious mind of man may yet find out it is not easy to determine this at least i believe that the ideas of quantity are not those alone that are capable of demonstration and knowledge and that other and perhaps more useful parts of contemplation would afford us certainty if vices passions and domineering interest did not oppose or menace such endeavours   morality capable of demonstration  the idea of a supreme being infinite in power goodness and wisdom whose workmanship we are and on whom we depend and the idea of ourselves as understanding rational creatures being such as are clear in us would i suppose if duly considered and pursued afford such foundations of our duty and rules of action as might place morality amongst the sciences capable of demonstration wherein i doubt not but from selfevident propositions by necessary consequences as incontestible as those in mathematics the measures of right and wrong might be made out to any one that will apply himself with the same indifferency and attention to the one as he does to the other of these sciences the relation of other modes may certainly be perceived as well as those of number and extension and i cannot see why they should not also be capable of demonstration if due methods were thought on to examine or pursue their agreement or disagreement where there is no property there is no injustice is a proposition as certain as any demonstration in euclid for the idea of property being a right to anything and the idea of which the name injustice is given being the invasion or violation of that right it is evident that these ideas being thus established and these names annexed to them i can as certainly know this proposition to be true as that a triangle has three angles equal to two right ones again no government allows absolute liberty the idea of government being the establishment of society upon certain rules or laws which require conformity to them and the idea of absolute liberty being for any one to do whatever he pleases i am as capable of being certain of the truth of this proposition as of any in the mathematics      two things have made moral ideas to be thought incapable of demonstration their unfitness for sensible representation and their complexedness  that which in this respect has given the advantage to the ideas of quantity and made them thought more capable of certainty and demonstration is  first that they can be set down and represented by sensible marks which have a greater and nearer correspondence with them than any words or sounds whatsoever diagrams drawn on paper are copies of the ideas in the mind and not liable to the uncertainty that words carry in their signification an angle circle or square drawn in lines lies open to the view and cannot be mistaken it remains unchangeable and may at leisure be considered and examined and the demonstration be revised and all the parts of it may be gone over more than once without any danger of the least change in the ideas this cannot be thus done in moral ideas we have no sensible marks that resemble them whereby we can set them down we have nothing but words to express them by which though when written they remain the same yet the ideas they stand for may change in the same man and it is very seldom that they are not different in different persons  secondly another thing that makes the greater difficulty in ethics is that moral ideas are commonly more complex than those of the figures ordinarily considered in mathematics from whence these two inconveniences followfirst that their names are of more uncertain signification the precise collection of simple ideas they stand for not being so easily agreed on and so the sign that is used for them in communication always and in thinking often does not steadily carry with it the same idea upon which the same disorder confusion and error follow as would if a man going to demonstrate something of an heptagon should in the diagram he took to do it leave out one of the angles or by oversight make the figure with one angle more than the name ordinarily imported or he intended it should when at first he thought of his demonstration this often happens and is hardly avoidable in very complex moral ideas where the same name being retained one angle ie one simple idea is left out or put in the complex one still called by the same name more at one time than another secondly from the complexedness of these moral ideas there follows another inconvenience viz that the mind cannot easily retain those precise combinations so exactly and perfectly as is necessary in the examination of the habitudes and correspondences agreements or disagreements of several of them one with another especially where it is to be judged of by long deductions and the intervention of several other complex ideas to show the agreement or disagreement of two remote ones  the great help against this which mathematicians find in diagrams and figures which remain unalterable in their draughts is very apparent and the memory would often have great difficulty otherwise to retain them so exactly whilst the mind went over the parts of them step by step to examine their several correspondences and though in casting up a long sum either in addition multiplication or division every part be only a progression of the mind taking a view of its own ideas and considering their agreement or disagreement and the resolution of the question be nothing but the result of the whole made up of such particulars whereof the mind has a clear perception yet without setting down the several parts by marks whose precise significations are known and by marks that last and remain in view when the memory had let them go it would be almost impossible to carry so many different ideas in the mind without confounding or letting slip some parts of the reckoning and thereby making all our reasonings about it useless in which case the cyphers or marks help not the mind at all to perceive the agreement of any two or more numbers their equalities or proportions that the mind has only by intuition of its own ideas of the numbers themselves but the numerical characters are helps to the memory to record and retain the several ideas about which the demonstration is made whereby a man may know how far his intuitive knowledge in surveying several of the particulars has proceeded that so he may without confusion go on to what is yet unknown and at last have in one view before him the result of all his perceptions and reasonings    0 remedies of our difficulties in dealing demonstratively with moral ideas  one part of these disadvantages in moral ideas which has made them be thought not capable of demonstration may in a good measure be remedied by definitions setting down that collection of simple ideas which every term shall stand for and then using the terms steadily and constantly for that precise collection and what methods algebra or something of that kind may hereafter suggest to remove the other difficulties it is not easy to foretell confident i am that if men would in the same method and with the same indifferency search after moral as they do mathematical truths they would find them have a stronger connexion one with another and a more necessary consequence from our clear and distinct ideas and to come nearer perfect demonstration than is commonly imagined but much of this is not to be expected whilst the desire of esteem riches or power makes men espouse the wellendowed opinions in fashion and then seek arguments either to make good their beauty or varnish over and cover their deformity nothing being so beautiful to the eye as truth is to the mind nothing so deformed and irreconcilable to the understanding as a lie for though many a man can with satisfaction enough own a no very handsome wife in his bosom yet who is bold enough openly to avow that he has espoused a falsehood and received into his breast so ugly a thing as a lie whilst the parties of men cram their tenets down all mens throats whom they can get into their power without permitting them to examine their truth or falsehood and will not let truth have fair play in the world nor men the liberty to search after it what improvements can be expected of this kind what greater light can be hoped for in the moral sciences the subject part of mankind in most places might instead thereof with egyptian bondage expect egyptian darkness were not the candle of the lord set up by himself in mens minds which it is impossible for the breath or power of man wholly to extinguish      fourthly of the three real existences of which we have certain knowledge  fourthly as to the fourth sort of our knowledge viz of the real actual existence of things we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence and a demonstrative knowledge of the existence of a god of the existence of anything else we have no other but a sensitive knowledge which extends not beyond the objects present to our senses      our ignorance great  our knowledge being so narrow as i have shown it will perhaps give us some light into the present state of our minds if we look a little into the dark side and take a view of our ignorance which being infinitely larger than our knowledge may serve much to the quieting of disputes and improvement of useful knowledge if discovering how far we have clear and distinct ideas we confine our thoughts within the contemplation of those things that are within the reach of our understandings and launch not out into that abyss of darkness where we have not eyes to see nor faculties to perceive anything out of a presumption that nothing is beyond our comprehension but to be satisfied of the folly of such a conceit we need not go far he that knows anything knows this in the first place that he need not seek long for instances of his ignorance the meanest and most obvious things that come in our way have dark sides that the quickest sight cannot penetrate into the clearest and most enlarged understandings of thinking men find themselves puzzled and at a loss in every particle of matter we shall the less wonder to find it so when we consider the causes of our ignorance which from what has been said i suppose will be found to be these three  first want of ideas its causes  secondly want of a discoverable connexion between the ideas we have  thirdly want of tracing and examining our ideas      first one cause of our ignorance want of ideas  i want of simple ideas that other creatures in other parts of the universe may have  first there are some things and those not a few that we are ignorant of for want of ideas  first all the simple ideas we have are confined as i have shown to those we receive from corporeal objects by sensation and from the operations of our own minds as the objects of reflection but how much these few and narrow inlets are disproportionate to the vast whole extent of all beings will not be hard to persuade those who are not so foolish as to think their span the measure of all things what other simple ideas it is possible the creatures in other parts of the universe may have by the assistance of senses and faculties more or perfecter than we have or different from ours it is not for us to determine but to say or think there are no such because we conceive nothing of them is no better an argument than if a blind man should be positive in it that there was no such thing as sight and colours because he had no manner of idea of any such thing nor could by any means frame to himself any notions about seeing the ignorance and darkness that is in us no more hinders nor confines the knowledge that is in others than the blindness of a mole is an argument against the quicksightedness of an eagle he that will consider the infinite power wisdom and goodness of the creator of all things will find reason to think it was not all laid out upon so inconsiderable mean and impotent a creature as he will find man to be who in all probability is one of the lowest of all intellectual beings what faculties therefore other species of creatures have to penetrate into the nature and inmost constitutions of things what ideas they may receive of them far different from ours we know not this we know and certainly find that we want several other views of them besides those we have to make discoveries of them more perfect and we may be convinced that the ideas we can attain to by our faculties are very disproportionate to things themselves when a positive clear distinct one of substance itself which is the foundation of all the rest is concealed from us but want of ideas of this kind being a part as well as cause of our ignorance cannot be described only this i think i may confidently say of it that the intellectual and sensible world are in this perfectly alike that that part which we see of either of them holds no proportion with what we see not and whatsoever we can reach with our eyes or our thoughts of either of them is but a point almost nothing in comparison of the the rest      want of simple ideas that men are capable of having but having not  because their remoteness or  secondly another great cause of ignorance is the want of ideas we are capable of as the want of ideas which our faculties are not able to give us shuts us wholly from those views of things which it is reasonable to think other beings perfecter than we have of which we know nothing so the want of ideas i now speak of keeps us in ignorance of things we conceive capable of being known to us bulk figure and motion we have ideas of but though we are not without ideas of these primary qualities of bodies in general yet not knowing what is the particular bulk figure and motion of the greatest part of the bodies of the universe we are ignorant of the several powers efficacies and ways of operation whereby the effects which we daily see are produced these are hid from us in some things by being too remote and in others by being too minute when we consider the vast distance of the known and visible parts of the world and the reasons we have to think that what lies within our ken is but a small part of the universe we shall then discover a huge abyss of ignorance what are the particular fabrics of the great masses of matter which make up the whole stupendous frame of corporeal beings how far they are extended what is their motion and how continued or communicated and what influence they have one upon another are contemplations that at first glimpse our thoughts lose themselves in if we narrow our contemplations and confine our thoughts to this little cantoni mean this system of our sun and the grosser masses of matter that visibly move about it what several sorts of vegetables animals and intellectual corporeal beings infinitely different from those of our little spot of earth may there probably be in the other planets to the knowledge of which even of their outward figures and parts we can no way attain whilst we are confined to this earth there being no natural means either by sensation or reflection to convey their certain ideas into our minds they are out of the reach of those inlets of all our knowledge and what sorts of furniture and inhabitants those mansions contain in them we cannot so much as guess much less have clear and distinct ideas of them        because of their minuteness  if a great nay far the greatest part of the several ranks of bodies in the universe escape our notice by their remoteness there are others that are no less concealed from us by their minuteness these insensible corpuscles being the active parts of matter and the great instruments of nature on which depend not only all their secondary qualities but also most of their natural operations our want of precise distinct ideas of their primary qualities keeps us in an incurable ignorance of what we desire to know about them i doubt not but if we could discover the figure size texture and motion of the minute constituent parts of any two bodies we should know without trial several of their operations one upon another as we do now the properties of a square or a triangle did we know the mechanical affections of the particles of rhubarb hemlock opium and a man as a watchmaker does those of a watch whereby it performs its operations and of a file which by rubbing on them will alter the figure of any of the wheels we should be able to tell beforehand that rhubarb will purge hemlock kill and opium make a man sleep as well as a watchmaker can that a little piece of paper laid on the balance will keep the watch from going till it be removed or that some small part of it being rubbed by a file the machine would quite lose its motion and the watch go no more the dissolving of silver in aqua fortis and gold in aqua regia and not vice versa would be then perhaps no more difficult to know than it is to a smith to understand why the turning of one key will open a lock and not the turning of another but whilst we are destitute of senses acute enough to discover the minute particles of bodies and to give us ideas of their mechanical affections we must be content to be ignorant of their properties and ways of operation nor can we be assured about them any further than some few trials we make are able to reach but whether they will succeed again another time we cannot be certain this hinders our certain knowledge of universal truths concerning natural bodies and our reason carries us herein very little beyond particular matter of fact      hence no science of bodies within our reach  and therefore i am apt to doubt that how far soever human industry may advance useful and experimental philosophy in physical things scientifical will still be out of our reach because we want perfect and adequate ideas of those very bodies which are nearest to us and most under our command those which we have ranked into classes under names and we think ourselves best acquainted with we have but very imperfect and incomplete ideas of distinct ideas of the several sorts of bodies that fall under the examination of our senses perhaps we may have but adequate ideas i suspect we have not of any one amongst them and though the former of these will serve us for common use and discourse yet whilst we want the latter we are not capable of scientifical knowledge nor shall ever be able to discover general instructive unquestionable truths concerning them certainty and demonstration are things we must not in these matters pretend to by the colour figure taste and smell and other sensible qualities we have as clear and distinct ideas of sage and hemlock as we have of a circle and a triangle but having no ideas of the particular primary qualities of the minute parts of either of these plants nor of other bodies which we would apply them to we cannot tell what effects they will produce nor when we see those effects can we so much as guess much less know their manner of production thus having no ideas of the particular mechanical affections of the minute parts of bodies that are within our view and reach we are ignorant of their constitutions powers and operations and of bodies more remote we are yet more ignorant not knowing so much as their very outward shapes or the sensible and grosser parts of their constitutions      much less a science of unembodied spirits  this at first will show us how disproportionate our knowledge is to the whole extent even of material beings to which if we add the consideration of that infinite number of spirits that may be and probably are which are yet more remote from our knowledge whereof we have no cognizance nor can frame to ourselves any distinct ideas of their several ranks and sorts we shall find this cause of ignorance conceal from us in an impenetrable obscurity almost the whole intellectual world a greater certainly and more beautiful world than the material for bating some very few and those if i may so call them superficial ideas of spirit which by reflection we get of our own and from thence the best we can collect of the father of all spirits the eternal independent author of them and us and all things we have no certain information so much as of the existence of other spirits but by revelation angels of all sorts are naturally beyond our discovery and all those intelligences whereof it is likely there are more orders than of corporeal substances are things whereof our natural faculties give us no certain account at all that there are minds and thinking beings in other men as well as himself every man has a reason from their words and actions to be satisfied and the knowledge of his own mind cannot suffer a man that considers to be ignorant that there is a god but that there are degrees of spiritual beings between us and the great god who is there that by his own search and ability can come to know much less have we distinct ideas of their different natures conditions states powers and several constitutions wherein they agree or differ from one another and from us and therefore in what concerns their different species and properties we are in absolute ignorance      secondly another cause want of a discoverable connexion between ideas we have  secondly what a small part of the substantial beings that are in the universe the want of ideas leaves open to our knowledge we have seen in the next place another cause of ignorance of no less moment is a want of a discoverable connection between those ideas we have for wherever we want that we are utterly incapable of universal and certain knowledge and are in the former case left only to observation and experiment which how narrow and confined it is how far from general knowledge we need not be told i shall give some few instances of this cause of our ignorance and so leave it it is evident that the bulk figure and motion of several bodies about us produce in us several sensations as of colours sounds tastes smells pleasure and pain c these mechanical affections of bodies having no affinity at all with those ideas they produce in us there being no conceivable connexion between any impulse of any sort of body and any perception of a colour or smell which we find in our minds we can have no distinct knowledge of such operations beyond our experience and can reason no otherwise about them than as effects produced by the appointment of an infinitely wise agent which perfectly surpass our comprehensions as the ideas of sensible secondary qualities which we have in our minds can by us be no way deduced from bodily causes nor any correspondence or connexion be found between them and those primary qualities which experience shows us produce them in us so on the other side the operation of our minds upon our bodies is as inconceivable how any thought should produce a motion in body is as remote from the nature of our ideas as how any body should produce any thought in the mind that it is so if experience did not convince us the consideration of the things themselves would never be able in the least to discover to us these and the like though they have a constant and regular connexion in the ordinary course of things yet that connexion being not discoverable in the ideas themselves which appearing to have no necessary dependence one on another we can attribute their connexion to nothing else but the arbitrary determination of that allwise agent who has made them to be and to operate as they do in a way wholly above our weak understandings to conceive      instances  in some of our ideas there are certain relations habitudes and connexions so visibly included in the nature of the ideas themselves that we cannot conceive them separable from them by any power whatsoever and in these only we are capable of certain and universal knowledge thus the idea of a rightlined triangle necessarily carries with it an equality of its angles to two right ones nor can we conceive this relation this connexion of these two ideas to be possibly mutable or to depend on any arbitrary power which of choice made it thus or could make it otherwise but the coherence and continuity of the parts of matter the production of sensation in us of colours and sounds c by impulse and motion nay the original rules and communication of motion being such wherein we can discover no natural connexion with any ideas we have we cannot but ascribe them to the arbitrary will and good pleasure of the wise architect i need not i think here mention the resurrection of the dead the future state of this globe of earth and such other things which are by every one acknowledged to depend wholly on the determination of a free agent the things that as far as our observation reaches we constantly find to proceed regularly we may conclude do act by a law set them but yet by a law that we know not whereby though causes work steadily and effects constantly flow from them yet their connexions and dependencies being not discoverable in our ideas we can have but an experimental knowledge of them from all which it is easy to perceive what a darkness we are involved in how little it is of being and the things that are that we are capable to know and therefore we shall do no injury to our knowledge when we modestly think with ourselves that we are so far from being able to comprehend the whole nature of the universe and all the things contained in it that we are not capable of a philosophical knowledge of the bodies that are about us and make a part of us concerning their secondary qualities powers and operations we can have no universal certainty several effects come every day within the notice of our senses of which we have so far sensitive knowledge but the causes manner and certainty of their production for the two foregoing reasons we must be content to be very ignorant of in these we can go no further than particular experience informs us of matter of fact and by analogy to guess what effects the like bodies are upon other trials like to produce but as to a perfect science of natural bodies not to mention spiritual beings we are i think so far from being capable of any such thing that i conclude it lost labour to seek after it    0 thirdly a third cause want of tracing our ideas  thirdly where we have adequate ideas and where there is a certain and discoverable connexion between them yet we are often ignorant for want of tracing those ideas which we have or may have and for want of finding out those intermediate ideas which may show us what habitude of agreement or disagreement they have one with another and thus many are ignorant of mathematical truths not out of any imperfection of their faculties or uncertainty in the things themselves but for want of application in acquiring examining and by due ways comparing those ideas that which has most contributed to hinder the due tracing of our ideas and finding out their relations and agreements or disagreements one with another has been i suppose the ill use of words it is impossible that men should ever truly seek or certainly discover the agreement or disagreement of ideas themselves whilst their thoughts flutter about or stick only in sounds of doubtful and uncertain significations mathematicians abstracting their thoughts from names and accustoming themselves to set before their minds the ideas themselves that they would consider and not sounds instead of them have avoided thereby a great part of that perplexity puddering and confusion which has so much hindered mens progress in other parts of knowledge for whilst they stick in words of undetermined and uncertain signification they are unable to distinguish true from false certain from probable consistent from inconsistent in their own opinions this having been the fate or misfortune of a great part of men of letters the increase brought into the stock of real knowledge has been very little in proportion to the schools disputes and writings the world has been filled with whilst students being lost in the great wood of words knew not whereabouts they were how far their discoveries were advanced or what was wanting in their own or the general stock of knowledge had men in the discoveries of the material done as they have in those of the intellectual world involved all in the obscurity of uncertain and doubtful ways of talking volumes writ of navigation and voyages theories and stories of zones and tides multiplied and disputed nay ships built and fleets sent out would never have taught us the way beyond the line and the antipodes would be still as much unknown as when it was declared heresy to hold there were any but having spoken sufficiently of words and the ill or careless use that is commonly made of them i shall not say anything more of it here      extent of human knowledge in respect to its universality  hitherto we have examined the extent of our knowledge in respect of the several sorts of beings that are there is another extent of it in respect of universality which will also deserve to be considered and in this regard our knowledge follows the nature of our ideas if the ideas are abstract whose agreement or disagreement we perceive our knowledge is universal for what is known of such general ideas will be true of every particular thing in whom that essence ie that abstract idea is to be found and what is once known of such ideas will be perpetually and for ever true so that as to all general knowledge we must search and find it only in our minds and it is only the examining of our own ideas that furnisheth us with that truths belonging to essences of things that is to abstract ideas are eternal and are to be found out by the contemplation only of those essences as the existence of things is to be known only from experience but having more to say of this in the chapters where i shall speak of general and real knowledge this may here suffice as to the universality of our knowledge in general     chapter iv of the reality of knowledge     objection knowledge placed in our ideas may be all unreal or chimerical  i doubt not but my reader by this time may be apt to think that i have been all this while only building a castle in the air and be ready to say to me  to what purpose all this stir knowledge say you is only the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas but who knows what those ideas may be is there anything so extravagant as the imaginations of mens brains where is the head that has no chimeras in it or if there be a sober and a wise man what difference will there be by your rules between his knowledge and that of the most extravagant fancy in the world they both have their ideas and perceive their agreement and disagreement one with another if there be any difference between them the advantage will be on the warmheaded mans side as having the more ideas and the more lively and so by your rules he will be the more knowing if it be true that all knowledge lies only in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas the visions of an enthusiast and the reasonings of a sober man will be equally certain it is no matter how things are so a man observe but the agreement of his own imaginations and talk conformably it is all truth all certainty such castles in the air will be as strongholds of truth as the demonstrations of euclid that an harpy is not a centaur is by this way as certain knowledge and as much a truth as that a square is not a circle  but of what use is all this fine knowledge of mens own imaginations to a man that inquires after the reality of things it matters not what mens fancies are it is the knowledge of things that is only to be prized it is this alone gives a value to our reasonings and preference to one mans knowledge over anothers that it is of things as they really are and not of dreams and fancies     answer not so where ideas agree with things  to which i answer that if our knowledge of our ideas terminate in them and reach no further where there is something further intended our most serious thoughts will be of little more use than the reveries of a crazy brain and the truths built thereon of no more weight than the discourses of a man who sees things clearly in a dream and with great assurance utters them but i hope before i have done to make it evident that this way of certainty by the knowledge of our own ideas goes a little further than bare imagination and i believe it will appear that all the certainty of general truths a man has lies in nothing else     but what shall be the criterion of this agreement  it is evident the mind knows not things immediately but only by the intervention of the ideas it has of them our knowledge therefore is real only so far as there is a conformity between our ideas and the reality of things but what shall be here the criterion how shall the mind when it perceives nothing but its own ideas know that they agree with things themselves this though it seems not to want difficulty yet i think there be two sorts of ideas that we may be assured agree with things     as first all simple ideas are really conformed to things  first the first are simple ideas which since the mind as has been showed can by no means make to itself must necessarily be the product of things operating on the mind in a natural way and producing therein those perceptions which by the wisdom and will of our maker they are ordained and adapted to from whence it follows that simple ideas are not fictions of our fancies but the natural and regular productions of things without us really operating upon us and so carry with them all the conformity which is intended or which our state requires for they represent to us things under those appearances which they are fitted to produce in us whereby we are enabled to distinguish the sorts of particular substances to discern the states they are in and so to take them for our necessities and apply them to our uses thus the idea of whiteness or bitterness as it is in the mind exactly answering that power which is in any body to produce it there has all the real conformity it can or ought to have with things without us and this conformity between our simple ideas and the existence of things is sufficient for real knowledge     secondly all complex ideas except ideas of substances are their own archetypes  secondly all our complex ideas except those of substances being archetypes of the minds own making not intended to be the copies of anything nor referred to the existence of anything as to their originals cannot want any conformity necessary to real knowledge for that which is not designed to represent anything but itself can never be capable of a wrong representation nor mislead us from the true apprehension of anything by its dislikeness to it and such excepting those of substances are all our complex ideas which as i have showed in another place are combinations of ideas which the mind by its free choice puts together without considering any connexion they have in nature and hence it is that in all these sorts the ideas themselves are considered as the archetypes and things no otherwise regarded but as they are conformable to them so that we cannot but be infallibly certain that all the knowledge we attain concerning these ideas is real and reaches things themselves because in all our thoughts reasonings and discourses of this kind we intend things no further than as they are conformable to our ideas so that in these we cannot miss of a certain and undoubted reality     hence the reality of mathematical knowledge  i doubt not but it will be easily granted that the knowledge we have of mathematical truths is not only certain but real knowledge and not the bare empty vision of vain insignificant chimeras of the brain and yet if we will consider we shall find that it is only of our own ideas the mathematician considers the truth and properties belonging to a rectangle or circle only as they are in idea in his own mind for it is possible he never found either of them existing mathematically ie precisely true in his life but yet the knowledge he has of any truths or properties belonging to a circle or any other mathematical figure are nevertheless true and certain even of real things existing because real things are no further concerned nor intended to be meant by any such propositions than as things really agree to those archetypes in his mind is it true of the idea of a triangle that its three angles are equal to two right ones it is true also of a triangle wherever it really exists whatever other figure exists that it is not exactly answerable to that idea of a triangle in his mind is not at all concerned in that proposition and therefore he is certain all his knowledge concerning such ideas is real knowledge because intending things no further than they agree with those his ideas he is sure what he knows concerning those figures when they have barely an ideal existence in his mind will hold true of them also when they have a real existance in matter his consideration being barely of those figures which are the same wherever or however they exist     and of moral  and hence it follows that moral knowledge is as capable of real certainty as mathematics for certainty being but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas and demonstration nothing but the perception of such agreement by the intervention of other ideas or mediums our moral ideas as well as mathematical being archetypes themselves and so adequate and complete ideas all the agreement or disagreement which we shall find in them will produce real knowledge as well as in mathematical figures     existence not required to make abstract knowledge real  for the attaining of knowledge and certainty it is requisite that we have determined ideas and to make our knowledge real it is requisite that the ideas answer their archetypes nor let it be wondered that i place the certainty of our knowledge in the consideration of our ideas with so little care and regard as it may seem to the real existence of things since most of those discourses which take up the thoughts and engage the disputes of those who pretend to make it their business to inquire after truth and certainty will i presume upon examination be found to be general propositions and notions in which existence is not at all concerned all the discourses of the mathematicians about the squaring of a circle conic sections or any other part of mathematics concern not the existence of any of those figures but their demonstrations which depend on their ideas are the same whether there be any square or circle existing in the world or no in the same manner the truth and certainty of moral discourses abstracts from the lives of men and the existence of those virtues in the world whereof they treat nor are tullys offices less true because there is nobody in the world that exactly practises his rules and lives up to that pattern of a virtuous man which he has given us and which existed nowhere when he writ but in idea if it be true in speculation ie in idea that murder deserves death it will also be true in reality of any action that exists conformable to that idea of murder as for other actions the truth of that proposition concerns them not and thus it is of all other species of things which have no other essences but those ideas which are in the minds of men     nor will it be less true or certain because moral ideas are of our own making and naming  but it will here be said that if moral knowledge be placed in the contemplation of our own moral ideas and those as other modes be of our own making what strange notions will there be of justice and temperance what confusion of virtues and vices if every one may make what ideas of them he pleases no confusion or disorder in the things themselves nor the reasonings about them no more than in mathematics there would be a disturbance in the demonstration or a change in the properties of figures and their relations one to another if a man should make a triangle with four corners or a trapezium with four right angles that is in plain english change the names of the figures and call that by one name which mathematicians call ordinarily by another for let a man make to himself the idea of a figure with three angles whereof one is a right one and call it if he please equilaterum or trapezium or anything else the properties of and demonstrations about that idea will be the same as if he called it a rectangular triangle i confess the change of the name by the impropriety of speech will at first disturb him who knows not what idea it stands for but as soon as the figure is drawn the consequences and demonstrations are plain and clear just the same is it in moral knowledge let a man have the idea of taking from others without their consent what their honest industry has possessed them of and call this justice if he please he that takes the name here without the idea put to it will be mistaken by joining another idea of his own to that name but strip the idea of that name or take it such as it is in the speakers mind and the same things will agree to it as if you called it injustice indeed wrong names in moral discourses breed usually more disorder because they are not so easily rectified as in mathematics where the figure once drawn and seen makes the name useless and of no force for what need of a sign when the thing signified is present and in view but in moral names that cannot be so easily and shortly done because of the many decompositions that go to the making up the complex ideas of those modes but yet for all this the miscalling of any of those ideas contrary to the usual signification of the words of that language hinders not but that we may have certain and demonstrative knowledge of their several agreements and disagreements if we will carefully as in mathematics keep to the same precise ideas and trace them in their several relations one to another without being led away by their names if we but separate the idea under consideration from the sign that stands for it our knowledge goes equally on in the discovery of real truth and certainty whatever sounds we make use of    0 misnaming disturbs not the certainty of the knowledge  one thing more we are to take notice of that where god or any other lawmaker hath defined any moral names there they have made the essence of that species to which that name belongs and there it is not safe to apply or use them otherwise but in other cases it is bare impropriety of speech to apply them contrary to the common usage of the country but yet even this too disturbs not the certainty of that knowledge which is still to be had by a due contemplation and comparing of those even nicknamed ideas      thirdly our complex ideas of substances have their archetypes without us and here knowledge comes short  thirdly there is another sort of complex ideas which being referred to archetypes without us may differ from them and so our knowledge about them may come short of being real such are our ideas of substances which consisting of a collection of simple ideas supposed taken from the works of nature may yet vary from them by having more or different ideas united in them than are to be found united in the things themselves from whence it comes to pass that they may and often do fail of being exactly conformable to things themselves      so far as our complex ideas agree with those archetypes without us so far our knowledge concerning substances is real  i say then that to have ideas of substances which by being conformable to things may afford us real knowledge it is not enough as in modes to put together such ideas as have no inconsistence though they did never before so exist vg the ideas of sacrilege or perjury c were as real and true ideas before as after the existence of any such fact but our ideas of substances being supposed copies and referred to archetypes without us must still be taken from something that does or has existed they must not consist of ideas put together at the pleasure of our thoughts without any real pattern they were taken from though we can perceive no inconsistence in such a combination the reason whereof is because we knowing not what real constitution it is of substances whereon our simple ideas depend and which really is the cause of the strict union of some of them one with another and the exclusion of others there are very few of them that we can be sure are or are not inconsistent in nature any further than experience and sensible observation reach herein therefore is founded the reality of our knowledge concerning substancesthat all our complex ideas of them must be such and such only as are made up of such simple ones as have been discovered to coexist in nature and our ideas being thus true though not perhaps very exact copies are yet the subjects of real as far as we have any knowledge of them which as has been already shown will not be found to reach very far but so far as it does it will still be real knowledge whatever ideas we have the agreement we find they have with others will still be knowledge if those ideas be abstract it will be general knowledge but to make it real concerning substances the ideas must be taken from the real existence of things whatever simple ideas have been found to coexist in any substance these we may with confidence join together again and so make abstract ideas of substances for whatever have once had an union in nature may be united again      in our inquiries about substances we must consider ideas and not confine our thoughts to names or species supposed set out by names  this if we rightly consider and confine not our thoughts and abstract ideas to names as if there were or could be no other sorts of things than what known names had already determined and as it were set out we should think of things with greater freedom and less confusion than perhaps we do it would possibly be thought a bold paradox if not a very dangerous falsehood if i should say that some changelings who have lived forty years together without any appearance of reason are something between a man and a beast which prejudice is founded upon nothing else but a false supposition that these two names man and beast stand for distinct species so set out by real essences that there can come no other species between them whereas if we will abstract from those names and the supposition of such specific essences made by nature wherein all things of the same denominations did exactly and equally partake if we would not fancy that there were a certain number of these essences wherein all things as in moulds were cast and formed we should find that the idea of the shape motion and life of a man without reason is as much a distinct idea and makes as much a distinct sort of things from man and beast as the idea of the shape of an ass with reason would be different from either that of man or beast and be a species of an animal between or distinct from both      objection against a changeling being something between a man and beast answered  here everybody will be ready to ask if changelings may be supposed something between man and beast pray what are they i answer changelings which is as good a word to signify something different from the signification of man or beast as the names man and beast are to have significations different one from the other this well considered would resolve this matter and show my meaning without any more ado but i am not so unacquainted with the zeal of some men which enables them to spin consequences and to see religion threatened whenever any one ventures to quit their forms of speaking as not to foresee what names such a proposition as this is like to be charged with and without doubt it will be asked if changelings are something between man and beast what will become of them in the other world to which i answer i it concerns me not to know or inquire to their own master they stand or fall it will make their state neither better nor worse whether we determine anything of it or no they are in the hands of a faithful creator and a bountiful father who disposes not of his creatures according to our narrow thoughts or opinions nor distinguishes them according to names and species of our contrivance and we that know so little of this present world we are in may i think content ourselves without being peremptory in defining the different states which creatures shall come into when they go off this stage it may suffice us that he hath made known to all those who are capable of instruction discoursing and reasoning that they shall come to an account and receive according to what they have done in this body      what will become of changelings in a future state  but secondly i answer the force of these mens question viz will you deprive changelings of a future state is founded on one of these two suppositions which are both false the first is that all things that have the outward shape and appearance of a man must necessarily be designed to an immortal future being after this life or secondly that whatever is of human birth must be so take away these imaginations and such questions will be groundless and ridiculous i desire then those who think there is no more but an accidental difference between themselves and changelings the essence in both being exactly the same to consider whether they can imagine immortality annexed to any outward shape of the body the very proposing it is i suppose enough to make them disown it no one yet that ever i heard of how much soever immersed in matter allowed that excellency to any figure of the gross sensible outward consequence of it or that any mass of matter should after its dissolution here be again restored hereafter to an everlasting state of sense perception and knowledge only because it was moulded into this or that figure and had such a particular frame of its visible parts such an opinion as this placing immortality in a certain superficial figure turns out of doors all consideration of soul or spirit upon whose account alone some corporeal beings have hitherto been concluded immortal and others not this is to attribute more to the outside than inside of things and to place the excellency of a man more in the external shape of his body than internal perfections of his soul which is but little better than to annex the great and inestimable advantage of immortality and life everlasting which he has above other material beings to annex it i say to the cut of his beard or the fashion of his coat for this or that outward mark of our bodies no more carries with it the hope of an eternal duration than the fashion of a mans suit gives him reasonable grounds to imagine it will never wear out or that it will make him immortal it will perhaps be said that nobody thinks that the shape makes anything immortal but it is the shape that is the sign of a rational soul within which is immortal i wonder who made it the sign of any such thing for barely saying it will not make it so it would require some proofs to persuade one of it no figure that i know speaks any such language for it may as rationally be concluded that the dead body of a man wherein there is to be found no more appearance or action of life than there is in a statue has yet nevertheless a living soul in it because of its shape as that there is a rational soul in a changeling because he has the outside of a rational creature when his actions carry far less marks of reason with them in the whole course of his life than what are to be found in many a beast      monsters  but it is the issue of rational parents and must therefore be concluded to have a rational soul i know not by what logic you must so conclude i am sure this is a conclusion that men nowhere allow of for if they did they would not make bold as everywhere they do to destroy illformed and misshaped productions ay but these are monsters let them be so what will your drivelling unintelligent intractable changeling be shall a defect in the body make a monster a defect in the mind the far more noble and in the common phrase the far more essential part not shall the want of a nose or a neck make a monster and put such issue out of the rank of men the want of reason and understanding not this is to bring all back again to what was exploded just now this is to place all in the shape and to take the measure of a man only by his outside to show that according to the ordinary way of reasoning in this matter people do lay the whole stress on the figure and resolve the whole essence of the species of man as they make it into the outward shape how unreasonable soever it be and how much soever they disown it we need but trace their thoughts and practice a little further and then it will plainly appear the wellshaped changeling is a man has a rational soul though it appear not this is past doubt say you make the ears a little longer and more pointed and the nose a little flatter than ordinary and then you begin to boggle make the face yet narrower flatter and longer and then you are at a stand add still more and more of the likeness of a brute to it and let the head be perfectly that of some other animal then presently it is a monster and it is demonstration with you that it hath no rational soul and must be destroyed where now i ask shall be the just measure which the utmost bounds of that shape that carries with it a rational soul for since there have been human foetuses produced half beast and half man and others three parts one and one part the other and so it is possible they may be in all the variety of approaches to the one or the other shape and may have several degrees of mixture of the likeness of a man or a brutei would gladly know what are those precise lineaments which according to this hypothesis are or are not capable of a rational soul to be joined to them what sort of outside is the certain sign that there is or is not such an inhabitant within for till that be done we talk at random of man and shall always i fear do so as long as we give ourselves up to certain sounds and the imaginations of settled and fixed species in nature we know not what but after all i desire it may be considered that those who think they have answered the difficulty by telling us that a misshaped foetus is a monster run into the same fault they are arguing against by constituting a species between man and beast for what else i pray is their monster in the case if the word monster signifies anything at all but something neither man nor beast but partaking somewhat of either and just so is the changeling before mentioned so necessary is it to quit the common notion of species and essences if we will truly look into the nature of things and examine them by what our faculties can discover in them as they exist and not by groundless fancies that have been taken up about them      words and species  i have mentioned this here because i think we cannot be too cautious that words and species in the ordinary notions which we have been used to of them impose not on us for i am apt to think therein lies one great obstacle to our clear and distinct knowledge especially in reference to substances and from thence has rose a great part of the difficulties about truth and certainty would we accustom ourselves to separate our contemplations and reasonings from words we might in a great measure remedy this inconvenience within our own thoughts but yet it would still disturb us in our discourse with others as long as we retained the opinion that species and their essences were anything else but our abstract ideas such as they are with names annexed to them to be the signs of them      recapitulation  wherever we perceive the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas there is certain knowledge and wherever we are sure those ideas agree with the reality of things there is certain real knowledge of which agreement of our ideas with the reality of things having here given the marks i think i have shown wherein it is that certainty real certainty consists which whatever it was to others was i confess to me heretofore one of those desiderata which i found great want of     chapter v of truth in general     what truth is  what is truth was an inquiry many ages since and it being that which all mankind either do or pretend to search after it cannot but be worth our while carefully to examine wherein it consists and so acquaint ourselves with the nature of it as to observe how the mind distinguishes it from falsehood     a right joining or separating of signs ie either ideas or words  truth then seems to me in the proper import of the word to signify nothing but the joining or seperating of signs as the things signified by them do agree or disagree one with another the joining or separating of signs here meant is what by another name we call proposition so that truth properly belongs only to propositions whereof there are two sorts viz mental and verbal as there are two sorts of signs commonly made use of viz ideas and words    which make mental or verbal propositions  to form a clear notion of truth it is very necessary to consider truth of thought and truth of words distinctly one from another but yet it is very difficult to treat of them asunder because it is unavoidable in treating of mental propositions to make use of words and then the instances given of mental propositions cease immediately to be barely mental and become verbal for a mental proposition being nothing but a bare consideration of the ideas as they are in our minds stripped of names they lose the nature of purely mental propositions as soon as they are put into words     mental propositions are very hard to be treated of  and that which makes it yet harder to treat of mental and verbal propositions separately is that most men if not all in their thinking and reasonings within themselves make use of words instead of ideas at least when the subject of their meditation contains in it complex ideas which is a great evidence of the imperfection and uncertainty of our ideas of that kind and may if attentively made use of serve for a mark to show us what are those things we have clear and perfect established ideas of and what not for if we will curiously observe the way our mind takes in thinking and reasoning we shall find i suppose that when we make any propositions within our own thoughts about white or black sweet or bitter a triangle or a circle we can and often do frame in our minds the ideas themselves without reflecting on the names but when we would consider or make propositions about the more complex ideas as of a man vitriol fortitude glory we usually put the name for the idea because the ideas these names stand for being for the most part imperfect confused and undetermined we reflect on the names themselves because they are more clear certain and distinct and readier occur to our thoughts than the pure ideas and so we make use of these words instead of the ideas themselves even when we would meditate and reason within ourselves and make tacit mental propositions in substances as has been already noticed this is occasioned by the imperfections of our ideas we making the name stand for the real essence of which we have no idea at all in modes it is occasioned by the great number of simple ideas that go to the making them up for many of them being compounded the name occurs much easier than the complex idea itself which requires time and attention to be recollected and exactly represented to the mind even in those men who have formerly been at the pains to do it and is utterly impossible to be done by those who though they have ready in their memory the greatest part of the common words of that language yet perhaps never troubled themselves in all their lives to consider what precise ideas the most of them stood for some confused or obscure notions have served their turns and many who talk very much of religion and conscience of church and faith of power and right of obstructions and humours melancholy and choler would perhaps have little left in their thoughts and meditations if one should desire them to think only of the things themselves and lay by those words with which they so often confound others and not seldom themselves also     mental and verbal propositions contrasted  but to return to the consideration of truth we must i say observe two sorts of propositions that we are capable of making  first mental wherein the ideas in our understandings are without the use of words put together or separated by the mind perceiving or judging of their agreement or disagreement  secondly verbal propositions which are words the signs of our ideas put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences by which way of affirming or denying these signs made by sounds are as it were put together or separated from another so that proposition consists in joining or separating signs and truth consists in the putting together or separating those signs according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree     when mental propositions contain real truth and when verbal  every ones experience will satisfy him that the mind either by perceiving or supposing the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas does tacitly within itself put them into a kind of proposition affirmative or negative which i have endeavoured to express by the terms putting together and separating but this action of the mind which is so familiar to every thinking and reasoning man is easier to be conceived by reflecting on what passes in us when we affirm or deny than to be explained by words when a man has in his head the idea of two lines viz the side and diagonal of a square whereof the diagonal is an inch long he may have the idea also of the division of that line into a certain number of equal parts vg into five ten a hundred a thousand or any other number and may have the idea of that inch line being divisible or not divisible into such equal parts as a certain number of them will be equal to the sideline now whenever he perceives believes or supposes such a kind of divisibility to agree or disagree to his idea of that line he as it were joins or separates those two ideas viz the idea of that line and the idea of that kind of divisibility and so makes a mental proposition which is true or false according as such a kind of divisibility a divisibility into such aliquot parts does really agree to that line or no when ideas are so put together or separated in the mind as they or the things they stand for do agree or not that is as i may call it mental truth but truth of words is something more and that is the affirming or denying of words one of another as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree and this again is twofold either purely verbal and trifling which i shall speak of chap viii or real and instructive which is the object of that real knowledge which we have spoken of already     objection against verbal truth that thus it may all be chimerical  but here again will be apt to occur the same doubt about truth that did about knowledge and it will be objected that if truth be nothing but the joining and separating of words in propositions as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree in mens minds the knowledge of truth is not so valuable a thing as it is taken to be nor worth the pains and time men employ in the search of it since by this account it amounts to no more than the conformity of words to the chimeras of mens brains who knows not what odd notions many mens heads are filled with and what strange ideas all mens brains are capable of but if we rest here we know the truth of nothing by this rule but of the visionary words in our own imaginations nor have other truth but what as much concerns harpies and centaurs as men and horses for those and the like may be ideas in our heads and have their agreement or disagreement there as well as the ideas of real beings and so have as true propositions made about them and it will be altogether as true a proposition to say all centaurs are animals as that all men are animals and the certainty of one as great as the other for in both the propositions the words are put together according to the agreement of the ideas in our minds and the agreement of the idea of animal with that of centaur is as clear and visable to the mind as the agreement of the idea of animal with that of man and so these two propositions are equally true equally certain but of what use is all such truth to us     answered real truth is about ideas agreeing to things  though what has been said in the foregoing chapter to distinguish real from imaginary knowledge might suffice here in answer to this doubt to distinguish real truth from chimerical or if you please barely nominal they depending both on the same foundation yet it may not be amiss here again to consider that though our words signify things the truth they contain when put into propositions will be only verbal when they stand for ideas in the mind that have not an agreement with the reality of things and therefore truth as well as knowledge may well come under the distinction of verbal and real that being only verbal truth wherein terms are joined according to the agreement or disagreement of the ideas they stand for without regarding whether our ideas are such as really have or are capable of having an existence in nature but then it is they contain real truth when these signs are joined as our ideas agree and when our ideas are such as we know are capable of having an existence in nature which in substances we cannot know but by knowing that such have existed     truth and falsehood in general  truth is the marking down in words the agreement or disagreement of ideas as it is falsehood is the marking down in words the agreement or disagreement of ideas otherwise than it is and so far as these ideas thus marked by sounds agree to their archetypes so far only is the truth real the knowledge of this truth consists in knowing what ideas the words stand for and the perception of the agreement or disagreement of those ideas according as it is marked by those words    0 general propositions to be treated of more at large  but because words are looked on as the great conduits of truth and knowledge and that in conveying and receiving of truth and commonly in reasoning about it we make use of words and propositions i shall more at large inquire wherein the certainty of real truths contained in propositions consists and where it is to be had and endeavour to show in what sort of universal propositions we are capable of being certain of their real truth or falsehood  i shall begin with general propositions as those which most employ our thoughts and exercise our contemplation general truths are most looked after by the mind as those that most enlarge our knowledge and by their comprehensiveness satisfying us at once of many particulars enlarge our view and shorten our way to knowledge      moral and metaphysical truth  besides truth taken in the strict sense before mentioned there are other sorts of truths as   moral truth which is speaking of things according to the persuasion of our own minds though the proposition we speak agree not to the reality of things   metaphysical truth which is nothing but the real existence of things conformable to the ideas to which we have annexed their names this though it seems to consist in the very beings of things yet when considered a little nearly will appear to include a tacit proposition whereby the mind joins that particular thing to the idea it had before settled with the name to it but these considerations of truth either having been before taken notice of or not being much to our present purpose it may suffice here only to have mentioned them     chapter vi of universal propositions their truth and certainty     treating of words necessary to knowledge  though the examining and judging of ideas by themselves their names being quite laid aside be the best and surest way to clear and distinct knowledge yet through the prevailing custom of using sounds for ideas i think it is very seldom practised every one may observe how common it is for names to be made use of instead of the ideas themselves even when men think and reason within their own breasts especially if the ideas be very complex and made up of a great collection of simple ones this makes the consideration of words and propositions so necessary a part of the treatise of knowledge that it is very hard to speak intelligibly of the one without explaining the other     general truths hardly to be understood but in verbal propositions  all the knowledge we have being only of particular or general truths it is evident that whatever may be done in the former of these the latter which is that which with reason is most sought after can never be well made known and is very seldom apprehended but as conceived and expressed in words it is not therefore out of our way in the examination of our knowledge to inquire into the truth and certainty of universal propositions     certainty twofoldof truth and of knowledge  but that we may not be misled in this case by that which is the danger everywhere i mean by the doubtfulness of terms it is fit to observe that certainty is twofold certainty of truth and certainty of knowledge certainty of truth is when words are so put together in propositions as exactly to express the agreement or disagreement of the ideas they stand for as really it is certainty of knowledge is to perceive the agreement or disagreement of ideas as expressed in any proposition this we usually call knowing or being certain of the truth of any proposition     no proposition can be certainly known to be true where the real essence of each species mentioned is not known  now because we cannot be certain of the truth of any general proposition unless we know the precise bounds and extent of the species its terms stand for it is necessary we should know the essence of each species which is that which constitutes and bounds it  this in all simple ideas and modes is not hard to do for in these the real and nominal essence being the same or which is all one the abstract idea which the general term stands for being the sole essence and boundary that is or can be supposed of the species there can be no doubt how far the species extends or what things are comprehended under each term which it is evident are all that have an exact conformity with the idea it stands for and no other but in substances wherein a real essence distinct from the nominal is supposed to constitute determine and bound the species the extent of the general word is very uncertain because not knowing this real essence we cannot know what is or what is not of that species and consequently what may or may not with certainty be affirmed of it and thus speaking of a man or gold or any other species of natural substances as supposed constituted by a precise and real essence which nature regularly imparts to every individual of that kind whereby it is made to be of that species we cannot be certain of the truth of any affirmation or negation made of it for man or gold taken in this sense and used for species of things constituted by real essences different from the complex idea in the mind of the speaker stand for we know not what and the extent of these species with such boundaries are so unknown and undetermined that it is impossible with any certainty to affirm that all men are rational or that all gold is yellow but where the nominal essence is kept to as the boundary of each species and men extend the application of any general term no further than to the particular things in which the complex idea it stands for is to be found there they are in no danger to mistake the bounds of each species nor can be in doubt on this account whether any proposition be true or not i have chosen to explain this uncertainty of propositions in this scholastic way and have made use of the terms of essences and species on purpose to show the absurdity and inconvenience there is to think of them as of any other sort of realities than barely abstract ideas with names to them to suppose that the species of things are anything but the sorting of them under general names according as they agree to several abstract ideas of which we make those names signs is to confound truth and introduce uncertainty into all general propositions that can be made about them though therefore these things might to people not possessed with scholastic learning be treated of in a better and clearer way yet those wrong notions of essences or species having got root in most peoples minds who have received any tincture from the learning which has prevailed in this part of the world are to be discovered and removed to make way for that use of words which should convey certainty with it     this more particularly concerns substances  the names of substances then whenever made to stand for species which are supposed to be constituted by real essences which we know not are not capable to convey certainty to the understanding of the truth general propositions made up of such terms we cannot be sure the reason whereof is plain for how can we be sure that this or that quality is in gold when we know not what is or is not gold since in this way of speaking nothing is gold but what partakes of an essence which we not knowing cannot know where it is or is not and so cannot be sure that any parcel of matter in the world is or is not in this sense gold being incurably ignorant whether it has or has not that which makes anything to be called gold i e that real essence of gold whereof we have no idea at all this being as impossible for us to know as it is for a blind man to tell in what flower the colour of a pansy is or is not to be found whilst he has no idea of the colour of a pansy at all or if we could which is impossible certainly know where a real essence which we know not is vg in what parcels of matter the real essence of gold is yet could we not be sure that this or that quality could with truth be affirmed of gold since it is impossible for us to know that this or that quality or idea has a necessary connexion with a real essence of which we have no idea at all whatever species that supposed real essence may be imagined to constitute      on the other side the names of substances when made use of as they should be for the ideas men have in their minds though they carry a clear and determinate signification with them will not yet serve us to make many universal propositions of whose truth we can be certain not because in this use of them we are uncertain what things are signified by them but because the complex ideas they stand for are such combinations of simple ones as carry not with them any discoverable connexion or repugnancy but with a very few other ideas      the complex ideas that our names of the species of substances properly stand for are collections of such qualities as have been observed to coexist in an unknown substratum which we call substance but what other qualities necessarily coexist with such combinations we cannot certainly know unless we can discover their natural dependence which in their primary qualities we can go but a very little way in and in all their secondary qualities we can discover no connexion at all for the reasons mentioned chap iii viz   because we know not the real constitutions of substances on which each secondary quality particularly depends   did we know that it would serve us only for experimental not universal knowledge and reach with certainty no further than that bare instance because our understandings can discover no conceivable connexion between any secondary quality and any modification whatsoever of any of the primary ones and therefore there are very few general propositions to be made concerning substances which can carry with them undoubted certainty     instance in gold  all gold is fixed is a proposition whose truth we cannot be certain of how universally soever it be believed for if according to the useless imagination of the schools any one supposes the term gold to stand for a species of things set out by nature by a real essence belonging to it it is evident he knows not what particular substances are of that species and so cannot with certainty affirm anything universally of gold but if he makes gold stand for a species determined by its nominal essence let the nominal essence for example be the complex idea of a body of a certain yellow colour malleable fusible and heavier than any other knownin this proper use of the word gold there is no difficulty to know what is or is not gold but yet no other quality can with certainty be universally affirmed or denied of gold but what hath a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with that nominal essence fixedness for example having no necessary connexion that we can discover with the colour weight or any other simple idea of our complex one or with the whole combination together it is impossible that we should certainly know the truth of this proposition that all gold is fixed     no discoverable necessary connexion between nominal essence gold and other simple ideas  as there is no discoverable connexion between fixedness and the colour weight and other simple ideas of that nominal essence of gold so if we make our complex idea of gold a body yellow fusable ductile weighty and fixed we shall be at the same uncertainty concerning solubility in aqua regia and for the same reason since we can never from consideration of the ideas themselves with certainty affirm or deny of a body whose complex idea is made up of yellow very weighty ductile fusible and fixed that it is soluble in aqua regia and so on of the rest of its qualities i would gladly meet with one general affirmation concerning any will no doubt be presently objected is not this an universal proposition all gold is malleable to which i answer it is a very complex idea the word gold stands for but then here is nothing affirmed of gold but that that sound stands for an idea in which malleableness is contained and such a sort of truth and certainty as this it is to say a centaur is fourfooted but if malleableness make not a part of the specific essence the name of gold stands for it is plain all gold is malleable is not a certain proposition because let the complex idea of gold be made up of whichsoever of its other qualities you please malleableness will not appear to depend on that complex idea nor follow from any simple one contained in it the connexion that malleableness has if it has any with those other qualities being only by the intervention of the real constitution of its insensible parts which since we know not it is impossible we should perceive that connexion unless we could discover that which ties them together    0 as far as any such coexistence can be known so far universal propositions maybe certain but this will go but a little way  the more indeed of these coexisting qualities we unite into one complex idea under one name the more precise and determinate we make the signification of that word but never yet make it thereby more capable of universal certainty in respect of other qualities not contained in our complex idea since we perceive not their connexion or dependence on one another being ignorant both of that real constitution in which they are all founded and also how they flow from it for the chief part of our knowledge concerning substances is not as in other things barely of the relation of two ideas that may exist separately but is of the necessary connexion and coexistence of several distinct ideas in the same subject or of their repugnancy so to coexist could we begin at the other end and discover what it was wherein that colour consisted what made a body lighter or heavier what texture of parts made it malleable fusible and fixed and fit to be dissolved in this sort of liquor and not in anotherif i say we had such an idea as this of bodies and could perceive wherein all sensible qualities originally consist and how they are produced we might frame such abstract ideas of them as would furnish us with matter of more general knowledge and enable us to make universal propositions that should carry general truth and certainty with them but whilst our complex ideas of the sorts of substances are so remote from that internal real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend and are made up of nothing but an imperfect collection of those apparent qualities our senses can discover there can be few general propositions concerning substances of whose real truth we can be certainly assured since there are but few simple ideas of whose connexion and necessary coexistence we can have certain and undoubted knowledge i imagine amongst all the secondary qualities of substances and the powers relating to them there cannot any two be named whose necessary coexistence or repugnance to coexist can certainly be known unless in those of the same sense which necessarily exclude one another as i have elsewhere showed no one i think by the colour that is in any body can certainly know what smell taste sound or tangible qualities it has nor what alterations it is capable to make or receive on or from other bodies the same may be said of the sound or taste c our specific names of substances standing for any collections of such ideas it is not to be wondered that we can with them make very few general propositions of undoubted real certainty but yet so far as any complex idea of any sort of substances contains in it any simple idea whose necessary coexistence with any other may be discovered so far universal propositions may with certainty be made concerning it vg could any one discover a necessary connexion between malleableness and the colour or weight of gold or any other part of the complex idea signified by that name he might make a certain universal proposition concerning gold in this respect and the real truth of this proposition that all gold is malliable would be as certain as of this the three angles of all rightlined triangles are all equal to two right ones      the qualities which make our complex ideas of substances depend mostly on external remote and unperceived causes  had we such ideas of substances as to know what real constitutions produce those sensible qualities we find in them and how those qualities flowed from thence we could by the specific ideas of their real essences in our own minds more certainly find out their properties and discover what qualities they had or had not than we can now by our senses and to know the properties of gold it would be no more necessary that gold should exist and that we should make experiments upon it than it is necessary for the knowing the properties of a triangle that a triangle should exist in any matter the idea in our minds would serve for the one as well as the other but we are so far from being admitted into the secrets of nature that we scarce so much as ever approach the first entrance towards them for we are wont to consider the substances we meet with each of them as an entire thing by itself having all its qualities in itself and independent of other things overlooking for the most part the operations of those invisible fluids they are encompassed with and upon whose motions and operations depend the greatest part of those qualities which are taken notice of in them and are made by us the inherent marks of distinction whereby we know and denominate them put a piece of gold anywhere by itself separate from the reach and influence of all other bodies it will immediately lose all its colour and weight and perhaps malleableness too which for aught i know would be changed into a perfect friability water in which to us fluidity is an essential quality left to itself would cease to be fluid but if inanimate bodies owe so much of their present state to other bodies without them that they would not be what they appear to us were those bodies that environ them removed it is yet more so in vegetables which are nourished grow and produce leaves flowers and seeds in a constant succession and if we look a little nearer into the state of animals we shall find that their dependence as to life motion and the most considerable qualities to be observed in them is so wholly on extrinsical causes and qualities of other bodies that make no part of them that they cannot subsist a moment without them though yet those bodies on which they depend are little taken notice of and make no part of the complex ideas we frame of those animals take the air but for a minute from the greatest part of living creatures and they presently lose sense life and motion this the necessity of breathing has forced into our knowledge but how many other extrinsical and possibly very remote bodies do the springs of these admirable machines depend on which are not vulgarly observed or so much as thought on and how many are there which the severest inquiry can never discover the inhabitants of this spot of the universe though removed so many millions of miles from the sun yet depend so much on the duly tempered motion of particles coming from or agitated by it that were this earth removed but a small part of the distance out of its present situation and placed a little further or nearer that source of heat it is more than probable that the greatest part of the animals in it would immediately perish since we find them so often destroyed by an excess or defect of the suns warmth which an accidental position in some parts of this our little globe exposes them to the qualities observed in a loadstone must needs have their source far beyond the confines of that body and the ravage made often on several sorts of animals by invisible causes the certain death as we are told of some of them by barely passing the line or as it is certain of other by being removed into a neighbouring country evidently show that the concurrence and operations of several bodies with which they are seldom thought to have anything to do is absolutely necessary to make them be what they appear to us and to preserve those qualities by which we know and distinguish them we are then quite out of the way when we think that things contain within themselves the qualities that appear to us in them and we in vain search for that constitution within the body of a fly or an elephant upon which depend those qualities and powers we observe in them for which perhaps to understand them aright we ought to look not only beyond this our earth and atmosphere but even beyond the sun or remotest star our eyes have yet discovered for how much the being and operation of particular substances in this our globe depends on causes utterly beyond our view is impossible for us to determine we see and perceive some of the motions and grosser operations of things here about us but whence the streams come that keep all these curious machines in motion and repair how conveyed and modified is beyond our notice and apprehension and the great parts and wheels as i may so say of this stupendous structure of the universe may for aught we know have such a connexion and dependence in their influences and operations one upon another that perhaps things in this our mansion would put on quite another face and cease to be what they are if some one of the stars or great bodies incomprehensibly remote from us should cease to be or move as it does this is certain things however absolute and entire they seem in themselves are but retainers to other parts of nature for that which they are most taken notice of by us their observable qualities actions and powers are owing to something without them and there is not so complete and perfect a part that we know of nature which does not owe the being it has and the excellences of it to its neighbours and we must not confine our thoughts within the surface of any body but look a great deal further to comprehend perfectly those qualities that are in it      our nominal essences of substances furnish few universal propositions about them that are certain  if this be so it is not to be wondered that we have very imperfect ideas of substances and that the real essences on which depend their properties and operations are unknown to us we cannot discover so much as that size figure and texture of their minute and active parts which is really in much less the different motions and impulses made in and upon them by bodies from without upon which depends and by which is formed the greatest and most remarkable part of those qualities we observe in them and of which our complex ideas of them are made up this consideration alone is enough to put an end to all our hopes of ever having the ideas of their real essences which whilst we want the nominal essences we make use of instead of them will be able to furnish us but very sparingly with any general knowledge or universal propositions capable of real certainty      judgment of probability concerning substances may reach further but that is not knowledge  we are not therefore to wonder if certainty be to be found in very few general propositions made concerning substances our knowledge of their qualities and properties goes very seldom further than our senses reach and inform us possibly inquisitive and observing men may by strength of judgment penetrate further and on probabilities taken from wary observation and hints well laid together often guess right at what experience has not yet discovered to them but this is but guessing still it amounts only to opinion and has not that certainty which is requisite to knowledge for all general knowledge lies only in our own thoughts and consists barely in the contemplation of our own abstract ideas wherever we perceive any agreement or disagreement amongst them there we have general knowledge and by putting the names of those ideas together accordingly in propositions can with certainty pronounce general truths but because the abstract ideas of substances for which their specific names stand whenever they have any distinct and determinate signification have a discoverable connexion or inconsistency with but a very few other ideas the certainty of universal propositions concerning substances is very narrow and scanty in that part which is our principal inquiry concerning them and there are scarce any of the names of substances let the idea it is applied to be what it will of which we can generally and with certainty pronounce that it has or has not this or that other quality belonging to it and constantly coexisting or inconsistent with that idea wherever it is to be found      what is requisite for our knowledge of substances  before we can have any tolerable knowledge of this kind we must first know what changes the primary qualities of one body do regularly produce in the primary qualities of another and how secondly we must know what primary qualities of any body produce certain sensations or ideas in us this is in truth no less than to know all the effects of matter under its divers modifications of bulk figure cohesion of parts motion and rest which i think every body will allow is utterly impossible to be known by us without revelation nor if it were revealed to us what sort of figure bulk and motion of corpuscles would produce in us the sensation of a yellow colour and what sort of figure bulk and texture of parts in the superficies of any body were fit to give such corpuscles their due motion to produce that colour would that be enough to make universal propositions with certainty concerning the several sorts of them unless we had faculties acute enough to perceive the precise bulk figure texture and motion of bodies in those minute parts by which they operate on our senses so that we might by those frame our abstract ideas of them i have mentioned here only corporeal substances whose operations seem to lie more level to our understandings for as to the operations of spirits both their thinking and moving of bodies we at first sight find ourselves at a loss though perhaps when we have applied our thoughts a little nearer to the consideration of bodies and their operations and examined how far our notions even in these reach with any clearness beyond sensible matter of fact we shall be bound to confess that even in these too our discoveries amount to very little beyond perfect ignorance and incapacity      whilst our complex ideas of substances contain not ideas of their real constitutions we can make but few general propositions concerning them  this is evident the abstract complex ideas of substances for which their general names stand not comprehending their real constitutions can afford us very little universal certainty because our ideas of them are not made up of that on which those qualities we observe in them and would inform ourselves about do depend or with which they have any certain connexion vg let the ideas to which we give the name man be as it commonly is a body of the ordinary shape with sense voluntary motion and reason joined to it this being the abstract idea and consequently the essence of our species man we can make but very few general certain propositions concerning man standing for such an idea because not knowing the real constitution on which sensation power of motion and reasoning with that peculiar shape depend and whereby they are united together in the same subject there are very few other qualities with which we can perceive them to have a necessary connexion and therefore we cannot with certainty affirm that all men sleep by intervals that no man can be nourished by wood or stones that all men will be poisoned by hemlock because these ideas have no connexion nor repugnancy with this our nominal essence of man with this abstract idea that name stands for we must in these and the like appeal to trial in particular subjects which can reach but a little way we must content ourselves with probability in the rest but can have no general certainty whilst our specific idea of man contains not that real constitution which is the root wherein all his inseparable qualities are united and from whence they flow whilst our idea the word man stands for is only an imperfect collection of some sensible qualities and powers in him there is no discernible connexion or repugnance between our specific idea and the operation of either the parts of hemlock or stones upon his constitution there are animals that safely eat hemlock and others that are nourished by wood and stones but as long as we want ideas of those real constitutions of different sorts of animals whereon these and the like qualities and powers depend we must not hope to reach certainty in universal propositions concerning them those few ideas only which have a discernible connexion with our nominal essence or any part of it can afford us such propositions but these are so few and of so little moment that we may justly look on our certain general knowledge of substances as almost none at all      wherein lies the general certainty of propositions  to conclude general propositions of what kind soever are then only capable of certainty when the terms used in them stand for such ideas whose agreement or disagreement as there expressed is capable to be discovered by us and we are then certain of their truth or falsehood when we perceive the ideas the terms stand for to agree or not agree according as they are affirmed or denied one of another whence we may take notice that general certainty is never to be found but in our ideas whenever we go to seek it elsewhere in experiment or observations without us our knowledge goes not beyond particulars it is the contemplation of our own abstract ideas that alone is able to afford us general knowledge     chapter vii of maxims     maxims or axioms are selfevident propositions  there are a sort of propositions which under the name of maxims and axioms have passed for principles of science and because they are selfevident have been supposed innate without that anybody that i know ever went about to show the reason and foundation of their clearness or cogency it may however be worth while to inquire into the reason of their evidence and see whether it be peculiar to them alone and also to examine how far they influence and govern our other knowledge     where in that selfevidence consists  knowledge as has been shown consists in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas now where that agreement or disagreement is perceived immediately by itself without the intervention or help of any other there our knowledge is selfevident this will appear to be so to any who will but consider any of those propositions which without any proof he assents to at first sight for in all of them he will find that the reason of his assent is from that agreement or disagreement which the mind by an immediate comparing them finds in those ideas answering the affirmation or negation in the proposition     self evidence not peculiar to received axioms  this being so in the next place let us consider whether this selfevidence be peculiar only to those propositions which commonly pass under the name of maxims and have the dignity of axioms allowed them and here it is plain that several other truths not allowed to be axioms partake equally with them in this selfevidence this we shall see if we go over these several sorts of agreement or disagreement of ideas which i have above mentioned viz identity relation coexistence and real existence which will discover to us that not only those few propositions which have had the credit of maxims are selfevident but a great many even almost an infinite number of other propositions are such     as to identity and diversity all propositions are equally selfevident  i for first the immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of identity being founded in the minds having distinct ideas this affords us as many selfevident propositions as we have distinct ideas every one that has any knowledge at all has as the foundation of it various and distinct ideas and it is the first act of the mind without which it can never be capable of any knowledge to know every one of its ideas by itself and distinguish it from others every one finds in himself that he knows the ideas he has that he knows also when any one is in his understanding and what it is and that when more than one are there he knows them distinctly and unconfusedly one from another which always being so it being impossible but that he should perceive what he perceives he can never be in doubt when any idea is in his mind that it is there and is that idea it is and that two distinct ideas when they are in his mind are there and are not one and the same idea so that all such affirmations and negations are made without any possibility of doubt uncertainty or hesitation and must necessarily be assented to as soon as understood that is as soon as we have in our minds determined ideas which the terms in the proposition stand for and therefore whenever the mind with attention considers any proposition so as to perceive the two ideas signified by the terms and affirmed or denied one of the other to be the same or different it is presently and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition and this equally whether these propositions be in terms standing for more general ideas or such as are less so vg whether the general idea of being be affirmed of itself as in this proposition whatsoever is is or a more particular idea be affirmed of itself as a man is a man or whatsoever is white is white or whether the idea of being in general be denied of notbeing which is the only if i may so call it idea different from it as in this other proposition it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be or any idea of any particular being be denied of another different from it as a man is not a horse red is not blue the difference of the ideas as soon as the terms are understood makes the truth of the proposition presently visible and that with an equal certainty and easiness in the less as well as the more general propositions and all for the same reason viz because the mind perceives in any ideas that it has the same idea to be the same with itself and two different ideas to be different and not the same and this it is equally certain of whether these ideas be more or less general abstract and comprehensive it is not therefore alone to these two general propositionswhatsoever is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to bethat this sort of selfevidence belongs by any peculiar right the perception of being or not being belongs no more to these vague ideas signified by the terms whatsoever and thing than it does to any other ideas these two general maxims amounting to no more in short but this that the same is the same and the same is not different are truths known in more particular instances as well as in those general maxims and known also in particular instances before these general maxims are ever thought on and draw all their force from the discernment of the mind employed about particular ideas there is nothing more visible than that the mind without the help of any proof or reflection on either of these general propositions perceives so clearly and knows so certainly that the idea of white is the idea of white and not the idea of blue and that the idea of white when it is in the mind is there and is not absent that the consideration of these axioms can add nothing to the evidence or certainty of its knowledge just so it is as every one may experiment in himself in all the ideas a man has in his mind he knows each to be itself and not to be another and to be in his mind and not away when it is there with a certainty that cannot be greater and therefore the truth of no general proposition can be known with a greater certainty nor add anything to this so that in respect of identity our intuitive knowledge reaches as far as our ideas and we are capable of making as many selfevident propositions as we have names for distinct ideas and i appeal to every ones own mind whether this proposition a circle is a circle be not as selfevident a proposition as that consisting of more general terms whatsoever is is and again whether this proposition blue is not red be not a proposition that the mind can no more doubt of as soon as it understands the words than it does of that axiom it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and so of all the like     in coexistance we have few selfevident propositions  ii secondly as to coexistance or such a necessary connexion between two ideas that in the subject where one of them is supposed there the other must necessarily be also of such agreement or disagreement as this the mind has an immediate perception but in very few of them and therefore in this sort we have but very little intuitive knowledge nor are there to be found very many propositions that are selfevident though some there are vg the idea of filling a place equal to the contents of its superficies being annexed to our idea of body i think it is a selfevident proposition that two bodies cannot be in the same place     iii in other relations we may have many  thirdly as to the relations of modes mathematicians have framed many axioms concerning that one relation of equality as equals taken from equals the remainder will be equal which with the rest of that kind however they are received for maxims by the mathematicians and are unquestionable truths yet i think that any one who considers them will not find that they have a clearer selfevidence than thesethat one and one are equal to two that if you take from the five fingers of one hand two and from the five fingers of the other hand two the remaining numbers will be equal these and a thousand other such propositions may be found in numbers which at the very first hearing force the assent and carry with them an equal if not greater clearness than those mathematical axioms     iv concerning real existence we have none  fourthly as to real existance since that has no connexion with any other of our ideas but that of ourselves and of a first being we have in that concerning the real existence of all other beings not so much as demonstrative much less a selfevident knowledge and therefore concerning those there are no maxims     these axioms do not much influence our other knowledge  in the next place let us consider what influence these received maxims have upon the other parts of our knowledge the rules established in the schools that all reasonings are ex praecognitis et praeconcessis seem to lay the foundation of all other knowledge in these maxims and to suppose them to be praecognita whereby i think are meant these two things first that these axioms are those truths that are first known to the mind and secondly that upon them the other parts of our knowledge depend     because maxims or axioms are not the truths we first knew  first that they are not the truths first known to the mind is evident to experience as we have shown in another place book i chap   who perceives not that a child certainly knows that a stranger is not its mother that its suckingbottle is not the rod long before he knows that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and how many truths are there about numbers which it is obvious to observe that the mind is perfectly acquainted with and fully convinced of before it ever thought on these general maxims to which mathematicians in their arguings do sometimes refer them whereof the reason is very plain for that which makes the mind assent to such propositions being nothing else but the perception it has of the agreement or disagreement of its ideas according as it finds them affirmed or denied one of another in words it understands and every idea being known to be what it is and every two distinct ideas being known not to be the same it must necessarily follow that such selfevident truths must be first known which consist of ideas that are first in the mind and the ideas first in the mind it is evident are those of particular things from whence by slow degrees the understanding proceeds to some few general ones which being taken from the ordinary and familiar objects of sense are settled in the mind with general names to them thus particular ideas are first received and distinguished and so knowledge got about them and next to them the less general or specific which are next to particular for abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine for example does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a trianglewhich is yet none of the more abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalinon but all and none of these at once in effect it is something imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some part of several different and inconsistant ideas are put together it is true the mind in this imperfect state has need of such ideas and makes all the haste to them it can for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it is naturally very much inclined but yet one has reason to suspect such ideas are marks of our imperfection at least this is enough to show that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is first and most easily acquainted with nor such as its earliest knowledge is conversant about    0 because on perception of them the other parts of our knowledge do not depend  secondly from what has been said it plainly follows that these magnified maxims are not the principles and foundations of all our other knowledge for if there be a great many other truths which have as much selfevidence as they and a great many that we know before them it is impossible they should be the principles from which we deduce all other truths is it impossible to know that one and two are equal to three but by virtue of this or some such axiom viz the whole is equal to all its parts taken together many a one knows that one and two are equal to three without having heard or thought on that or any other axiom by which it might be proved and knows it as certainly as any other man knows that the whole is equal to all its parts or any other maxim and all from the same reason of selfevidence the equality of those ideas being as visible and certain to him without that or any other axiom as with it it needing no proof to make it perceived nor after the knowledge that the whole is equal to all its parts does he know that one and two are equal to three better or more certainly than he did before for if there be any odds in those ideas the whole and parts are more obscure or at least more difficult to be settled in the mind than those of one two and three and indeed i think i may ask these men who will needs have all knowledge besides those general principles themselves to depend on general innate and selfevident principles what principle is requisite to prove that one and one are two that two and two are four that three times two are six which being known without any proof do evince that either all knowledge does not depend on certain praecognita or general maxims called principles or else that these are principles and if these are to be counted principles a great part of numeration will be so to which if we add all the selfevident propositions which may be made about all our distinct ideas principles will be almost infinite at least innumerable which men arrive to the knowledge of at different ages and a great many of these innate principles they never come to know all their lives but whether they come in view of the mind earlier or later this is true of them that they are all known by their native evidence are wholly independent receive no light nor are capable of any proof one from another much less the more particular from the more general or the more simple from the more compounded the more simple and less abstract being the most familiar and the easier and earlier apprehended but whichever be the clearest ideas the evidence and certainty of all such propositions is in this that a man sees the same idea to be the same idea and infallibly perceives two different ideas to be different ideas for when a man has in his understanding the ideas of one and of two the idea of yellow and the idea of blue he cannot but certainly know that the idea of one is the idea of one and not the idea of two and that the idea of yellow is the idea of yellow and not the idea of blue for a man cannot confound the ideas in his mind which he has distinct that would be to have them confused and distinct at the same time which is a contradiction and to have none distinct is to have no use of our faculties to have no knowledge at all and therefore what idea soever is affirmed of itself or whatsoever two entire distinct ideas are denied one of another the mind cannot but assent to such a proposition as infallibly true as soon as it understands the terms without hesitation or need of proof or regarding those made in more general terms and called maxims      what use these general maxims or axioms have  what shall we then say are these general maxims of no use by no means though perhaps their use is not that which it is commonly taken to be but since doubting in the least of what hath been by some men ascribed to these maxims may be apt to be cried out against as overturning the foundations of all the sciences it may be worth while to consider them with respect to other parts of our knowledge and examine more particularly to what purposes they serve and to what not  of no use to prove less general propositions nor as foundations on consideration of which any science has been built    it is evident from what has been already said that they are of no use to prove or confirm less general selfevident propositions   it is as plain that they are not nor have been the foundations whereon any science hath been built there is i know a great deal of talk propagated from scholastic men of sciences and the maxims on which they are built but it has been my illluck never to meet with any such sciences much less any one built upon these two maxims what is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and i would be glad to be shown where any such science erected upon these or any other general axioms is to be found and should be obliged to any one who would lay before me the frame and system of any science so built on these or any such like maxims that could not be shown to stand as firm without any consideration of them i ask whether these general maxims have not the same use in the study of divinity and in theological questions that they have in other sciences they serve here too to silence wranglers and put an end to dispute but i think that nobody will therefore say that the christian religion is built upon these maxims or that the knowledge we have of it is derived from these principles it is from revelation we have received it and without revelation these maxims had never been able to help us to it when we find out an idea by whose intervention we discover the connexion of two others this is a revelation from god to us by the voice of reason for we then come to know a truth that we did not know before when god declares any truth to us this is a revelation to us by the voice of his spirit and we are advanced in our knowledge but in neither of these do we receive our light or knowledge from maxims but in the one the things themselves afford it and we see the truth in them by perceiving their agreement or disagreement in the other god himself affords it immediately to us and we see the truth of what he says in his unerring veracity    nor as helps in the discovery of yet unknown truths  they are not of use to help men forward in the advancement of sciences or new discoveries of yet unknown truths mr newton in his never enough to be admired book has demonstrated several propositions which are so many new truths before unknown to the world and are further advances in mathematical knowledge but for the discovery of these it was not the general maxims what is is or the whole is bigger than a part or the like that helped him these were not the clues that led him into the discovery of the truth and certainty of those propositions nor was it by them that he got the knowledge of those demonstrations but by finding out intermediate ideas that showed the agreement or disagreement of the ideas as expressed in the propositions he demonstrated this is the greatest exercise and improvement of human understanding in the enlarging of knowledge and advancing the sciences wherein they are far enough from receiving any help from the contemplation of these or the like magnified maxims would those who have this traditional admiration of these propositions that they think no step can be made in knowledge without the support of an axiom no stone laid in the building of the sciences without a general maxim but distinguish between the method of acquiring knowledge and of communicating it between the method of raising any science and that of teaching it to others as far as it is advancedthey would see that those general maxims were not the foundations on which the first discoverers raised their admirable structures nor the keys that unlocked and opened those secrets of knowledge though afterwards when schools were erected and sciences had their professors to teach what others had found out they often made use of maxims ie laid down certain propositions which were selfevident or to be received for true which being settled in the minds of their scholars as unquestionable verities they on occasion made use of to convince them of truths in particular instances that were not so familiar to their minds as those general axioms which had before been inculcated to them and carefully settled in their minds though these particular instances when well reflected on are no less selfevident to the understanding than the general maxims brought to confirm them and it was in those particular instances that the first discoverer found the truth without the help of the general maxims and so may any one else do who with attention considers them  maxims of use in the exposition of what has been discovered and in silencing obstinate wranglers  to come therefore to the use that is made of maxims   they are of use as has been observed in the ordinary methods of teaching sciences as far as they are advanced but of little or none in advancing them further   they are of use in disputes for the silencing of obstinate wranglers and bringing those contests to some conclusion whether a need of them to that end came not in the manner following i crave leave to inquire the schools having made disputation the touchstone of mens abilities and the criterion of knowledge adjudged victory to him that kept the field and he that had the last word was concluded to have the better of the argument if not of the cause but because by this means there was like to be no decision between skilful combatants whilst one never failed of a medius terminus to prove any proposition and the other could as constantly without or with a distinction deny the major or minor to prevent as much as could be running out of disputes into an endless train of syllogisms certain general propositionsmost of them indeed selfevidentwere introduced into the schools which being such as all men allowed and agreed in were looked on as general measures of truth and served instead of principles where the disputants had not lain down any other between them beyond which there was no going and which must not be receded from by either side and thus these maxims getting the name of principles beyond which men in dispute could not retreat were by mistake taken to be the originals and sources from whence all knowledge began and the foundations whereon the sciences were built because when in their disputes they came to any of these they stopped there and went no further the matter was determined but how much this is a mistake hath been already shown   how maxims came to be so much in vogue  this method of the schools which have been thought the fountains of knowledge introduced as i suppose the like use of these maxims into a great part of conversation out of the schools to stop the mouths of cavillers whom any one is excused from arguing any longer with when they deny these general selfevident principles received by all reasonable men who have once thought of them but yet their use herein is but to put an end to wrangling they in truth when urged in such cases teach nothing that is already done by the intermediate ideas made use of in the debate whose connexion may be seen without the help of those maxims and so the truth known before the maxim is produced and the argument brought to a first principle men would give off a wrong argument before it came to that if in their disputes they proposed to themselves the finding and embracing of truth and not a contest for victory and thus maxims have their use to put a stop to their perverseness whose ingenuity should have yielded sooner but the method of the schools having allowed and encouraged men to oppose and resist evident truth till they are baffled ie till they are reduced to contradict themselves or some established principles it is no wonder that they should not in civil conversation be ashamed of that which in the schools is counted a virtue and a glory viz obstinately to maintain that side of the question they have chosen whether true or false to the last extremity even after conviction a strange way to attain truth and knowledge and that which i think the rational part of mankind not corrupted by education could scare believe should ever be admitted amongst the lovers of truth and students of religion or nature or introduced into the seminaries of those who are to propegate the truths of religion or philosophy amongst the ignorant and unconvinced how much such a way of learning is like to turn young mens minds from the sincere search and love of truth nay and to make them doubt whether there is any such thing or at least worth the adhering to i shall not now inquire this i think that bating those places which brought the peripatetic philosophy into their schools where it continued many ages without teaching the world anything but the art of wrangling these maxims were nowhere thought the foundations on which the sciences were built nor the great helps to the advancement of knowledge   of great use to stop wranglers in disputes but of little use to the discovery of truths  as to these general maxims therefore they are as i have said of great use in disputes to stop the mouths of wranglers but not of much use to the discovery of unknown truths or to help the mind forwards in its search after knowledge for who ever began to build his knowledge on this general proposition what is is or it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and from either of these as from a principle of science deduced a system of useful knowledge wrong opinions often involving contradictions one of these maxims as a touchstone may serve well to show whither they lead but yet however fit to lay open the absurdity or mistake of a mans reasoning or opinion they are of very little use for enlightening the understanding and it will not be found that the mind receives much help from them in its progress in knowledge which would be neither less nor less certain were these two general propositions never thought on it is true as i have said they sometimes serve in argumentation to stop a wranglers mouth by showing the absurdity of what he saith and by exposing him to the shame of contradicting what all the world knows and he himself cannot but own to be true but it is one thing to show a man that he is in an error and another to put him in possession of truth and i would fain know what truths these two propositions are able to teach and by their influence make us know which we did not know before or could not know without them let us reason from them as well as we can they are only about identical predications and influence if any at all none but such each particular proposition concerning identity or diversity is as clearly and certainly known in itself if attended to as either of these general ones only these general ones as serving in all cases are therefore more inculcated and insisted on as to other less general maxims many of them are no more than bare verbal propositions and teach us nothing but the respect and import of names one to another the whole is equal to all its parts what real truth i beseech you does it teach us what more is contained in that maxim than what the signification of the word totum or the whole does of itself import and he that knows that the word whole stands for what is made up of all its parts knows very little less than that the whole is equal to all its parts and upon the same ground i think that this proposition a hill is higher than a valley and several the like may also pass for maxims but yet masters of mathematics when they would as teachers of what they know initiate others in that science do not without reason place this and some other such maxims at the entrance of their systems that their scholars having in the beginning perfectly acquainted their thoughts with these propositions made in such general terms may be used to make such reflections and have these more general propositions as formed rules and sayings ready to apply to all particular cases not that if they be equally weighed they are more clear and evident than the particular instances they are brought to confirm but that being more familiar to the mind the very naming them is enough to satisfy the understanding but this i say is more from our custom of using them and the establishment they have got in our minds by our often thinking of them than from the different evidence of the things but before custom has settled methods of thinking and reasoning in our minds i am apt to imagine it is quite otherwise and that the child when a part of his apple is taken away knows it better in that particular instance than by this general proposition the whole is equal to all its parts and that if one of these have need to be confirmed to him by the other the general has more need to be let into his mind by the particular than the particular by the general for in particulars our knowledge begins and so spreads itself by degrees to generals footnote this is the order in time of the conscious acquistion of knowledge that is human the essay might be regarded as a commentary on this one sentence our intellectual progress is from particulars and involuntary recipiency through reactive doubt and criticism into what is at last reasoned faith though afterwards the mind takes the quite contrary course and having drawn its knowledge into as general propositions as it can makes those familiar to its thoughts and accustoms itself to have recourse to them as to the standards of truth and falsehood footnote this is the philosophic attitude therein one consciously apprehends the intellectual necessities that were unconciously presupposed its previous intellectual progress in philosophy we draw our knowledge into as general propositions as it can be made to assume and thus either learn to see it as an organic while in a speculative unity or learn that it cannot be so seen in a finite intelligence and that even at the last it must remain broken and mysterious in the human understanding  by which familiar use of them as rules to measure the truth of other propositions it comes in time to be thought that more particular propositions have their truth and evidence from their conformity to these more general ones which in discourse and argumentation are so frequently urged and constantly admitted and this i think to be the reason why amongst so many selfevident propositions the most general only have had the title of maxims      maxims if care be not taken in the use of words may prove contradictions  one thing further i think it may not be amiss to observe concerning these general maxims that they are so far from improving or establishing our minds in true knowledge that if our notions be wrong loose or unsteady and we resign up our thoughts to the sound of words rather than fix them on settled determined ideas of things i say these general maxims will serve to confirm us in mistakes and in such a way of use of words which is most common will serve to prove contradictions vg he that with descartes shall frame in his mind an idea of what he calls body to be nothing but extension may easily demonstrate that there is no vacuum ie no space void of body by this maxim what is is for the idea to which he annexes the name body being bare extension his knowledge that space cannot be without body is certain for he knows his own idea of extension clearly and distinctly and knows that it is what it is and not another idea though it be called by these three namesextension body space which three words standing for one and the same idea may no doubt with the same evidence and certainty be affirmed one of another as each of itself and it is as certain that whilst i use them all to stand for one and the same idea this predication is as true and identical in its signification that space is body as this predication is true and identical that body is body both in signification and sound      instance in vacuum  but if another should come and make to himself another idea different from descartess of the thing which yet with descartes he calls by the same name body and make his idea which he expresses by the word body to be of a thing that hath both extension and solidity together he will as easily demonstrate that there may be a vacuum or space without a body as descartes demonstrated the contrary because the idea to which he gives the name space being barely the simple one of extension and the idea to which he gives the name body being the complex idea of extension and resistibility or solidity together in the same subject these two ideas are not exactly one and the same but in the understanding as distinct as the ideas of one and two white and black or as of corporeity and humanity if i may use those barbarous terms and therefore the predication of them in our minds or in words standing for them is not identical but the negation of them one of another viz this proposition extension or space is not body is as true and evidently certain as this maxim it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be can make any proposition      but they prove not the existance of things without us  but yet though both these propositions as you see may be equally demonstrated viz that there may be a vacuum and that there cannot be a vacuum by these two certain principles viz what is is and the same thing cannot be and not be yet neither of these principles will serve to prove to us that any or what bodies do exist for that we are left to our senses to discover to us as far as they can those universal and selfevident principles being only our constant clear and distinct knowledge of our own ideas more general or comprehensive can assure us of nothing that passes without the mind their certainty is founded only upon the knowledge we have of each idea by itself and of its distinction from others about which we cannot be mistaken whilst they are in our minds though we may be and often are mistaken when we retain the names without the ideas or use them confusedly sometimes for one and sometimes for another idea in which cases the force of these axioms reaching only to the sound and not the signification of the words serves only to lead us into confusion mistake and error it is to show men that these maxims however cried up for the great guards of truth will not secure them from error in a careless loose use of their words that i have made this remark in all that is here suggested concerning their little use for the improvement of knowledge or dangerous use in undetermined ideas i have been far enough from saying or intending they should be laid aside as some have been too forward to charge me i affirm them to be truths selfevident truths and so cannot be laid aside as far as their influence will reach it is in vain to endeavour nor will i attempt to abridge it but yet without any injury to truth or knowledge i may have reason to think their use is not answerable to the great stress which seems to be laid on them and i may warn men not to make an ill use of them for the confirming themselves in errors      they cannot add to our knowledge of substances and their application to complex ideas is dangerous  but let them be of what use they will in verbal propositions they cannot discover or prove to us the least knowledge of the nature of substances as they are found and exist without us any further than grounded on experience and though the consequence of these two propositions called principles be very clear and their use not dangerous or hurtful in the probation of such things wherein there is no need at all of them for proof but such as are clear by themselves without them viz where our ideas are determined and known by the names that stand for them yet when these principles viz what is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be are made use of in the probation of propositions wherein are words standing for complex ideas vg man horse gold virtue there they are of infinite danger and most commonly make men receive and retain falsehood for manifest truth and uncertainty for demonstration upon which follow error obstinacy and all the mischiefs that can happen from wrong reasoning the reason whereof is not that these principles are less true or of less force in proving propositions made of terms standing for complex ideas than where the propositions are about simple ideas but because men mistake generallythinking that where the same terms are preserved the propositions are about the same things though the ideas they stand for are in truth different therefore these maxims are made use of to support those which in sound and appearance are contradictory propositions and is clear in the demonstrations above mentioned about a vacuum so that whilst men take words for things as usually they do these maxims may and do commonly serve to prove contradictory propositions as shall yet be further made manifest      instance in demonstrations about man which can only be verbal  for instance let man be that concerning which you would by these first principles demonstrate anything and we shall see that so far as demonstration is by these principles it is only verbal and gives us no certain universal true proposition or knowledge of any being existing without us first a child having framed the idea of a man it is probable that his idea is just like that picture which the painter makes of the visible appearances joined together and such a complication of ideas together in his understanding makes up the single complex idea which he calls man whereof white or fleshcolour in england being one the child can demonstrate to you that a negro is not a man because white colour was one of the constant simple ideas of the complex idea he calls man and therefore he can demonstrate by the principle it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be that a negro is not a man the foundation of his certainty being not that universal proposition which perhaps he never heard nor thought of but the clear distinct perception he hath of his own simple ideas of black and white which he cannot be persuaded to take nor can ever mistake one for another whether he knows that maxim or no and to this child or any one who hath such an idea which he calls man can you never demonstrate that a man hath a soul because his idea of man includes no such notion or idea in it and therefore to him the principle of what is is proves not this matter but it depends upon collection and observation by which he is to make his complex idea called man      another instance  secondly another that hath gone further in framing and collecting the idea he calls man and to the outward shape adds laughter and rational discourse may demonstrate that infants and changelings are no men by this maxim it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be and i have discoursed with very rational men who have actually denied that they are men      a third instance  thirdly perhaps another makes up the complex idea which he calls man only out of the ideas of body in general and the powers of language and reason and leaves out the shape wholly this man is able to demonstrate that a man may have no hands but be quadrupes neither of those being included in his idea of man and in whatever body or shape he found speech and reason joined that was a man because having a clear knowledge of such a complex idea it is certain that what is is      little use of these maxims in proofs where we have clear and distinct ideas  so that if rightly considered i think we may say that where our ideas are determined in our minds and have annexed to them by us known and steady names under those settled determinations there is little need or no use at all of these maxims to prove the agreement or disagreement of any of them he that cannot discern the truth or falsehood of such propositions without the help of these and the like maxims will not be helped by these maxims to do it since he cannot be supposed to know the truth of these maxims themselves without proof if he cannot know the truth of others without proof which are as selfevident as these upon this ground it is that intuitive knowledge neither requires nor admits any proof one part of it more than another he that will suppose it does takes away the foundation of all knowledge and certainty and he that needs any proof to make him certain and give his assent to this proposition that two are equal to two will also have need of a proof to make him admit that what is is he that needs a probation to convince him that two are not three that white is not black that a triangle is not a circle c or any other two determined distinct ideas are not one and the same will need also a demonstration to convince him that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be    0 their use dangerous where our ideas are not determined  and as these maxims are of little use where we have determined ideas so they are as i have showed of dangerous use where our ideas are not determined and where we use words that are not annexed to determined ideas but such as are of a loose and wandering signification sometimes standing for one and sometimes for another idea from which follow mistake and error which these maxims brought as proofs to establish propositions wherein the terms stand for undetermined ideas do by their authority confirm and rivet     chapter viii of trifling propositions     some propositions bring no increase to our knowledge  whether the maxims treated of in the foregoing chapter be of that use to real knowledge as is generally supposed i leave to be considered this i think may confidently be affirmed that there are universal propositions which though they be certainly true yet they add no light to our understanding bring no increase to our knowledge such are     as first identical propositions  first all purely identical propositions these obviously and at first blush appear to contain no instruction in them for when we affirm the said term of itself whether it be barely verbal or whether it contains any clear and real idea it shows us nothing but what we must certainly know before whether such a proposition be either made by or proposed to us indeed that most general one what is is may serve sometimes to show a man the absurdity he is guilty of when by circumlocution or equivocal terms he would in particular instances deny the same thing of itself because nobody will so openly bid defiance to common sense as to affirm visible and direct contradictions in plain words or if he does a man is excused if he breaks off any further discourse with him but yet i think i may say that neither that received maxim nor any other identical proposition teaches us anything and though in such kind of propositions this great and magnified maxim boasted to be the foundation of demonstration may be and often is made use of to confirm them yet all it proves amounts to no more than this that the same word may with great certainty be affirmed of itself without any doubt of the truth of any such proposition and let me add also without any real knowledge     examples  for at this rate any very ignorant person who can but make a proposition and knows what he means when he says ay or no may make a million of propositions of whose truth he may be infallibly certain and yet not know one thing in the world thereby vg what is a soul is a soul or a soul is a soul a spirit is a spirit a fetiche is a fetiche c these all being equivalent to this proposition viz what is is ie what hath existence hath existence or who hath a soul hath a soul what is this more than trifling with words it is but like a monkey shifting his oyster from one hand to the other and had he but words might no doubt have said oyster in right hand is subject and oyster in left hand is predicate and so might have made a selfevident proposition of oyster ie oyster is oyster and yet with all this not have been one whit the wiser or more knowing and that way of handling the matter would much at one have satisfied the monkeys hunger or a mans understanding and they would have improved in knowledge and bulk together     secondly propositions in which a part of any complex idea is predicated of the whole  ii another sort of trifling propositions is when a part of the complex idea is predicated of the name of the whole a part of the definition of the word defined such are all propositions wherein the genus is predicated of the species or more comprehensive of less comprehensive terms for what information what knowledge carries this proposition in it viz lead is a metal to a man who knows the complex idea the name lead stands for all the simple ideas that go to the complex one signified by the term metal being nothing but what he before comprehended and signified by the name lead indeed to a man that knows the signification of the word metal and not of the word lead it is a shorter way to explain the signification of the word lead by saying it is a metal which at once expresses several of its simple ideas than to enumerate them one by one telling him it is a body very heavy fusible and malleable     as part of the definition of the term defined  alike trifling it is to predicate any other part of the definition of the term defined or to affirm anyone of the simple ideas of a complex one of the name of the whole complex idea as all gold is fusible for fusibility being one of the simple ideas that goes to the making up the complex one the sound gold stands for what can it be but playing with sounds to affirm that of the name gold which is comprehended in its received signification it would be thought little better than ridiculous to affirm gravely as a truth of moment that gold is yellow and i see not how it is any jot more material to say it is fusible unless that quality be left out of the complex idea of which the sound gold is the mark in ordinary speech what instruction can it carry with it to tell one that which he hath been told already or he is supposed to know before for i am supposed to know the signification of the word another uses to me or else he is to tell me and if i know that the name gold stands for this complex idea of body yellow heavy fusible malleable it will not much instruct me to put it solemnly afterwards in a proposition and gravely say all gold is fusible such propositions can only serve to show the disingenuity of one who will go from the definition of his own terms by reminding him sometimes of it but carry no knowledge with them but of the signification of words however certain they be     instance man and palfrey  every man is an animal or living body is as certain a proposition as can be but no more conducing to the knowledge of things than to say a palfrey is an ambling horse or a neighing ambling animal both being only about the signification of words and make me know but thisthat body sense and motion or power of sensation and moving are three of those ideas that i always comprehend and signify by the word man and where they are not to be found together the name man belongs not to that thing and so of the otherthat body sense and a certain way of going with a certain kind of voice are some of those ideas which i always comprehend and signify by the word palfrey and when they are not to be found together the name palfrey belongs not to that thing it is just the same and to the same purpose when any term standing for any one or more of the simple ideas that altogether make up that complex idea which is called man is affirmed of the term manvg suppose a roman signified by the word homo all these distinct ideas united in one subject corporietas sensibilitas potentia se movendi rationalitas risibilitas he might no doubt with great certainty universally affirm one more or all of these together of the word homo but did no more than say that the word homo in his country comprehended in its signification all these ideas much like a romance knight who by the word palfrey signified these ideasbody of a certain figure fourlegged with sense motion ambling neighing white used to have a woman on his backmight with the same certainty universally affirm also any or all of these of the word palfrey but did thereby teach no more but that the word palfrey in his or romance language stood for all these and was not to be applied to anything where any of these was wanting but he that shall tell me that in whatever thing sense motion reason and laughter were united that thing had actually a notion of god or would be cast into a sleep by opium made indeed an instructive proposition because neither having the notion of god nor being cast into sleep by opium being contained in the idea signified by the word man we are by such propositions taught something more than barely what the word man stands for and therefore the knowledge contained in it is more than verbal     for this teaches but the signification of words  before a man makes any proposition he is supposed to understand the terms he uses in it or else he talks like a parrot only making a noise by imitation and framing certain sounds which he has learnt of others but not as a rational creature using them for signs of ideas which he has in his mind the hearer also is supposed to understand the terms as the speaker uses them or else he talks jargon and makes an unintelligible noise and therefore he trifles with words who makes such a proposition which when it is made contains no more than one of the terms does and which a man was supposed to know before vg a triangle hath three sides or saffron is yellow and this is no further tolerable than where a man goes to explain his terms to one who is supposed or declares himself not to understand him and then it teaches only the signification of that word and the use of that sign     but adds no real knowledge  we can know then the truth of two sorts of propositions with perfect certainty the one is of those trifling propositions which have a certainty in them but it is only a verbal certainty but not instructive and secondly we can know the truth and so may be certain in propositions which affirm something of another which is a necessary consequence of its precise complex idea but not contained in it as that the external angle of all triangles is bigger than either of the opposite internal angles which relation of the outward angle to either of the opposite internal angles making no part of the complex idea signified by the name triangle this is a real truth and conveys with it instructive real knowledge     general propositions concerning substances are often trifling  we having little or no knowledge of what combinations there be of simple ideas existing together in substances but by our senses we cannot make any universal certain propositions concerning them any further than our nominal essences lead us which being to a very few and inconsiderable truths in respect of those which depend on their real constitutions the general propositions that are made about substances if they are certain are for the most part but trifling and if they are instructive are uncertain and such as we can have no knowledge of their real truth how much soever constant observation and analogy may assist our judgment in guessing hence it comes to pass that one may often meet with very clear and coherent discourses that amount yet to nothing for it is plain that names of substantial beings as well as others as far as they have relative significations affixed to them may with great truth be joined negatively and affirmatively in propositions as their relative definitions make them fit to be so joined and propositions consisting of such terms may with the same clearness be deduced one from another as those that convey the most real truths and all this without any knowledge of the nature or reality of things existing without us by this method one may make demonstrations and undoubted propositions in words and yet thereby advance not one jot in the knowledge of the truth of things v g he that having learnt these following words with their ordinary mutual relative acceptations annexed to them v g substance man animal form soul vegetative sensitive rational may make several undoubted propositions about the soul without knowing at all what the soul really is and of this sort a man may find an infinite number of propositions reasonings and conclusions in books of metaphysics schooldivinity and some sort of natural philosophy and after all know as little of god spirits or bodies as he did before he set out    0 and why  he that hath liberty to define ie to determine the signification of his names of substances as certainly every one does in effect who makes them stand for his own ideas and makes their significations at a venture taking them from his own or other mens fancies and not from an examination or inquiry into the nature of things themselves may with little trouble demonstrate them one of another according to those several respects and mutual relations he has given them one to another wherein however things agree or disagree in their own nature he needs mind nothing but his own notions with the names he hath bestowed upon them but thereby no more increases his own knowledge than he does his riches who taking a bag of counters calls one in a certain place a pound another in another place a shilling and a third in a third place a penny and so proceeding may undoubtedly reckon right and cast up a great sum according to his counters so placed and standing for more or less as he pleases without being one jot the richer or without even knowing how much a pound shilling or penny is but only that one is contained in the other twenty times and contains the other twelve which a man may also do in the signification of words by making them in respect of one another more or less or equally comprehensive      thirdly using words variously is trifling with them  though yet concerning most words used in discourses equally argumentative and controversial there is this more to be complained of which is the worst sort of trifling and which sets us yet further from the certainty of knowledge we hope to attain by them or find in them viz that most writers are so far from instructing us in the nature and knowledge of things that they use their words loosely and uncertainly and do not by using them constantly and steadily in the same significations make plain and clear deductions of words one from another and make their discourses coherent and clear how little soever they were instructive which were not difficult to do did they not find it convenient to shelter their ignorance or obstinacy under the obscurity and perplexedness of their terms to which perhaps inadvertency and ill custom do in many men much contribute      marks of verbal propositions first predication in abstract  to conclude barely verbal propositions may be known by these following marks  first all propositions wherein two abstract terms are affirmed one of another are barely about the signification of sounds for since no abstract idea can be the same with any other but itself when its abstract name is affirmed of any other term it can signify no more but this that it may or ought to be called by that name or that these two names signify the same idea thus should any one say that parsimony is frugality that gratitude is justice that this or that action is or is not temperate however specious these and the like propositions may at first sight seem yet when we come to press them and examine nicely what they contain we shall find that it all amounts to nothing but the signification of those terms      secondly a part of the definition predicated of any term  secondly all propositions wherein a part of the complex idea which any term stands for is predicated of that term are only verbal vg to say that gold is a metal or heavy and thus all propositions wherein more comprehensive words called genera are affirmed of subordinate or less comprehensive called species or individuals are barely verbal  when by these two rules we have examined the propositions that make up the discourses we ordinarily meet with both in and out of books we shall perhaps find that a greater part of them than is usually suspected are purely about the signification of words and contain nothing in them but the use and application of these signs  this i think i may lay down for an infallible rule that wherever the distinct idea any word stands for is not known and considered and something not contained in the idea is not affirmed or denied of it there our thoughts stick wholly in sounds and are able to attain no real truth or falsehood this perhaps if well heeded might save us a great deal of useless amusement and dispute and very much shorten our trouble and wandering in the search of real and true knowledge     chapter ix of our threefold knowledge of existence     general propositions that are certain concern not existence  hitherto we have only considered the essences of things which being only abstract ideas and thereby removed in our thoughts from particular existence that being the proper operation of the mind in abstraction to consider an idea under no other existence but what it has in the understandings gives us no knowledge of real existence at all where by the way we may take notice that universal propositions of whose truth or falsehood we can have certain knowledge concern not existence and further that all particular affirmations or negations that would not be certain if they were made general are only concerning existence they declaring only the accidental union or separation of ideas in things existing which in their abstract natures have no known necessary union or repugnancy     a threefold knowledge of existence  but leaving the nature of propositions and different ways of predication to be considered more at large in another place let us proceed now to inquire concerning our knowledge of the existance of things and how we come by it i say then that we have the knowledge of our own existence by intuition of the existence of god by demonstration and of other things by sensation     our knowledge of our own existence is intuitive  as for our own existence we perceive it so plainly and so certainly that it neither needs nor is capable of any proof for nothing can be more evident to us than our own existence i think i reason i feel pleasure and pain can any of these be more evident to me than my own existence if i doubt of all other things that very doubt makes me perceive my own existence and will not suffer me to doubt of that for if i know i feel pain it is evident i have as certain perception of my own existence as of the existence of the pain i feel or if i know i doubt i have as certain perception of the existence of the thing doubting as of that thought which i call doubt experience then convinces us that we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence and an internal infallible perception that we are in every act of sensation reasoning or thinking we are conscious to ourselves of our own being and in this matter come not short of the highest degree of certainty     chapter x of our knowledge of the existence of a god     we are capable of knowing certainly that there is a god  though god has given us no innate ideas of himself though he has stamped no original characters on our minds wherein we may read his being yet having furnished us with those faculties our minds are endowed with he hath not left himself without witness since we have sense perception and reason and cannot want a clear proof of him as long as we carry ourselves about us nor can we justly complain of our ignorance in this great point since he has so plentifully provided us with the means to discover and know him so far as is necessary to the end of our being and the great concernment of our happiness but though this be the most obvious truth that reason discovers and though its evidence be if i mistake not equal to mathematical certainty yet it requires thought and attention and the mind must apply itself to a regular deduction of it from some part of our intuitive knowledge or else we shall be as uncertain and ignorant of this as of other propositions which are in themselves capable of clear demonstration to show therefore that we are capable of knowing ie being certain that there is a god and how we may come by this certainty i think we need go no further than ourselves and that undoubted knowledge we have of our own existence     for man knows that he himself exists  i think it is beyond question that man has a clear idea of his own being he knows certainly he exists and that he is something he that can doubt whether he be anything or no i speak not to no more than i would argue with pure nothing or endeavour to convince nonentity that it were something if any one pretends to be so sceptical as to deny his own existence for really to doubt of it is manifestly impossible let him for me enjoy his beloved happiness of being nothing until hunger or some other pain convince him of the contrary this then i think i may take for a truth which every ones certain knowledge assures him of beyond the liberty of doubting viz that he is something that actually exists     he knows also that nothing cannot produce a being therefore something must have existed from eternity  in the next place man knows by an intuitive certainty that bare nothing can no more produce any real being than it can be equal to two right angles if a man knows not that nonentity or the absence of all being cannot be equal to two right angles it is impossible he should know any demonstration in euclid if therefore we know there is some real being and that nonentity cannot produce any real being it is an evident demonstration that from eternity there has been something since what was not from eternity had a beginning and what had a beginning must be produced by something else     and that eternal being must be most powerful  next it is evident that what had its being and beginning from another must also have all that which is in and belongs to its being from another too all the powers it has must be owing to and received from the same source this eternal source then of all being must also be the source and original of all power and so this eternal being must be also the most powerful     and most knowing  again a man finds in himself perception and knowledge we have then got one step further and we are certain now that there is not only some being but some knowing intelligent being in the world there was a time then when there was no knowing being and when knowledge began to be or else there has been also a knowing being from eternity if it be said there was a time when no being had any knowledge when that eternal being was void of all understanding i reply that then it was impossible there should ever have been any knowledge it being as impossible that things wholly void of knowledge and operating blindly and without any perception should produce a knowing being as it is impossible that a triangle should make itself three angles bigger than two right ones for it is as repugnant to the idea of senseless matter that it should put into itself sense perception and knowledge as it is repugnant to the idea of a triangle that it should put into itself greater angles than two right ones     and therefore god  thus from the consideration of ourselves and what we infallibly find in our own constitutions our reason leads us to the knowledge of this certain and evident truththat there is an eternal most powerful and most knowing being which whether any one will please to call god it matters not the thing is evident and from this idea duly considered will easily be deduced all those other attributes which we ought to ascribe to this eternal being if nevertheless any one should be found so senselessly arrogant as to suppose man alone knowing and wise but yet the product of mere ignorance and chance and that all the rest of the universe acted only by that blind haphazard i shall leave with him that very rational and emphatical rebuke of tully   ii de leg to be considered at his leisure what can be more sillily arrogant and misbecoming than for a man to think that he has a mind and understanding in him but yet in all the universe beside there is no such thing or that those things which with the utmost stretch of his reason he can scarce comprehend should be moved and managed without any reason at all quid est enim verius quam neminem esse oportere tam stulte arogantem ut in se mentem et rationem putet inesse in coelo mundoque non putet aut ea quoe viz summa ingenii ratione comprehendat nulla ratione moveri putet  from what has been said it is plain to me we have a more certain knowledge of the existence of a god than of anything our senses have not immediately discovered to us nay i presume i may say that we more certainly know that there is a god than that there is anything else without us when i say we know i mean there is such a knowledge within our reach which we cannot miss if we will but apply our minds to that as we do to several other inquiries     our idea of a most perfect being not the sole proof of a god  how far the idea of a most perfect being which a man may frame in his mind does or does not prove the existence of a god i will not here examine for in the different make of mens tempers and application of their thoughts some arguments prevail more on one and some on another for the confirmation of the same truth but yet i think this i may say that it is an ill way of establishing this truth and silencing atheists to lay the whole stress of so important a point as this upon that sole foundation and take some mens having that idea of god in their minds for it is evident some men have none and some worse than none and the most very different for the only proof of a deity and out of an over fondness of that darling invention cashier or at least endeavour to invalidate all other arguments and forbid us to hearken to those proofs as being weak or fallacious which our own existence and the sensible parts of the universe offer so clearly and cogently to our thoughts that i deem it impossible for a considering man to withstand them for i judge it as certain and clear a truth as can anywhere be delivered that the invisible things of god are clearly seen from the creation of the world being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead though our own being furnishes us as i have shown with an evident and incontestible proof of a deity and i believe nobody can avoid the cogency of it who will but as carefully attend to it as to any other demonstration of so many parts yet this being so fundamental a truth and of that consequence that all religion and genuine morality depend thereon i doubt not but i shall be forgiven by my reader if i go over some parts of this argument again and enlarge a little more upon them     recapitulation something from eternity  there is no truth more evident than that something must be from eternity i never yet heard of any one so unreasonable or that could suppose so manifest a contradiction as a time wherein there was perfectly nothing this being of all absurdities the greatest to imagine that pure nothing the perfect negation and absence of all beings should ever produce any real existence  it being then unavoidable for all rational creatures to conclude that something has existed from eternity let us next see what kind of thing that must be     two sorts of beings cogitative and incogitative  there are but two sorts of beings in the world that man knows or conceives  first such as are purely material without sense perception or thought as the clippings of our beards and parings of our nails  secondly sensible thinking perceiving beings such as we find ourselves to be which if you please we will hereafter call cogitative and incogitative beings which to our present purpose if for nothing else are perhaps better terms than material and immaterial    0 incogitative being cannot produce a cogitative being  if then there must be something eternal let us see what sort of being it must be and to that it is very obvious to reason that it must necessarily be a cogitative being for it is as impossible to conceive that ever bare incogitative matter should produce a thinking intelligent being as that nothing should of itself produce matter let us suppose any parcel of matter eternal great or small we shall find it in itself able to produce nothing for example let us suppose the matter of the next pebble we meet with eternal closely united and the parts firmly at rest together if there were no other being in the world must it not eternally remain so a dead inactive lump is it possible to conceive it can add motion to itself being purely matter or produce anything matter then by its own strength cannot produce in itself so much as motion the motion it has must also be from eternity or else be produced and added to matter by some other being more powerful than matter matter as is evident having not power to produce motion in itself but let us suppose motion eternal too yet matter incogitative matter and motion whatever changes it might produce of figure and bulk could never produce thought knowledge will still be as far beyond the power of motion and matter to produce as matter is beyond the power of nothing or nonentity to produce and i appeal to every ones own thoughts whether he cannot as easily conceive matter produced by nothing as thought to be produced by pure matter when before there was no such thing as thought or an intelligent being existing divide matter into as many parts as you will which we are apt to imagine a sort of spiritualizing or making a thinking thing of it vary the figure and motion of it as much as you pleasea globe cube cone prism cylinder c whose diameters are but  00000th part of a gry will operate no otherwise upon other bodies of proportionable bulk than those of an inch or foot diameter and you may as rationally expect to produce sense thought and knowledge by putting together in a certain figure and motion gross particles of matter as by those that are the very minutest that do anywhere exist they knock impel and resist one another just as the greater do and that is all they can do so that if we will suppose nothing first or eternal matter can never begin to be if we suppose bare matter without motion eternal motion can never begin to be if we suppose only matter and motion first or eternal thought can never begin to be for it is impossible to conceive that matter either with or without motion could have originally in and from itself sense perception and knowledge as is evident from hence that then sense perception and knowledge must be a property eternally inseparable from matter and every particle of it not to add that though our general or specific conception of matter makes us speak of it as one thing yet really all matter is not one individual thing neither is there any such thing existing as one material being or one single body that we know or can conceive and therefore if matter were the eternal first cogitative being there would not be one eternal infinite cogitative being but an infinite number of eternal finite cogitative beings independent one of another of limited force and distinct thoughts which could never produce that order harmony and beauty which are to be found in nature since therefore whatsoever is the first eternal being must necessarily be cogitative and whatsoever is first of all things must necessarily contain in it and actually have at least all the perfections that can ever after exist nor can it ever give to another any perfection that it hath not either actually in itself or at least in a higher degree it necessarily follows that the first eternal being cannot be matter      therefore there has been an eternal wisdom  if therefore it be evident that something necessarily must exist from eternity it is also as evident that that something must necessarily be a cogitative being for it is as impossible that incogitative matter should produce a cogitative being as that nothing or the negation of all being should produce a positive being or matter      the attributes of the eternal cogitative being  though this discovery of the necessary existance of a eternal mind does sufficiently lead us into the knowledge of god since it will hence follow that all other knowing beings that have a beginning must depend on him and have in other ways of knowledge or extent of power than what he gives them and therefore if he made those he made all the less excellent pieces of this universeall inanimate beings whereby his omniscience power and providence will be established and all his other attributes necessarily follow yet to clear up this a little further we will see what doubt can be raised against it      whether the eternal mind may be also material or no  first perhaps it will be said that though it be as clear as demonstration can make it that there must be an eternal being and that being must also be knowing yet it does not follow but that thinking being may also be material let it be so it equally still follows that there is a god for there be an eternal omniscient omnipotent being it is certain that there is a god whether you imagine that being to be material or no but herein i suppose lies the danger and deceit of that suppositionthere being no way to avoid the demonstration that there is an eternal knowing being men devoted to matter would willingly have it granted that that knowing being is material and then letting slide out of their minds or the discourse the demonstration whereby an eternal knowing being was proved necessarily to exist would argue all to be matter and so deny a god that is an eternal cogitative being whereby they are so far from establishing that they destroy their own hypothesis for if there can be in their opinion eternal matter without any eternal cogitative being they manifestly separate matter and thinking and suppose no necessary connexion of the one with the other and so establish the necessity of an eternal spirit but not of matter since it has been proved already that an eternal cogitative being is unavoidably to be granted now if thinking and matter may be separated the eternal existence of matter will not follow from the eternal existence of a cogitative being and they suppose it to no purpose      not material first because each particle of matter is not cogitative  but now let us see how they can satisfy themselves or others that this eternal thinking being is material  i i would ask them whether they imagine that all matter every particle of matter thinks this i suppose they will scarce say since then there would be as many eternal thinking beings as there are particles of matter and so an infinity of gods and yet if they will not allow matter as matter that is every particle of matter to be as well cogitative as extended they will have as hard a task to make out to their own reasons a cogitative being out of incogitative particles as an extended being out of unextended parts if i may so speak      ii secondly because one particle alone of matter cannot be cogitative  if all matter does not think i next ask whether it be only one atom that does so this has as many absurdities as the other for then this atom of matter must be alone eternal or not if this alone be eternal then this alone by its powerful thought or will made all the rest of matter and so we have the creation of matter by a powerful thought which is that the materialists stick at for if they suppose one single thinking atom to have produced all the rest of matter they cannot ascribe that preeminency to it upon any other account than that of its thinking the only supposed difference but allow it to be by some other way which is above our conception it must still be creation and these men must give up their great maxim ex nihilo nil fit if it be said that all the rest of matter is equally eternal as that thinking atom it will be to say anything at pleasure though ever so absurd for to suppose all matter eternal and yet one small particle in knowledge and power infinitely above all the rest is without any the least appearance of reason to frame an hypothesis every particle of matter as matter is capable of all the same figures and motions of any other and i challenge any one in his thoughts to add anything else to one above another      iii thirdly because a system of incogitative matter cannot be cogitative  if then neither one peculiar atom alone can be this eternal thinking being nor all matter as matter i e every particle of matter can be it it only remains that it is some certain system of matter duly put together that is this thinking eternal being this is that which i imagine is that notion which men are aptest to have of god who would have him a material being as most readily suggested to them by the ordinary conceit they have of themselves and other men which they take to be material thinking beings but this imagination however more natural is no less absurd than the other for to suppose the eternal thinking being to be nothing else but a composition of particles of matter each whereof is incogitative is to ascribe all the wisdom and knowledge of that eternal being only to the juxtaposition of parts than which nothing can be more absurd for unthinking particles of matter however put together can have nothing thereby added to them but a new relation of position which it is impossible should give thought and knowledge to them      and whether this corporeal system is in motion or at rest  but further this corporeal system either has all its parts at rest or it is a certain motion of the parts wherein its thinking consists if it be perfectly at rest it is but one lump and so can have no privileges above one atom  if it be the motion of its parts on which its thinking depends all the thoughts there must be unavoidably accidental and limited since all the particles that by motion cause thought being each of them in itself without any thought cannot regulate its own motions much less be regulated by the thought of the whole since that thought is not the cause of motion for then it must be antecedent to it and so without it but the consequence of it whereby freedom power choice and all rational and wise thinking or acting will be quite taken away so that such a thinking being will be no better nor wiser than pure blind matter since to resolve all into the accidental unguided motions of blind matter or into thought depending on unguided motions of blind matter is the same thing not to mention the narrowness of such thoughts and knowledge that must depend on the motion of such parts but there needs no enumeration of any more absurdities and impossibilities in this hypothesis however full of them it be than that before mentioned since let this thinking system be all or a part of the matter of the universe it is impossible that any one particle should either know its own or the motion of any other particle or the whole know the motion of every particle and so regulate its own thoughts or motions or indeed have any thought resulting from such motion      matter not coeternal with an eternal mind  secondly others would have matter to be eternal notwithstanding that they allow an eternal cogitative immaterial being this though it take not away the being of a god yet since it denies one and the first great piece of his workmanship the creation let us consider it a little matter must be allowed eternal why because you cannot conceive how it can be made out of nothing why do you not also think yourself eternal you will answer perhaps because about twenty or forty years since you began to be but if i ask you what that you is which began then to be you can scarce tell me the matter whereof you are made began not then to be for if it did then it is not eternal but it began to be put together in such a fashion and frame as makes up your body but yet that frame of particles is not you it makes not that thinking thing you are for i have now to do with one who allows an eternal immaterial thinking being but would have unthinking matter eternal too therefore when did that thinking thing begin to be if it did never begin to be then have you always been a thinking thing from eternity the absurdity whereof i need not confute till i meet with one who is so void of understanding as to own it if therefore you can allow a thinking thing to be made out of nothing as all things that are not eternal must be why also can you not allow it possible for a material being to be made out of nothing by an equal power but that you have the experience of the one in view and not of the other though when well considered creation of a spirit will be found to require no less power than the creation of matter nay possibly if we would emancipate ourselves from vulgar notions and raise our thoughts as far as they would reach to a closer contemplation of things we might be able to aim at some dim and seeming conception how matter might at first be made and begin to exist by the power of that eternal first being but to give beginning and being to a spirit would be found a more inconceivable effect of omnipotent power but this being what would perhaps lead us too far from the notions on which the philosophy now in the world is built it would not be pardonable to deviate so far from them or to inquire so far as grammar itself would authorize if the common settled opinion opposes it especially in this place where the received doctrine serves well enough to our present purpose and leaves this past doubt that the creation or beginning of any one substance out of nothing being once admitted the creation of all other but the creator himself may with the same ease be supposed      objection creation out of nothing  but you will say is it not impossible to admit of the making anything out of nothing since we cannot possibly conceive it i answer no because it is not reasonable to deny the power of an infinite being because we cannot comprehend its operations we do not deny other effects upon this ground because we cannot possibly conceive the manner of their production we cannot conceive how anything but impulse of body can move body and yet that is not a reason sufficient to make us deny it possible against the constant experience we have of it in ourselves in all our voluntary motions which are produced in us only by the free action or thought of our own minds and are not nor can be the effects of the impulse or determination of the motion of blind matter in or upon our own bodies for then it could not be in our power or choice to alter it for example my right hand writes whilst my left hand is still what causes rest in one and motion in the other nothing but my willa thought of my mind my thought only changing the right hand rests and the left hand moves this is matter of fact which cannot be denied explain this and make it intelligible and then the next step will be to understand creation for the giving a new determination to the motion of the animal spirits which some make use of to explain voluntary motion clears not the difficulty one jot to alter the determination of motion being in this case no easier nor less than to give motion itself since the new determination given to the animal spirits must be either immediately by thought or by some other body put in their way by thought which was not in their way before and so must owe its motion to thought either of which leaves voluntary motion as unintelligible as it was before in the meantime it is an overvaluing ourselves to reduce all to the narrow measure of our capacities and to conclude all things impossible to be done whose manner of doing exceeds our comprehension this is to make our comprehension infinite or god finite when what he can do is limited to what we can conceive of it if you do not understand the operations of your own finite mind that thinking thing within you do not deem it strange that you cannot comprehend the operations of that eternal infinite mind who made and governs all things and whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain     chapter xi  of our knowledge of the existence of other things     knowledge of the existence of other finite beings is to be had only by actual sensation  the knowledge of our own being we have by intuition the existence of a god reason clearly makes known to us as has been shown  the knowledge of the existence of any other thing we can have only by sensation for there being no necessary connexion of real existence with any idea a man hath in his memory nor of any other existence but that of god with the existence of any particular man no particular man can know the existence of any other being but only when by actual operating upon him it makes itself perceived by him for the having the idea of anything in our mind no more proves the existence of that thing than the picture of a man evidences his being in the world or the visions of a dream make thereby a true history     instance whiteness of this paper  it is therefore the actual receiving of ideas from without that gives us notice of the existence of other things and makes us know that something doth exist at that time without us which causes that idea in us though perhaps we neither know nor consider how it does it for it takes not from the certainty of our senses and the ideas we receive by them that we know not the manner wherein they are produced vg whilst i write this i have by the paper affecting my eyes that idea produced in my mind which whatever object causes i call white by which i know that that quality or accident ie whose appearance before my eyes always causes that idea doth really exist and hath a being without me and of this the greatest assurance i can possibly have and to which my faculties can attain is the testimony of my eyes which are the proper and sole judges of this thing whose testimony i have reason to rely on as so certain that i can no more doubt whilst i write this that i see white and black and that something really exists that causes that sensation in me than that i write or move my hand which is a certainty as great as human nature is capable of concerning the existence of anything but a mans self alone and of god     this notice by our senses though not so certain as demonstration yet may be called knowledge and proves the existence of things without us  the notice we have by our senses of the existing of things without us though it be not altogether so certain as our intuitive knowledge or the deductions of our reason employed about the clear abstract ideas of our own minds yet it is an assurance that deserves the name of knowledge if we persuade ourselves that our faculties act and inform us right concerning the existence of those objects that affect them it cannot pass for an illgrounded confidence for i think nobody can in earnest be so sceptical as to be uncertain of the existence of those things which he sees and feels at least he that can doubt so far whatever he may have with his own thoughts will never have any controversy with me since he can never be sure i say anything contrary to his own opinion as to myself i think god has given me assurance enough of the existence of things without me since by their different application i can produce in myself both pleasure and pain which is one great concernment of my present state this is certain the confidence that our faculties do not herein deceive us is the greatest assurance we are capable of concerning the existence of material beings for we cannot act anything but by our faculties nor talk of knowledge itself but by the help of those faculties which are fitted to apprehend even what knowledge is  but besides the assurance we have from our senses themselves that they do not err in the information they give us of the existence of things without us when they are affected by them we are further confirmed in this assurance by other concurrent reasons     i confirmed by concurrent reasonsfirst because we cannot have ideas of sensation but by the inlet of the senses  it is plain those perceptions are produced in us by exterior causes affecting our senses because those that want the organs of any sense never can have the ideas belonging to that sense produced in their minds this is too evident to be doubted and therefore we cannot but be assured that they come in by the organs of that sense and no other way the organs themselves it is plain do not produce them for then the eyes of a man in the dark would produce colours and his nose smell roses in the winter but we see nobody gets the relish of a pineapple till he goes to the indies where it is and tastes it     ii secondly because we find that an idea from actual sensation and another from memory are very distinct perceptions  because sometimes i find that i cannot avoid the having those ideas produced in my mind for though when my eyes are shut or windows fast i can at pleasure recal to my mind the ideas of light or the sun which former sensations had lodged in my memory so i can at pleasure lay by that idea and take into my view that of the smell of a rose or taste of sugar but if i turn my eyes at noon towards the sun i cannot avoid the ideas which the light or sun then produces in me so that there is a manifest difference between the ideas laid up in my memory over which if they were there only i should have constantly the same power to dispose of them and lay them by at pleasure and those which force themselves upon me and i cannot avoid having and therefore it must needs be some exterior cause and the brisk acting of some objects without me whose efficacy i cannot resist that produces those ideas in my mind whether i will or no besides there is nobody who doth not perceive the difference in himself between contemplating the sun as he hath the idea of it in his memory and actually looking upon it of which two his perception is so distinct that few of his ideas are more distinguishable one from another and therefore he hath certain knowledge that they are not both memory or the actions of his mind and fancies only within him but that actual seeing hath a cause without     iii thirdly because pleasure or pain which accompanies actual sensation accompanies not the returning of those ideas without the external objects  add to this that many of those ideas are produced in us with pain which afterwards we remember without the least offence thus the pain of heat or cold when the idea of it is revived in our minds gives us no disturbance which when felt was very troublesome and is again when actually repeated which is occasioned by the disorder the external object causes in our bodies when applied to them and we remember the pains of hunger thirst or the headache without any pain at all which would either never disturb us or else constantly do it as often as we thought of it were there nothing more but ideas floating in our minds and appearances entertaining our fancies without the real existence of things affecting us from abroad the same may be said of pleasure accompanying several actual sensations and though mathematical demonstration depends not upon sense yet the examining them by diagrams gives great credit to the evidence of our sight and seems to give it a certainty approaching to that of demonstration itself for it would be very strange that a man should allow it for an undeniable truth that two angles of a figure which he measures by lines and angles of a diagram should be bigger one than the other and yet doubt of the existence of those lines and angles which by looking on he makes use of to measure that by     iv fourthly because our senses assist one anothers testimony of the existence of outward things and enable us to predict  our senses in many cases bear witness to the truth of each others report concerning the existence of sensible things without us he that sees a fire may if he doubt whether it be anything more than a bare fancy feel it too and be convinced by putting his hand in it which certainly could never be put into such exquisite pain by a bare idea or phantom unless that the pain be a fancy too which yet he cannot when the burn is well by raising the idea of it bring upon himself again  thus i see whilst i write this i can change the appearance of the paper and by designing the letters tell beforehand what new idea it shall exhibit the very next moment by barely drawing my pen over it which will neither appear let me fancy as much as i will if my hands stand still or though i move my pen if my eyes be shut nor when those characters are once made on the paper can i choose afterwards but see them as they are that is have the ideas of such letters as i have made whence it is manifest that they are not barely the sport and play of my own imagination when i find that the characters that were made at the pleasure of my own thoughts do not obey them nor yet cease to be whenever i shall fancy it but continue to affect my senses constantly and regularly according to the figures i made them to which if we will add that the sight of those shall from another man draw such sounds as i beforehand design they shall stand for there will be little reason left to doubt that those words i write do really exist without me when they cause a long series of regular sounds to affect my ears which could not be the effect of my imagination nor could my memory retain them in that order     this certainty is as great as our condition needs  but yet if after all this any one will be so sceptical as to distrust his senses and to affirm that all we see and hear feel and taste think and do during our whole being is but the series and deluding appearances of a long dream whereof there is no reality and therefore will question the existence of all things or our knowledge of anything i must desire him to consider that if all be a dream then he doth but dream that he makes the question and so it is not much matter that a waking man should answer him but yet if he pleases he may dream that i make him this answer that the certainty of things existing in rerum natura when we have the testimony of our senses for it is not only as great as our frame can attain to but as our condition needs for our faculties being suited not to the full extent of being nor to a perfect clear comprehensive knowledge of things free from all doubt and scruple but to the preservation of us in whom they are and accommodated to the use of life they serve to our purpose well enough if they will but give us certain notice of those things which are convenient or inconvenient to us for he that sees a candle burning and hath experimented the force of its flame by putting his finger in it will little doubt that this is something existing without him which does him harm and puts him to great pain which is assurance enough when no man requires greater certainty to govern his actions by than what is as certain as his actions themselves and if our dreamer pleases to try whether the glowing heat of a glass furnace be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy mans fancy by putting his hand into it he may perhaps be wakened into a certainty greater than he could wish that it is something more than bare imagination so that this evidence is as great as we can desire being as certain to us as our pleasure or pain ie happiness or misery beyond which we have no concernment either of knowing or being such an assurance of the existence of things without us is sufficient to direct us in the attaining the good and avoiding the evil which is caused by them which is the important concernment we have of being made acquainted with them     but reaches no further than actual sensation  in fine then when our senses do actually convey into our understandings any idea we cannot but be satisfied that there doth something at that time really exist without us which doth affect our senses and by them give notice of itself to our apprehensive faculties and actually produce that idea which we then perceive and we cannot so far distrust their testimony as to doubt that such collections of simple ideas as we have observed by our senses to be united together do really exist together but this knowledge extends as far as the present testimony of our senses employed about particular objects that do then affect them and no further for if i saw such a collection of simple ideas as is wont to be called man existing together one minute since and am now alone i cannot be certain that the same man exists now since there is no necessary connexion of his existence a minute since with his existence now by a thousand ways he may cease to be since i had the testimony of my senses for his existence and if i cannot be certain that the man i saw last today is now in being i can less be certain that he is so who hath been longer removed from my senses and i have not seen since yesterday or since the last year and much less can i be certain of the existence of men that i never saw and therefore though it be highly probable that millions of men do now exist yet whilst i am alone writing this i have not that certainty of it which we strictly call knowledge though the great likelihood of it puts me past doubt and it be reasonable for me to do several things upon the confidence that there are men and men also of my acquaintance with whom i have to do now in the world but this is but probability not knowledge    0 folly to expect demonstration in everything  whereby yet we may observe how foolish and vain a thing it is for a man of a narrow knowledge who having reason given him to judge of the different evidence and probability of things and to be swayed accordingly how vain i say it is to expect demonstration and certainty in things not capable of it and refuse assent to very rational propositions and act contrary to very plain and clear truths because they cannot be made out so evident as to surmount every the least i will not say reason but pretence of doubting he that in the ordinary affairs of life would admit of nothing but direct plain demonstration would be sure of nothing in this world but of perishing quickly the wholesomeness of his meat or drink would not give him reason to venture on it and i would fain know what it is he could do upon such grounds as are capable of no doubt no objection      past existence of other things is known by memory  as when our senses are actually employed about any object we do know that it does exist so by our memory we may be assured that heretofore things that affected our senses have existed and thus we have knowledge of the past existence of several things whereof our senses having informed us our memories still retain the ideas and of this we are past all doubt so long as we remember well but this knowledge also reaches no further than our senses have formerly assured us thus seeing water at this instant it is an unquestionable truth to me that water doth exist and remembering that i saw it yesterday it will also be always true and as long as my memory retains it always an undoubted proposition to me that water did exist the  0th of july      as it will also be equally true that a certain number of very fine colours did exist which at the same time i saw upon a bubble of that water but being now quite out of sight both of the water and bubbles too it is no more certainly known to me that the water doth now exist than that the bubbles or colours therein do so it being no more necessary that water should exist today because it existed yesterday than that the colours or bubbles exist today because they existed yesterday though it be exceedingly much more probable because water hath been observed to continue long in existence but bubbles and the colours on them quickly cease to be      the existence of other finite spirits not knowable and rests on faith  what ideas we have of spirits and how we come by them i have already shown but though we have those ideas in our minds and know we have them there the having the ideas of spirits does not make us know that any such things do exist without us or that there are any finite spirits or any other spiritual beings but the eternal god we have ground from revelation and several other reasons to believe with assurance that there are such creatures but our senses not being able to discover them we want the means of knowing their particular existences for we can no more know that there are finite spirits really existing by the idea we have of such beings in our minds than by the ideas any one has of fairies or centaurs he can come to know that things answering those ideas do really exist  and therefore concerning the existence of finite spirits as well as several other things we must content ourselves with the evidence of faith but universal certain propositions concerning this matter are beyond our reach for however true it may be vg that all the intelligent spirits that god ever created do still exist yet it can never make a part of our certain knowledge these and the like propositions we may assent to as highly probable but are not i fear in this state capable of knowing we are not then to put others upon demonstrating nor ourselves upon search of universal certainty in all those matters wherein we are not capable of any other knowledge but what our senses give us in this or that particular      only particular propositions concerning concrete existances are knowable  by which it appears that there are two sorts of propositions  there is one sort of propositions concerning the existence of anything answerable to such an idea as having the idea of an elephant phoenix motion or an angel in my mind the first and natural inquiry is whether such a thing does anywhere exist and this knowledge is only of particulars no existence of anything without us but only of god can certainly be known further than our senses inform us   there is another sort of propositions wherein is expressed the agreement or disagreement of our abstract ideas and their dependence on one another such propositions may be universal and certain so having the idea of god and myself of fear and obedience i cannot but be sure that god is to be feared and obeyed by me and this proposition will be certain concerning man in general if i have made an abstract idea of such a species whereof i am one particular but yet this proposition how certain soever that men ought to fear and obey god proves not to me the existence of men in the world but will be true of all such creatures whenever they do exist which certainty of such general propositions depends on the agreement or disagreement to be discovered in those abstract ideas      and all general propositions that are known to be true concern abstract ideas  in the former case our knowledge is the consequence of the existence of things producing ideas in our minds by our senses in the latter knowledge is the consequence of the ideas be they what they will that are in our minds producing there general certain propositions many of these are called aeternae veritates and all of them indeed are so not from being written all or any of them in the minds of all men or that they were any of them propositions in any ones mind till he having got the abstract ideas joined or separated them by affirmation or negation but wheresoever we can suppose such a creature as man is endowed with such faculties and thereby furnished with such ideas as we have we must conclude he must needs when he applies his thoughts to the consideration of his ideas know the truth of certain propositions that will arise from the agreement or disagreement which he will perceive in his own ideas such propositions are therefore called eternal truths not because they are eternal propositions actually formed and antecedent to the understanding that at any time makes them nor because they are imprinted on the mind from any patterns that are anywhere out of the mind and existed before but because being once made about abstract ideas so as to be true they will whenever they can be supposed to be made again at any time past or come by a mind having those ideas always actually be true for names being supposed to stand perpetually for the same ideas and the same ideas having immutably the same habitudes one to another propositions concerning any abstract ideas that are once true must needs be eternal verities     chapter xii of the improvement of our knowledge     knowledge is not got from maxims  it having been the common received opinion amongst men of letters that maxims were the foundation of all knowledge and that the sciences were each of them built upon certain praecognita from whence the understanding was to take its rise and by which it was to conduct itself in its inquiries into the matters belonging to that science the beaten road of the schools has been to lay down in the beginning one or more general propositions as foundations whereon to build the knowledge that was to be had of that subject these doctrines thus laid down for foundations of any science were called principles as the beginnings from which we must set out and look no further backwards in our inquiries as we have already observed     the occasion of that opinion  one thing which might probably give an occasion to this way of proceeding in other sciences was as i suppose the good success it seemed to have in mathematics wherein men being observed to attain a great certainty of knowledge these sciences came by preeminence to be called word in greek and word in greek learning or things learned thoroughly learned as having of all others the greatest certainty clearness and evidence in them     but from comparing clear and distinct ideas  but if any one will consider he will i guess find that the great advancement and certainty of real knowledge which men arrived to in these sciences was not owing to the influence of these principles nor derived from any peculiar advantage they received from two or three general maxims laid down in the beginning but from the clear distinct complete ideas their thoughts were employed about and the relation of equality and excess so clear between some of them that they had an intuitive knowledge and by that a way to discover it in others and this without the help of those maxims for i ask is it not possible for a young lad to know that his whole body is bigger than his little finger but by virtue of this axiom that the whole is bigger than a part nor be assured of it till he has learned that maxim or cannot a country wench know that having received a shilling from one that owes her three and a shilling also from another that owes her three the remaining debts in each of their hands are equal cannot she know this i say unless she fetch the certainty of it from this maxim that if you take equals from equals the remainder will be equals a maxim which possibly she never heard or thought of i desire any one to consider from what has been elsewhere said which is known first and clearest by most people the particular instance or the general rule and which it is that gives life and birth to the other these general rules are but the comparing our more general and abstract ideas which are the workmanship of the mind made and names given to them for the easier dispatch in its reasonings and drawing into comprehensive terms and short rules its various and multiplied observations but knowledge began in the mind and was founded on particulars though afterwards perhaps no notice was taken thereof it being natural for the mind forward still to enlarge its knowledge most attentively to lay up those general notions and make the proper use of them which is to disburden the memory of the cumbersome load of particulars for i desire it may be considered what more certainty there is to a child or any one that his body little finger and all is bigger than his little finger alone after you have given to his body the name whole and to his little finger the name part than he could have had before or what new knowledge concerning his body can these two relative terms give him which he could not have without them could he not know that his body was bigger than his little finger if his language were yet so imperfect that he had no such relative terms as whole and part i ask further when he has got these names how is he more certain that his body is a whole and his little finger a part than he was or might be certain before he learnt those terms that his body was bigger than his little finger any one may as reasonably doubt or deny that his little finger is a part of his body as that it is less than his body and he that can doubt whether it be less will as certainly doubt whether it be a part so that the maxim the whole is bigger than a part can never be made use of to prove the little finger less than the body but when it is useless by being brought to convince one of a truth which he knows already for he that does not certainly know that any parcel of matter with another parcel of matter joined to it is bigger than either of them alone will never be able to know it by the help of these two relative terms whole and part make of them what maxim you please     dangerous to build upon precarious principles  but be it in the mathematics as it will whether it be clearer that taking an inch from a black line of two inches and an inch from a red line of two inches the remaining parts of the two lines will be equal or that if you take equals from equals the remainder will be equals which i say of these two is the clearer and first known i leave to any one to determine it not being material to my present occasion that which i have here to do is to inquire whether if it be the readiest way to knowledge to begin with general maxims and build upon them it be yet a safe way to take the principles which are laid down in any other science as unquestionable truths and so receive them without examination and adhere to them without suffering them to be doubted of because mathematicians have been so happy or so fair to use none but selfevident and undeniable if this be so i know not what may not pass for truth in morality what may not be introduced and proved in natural philosophy  let that principle of some of the old philosophers that all is matter and that there is nothing else be received for certain and indubitable and it will be easy to be seen by the writings of some that have revived it again in our days what consequences it will lead us into let any one with polemo take the world or with the stoics the aether or the sun or with anaximenes the air to be god and what a divinity religion and worship must we needs have nothing can be so dangerous as principles thus taken up without questioning or examination especially if they be such as concern morality which influence mens lives and give a bias to all their actions who might not justly expect another kind of life in aristippus who placed happiness in bodily pleasure and in antisthenes who made virtue sufficient to felicity and he who with plato shall place beatitude in the knowledge of god will have his thoughts raised to other contemplations than those who look not beyond this spot of earth and those perishing things which are to be had in it he that with archelaus shall lay it down as a principle that right and wrong honest and dishonest are defined only by laws and not by nature will have other measures of moral rectitude and gravity than those who take it for granted that we are under obligations antecedent to all human constitutions     to do so is no certain way to truth  if therefore those that pass for principles are not certain which we must have some way to know that we may be able to distinguish them from those that are doubtful but are only made so to us by our blind assent we are liable to be misled by them and instead of being guided into truth we shall by principles be only confirmed in mistake and error     but to compare clear complete ideas under steady names  but since the knowledge of the certainty of principles as well as of all other truths depends only upon the perception we have of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas the way to improve our knowledge is not i am sure blindly and with an implicit faith to receive and swallow principles but is i think to get and fix in our minds clear distinct and complete ideas as far as they are to be had and annex to them proper and constant names and thus perhaps without any other principles but barely considering those perfect ideas and by comparing them one with another finding their agreement and disagreement and their several relations and habitudes we shall get more true and clear knowledge by the conduct of this one rule than by taking up principles and thereby putting our minds into the disposal of others     the true method of advancing knowledge is by considering our abstract ideas  we must therefore if we will proceed as reason advises adapt our methods of inquiry to the nature of the ideas we examine and the truth we search after general and certain truths are only founded in the habitudes and relations of abstract ideas a sagacious and methodical application of our thoughts for the finding out these relations is the only way to discover all that can be put with truth and certainty concerning them into general propositions by what steps we are to proceed in these is to be learned in the schools of the mathematicians who from very plain and easy beginnings by gentle degrees and a continued chain of reasonings proceed to the discovery and demonstration of truths that appear at first sight beyond human capacity the art of finding proofs and the admirable methods they have invented for the singling out and laying in order those intermediate ideas that demonstratively show the equality or inequality of unapplicable quantities is that which has carried them so far and produced such wonderful and unexpected discoveries but whether something like this in respect of other ideas as well as those of magnitude may not in time be found out i will not determine this i think i may say that if other ideas that are the real as well as nominal essences of their species were pursued in the way familiar to mathematicians they would carry our thoughts further and with greater evidence and clearness than possibly we are apt to imagine     by which morality also may be made clearer  this gave me the confidence to advance that conjecture which i suggest chap iii viz that morality is capable of demonstration as well as mathematics for the ideas that ethics are conversant about being all real essences and such as i imagine have a discoverable connexion and agreement one with another so far as we can find their habitudes and relations so far we shall be possessed of certain real and general truths and i doubt not but if a right method were taken a great part of morality might be made out with that clearness that could leave to a considering man no more reason to doubt than he could have to doubt of the truth of propositions in mathematics which have been demonstrated to him     our knowledge of substances is to be improved not by contemplation of abstract ideas but only by experience  in our search after the knowledge of substances our want of ideas that are suitable to such a way of proceeding obliges us to a quite different method we advance not here as in the other where our abstract ideas are real as well as nominal essences by contemplating our ideas and considering their relations and correspondences that helps us very little for the reasons that in another place we have at large set down by which i think it is evident that substances afford matter of very little general knowledge and the bare contemplation of their abstract ideas will carry us but a very little way in the search of truth and certainty what then are we to do for the improvement of our knowledge in substantial beings here we are to take a quite contrary course the want of ideas of their real essences sends us from our own thoughts to the things themselves as they exist experience here must teach me what reason cannot and it is by trying alone that i can certainly know what other qualities coexist with those of my complex idea vg whether that yellow heavy fusible body i call gold be malleable or no which experience which way ever it prove in that particular body i examine makes me not certain that it is so in all or any other yellow heavy fusible bodies but that which i have tried because it is no consequence one way or the other from my complex idea the necessity or inconsistence of malleability hath no visible connexion with the combination of that colour weight and fusibility in any body what i have said here of the nominal essence of gold supposed to consist of a body of such a determinate colour weight and fusibility will hold true if malleableness fixedness and solubility in aqua regia be added to it our reasonings from these ideas will carry us but a little way in the certain discovery of the other properties in those masses of matter wherein all these are to be found because the other properties of such bodies depending not on these but on that unknown real essence on which these also depend we cannot by them discover the rest we can go no further than the simple ideas of our nominal essence will carry us which is very little beyond themselves and so afford us but very sparingly any certain universal and useful truths for upon trial having found that particular piece and all others of that colour weight and fusibility that i ever tried malleable that also makes now perhaps a part of my complex idea part of my nominal essence of gold whereby though i make my complex idea to which i affix the name gold to consist of more simple ideas than before yet still it not containing the real essence of any species of bodies it helps me not certainly to know i say to know perhaps it may be to conjecture the other remaining properties of that body further than they have a visible connexion with some or all of the simple ideas that make up my nominal essence for example i cannot be certain from this complex idea whether gold be fixed or no because as before there is no necessary connexion or inconsistence to be discovered betwixt a complex idea of a body yellow heavy fusible malleable betwixt these i say and fixedness so that i may certainly know that in whatsoever body these are found there fixedness is sure to be here again for assurance i must apply myself to experience as far as that reaches i may have certain knowledge but no further    0 experience may procure is convenience not science  i deny not but a man accustomed to rational and regular experiments shall be able to see further into the nature of bodies and guess righter at their yet unknown properties than one that is a stranger to them but yet as i have said this is but judgment and opinion not knowledge and certainty this way of getting and improving our knowledge in substances only by experience and history which is all that the weakness of our faculties in this state of mediocrity which we are in this world can attain to makes me suspect that natural philosophy is not capable is being made a science we are able i imagine to reach very little general knowledge concerning the species of bodies and their several properties experiments and historical observations we may have from which we may draw advantages of ease and health and thereby increase our stock of conveniences for this life but beyond this i fear our talents reach not nor are our faculties as i guess able to advance      we are fitted for moral science but only for probable interpretations of external nature  from whence is it obvious to conclude that since our faculties are not fitted to penetrate into the internal fabric and real essences of bodies but yet plainly discover to us the being of a god and the knowledge of ourselves enough to lead us into a full and clear discovery of our duty and great concernment it will become us as rational creatures to employ those faculties we have about what they are most adapted to and follow the direction of nature where it seems to point us out the way for it is rational to conclude that our proper employment lies in those inquiries and in that sort of knowledge which is most suited to our natural capacities and carries in it our greatest interest ie the condition of our eternal estate hence i think i may conclude that morality is the proper science and business of mankind in general who are both concerned and fitted to search out their summum bonum as several arts conversant about several parts of nature are the lot and private talent of particular men for the common use of human life and their own particular subsistence in this world of what consequence the discovery of one natural body and its properties may be to human life the whole great continent of america is a convincing instance whose ignorance in useful arts and want of the greatest part of the conveniences of life in a country that abounded with all sorts of natural plenty i think may be attributed to their ignorance of what was to be found in a very ordinary despicable stone i mean the mineral of iron and whatever we think of our parts or improvements in this part of the world where knowledge and plenty seem to vie with each other yet to any one that will seriously reflect on it i suppose it will appear past doubt that were the use of iron lost among us we should in a few ages be unavoidably reduced to the wants and ignorance of the ancient savage americans whose natural endowments and provisions come no way short of those of the most flourishing and polite nations so that he who first made known the use of that contemptible mineral may be truly styled the father of arts and author of plenty      in the study of nature we must beware of hypotheses and wrong principles  i would not therefore be thought to disesteem or dissuade the study of nature i readily agree the contemplation of his works gives us occasion to admire revere and glorify their author and if rightly directed may be of greater benefit to mankind than the monuments of exemplary charity that have at so great charge been raised by the founders of hospitals and almshouses he that first invented printing discovered the use of the compass or made public the virtue and right use of kin kina did more for the propagation of knowledge for the supply and increase of useful commodities and saved more from the grave than those who built colleges workhouses and hospitals all that i would say is that we should not be too forwardly possessed with the opinion or expectation of knowledge where it is not to be had or by ways that will not attain to it that we should not take doubtful systems for complete sciences nor unintelligible notions for scientifical demonstrations in the knowledge of bodies we must be content to glean what we can from particular experiments since we cannot from a discovery of their real essences grasp at a time whole sheaves and in bundles comprehend the nature and properties of whole species together where our inquiry is concerning coexistence or repugnancy to coexist which by contemplation of our ideas we cannot discover there experience observation and natural history must give us by our senses and by retail an insight into corporeal substances the knowledge of bodies we must get by our senses warily employed in taking notice of their qualities and operations on one another and what we hope to know of separate spirits in this world we must i think expect only from revelation he that shall consider how little general maxims precarious principles and hypotheses laid down at pleasure have promoted true knowledge or helped to satisfy the inquiries of rational men after real improvements how little i say the setting out at that end has for many ages together advanced mens progress towards the knowledge of natural philosophy will think we have reason to thank those who in this latter age have taken another course and have trod out to us though not an easier way to learned ignorance yet a surer way to profitable knowledge      the true use of hypotheses  not that we may not to explain any phenomena of nature make use of any probable hypothesis whatsoever hypotheses if they are well made are at least great helps to the memory and often direct us to new discoveries but my meaning is that we should not take up any one too hastily which the mind that would always penetrate into the causes of things and have principles to rest on is very apt to do till we have very well examined particulars and made several experiments in that thing which we would explain by our hypothesis and see whether it will agree to them all whether our principles will carry us quite through and not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature as they seem to accommodate and explain another and at least that we take care that the name of principles deceive us not nor impose on us by making us receive that for an unquestionable truth which is really at best but a very doubtful conjecture such as are most i had almost said all of the hypotheses in natural philosophy      clear and distinct ideas with settled names and the finding of those intermediate ideas which show their agreement or disagreement are the ways to enlarge our knowledge  but whether natural philosophy be capable of certainty or no the ways to enlarge our knowledge as far as we are capable seems to me in short to be these two  first the first is to get and settle in our minds determined ideas of those things whereof we have general or specific names at least so many of them as we would consider and improve our knowledge in or reason about and if they be specific ideas of substances we should endeavour also to make them as complete as we can whereby i mean that we should put together as many simple ideas as being constantly observed to coexist may perfectly determine the species and each of those simple ideas which are the ingredients of our complex ones should be clear and distinct in our minds for it being evident that our knowledge cannot exceed our ideas as far as they are either imperfect confused or obscure we cannot expect to have certain perfect or clear knowledge secondly the other is the art of finding out those intermediate ideas which may show us the agreement or repugnancy of other ideas which cannot be immediately compared      mathematics an instance of this  that these two and not the relying on maxims and drawing consequences from some general propositions are the right methods of improving our knowledge in the ideas of other modes besides those of quantity the consideration of mathematical knowledge will easily inform us where first we shall find that he that has not a perfect and clear idea of those angles or figures of which he desires to know anything is utterly thereby incapable of any knowledge about them suppose but a man not to have a perfect exact idea of a right angle a scalenum or trapezium and there is nothing more certain than that he will in vain seek any demonstration about them further it is evident that it was not the influence of those maxims which are taken for principles in mathematics that hath led the masters of that science into those wonderful discoveries they have made let a man of good parts know all the maxims generally made use of in mathematics ever so perfectly and contemplate their extent and consequences as much as he pleases he will by their assistance i suppose scarce ever come to know that the square of the hypothenuse in a rightangled triangle is equal to the squares of the two other sides the knowledge that the whole is equal to all its parts and if you take equals from equals the remainder will be equal c helped him not i presume to this demonstration and a man may i think pore long enough on those axioms without ever seeing one jot the more of mathematical truths they have been discovered by the thoughts otherwise applied the mind had other objects other views before it far different from those maxims when it first got the knowledge of such truths in mathematics which men well enough acquainted with those received axioms but ignorant of their method who first made these demonstrations can never sufficiently admire and who knows what methods to enlarge our knowledge in other parts of science may hereafter be invented answering that of algebra in mathematics which so readily finds out the ideas of quantities to measure others by whose equality or proportion we could otherwise very hardly or perhaps never come to know     chapter xiii  some further considerations concerning our knowledge     our knowledge partly necessary partly voluntary  our knowledge as in other things so in this has so great a conformity with our sight that it is neither wholly necessary nor wholly voluntary if our knowledge were altogether necessary all mens knowledge would not only be alike but every man would know all that is knowable and if it were wholly voluntary some men so little regard or value it that they would have extreme little or none at all men that have senses cannot choose but receive some ideas by them and if they have memory they cannot but retain some of them and if they have any distinguishing faculty cannot but perceive the agreement or disagreement of some of them one with another as he that has eyes if he will open them by day cannot but see some objects and perceive a difference in them but though a man with his eyes open in the light cannot but see yet there be certain objects which he may choose whether he will turn his eyes to there may be in his reach a book containing pictures and discourses capable to delight or instruct him which yet he may never have the will to open never take the pains to look into     the application of our faculties voluntary but they being employed we know as things are not as we please  there is also another thing in a mans power and that is though he turns his eyes sometimes towards an object yet he may choose whether he will curiously survey it and with an intent application endeavour to observe accurately all that is visible in it but yet what he does see he cannot see otherwise than he does it depends not on his will to see that black which appears yellow nor to persuade himself that what actually scalds him feels cold the earth will not appear painted with flowers nor the fields covered with verdure whenever he has a mind to it in the cold winter he cannot help seeing it white and hoary if he will look abroad just thus is it with our understanding all that is voluntary in our knowledge is the employing or withholding any of our faculties from this or that sort of objects and a more or less accurate survey of them but they being employed our will hath no power to determine the knowledge of the mind one way or another that is done only by the objects themselves as far as they are clearly discovered and therefore as far as mens senses are conversant about external objects the mind cannot but receive those ideas which are presented by them and be informed of the existence of things without and so far as mens thoughts converse with their own determined ideas they cannot but in some measure observe the agreement or disagreement that is to be found amongst some of them which is so far knowledge and if they have names for those ideas which they have thus considered they must needs be assured of the truth of those propositions which express that agreement or disagreement they perceive in them and be undoubtedly convinced of those truths for what a man sees he cannot but see and what he perceives he cannot but know that he perceives     instance in numbers  thus he that has got the ideas of numbers and hath taken the pains to compare one two and three to six cannot choose but know that they are equal he that hath got the idea of a triangle and found the ways to measure its angles and their magnitudes is certain that its three angles are equal to two right ones and can as little doubt of that as of this truth that it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be     instance in natural religion  he also that hath the idea of an intelligent but frail and weak being made by and depending on another who is eternal omnipotent perfectly wise and good will as certainly know that man is to honour fear and obey god as that the sun shines when he sees it for if he hath but the ideas of two such beings in his mind and will turn his thoughts that way and consider them he will as certainly find that the inferior finite and dependent is under an obligation to obey the supreme and infinite as he is certain to find that three four and seven are less than fifteen if he will consider and compute those numbers nor can he be surer in a clear morning that the sun is risen if he will but open his eyes and turn them that way but yet these truths being ever so certain ever so clear he may be ignorant of either or all of them who will never take the pains to employ his faculties as he should to inform himself about them     chapter xiv of judgment     our knowledge being short we want something else  the understanding faculties being given to man not barely for speculation but also for the conduct of his life man would be at a great loss if he had nothing to direct him but what has the certainty of true knowledge for that being very short and scanty as we have seen he would be often utterly in the dark and in most of the actions of his life perfectly at a stand had he nothing to guide him in the absence of clear and certain knowledge he that will not eat till he has demonstration that it will nourish him he that will not stir till he infallibly knows the business he goes about will succeed will have little else to do but to sit still and perish     what use to be made of this twilight state  therefore as god has set some things in broad daylight as he has given us some certain knowledge though limited to a few things in comparison probably as a taste of what intellectual creatures are capable of to excite in us a desire and endeavour after a better state so in the greatest part of our concernments he has afforded us only the twilight as i may so say of probability suitable i presume to that state of mediocrity and probationership he has been pleased to place us in here wherein to check our overconfidence and presumption we might by every days experience be made sensible of our shortsightedness and liableness to error the sense whereof might be a constant admonition to us to spend the days of this our pilgrimage with industry and care in the search and following of that way which might lead us to a state of greater perfection it being highly rational to think even were revelation silent in the case that as men employ those talents god has given them here they shall accordingly receive their rewards at the close of the day when their sun shall set and night shall put an end to their labours     judgement or assent to probability supplies our want of knowledge  the faculty which god has given man to supply the want of clear and certain knowledge in cases where that cannot be had is judgement whereby the mind takes its ideas to agree or disagree or which is the same any proposition to be true or false without perceiving a demonstrative evidence in the proofs the mind sometimes exercises this judgment out of necessity where demonstrative proofs and certain knowledge are not to be had and sometimes out of laziness unskilfulness or haste even where demonstrative and certain proofs are to be had men often stay not warily to examine the agreement or disagreement of two ideas which they are desirous or concerned to know but either incapable of such attention as is requisite in a long train of gradations or impatient of delay lightly cast their eyes on or wholly pass by the proofs and so without making out the demonstration determine of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas as it were by a view of them as they are at a distance and take it to be the one or the other as seems most likely to them upon such a loose survey this faculty of the mind when it is exercised immediately about things is called judgement when about truths delivered in words is most commonly called assent or dissent which being the most usual way wherein the mind has occasion to employ this faculty i shall under these terms treat of it as feast liable in our language to equivocation     judgement is the presuming things to be so without perceiving it  thus the mind has two faculties conversant about truth and falsehood  first knowledge whereby it certainly perceives and is undoubtedly satisfied of the agreement or disagreement of any ideas  secondly judgement which is the putting ideas together or separating them from one another in the mind when their certain agreement or disagreement is not perceived but presumed to be so which is as the word imports taken to be so before it certainly appears and if it so unites or separates them as in reality things are it is right judgement     chapter xv of probability     probability is the appearance of agreement upon fallible proofs  as demonstration is the showing the agreement or disagreement of two ideas by the intervention of one or more proofs which have a constant immutable and visible connexion one with another so probability is nothing but the appearance of such an agreement or disagreement by the intervention of proofs whose connexion is not constant and immutable or at least is not perceived to be so but is or appears for the most part to be so and is enough to induce the mind to judge the proposition to be true or false rather than the contrary for example in the demonstration of it a man perceives the certain immutable connexion there is of equality between the three angles of a triangle and those intermediate ones which are made use of to show their equality to two right ones and so by an intuitive knowledge of the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate ideas in each step of the progress the whole series is continued with an evidence which clearly shows the agreement or disagreement of those three angles in equality to two right ones and thus he has certain knowledge that it is so but another man who never took the pains to observe the demonstration hearing a mathematician a man of credit affirm the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right ones assents to it ie receives it for true in which case the foundation of his assent is the probability of the thing the proof being such as for the most part carries truth with it the man on whose testimony he receives it not being wont to affirm anything contrary to or besides his knowledge especially in matters of this kind so that that which causes his assent to this proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones that which makes him take these ideas to agree without knowings them to do so is the wonted veracity of the speaker in other cases or his supposed veracity in this     it is to supply our want of knowledge  our knowledge as has been shown being very narrow and we not happy enough to find certain truth in everything which we have occasion to consider most of the propositions we think reason discoursenay act upon are such as we cannot have undoubted knowledge of their truth yet some of them border so near upon certainty that we make no act according to the assent as resolutely as if they were infallibly demonstrated and that our knowledge of them was perfect and certain but there being degrees herein from the very neighbourhood of certainty and demonstration quite down to improbability and unlikeness even to the confines of impossibility and also degrees of assent from full assurance and confidence quite down to conjecture doubt and distrust i shall come now having as i think found out the bounds of human knowledge and certainty in the next place to consider the several degrees and grounds of probability and assent or faith     being that which makes us presume things to be true before we know them to be so  probability is likeliness to be true the very notation of the word signifying such a proposition for which there be arguments or proofs to make it pass or be received for true the entertainment the mind gives this sort of propositions is called belief assent or opinion which is the admitting or receiving any proposition for true upon arguments or proofs that are found to persuade us to receive it as true without certain knowledge that it is so and herein lies the difference between probability and certainty faith and knowledge that in all the parts of knowledge there is intuition each immediate idea each step has its visible and certain connexion in belief not so that which makes me believe is something extraneous to the thing i believe something not evidently joined on both sides to and so not manifestly showing the agreement or disagreement of those ideas that are under consideration     the grounds of probability are two conformity with our own experience or the testimony of others  probability then being to supply the defect of our knowledge and to guide us where that fails is always conversant about propositions whereof we have no certainty but only some inducements to receive them for true the grounds of it are in short these two following  first the conformity of anything with our own knowledge observation and experience  secondly the testimony of others vouching their observation and experience in the testimony of others is to be considered   the number   the integrity   the skill of the witnesses   the design of the author where it is a testimony out of a book cited   the consistency of the parts and circumstances of the relation   contrary testimonies     in this all the arguments pro and con ought to be examined before we come to a judgment  probability wanting that intuitive evidence which infallibly determines the understanding and produces certain knowledge the mind if it will proceed rationally ought to examine all the grounds of probability and see how they make more or less for or against any proposition before it assents to or dissents from it and upon a due balancing the whole reject or receive it with a more or less firm assent proportionably to the preponderancy of the greater grounds of probability on one side or the other for example  if i myself see a man walk on the ice it is past probability it is knowledge but if another tells me he saw a man in england in the midst of a sharp winter walk upon water hardened with cold this has so great conformity with what is usually observed to happen that i am disposed by the natures of the thing itself to assent to it unless some manifest suspicion attend the relation of that matter of fact but if the same thing be told to one born between the tropics who never saw nor heard of any such thing before there the whole probability relies on testimony and as the relators are more in number and of more credit and have no interest to speak contrary to the truth so that matter of fact is like to find more or less belief though to a man whose experience has always been quite contrary and who has never heard of anything like it the most untainted credit of a witness will scarce be able to find belief as it happened to a dutch ambassador who entertaining the king of siam with the particularities of holland which he was inquisitive after amongst other things told him that the water in his country would sometimes in cold weather be so hard that men walked upon it and that it would bear an elephant if he were there to which the king replied hitherto i have believed the strange things you have told me because i look upon you as a sober fair man but now i am sure you lie     probable arguments capable of great variety  upon these grounds depends the probability of any proposition and as the conformity of our knowledge as the certainty of observations as the frequency and constancy of experience and the number and credibility of testimonies do more or less agree or disagree with it so is any proposition in itself more or less probable there is another i confess which though by itself it be no true ground of probability yet is often made use of for one by which men most commonly regulate their assent and upon which they pin their faith more than anything else and that is the opinion of others though there cannot be a more dangerous thing to rely on nor more likely to mislead one since there is much more falsehood and error among men than truth and knowledge and if the opinions and persuasions of others whom we know and think well of be a ground of assent men have reason to be heathens in japan mahometans in turkey papists in spain protestants in england and lutherans in sweden but of this wrong ground of assent i shall have occasion to speak more at large in another place     chapter xvi of the degrees of assent     our assent ought to be regulated by the grounds of probability  the grounds of probability we have laid down in the foregoing chapter as they are the foundations on which our assent is built so are they also the measure whereby its several degrees are or ought to be regulated only we are to take notice that whatever grounds of probability there may be they yet operate no further on the mind which searches after truth and endeavours to judge right than they appear at least in the first judgment or search that the mind makes i confess in the opinions men have and firmly stick to in the world their assent is not always from an actual view of the reasons that at first prevailed with them it being in many cases almost impossible and in most very hard even for those who have very admirable memories to retain all the proofs which upon a due examination made them embrace that side of the question it suffices that they have once with care and fairness sifted the matter as far as they could and that they have searched into all the particulars that they could imagine to give any light to the question and with the best of their skill cast up the account upon the whole evidence and thus having once found on which side the probability appeared to them after as full and exact an inquiry as they can make they lay up the conclusion in their memories as a truth they have discovered and for the future they remain satisfied with the testimony of their memories that this is the opinion that by the proofs they have once seen of it deserves such a degree of their assent as they afford it     these can not always be actually in view and then we must content ourselves with the remembrance that we once saw ground for such a degree of assent  this is all that the greatest part of men are capable of doing in regulating their opinions and judgments unless a man will exact of them either to retain distinctly in their memories all the proofs concerning any probable truth and that too in the same order and regular deduction of consequences in which they have formerly placed or seen them which sometimes is enough to fill a large volume on one single question or else they must require a man for every opinion that he embraces every day to examine the proofs both which are impossible it is unavoidable therefore that the memory be relied on in the case and that men be persuaded of several opinions whereof the proofs are not actually in their thoughts nay which perhaps they are not able actually to recall without this the greatest part of men must be either very sceptics or change every moment and yield themselves up to whoever having lately studied the question offers them arguments which for want of memory they are not able presently to answer     the ill consequence of this if our former judgments were not rightly made  i cannot but own that mens sticking to their past judgment and adhering firmly to conclusions formerly made is often the cause of great obstinacy in error and mistake but the fault is not that they rely on their memories for what they have before well judged but because they judged before they had well examined may we not find a great number not to say the greatest part of men that think they have formed right judgments of several matters and that for no other reason but because they never thought otherwise that themselves to have judged right only because they never questioned never examined their own opinions which is indeed to think they judged right because they never judged at all and yet these of all men hold their opinions with the greatest stiffness those being generally the most fierce and firm in their tenets who have least examined them what we once know we are certain is so and we may be secure that there are no latent proofs undiscovered which may overturn our knowledge or bring it in doubt but in matters of probability it is not in every case we can be sure that we have all the particulars before us that any way concern the question and that there is no evidence behind and yet unseen which may cast the probability on the other side and outweigh all that at present seems to preponderate with us who almost is there that hath the leisure patience and means to collect together all the proofs concerning most of the opinions he has so as safely to conclude that he hath a clear and full view and that there is no more to be alleged for his better information and yet we are forced to determine ourselves on the one side or other the conduct of our lives and the management of our great concerns will not bear delay for those depend for the most part on the determination of our judgment in points wherein we are not capable of certain and demonstrative knowledge and wherein it is necessary for us to embrace the one side or the other     the right use of it mutual charity and forbearance in a necessary diversity of opinions  since therefore it is unavoidable to the greatest part of men if not all to have several opinions without certain and indubitable proofs of their truth and it carries too great an imputation of ignorance lightness or folly for men to quit and renounce their former tenets presently upon the offer of an argument which they cannot immediately answer and show the insufficiency of it would methinks become all men to maintain peace and the common offices of humanity and friendship in the diversity of opinions since we cannot reasonably expect that any one should readily and obsequiously quit his own opinion and embrace ours with a blind resignation to an authority which the understanding of man acknowledges not for however it may often mistake it can own no other guide but reason nor blindly submit to the will and dictates of another if he you would bring over to your sentiments be one that examines before he assents you must give him leave at his leisure to go over the account again and recalling what is out of his mind examine all the particulars to see on which side the advantage lies and if he will not think our arguments of weight enough to engage him anew in so much pains it is but what we often do ourselves in the like case and we should take it amiss if others should prescribe to us what points we should study and if he be one who takes his opinions upon trust how can we imagine that he should renounce those tenets which time and custom have so settled in his mind that he thinks them selfevident and of an unquestionably certainty or which he takes to be impressions he has received from god himself or from men sent by him how can we expect i say that opinions thus settled should be given up to the arguments or authority of a stranger or adversary especially if there be any suspicion of interest or design as there never fails to be where men find themselves illtrusted we should do well to commiserate our mutual ignorance and endeavour to remove it in all the gentle and fair ways of information and not instantly treat others ill as obstinate and perverse because they will not renounce their own and receive our opinions or at least those we would force upon them when it is more than probable that we are no less obstinate in not embracing some of theirs for where is the man that has incontestable evidence of the truth of all that he holds or of the falsehood of all he condemns or can say that he has examined to the bottom all his own or other mens opinions the necessity of believing without knowledge nay often upon very slight grounds in this fleeting state of action and blindness we are in should make us more busy and careful to inform ourselves than constrain others at least those who have not thoroughly examined to the bottom all their own tenets must confess they are unfit to prescribe to others and are unreasonable in imposing that as truth on other mens belief which they themselves have not searched into nor weighed the arguments of probability on which they should receive or reject it those who have fairly and truly examined and are thereby got past doubt in all the doctrines they profess and govern themselves by would have a juster pretence to require others to follow them but these are so few in number and find so little reason to be magisterial in their opinions that nothing insolent and imperious is to be expected from them and there is reason to think that if men were better instructed themselves they would be less imposing on others     probability is either of sensible matter of fact capable of human testimony or of what is beyond the evidence of our senses  but to return to the grounds of assent and the several degrees of it we are to take notice that the propositions we receive upon inducements of probability are of two sorts either concerning some particular existance or as it is usually termed matter of fact which falling under observation is capable of human testimony or else concerning things which being beyond the discovery of our senses are not capable of any such testimony     concerning the first of these viz particular matter of fact  i the concurrent experience of all other men with ours produces assurance approaching to knowledge  where any particular thing consonant to the constant observation of ourselves and others in the like case comes attested by the concurrent reports of all that mention it we receive it as easily and build as firmly upon it as if it were certain knowledge and we reason and act thereupon with as little doubt as if it were perfect demonstration thus if all englishmen who have occasion to mention it should affirm that it froze in england the last winter or that there were swallows seen there in the summer i think a man could almost as little doubt of it as that seven and four are eleven the first therefore and highest degree of probability is when the general consent of all men in all ages as far as it can be known concurs with a mans constant and neverfailing experience in like cases to confirm the truth of any particular matter of fact attested by fair witnesses such are all the stated constitutions and properties of bodies and the regular proceedings of causes and effects in the ordinary course of nature this we call an argument from the nature of things themselves for what our own and other mens constant observation has found always to be after the same manner that we with reason conclude to be the effect of steady and regular causes though they come not within the reach of our knowledge thus that fire warmed a man made lead fluid and changed the colour or consistency in wood or charcoal that iron sunk in water and swam in quicksilver these and the like propositions about particular facts being agreeable to our constant experience as often as we have to do with these matters and being generally spoke of when mentioned by others as things found constantly to be so and therefore not so much as controverted by anybodywe are put past doubt that a relation affirming any such thing to have been or any predication that it will happen again in the same manner is very true these probabilities rise so near to certainty that they govern our thoughts as absolutely and influence all our actions as fully as the most evident demonstration and in what concerns us we make little or no difference between them and certain knowledge our belief thus grounded rises to assurance     ii unquestionable testimony and our own experience that a thing is for the most part so produce confidence  the next degree of probability is when i find by my own experience and the agreement of all others that mention it a thing to be for the most part so and that the particular instance of it is attested by many and undoubted witnesses vg history giving us such an account of men in all ages and my own experience as far as i had an opportunity to observe confirming it that most men prefer their private advantage to the public if all historians that write of tiberius say that tiberius did so it is extremely probable and in this case our assent has a sufficient foundation to raise itself to a degree which we may call confidence     iii fair testimony and the nature of the thing indifferent produce unavoidable assent  in things that happen indifferently as that a bird should fly this or that way that it should thunder on a mans right or left hand c when any particular matter of fact is vouched by the concurrent testimony of unsuspected witnesses there our assent is also unavoidable thus that there is such a city in italy as rome that about one thousand seven hundred years ago there lived in it a man called julius caesar that he was a general and that he won a battle against another called pompey this though in the nature of the thing there be nothing for nor against it yet being related by historians of credit and contradicted by no one writer a man cannot avoid believing it and can as little doubt of it as he does of the being and actions of his own acquaintance whereof he himself is a witness     experience and testimonies clashing infinitely vary the degrees of probability  thus far the matter goes easy enough probability upon such grounds carries so much evidence with it that it naturally determines the judgment and leaves us as little liberty to believe or disbelieve as a demonstration does whether we will know or be ignorant the difficulty is when testimonies contradict common experience and the reports of history and witnesses clash with the ordinary course of nature or with one another there it is where diligence attention and exactness are required to form a right judgment and to proportion the assent to the different evidence and probability of the thing which rises and falls according as those two foundations of credibility viz common observation in like cases and particular testimonies in that particular instance favour or contradict it these are liable to so great variety of contrary observations circumstances reports different qualifications tempers designs oversights c of the reporters that it is impossible to reduce to precise rules the various degrees wherein men give their assent this only may be said in general that as the arguments and proofs pro and con upon due examination nicely weighing every particular circumstance shall to any one appear upon the whole matter in a greater or less degree to preponderate on either side so they are fitted to produce in the mind such different entertainments as we call belief conjecture guess doubt wavering distrust disbelief c    0 traditional testimonies the further removed the less their proof becomes  this is what concerns assent in matters wherein testimony is made use of concerning which i think it may not be amiss to take notice of a rule observed in the law of england which is that though the attested copy of a record be good proof yet the copy of a copy ever so well attested and by ever so credible witnesses will not be admitted as a proof in judicature this is so generally approved as reasonable and suited to the wisdom and caution to be used in our inquiry after material truths that i never yet heard of any one that blamed it this practice if it be allowable in the decisions of right and wrong carries this observation along with it viz that any testimony the further off it is from the original truth the less force and proof it has the being and existence of the thing itself is what i call the original truth a credible man vouching his knowledge of it is a good proof but if another equally credible do witness it from his report the testimony is weaker and a third that attests the hearsay of an hearsay is yet less considerable so that in traditional truths each remove weakens the force of the proof and the more hands the tradition has successively passed through the less strength and evidence does it receive from them this i thought necessary to be taken notice of because i find amongst some men the quite contrary commonly practised who look on opinions to gain force by growing older and what a thousand years since would not to a rational man contemporary with the first voucher have appeared at all probable is now urged as certain beyond all question only because several have since from him said it one after another upon this ground propositions evidently false or doubtful enough in their first beginning come by an inverted rule of probability to pass for authentic truths and those which found or deserved little credit from the mouths of their first authors are thought to grow venerable by age are urged as undeniable      yet history is of great use  i would not be thought here to lessen the credit and use of history it is all the light we have in many cases and we receive from it a great part of the useful truths we have with a convincing evidence i think nothing more valuable than the records of antiquity i wish we had more of them and more uncorrupted but this truth itself forces me to say that no probability can rise higher than its first original what has no other evidence than the single testimony of one only witness must stand or fall by his only testimony whether good bad or indifferent and though cited afterwards by hundreds of others one after another is so far from receiving any strength thereby that it is only the weaker passion interest inadvertency mistake of his meaning and a thousand odd reasons or capricios mens minds are acted by impossible to be discovered may make one man quote another mans words or meaning wrong he that has but ever so little examined the citations of writers cannot doubt how little credit the quotations deserve where the originals are wanting and consequently how much less quotations of quotations can be relied on this is certain that what in one age was affirmed upon slight grounds can never after come to be more valid in future ages by being often repeated but the further still it is from the original the less valid it is and has always less force in the mouth or writing of him that last made use of it than in his from whom he received it      secondly in things which sense cannot discover analogy is the great rule of probability  secondly the probabilities we have hitherto mentioned are only such as concern matter of fact and such things as are capable of observation and testimony there remains that other sort concerning which men entertain opinions with variety of assent though the things be such that falling not under the reach of our senses they are not capable of testimony such are   the existence nature and operations of finite immaterial beings without us as spirits angels devils c or the existence of material beings which either for their smallness in themselves or remoteness from us our senses cannot take notice ofas whether there be any plants animals and intelligent inhabitants in the planets and other mansions of the vast universe   concerning the manner of operation in most parts of the works of nature wherein though we see the sensible effects yet their causes are unknown and we perceive not the ways and manner how they are produced we see animals are generated nourished and move the loadstone draws iron and the parts of a candle successively melting turn into flame and give us both light and heat these and the like effects we see and know but the causes that operate and the manner they are produced in we can only guess and probably conjecture for these and the like coming not within the scrutiny of human senses cannot be examined by them or be attested by anybody and therefore can appear more or less probable only as they more or less agree to truths that are established in our minds and as they hold proportion to other parts of our knowledge and observation analogy in these matters is the only help we have and it is from that alone we draw all our grounds of probability thus observing that the bare rubbing of two bodies violently one upon another produces heat and very often fire itself we have reason to think that what we call heat and fire consists in a violent agitation of the imperceptible minute parts of the burning matter observing likewise that the different refractions of pellucid bodies produce in our eyes the different appearances of several colours and also that the different ranging and laying the superficial parts of several bodies as of velvet watered silk c does the like we think it probable that the colour and shining of bodies is in them nothing but the different arrangement and refraction of their minute and insensible parts thus finding in all parts of the creation that fall under human observation that there is a gradual connexion of one with another without any great or discernible gaps between in all that great variety of things we see in the world which are so closely linked together that in the several ranks of beings it is not easy to discover the bounds betwixt them we have reason to be persuaded that by such gentle steps things ascend upwards in degrees of perfection it is a hard matter to say where sensible and rational begin and where insensible and irrational end and who is there quicksighted enough to determine precisely which is the lowest species of living things and which the first of those which have no life things as far as we can observe lessen and augment as the quantity does in a regular cone where though there be a manifest odds betwixt the bigness of the diameter at a remote distance yet the difference between the upper and under where they touch one another is hardly discernible the difference is exceeding great between some men and some animals but if we will compare the understanding and abilities of some men and some brutes we shall find so little difference that it will be hard to say that that of the man is either clearer or larger observing i say such gradual and gentle descents downwards in those parts of the creation that are beneath man the rule of analogy may make it probable that it is so also in things above us and our observation and that there are several ranks of intelligent beings excelling us in several degrees of perfection ascending upwards towards the infinite perfection of the creator by gentle steps and differences that are every one at no great distance from the next to it this sort of probability which is the best conduct of rational experiments and the rise of hypothesis has also its use and influence and a wary reasoning from analogy leads us often into the discovery of truths and useful productions which would otherwise lie concealed      one case where contrary experience lessens not the testimony  though the common experience and the ordinary course of things have justly a mighty influence on the minds of men to make them give or refuse credit to anything proposed to their belief yet there is one case wherein the strangeness of the fact lessens not the assent to a fair testimony given of it for where such supernatural events are suitable to ends aimed at by him who has the power to change the course of nature there under such circumstances that may be the fitter to procure belief by how much the more they are beyond or contrary to ordinary observation this is the proper case of miracles which well attested do not only find credit themselves but give it also to other truths which need such confirmation      the bare testimony of divine revelation is the highest certainty  besides those we have hitherto mentioned there is one sort of propositions that challenge the highest degree of our assent upon bare testimony whether the thing proposed agree or disagree with common experience and the ordinary course of things or no the reason whereof is because the testimony is of such an one as cannot deceive nor be deceived and that is of god himself this carries with it an assurance beyond doubt evidence beyond exception this is called by a peculiar name revelation and our assent to it faith which as absolutely determines our minds and as perfectly excludes all wavering as our knowledge itself and we may as well doubt of our own being as we can whether any revelation from god be true so that faith is a settled and sure principle of assent and assurance and leaves no manner of room for doubt or hesitation only we must be sure that it be a divine revelation and that we understand it right else we shall expose ourselves to all the extravagancy of enthusiasm and all the error of wrong principles if we have faith and assurance in what is not divine revelation and therefore in those cases our assent can be rationally no higher than the evidence of its being a revelation and that this is the meaning of the expressions it is delivered in if the evidence of its being a revelation or that this is its true sense be only on probable proofs our assent can reach no higher than an assurance or diffidence arising from the more or less apparent probability of the proofs but of faith and the precedency it ought to have before other arguments of persuasion i shall speak more hereafter where i treat of it as it is ordinarily placed in contradistinction to reason though in truth it be nothing else but an assent founded on the highest reason     chapter xvii of reason     various significations of the word reason  the word reason in the english language has different significations sometimes it is taken for true and clear principles sometimes for clear and fair deductions from those principles and sometimes for the cause and particularly the final cause but the consideration i shall have of it here is in a signification different from all these and that is as it stands for a faculty in man that faculty whereby man is supposed to be distinguished from beasts and wherein it is evident he much surpasses them     wherein reasoning consists  if general knowledge as has been shown consists in a perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas and the knowledge of the existence of all things without us except only of a god whose existence every man may certainly know and demonstrate to himself from his own existence be had only by our senses what room is there for the exercise of any other faculty but outward sense and inward perception what need is there of reason very much both for the enlargement of our knowledge and regulating our assent for it hath to do both in knowledge and opinion and is necessary and assisting to all our other intellectual faculties and indeed contains two of them viz sagacity and illation by the one it finds out and by the other it so orders the intermediate ideas as to discover what connexion there is in each link of the chain whereby the extremes are held together and thereby as it were to draw into view the truth sought for which is that which we call illation or inference and consists in nothing but the perception of the connexion there is between the ideas in each step of the deduction whereby the mind comes to see either the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas as in demonstration in which it arrives at knowledge or their probable connexion on which it gives or withholds its assent as in opinion sense and intuition reach but a very little way the greatest part of our knowledge depends upon deductions and intermediate ideas and in those cases where we are fain to substitute assent instead of knowledge and take propositions for true without being certain they are so we have need to find out examine and compare the grounds of their probability in both these cases the faculty which finds out the means and rightly applies them to discover certainty in the one and probability in the other is that which we call reason for as reason perceives the necessary and indubitable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in each step of any demonstration that produces knowledge so it likewise perceives the probable connexion of all the ideas or proofs one to another in every step of a discourse to which it will think assent due this is the lowest degree of that which can be truly called reason for where the mind does not perceive this probable connexion where it does not discern whether there be any such connexion or no there mens opinions are not the product of judgment or the consequence of reason but the effects of chance and hazard of a mind floating at all adventures without choice and without direction     reason in its four degrees  so that we may in reason consider these four degrees the first and highest is the discovering and finding out of truths the second the regular and methodical disposition of them and laying them in a clear and fit order to make their connexion and force be plainly and easily perceived the third is the perceiving their connexion and the fourth a making a right conclusion these several degrees may be observed in any mathematical demonstration it being one thing to perceive the connexion of each part as the demonstration is made by another another to perceive the dependence of the conclusion on all the parts a third to make out a demonstration clearly and neatly ones self and something different from all these to have first found out these intermediate ideas or proofs by which it is made     whether syllogism is the great instrument of reason  there is one thing more which i shall desire to be considered concerning reason and that is whether syllogism as is generally thought be the proper instrument of it and the usefullest way of exercising this faculty the causes i have to doubt are these   first cause to doubt this  first because syllogism serves our reason but in one only of the forementioned parts of it and that is to show the connexion of the proofs in any one instance and no more but in this it is of no great use since the mind can perceive such connexion where it really is as easily nay perhaps better without it  men can reason well who cannot make a syllogism  if we will observe the actings of our own minds we shall find that we reason best and clearest when we only observe the connexion of the proof without reducing our thoughts to any rule of syllogism and therefore we may take notice that there are many men that reason exceeding clear and rightly who know not how to make a syllogism he that will look into many parts of asia and america will find men reason there perhaps as acutely as himself who yet never heard of a syllogism nor can reduce any one argument to those forms and i believe scarce any one makes syllogisms in reasoning within himself indeed syllogism is made use of on occasion to discover a fallacy hid in a rhetorical flourish or cunningly wrapt up in a smooth period and stripping an absurdity of the cover of wit and good language show it in its naked deformity but the mind is not taught to reason by these rules it has a native faculty to perceive the coherence or incoherence of its ideas and can range them right without any such perplexing repetitions tell a country gentlewoman that the wind is southwest and the weather lowering and like to rain and she will easily understand it is not safe for her to go abroad thin clad in such a day after a fever she clearly sees the probable connexion of all these viz southwest wind and clouds rain wetting taking cold relapse and danger of death without tying them together in those artificial and cumbersome fetters of several syllogisms that clog and hinder the mind which proceeds from one part to another quicker and clearer without them and the probability which she easily perceives in things thus in their native state would be quite lost if this argument were managed learnedly and proposed in mode and figure for it very often confounds the connexion and i think every one will perceive in mathematical demonstrations that the knowledge gained thereby comes shortest and clearest without syllogism   secondly because though syllogism serves to show the force or fallacy of an argument made use of in the usual way of discoursing by supplying the absent proposition and so setting it before the view in a clear light yet it no less engages the mind in the perplexity of obscure equivocal and fallacious terms wherewith this artificial way of reasoning always abounds it being adapted more to the attaining of victory in dispute than the discovery and confirmation of truth in fair enquiries     syllogism helps little in demonstration less in probability  but however it be in knowledge i think i may truly say it is of far less or no use at all in probabilities for the assent there being to be determined by the preponderancy after due weighing of all the proofs with all circumstances on both sides nothing is so unfit to assist the mind in that as syllogism which running away with one assumed probability or one topical argument pursues that till it has led the mind quite out of sight of the thing under consideration and forcing it upon some remote difficulty holds it fast there entangled perhaps and as it were manacled in the chain of syllogisms without allowing it the liberty much less affording it the helps requisite to show on which side all things considered is the greater probability     serves not to increase our knowledge but to fence with the knowledge we suppose we have  but let it help us as perhaps may be said in convincing men of their errors and mistakes and yet i would fain see the man that was forced out of his opinion by dint of syllogism yet still it fails our reason in that part which if not its highest perfection is yet certainly its hardest task and that which we most need its help in and that is the finding out of proofs and making new discoveries the rules of syllogism serve not to furnish the mind with those intermediate ideas that may show the connexion of remote ones this way of reasoning discovers no new proofs but is the art of marshalling and ranging the old ones we have already the fortyseventh proposition of the first book of euclid is very true but the discovery of it i think not owing to any rules of common logic a man knows first and then he is able to prove syllogistically so that syllogism comes after knowledge and then a man has little or no need of it but it is chiefly by the finding out those ideas that show the connexion of distant ones that our stock of knowledge is increased and that useful arts and sciences are advanced syllogism at best is but the art of fencing with the little knowledge we have without making any addition to it and if a man should employ his reason all this way he will not do much otherwise than he who having got some iron out of the bowels of the earth should have it beaten up all into swords and put it into his servants hands to fence with and bang one another had the king of spain employed the hands of his people and his spanish iron so he had brought to light but little of that treasure that lay so long hid in the dark entrails of america and i am apt to think that he who shall employ all the force of his reason only in brandishing of syllogisms will discover very little of that mass of knowledge which lies yet concealed in the secret recesses of nature and which i am apt to think native rustic reason as it formerly has done is likelier to open a way to and add to the common stock of mankind rather than any scholastic proceeding by the strict rules of mode and figure     other helps to reason than syllogism should be sought  i doubt not nevertheless but there are ways to be found to assist our reason in this most useful part and this the judicious hooker encourages me to say who in his eccl pol   i section   speaks thus if there might be added the right helps of true art and learning which helps i must plainly confess this age of the world carrying the name of a learned age doth neither much know nor generally regard there would undoubtedly be almost as much difference in maturity of judgment between men therewith inured and that which men now are as between men that are now and innocents i do not pretend to have found or discovered here any of those right helps of art this great man of deep thought mentions but that is plain that syllogism and the logic now in use which were as well known in his days can be none of those he means it is sufficient for me if by a discourse perhaps something out of the way i am sure as to me wholly new and unborrowed i shall have given occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries and to seek in their own thoughts for those right helps of art which will scarce be found i fear by those who servilely confine themselves to the rules and dictates of others for beaten tracks lead this sort of cattle as an observing roman calls them whose thoughts reach only to imitation non quo eundum est sed quo itur but i can be bold to say that this age is adorned with some men of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension that if they would employ their thoughts on this subject could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of knowledge     we can reason about particulars and the immediate object of all our reasonings is nothing but particular ideas  having here had occasion to speak of syllogism in general and the use of it in reasoning and the improvement of our knowledge it is fit before i leave this subject to take notice of one manifest mistake in the rules of syllogism viz that no syllogistical reasoning can be right and conclusive but what has at least one general proposition in it as if we could not reason and have knowledge about particulars whereas in truth the matter rightly considered the immediate object of all our reasoning and knowledge is nothing but particulars every mans reasoning and knowledge is only about the ideas existing in his own mind which are truly every one of them particular existences and our knowledge and reason about other things is only as they correspond with those our particular ideas so that the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our particular ideas is the whole and utmost of all our knowledge universality is but accidental to it and consists only in this that the particular ideas about which it is are such as more than one particular thing can correspond with and be represented by but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our particular ideas and consequently our knowledge is equally clear and certain whether either or both or neither of those ideas be capable of representing more real beings than one or no     our reason often fails us  reason though it penetrates into the depths of the sea and earth elevates our thoughts as high as the stars and leads us through the vast spaces and large rooms of this mighty fabric yet it comes far short of the real extent of even corporeal being and there are many instances wherein it fails us as   first in cases when we have no ideas  i it perfectly fails us where our ideas fail it neither does nor can extend itself further than they do and therefore wherever we have no ideas our reasoning stops and we are at an end of our reckoning and if at any time we reason about words which do not stand for any ideas it is only about those sounds and nothing else    0 secondly because our ideas are often obscure or imperfect  ii our reason is often puzzled and at a loss because of the obscurity confusion or imperfection of the ideas it is employed about and there we are involved in difficulties and contradictions thus not having any perfect idea of the least extension of matter nor of infinity we are at a loss about the divisibility of matter but having perfect clear and distinct ideas of number our reason meets with none of those inextricable difficulties in numbers nor finds itself involved in any contradictions about them thus we having but imperfect ideas of the operations of our minds and of the beginning of motion or thought how the mind produces either of them in us and much imperfecter yet of the operation of god run into great difficulties about free created agents which reason cannot well extricate itself out of      iii thirdly because we perceive not intermediate ideas to show conclusions  our reason is often at a stand because it perceives not those ideas which could serve to show the certain or probable agreement or disagreement of any other two ideas and in this some mens faculties far outgo others till algebra that great instrument and instance of human sagacity was discovered men with amazement looked on several of the demonstrations of ancient mathematicians and could scarce forbear to think the finding several of those proofs to be something more than human      iv fourthly because we often proceed upon wrong principles  the mind by proceeding upon false principles is often engaged in absurdities and difficulties brought into straits and contradictions without knowing how to free itself and in that case it is in vain to implore the help of reason unless it be to discover the falsehood and reject the influence of those wrong principles reason is so far from clearing the difficulties which the building upon false foundations brings a man into that if he will pursue it it entangles him the more and engages him deeper in perplexities      v fifthly because we often employ doubtful terms  as obscure and imperfect ideas often involve our reason so upon the same ground do dubious words and uncertain signs often in discourses and arguings when not warily attended to puzzle mens reason and bring them to a nonplus but these two latter are our fault and not the fault of reason but yet the consequences of them are nevertheless obvious and the perplexities or errors they fill mens minds with are everywhere observable      our highest degree of knowledge is intuitive without reasoning  some of the ideas that are in the mind are so there that they can be by themselves immediately compared one with another and in these the mind is able to perceive that they agree or disagree as clearly as that it has them thus the mind perceives that an arch of a circle is less than the whole circle as clearly as it does the idea of a circle and this therefore as has been said i call intuitive knowledge which is certain beyond all doubt and needs no probation nor can have any this being the highest of all human certainty in this consists the evidence of all those maxims which nobody has any doubt about but every man does not as is said only assent to but knows to be true as soon as ever they are proposed to his understanding in the discovery of and assent to these truths there is no use of the discursive faculty no need of reasoning but they are known by a superior and higher degree of evidence and such if i may guess at things unknown i am apt to think that angels have now and the spirits of just men made perfect shall have in a future state of thousands of things which now either wholly escape our apprehensions or which our shortsighted reason having got some faint glimpse of we in the dark grope after      the next is got by reasoning  but though we have here and there a little of this clear light some sparks of bright knowledge yet the greatest part of our ideas are such that we cannot discern their agreement or disagreement by an immediate comparing them and in all these we have need of reasoning and must by discourse and inference make our discoveries now of these there are two sorts which i shall take the liberty to mention here again   first through reasonings that are demonstrative  first those whose agreement or disagreement though it cannot be seen by an immediate putting them together yet may be examined by the intervention of other ideas which can be compared with them in this case when the agreement or disagreement of the intermediate idea on both sides with those which we would compare is plainly discerned there it amounts to demonstration whereby knowledge is produced which though it be certain yet it is not so easy nor altogether so clear as intuitive knowledge because in that there is barely one simple intuition wherein there is no room for any the least mistake or doubt the truth is seen all perfectly at once in demonstration it is true there is intuition too but not altogether at once for there must be a remembrance of the intuition of the agreement of the medium or intermediate idea with that we compared it with before when we compare it with the other and where there be many mediums there the danger of the mistake is the greater for each agreement or disagreement of the ideas must be observed and seen in each step of the whole train and retained in the memory just as it is and the mind must be sure that no part of what is necessary to make up the demonstration is omitted or overlooked this makes some demonstrations long and perplexed and too hard for those who have not strength of parts distinctly to perceive and exactly carry so many particulars orderly in their heads and even those who are able to master such intricate speculations are fain sometimes to go over them again and there is need of more than one review before they can arrive at certainty but yet where the mind clearly retains the intuition it had of the agreement of any idea with another and that with a third and that with a fourth c there the agreement of the first and the fourth is a demonstration and produces certain knowledge which may be called rational knowledge as the other is intuitive      secondly to supply the narrowness of demonstrative and intuitive knowledge we have nothing but judgment upon probable reasoning  secondly there are other ideas whose agreement or disagreement can no otherwise be judged of but by the intervention of others which have not a certain agreement with the extremes but an usual or likely one and in these is that the judgment is properly exercised which is the acquiescing of the mind that any ideas do agree by comparing them with such probable mediums this though it never amounts to knowledge no not to that which is the lowest degree of it yet sometimes the intermediate ideas tie the extremes so firmly together and the probability is so clear and strong that assent as necessarily follows it as knowledge does demonstration the great excellency and use of the judgment is to observe right and take a true estimate of the force and weight of each probability and then casting them up all right together choose that side which has the overbalance      intuition demonstration judgment  intuitive knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of two ideas immediately compared together  rational knowledge is the perception of the certain agreement or disagreement of any two ideas by the intervention of one or more other ideas  judgment is the thinking or taking two ideas to agree or disagree by the intervention of one or more ideas whose certain agreement or disagreement with them it does not perceive but hath observed to be frequent and usual      consequences of words and consequences of ideas  though the deducing one proposition from another or making inferences in words be a great part of reason and that which it is usually employed about yet the principal act of ratiocination is the finding the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another by the intervention of a third as a man by a yard finds two houses to be of the same length which could not be brought together to measure their equality by juxtaposition words have their consequences as the signs of such ideas and things agree or disagree as really they are but we observe it only by our ideas      four sorts of arguments  before we quit this subject it may be worth our while a little to reflect on four sorts of arguments that men in their reasonings with others do ordinarily make use of to prevail on their assent or at least so to awe them as to silence their opposition   first argumentum ad verecundiam  i the first is to allege the opinions of men whose parts learning eminency power or some other cause has gained a name and settled their reputation in the common esteem with some kind of authority when men are established in any kind of dignity it is thought a breach of modesty for others to derogate any way from it and question the authority of men who are in possession of it this is apt to be censured as carrying with it too much pride when a man does not readily yield to the determination of approved authors which is wont to be received with respect and submission by others and it is looked upon as insolence for a man to set up and adhere to his own opinion against the current stream of antiquity or to put it in the balance against that of some learned doctor or otherwise approved writer whoever backs his tenets with such authorities thinks he ought thereby to carry the cause and is ready to style it impudence in any one who shall stand out against them this i think may be called argumentum ad verecundiam    0 secondly argumentum ad ignorantiam  ii secondly another way that men ordinarily use to drive others and force them to submit their judgments and receive the opinion in debate is to require the adversary to admit what they allege as a proof or to assign a better and this i call argumentum ad ignorantiam      thirdly argumentum ad hominem  iii thirdly a third way is to press a man with consequences drawn from his own principles or concessions this is already known under the name of argumentum ad hominem      fourthly argumentum ad justicium the fourth alone advances us in knowledge and judgment  iv the fourth is the using of proofs drawn from any of the foundations of knowledge or probability this i call argumentum ad justicium this alone of all the four brings true instruction with it and advances us in our way to knowledge for   it argues not another mans opinion to be right because i out of respect or any other consideration but that of conviction will not contradict him   it proves not another man to be in the right way nor that i ought to take the same with him because i know not a better   nor does it follow that another man is in the right way because he has shown me that i am in the wrong i may be modest and therefore not oppose another mans persuasion i may be ignorant and not be able to produce a better i may be in an error and another may show me that i am so this may dispose me perhaps for the reception of truth but helps me not to it that must come from proofs and arguments and light arising from the nature of things themselves and not from my shamefacedness ignorance or error      above contrary and according to reason  by what has been before said of reason we may be able to make some guess at the distinction of things into those that are according to above and contrary to reason   according to reason are such propositions whose truth we can discover by examining and tracing those ideas we have from sensation and reflection and by natural deduction find to be true or probable   above reason are such propositions whose truth or probability we cannot by reason derive from those principles   contrary to reason are such propositions as are inconsistent with or irreconcilable to our clear and distinct ideas thus the existence of one god is according to reason the existence of more than one god contrary to reason the resurrection of the dead above reason above reason also may be taken in a double sense viz either as signifying above probability or above certainty and in that large sense also contrary to reason is i suppose sometimes taken      reason and faith not opposite for faith must be regulated by reason  there is another use of the word reason wherein it is opposed to faith which though it be in itself a very improper way of speaking yet common use has so authorized it that it would be folly either to oppose or hope to remedy it only i think it may not be amiss to take notice that however faith be opposed to reason faith is nothing but a firm assent of the mind which if it be regulated as is our duty cannot be afforded to anything but upon good reason and so cannot be opposite to it he that believes without having any reason for believing may be in love with his own fancies but neither seeks truth as he ought nor pays the obedience due to his maker who would have him use those discerning faculties he has given him to keep him out of mistake and error he that does not this to the best of his power however he sometimes lights on truth is in the right but by chance and i know not whether the luckiness of the accident will excuse the irregularity of his proceeding this at least is certain that he must be accountable for whatever mistakes he runs into whereas he that makes use of the light and faculties god has given him and seeks sincerely to discover truth by those helps and abilities he has may have this satisfaction in doing his duty as a rational creature that though he should miss truth he will not miss the reward of it for he governs his assent right and places it as he should who in any case or matter whatsoever believes or disbelieves according as reason directs him he that doth otherwise transgresses against his own light and misuses those faculties which were given him to no other end but to search and follow the clearer evidence and greater probability but since reason and faith are by some men opposed we will so consider them in the following chapter     chapter xviii  of faith and reason and their distinct provinces     necessary to know their boundaries  it has been above shown   that we are of necessity ignorant and want knowledge of all sorts where we want ideas   that we are ignorant and want rational knowledge where we want proofs   that we want certain knowledge and certainty as far as we want clear and determined specific ideas   that we want probability to direct our assent in matters where we have neither knowledge of our own nor testimony of other men to bottom our reason upon from these things thus premised i think we may come to lay down the measures and boundaries between faith and reason the want whereof may possibly have been the cause if not of great disorders yet at least of great disputes and perhaps mistakes in the world for till it be resolved how far we are to be guided by reason and how far by faith we shall in vain dispute and endeavour to convince one another in matters of religion     faith and reason what as contradistingushed  i find every sect as far as reason will help them make use of it gladly and where it fails them they cry out it is matter of faith and above reason and i do not see how they can argue with any one or ever convince a gainsayer who makes use of the same plea without setting down strict boundaries between faith and reason which ought to be the first point established in all questions where faith has anything to do  reason therefore here as contradistinguished to faith i take to be the discovery of the certainty or probability of such propositions or truths which the mind arrives at by deduction made from such ideas which it has got by the use of its natural faculties viz by sensation or reflection  faith on the other side is the assent to any proposition not thus made out by the deductions of reason but upon the credit of the proposer as coming from god in some extraordinary way of communication this way of discovering truths to men we call revelation     first no new simple idea can be conveyed by traditional revelation  first then i say that no man inspired by god can by any revelation communicate to others any new simple ideas which they had not before from sensation or reflection for whatsoever impressions he himself may have from the immediate hand of god this revelation if it be of new simple ideas cannot be conveyed to another either by words or any other signs because words by their immediate operation on us cause no other ideas but of their natural sounds and it is by the custom of using them for signs that they excite and revive in our minds latent ideas but yet only such ideas as were there before for words seen or heard recal to our thoughts those ideas only which to us they have been wont to be signs of but cannot introduce any perfectly new and formerly unknown simple ideas the same holds in all other signs which cannot signify to us things of which we have before never had any idea at all  thus whatever things were discovered to st paul when he was rapt up into the third heaven whatever new ideas his mind there received all the description he can make to others of that place is only this that there are such things as eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive and supposing god should discover to any one supernaturally a species of creatures inhabiting for example jupiter or saturn for that it is possible there may be such nobody can deny which had six senses and imprint on his mind the ideas conveyed to theirs by that sixth sense he could no more by words produce in the minds of other men those ideas imprinted by that sixth sense than one of us could convey the idea of any colour by the sound of words into a man who having the other four senses perfect had always totally wanted the fifth of seeing for our simple ideas then which are the foundation and sole matter of all our notions and knowledge we must depend wholly on our reason i mean our natural faculties and can by no means receive them or any of them from traditional revelation i say traditional revelation in distinction to original revelation by the one i mean that first impression which is made immediately by god on the mind of any man to which we cannot set any bounds and by the other those impressions delivered over to others in words and the ordinary ways of conveying our conceptions one to another     secondly traditional revelation may make us know propositions knowable also by reason but not with the same certainty that reason doth  secondly i say that the same truths may be discovered and conveyed down from revelation which are discernable to us by reason and by those ideas we naturally may have so god might by revelation discover the truth of any proposition in euclid as well as men by the natural use of their faculties come to make the discovery themselves in all things of this kind there is little need or use of revelation god having furnished us with natural and surer means to arrive at the knowledge of them for whatsoever truth we come to the clear discovery of from the knowledge and contemplation of our own ideas will always be certainer to us than those which are conveyed to us by traditional revelation for the knowledge we have that this revelation came at first from god can never be so sure as the knowledge we have from the clear and distinct perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas vg if it were revealed some ages since that the three angles of a triangle were equal to two right ones i might assent to the truth of that proposition upon the credit of the tradition that it was revealed but that would never amount to so great a certainty as the knowledge of it upon the comparing and measuring my own ideas of two right angles and the three angles of a triangle the like holds in matter of fact knowable by our senses vg the history of the deluge is conveyed to us by writings which had their original from revelation and yet nobody i think will say he has as certain and clear a knowledge of the flood as noah that saw it or that he himself would have had had he then been alive and seen it for he has no greater an assurance than that of his senses that it is writ in the book supposed writ by moses inspired but he has not so great an assurance that moses wrote that book as if he had seen moses write it so that the assurance of its being a revelation is less still than the assurance of his senses     even original revelation cannot be admitted against the clear evidence of reason  in propositions then whose certainty is built upon the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas attained either by immediate intuition as in selfevident propositions or by evident deductions of reason in demonstrations we need not the assistance of revelation as necessary to gain our assent and introduce them into our minds because the natural ways of knowledge could settle them there or had done it already which is the greatest assurance we can possibly have of anything unless where god immediately reveals it to us and there too our assurance can be no greater than our knowledge is that it is a revelation from god but yet nothing i think can under that title shake or overrule plain knowledge or rationally prevail with any man to admit it for true in a direct contradiction to the clear evidence of his own understanding for since no evidence of our faculties by which we receive such revelations can exceed if equal the certainty of our intuitive knowledge we can never receive for a truth anything that is directly contrary to our clear and distinct knowledge vg the ideas of one body and one place do so clearly agree and the mind has so evident a perception of their agreement that we can never assent to a proposition that affirms the same body to be in two distant places at once however it should pretend to the authority of a divine revelation since the evidence first that we deceive not ourselves in ascribing it to god secondly that we understand it right can never be so great as the evidence of our own intuitive knowledge whereby we discern it impossible for the same body to be in two places at once and therefore no proposition can be received for divine revelation or obtain the assent due to all such if it be contradictory to our clear intuitive knowledge because this would be to subvert the principles and foundations of all knowledge evidence and assent whatsoever and there would be left no difference between truth and falsehood no measures of credible and incredible in the world if doubtful propositions shall take place before selfevident and what we certainly know give way to what we may possibly be mistaken in in propositions therefore contrary to the clear perception of the agreement or disagreement of any of our ideas it will be in vain to urge them as matters of faith they cannot move our assent under that or any other title whatsoever for faith can never convince us of anything that contradicts our knowledge because though faith be founded on the testimony of god who cannot lie revealing any proposition to us yet we cannot have an assurance of the truth of its being a divine revelation greater than our own knowledge since the whole strength of the certainty depends upon our knowledge that god revealed it which in this case where the proposition supposed revealed contradicts our knowledge or reason will always have this objection hanging to it viz that we cannot tell how to conceive that to come from god the bountiful author of our being which if received for true must overturn all the principles and foundations of knowledge he has given us render all our faculties useless wholly destroy the most excellent part of his workmanship our understandings and put a man in a condition wherein he will have less light less conduct than the beast that perisheth for if the mind of man can never have a clearer and perhaps not so clear evidence of anything to be a divine revelation as it has of the principles of its own reason it can never have a ground to quit the clear evidence of its reason to give a place to a proposition whose revelation has not a greater evidence than those principles have     traditional revelation much less  thus far a man has use of reason and ought to hearken to it even in immediate and original revelation where it is supposed to be made to himself but to all those who pretend not to immediate revelation but are required to pay obedience and to receive the truths revealed to others which by the tradition of writings or word of mouth are conveyed down to them reason has a great deal more to do and is that only which can induce us to receive them for matter of faith being only divine revelation and nothing else faith as we use the word called commonly divine faith has to do with no propositions but those which are supposed to be divinely revealed so that i do not see how those who make revelation alone the sole object of faith can say that it is a matter of faith and not of reason to believe that such or such a proposition to be found in such or such a book is of divine inspiration unless it be revealed that that proposition or all in that book was communicated by divine inspiration without such a revelation the believing or not believing that proposition or book to be of divine authority can never be matter of faith but matter of reason and such as i must come to an assent to only by the use of my reason which can never require or enable me to believe that which is contrary to itself it being impossible for reason ever to procure any assent to that which to itself appears unreasonable  in all things therefore where we have clear evidence from our ideas and those principles of knowledge i have above mentioned reason is the proper judge and revelation though it may in consenting with it confirm its dictates yet cannot in such cases invalidate its decrees nor can we be obliged where we have the clear and evident sentence of reason to quit it for the contrary opinion under a pretence that it is matter of faith which can have no authority against the plain and clear dictates of reason     thirdly things above reason are when revealed the proper matter of faith  but thirdly there being many things wherein we have very imperfect notions or none at all and other things of whose past present or future existence by the natural use of our faculties we can have no knowledge at all these as being beyond the discovery of our natural faculties and above reason are when revealed the proper matter of faith thus that part of the angels rebelled against god and thereby lost their first happy state and that the dead shall rise and live again these and the like being beyond the discovery of reason are purely matters of faith with which reason has directly nothing to do     or not contrary to reason if revealed are matter of faith and must carry it against probable conjectures of reason  but since god in giving us the light of reason has not thereby tied up his own hands from affording us when he thinks fit the light of revelation in any of those matters wherein our natural faculties are able to give a probable determination revelation where god has been pleased to give it must carry it against the probable conjectures of reason because the mind not being certain of the truth of that it does not evidently know but only yielding to the probability that appears in it is bound to give up its assent to such a testimony which it is satisfied comes from one who cannot err and will not deceive but yet it still belongs to reason to judge of the truth of its being a revelation and of the signification of the words wherein it is delivered indeed if anything shall be thought revelation which is contrary to the plain principles of reason and the evident knowledge the mind has of its own clear and distinct ideas there reason must be hearkened to as to a matter within its province since a man can never have so certain a knowledge that a proposition which contradicts the clear principles and evidence of his own knowledge was divinely revealed or that he understands the words rightly wherein it is delivered as he has that the contrary is true and so is bound to consider and judge of it as a matter of reason and not swallow it without examination as a matter of faith     revelation in matters where reason cannot judge or but probably ought to be hearkened to  first whatever proposition is revealed of whose truth our mind by its natural faculties and notions cannot judge that is purely matter of faith and above reason  secondly all propositions whereof the mind by the use of its natural faculties can come to determine and judge from naturally acquired ideas are matter of reason with this difference still that in those concerning which it has but an uncertain evidence and so is persuaded of their truth only upon probable grounds which still admit a possibility of the contrary to be true without doing violence to the certain evidence of its own knowledge and overturning the principles of all reason in such probable propositions i say an evident revelation ought to determine our assent even against probability for where the principles of reason have not evidenced a proposition to be certainly true or false there clear revelation as another principle of truth and ground of assent may determine and so it may be matter of faith and be also above reason because reason in that particular matter being able to reach no higher than probability faith gave the determination where reason came short and revelation discovered on which side the truth lay    0 in matters where reason can afford certain knowledge that is to be hearkened to  thus far the dominion of faith reaches and that without any violence or hindrance to reason which is not injured or disturbed but assisted and improved by new discoveries of truth coming from the eternal fountain of all knowledge whatever god hath revealed is certainly true no doubt can be made of it this is the proper object of faith but whether it be a divine revelation or no reason must judge which can never permit the mind to reject a greater evidence to embrace what is less evident nor allow it to entertain probability in opposition to knowledge and certainty there can be no evidence that any traditional revelation is of divine original in the words we receive it and in the sense we understand it so clear and so certain as that of the principles of reason and therefore nothing that is contrary to and inconsistent with the clear and selfevident dictates of reason has a right to be urged or assented to as a matter of faith wherein reason hath nothing to do whatsoever is divine revelation ought to overrule all our opinions prejudices and interest and hath a right to be received with full assent such a submission as this of our reason to faith takes not away the landmarks of knowledge this shakes not the foundations of reason but leaves us that use of our faculties for which they were given us      if the boundaries be not set between faith and reason no enthusiasm or extravagancy in religion can be contradicted  if the provinces of faith and reason are not kept distinct by these boundaries there will in matters of religion be no room for reason at all and those extravagant opinions and ceremonies that are to be found in the several religions of the world will not deserve to be blamed for to this crying up of faith in opposition to reason we may i think in good measure ascribe those absurdities that fill almost all the religions which possess and divide mankind for men having been principled with an opinion that they must not consult reason in the things of religion however apparently contradictory to common sense and the very principles of all their knowledge have let loose their fancies and natural superstition and have been by them led into so strange opinions and extravagant practices in religion that a considerate man cannot but stand amazed at their follies and judge them so far from being acceptable to the great and wise god that he cannot avoid thinking them ridiculous and offensive to a sober good man so that in effect religion which should most distinguish us from beasts and ought most peculiarly to elevate us as rational creatures above brutes is that wherein men often appear most irrational and more senseless than beasts themselves credo quia impossibile est i believe because it is impossible might in a good man pass for a sally of zeal but would prove a very ill rule for men to choose their opinions or religion by     chapter xix not in early editions     chapter xx  of wrong assent or error     causes of error or how men come to give assent contrary to probability  knowledge being to be had only of visible and certain truth error is not a fault of our knowledge but a mistake of our judgment giving assent to that which is not true  but if assent be grounded on likelihood if the proper object and motive of our assent be probability and that probability consists in what is laid down in the foregoing chapters it will be demanded how men come to give their assents contrary to probability for there is nothing more common than contrariety of opinions nothing more obvious than that one man wholly disbelieves what another only doubts of and a third steadfastly believes and firmly adheres to  the reasons whereof though they may be very various yet i suppose may all be reduced to these four  i want of proofs  ii want of ability to use them  iii want of will to see them  iv wrong measures of probability     first cause of error want of proofs  first by want of proofs i do not mean only the want of those proofs which are nowhere extant and so are nowhere to be had but the want even of those proofs which are in being or might be procured and thus men want proofs who have not the convenience or opportunity to make experiments and observations themselves tending to the proof of any proposition nor likewise the convenience to inquire into and collect the testimonies of others and in this state are the greatest part of mankind who are given up to labour and enslaved to the necessity of their mean condition whose lives are worn out only in the provisions for living these mens opportunities of knowledge and inquiry are commonly as narrow as their fortunes and their understandings are but little instructed when all their whole time and pains is laid out to still the croaking of their own bellies or the cries of their children it is not to be expected that a man who drudges on all his life in a laborious trade should be more knowing in the variety of things done in the world than a packhorse who is driven constantly forwards and backwards in a narrow lane and dirty road only to market should be skilled in the geography of the country nor is it at all more possible that he who wants leisure books and languages and the opportunity of conversing with variety of men should be in a condition to collect those testimonies and observations which are in being and are necessary to make out many nay most of the propositions that in the societies of men are judged of the greatest moment or to find out grounds of assurance so great as the belief of the points he would build on them is thought necessary so that a great part of mankind are by the natural and unalterable state of things in this world and the constitution of human affairs unavoidably given over to invincible ignorance of those proofs on which others build and which are necessary to establish those opinions the greatest part of men having much to do to get the means of living are not in a condition to look after those of learned and laborious inquiries     objection what shall become of those who want proofs answered  what shall we say then are the greatest part of mankind by the necessity of their condition subjected to unavoidable ignorance in those things which are of greatest importance to them for of those it is obvious to inquire have the bulk of mankind no other guide but accident and blind chance to conduct them to their happiness or misery are the current opinions and licensed guides of every country sufficient evidence and security to every man to venture his great concernments on nay his everlasting happiness or misery or can those be the certain and infallible oracles and standards of truth which teach one thing in christendom and another in turkey or shall a poor countryman be eternally happy for having the chance to be born in italy or a daylabourer be unavoidably lost because he had the illluck to be born in england how ready some men may be to say some of these things i will not here examine but this i am sure that men must allow one or other of these to be true let them choose which they please or else grant that god has furnished men with faculties sufficient to direct them in the way they should take if they will but seriously employ them that way when their ordinary vocations allow them the leisure no man is so wholly taken up with the attendance on the means of living as to have no spare time at all to think of his soul and inform himself in matters of religion were men as intent upon this as they are on things of lower concernment there are none so enslaved to the necessities of life who might not find many vacancies that might be husbanded to this advantage of their knowledge     people hindered from inquiry  besides those whose improvements and informations are straitened by the narrowness of their fortunes there are others whose largeness of fortune would plentifully enough supply books and other requisites for clearing of doubts and discovering of truth but they are cooped in close by the laws of their countries and the strict guards of those whose interest it is to keep them ignorant lest knowing more they should believe the less in them these are as far nay further from the liberty and opportunities of a fair inquiry than these poor and wretched labourers we before spoke of and however they may seem high and great are confined to narrowness of thought and enslaved in that which should be the freest part of man their understandings this is generally the case of all those who live in places where care is taken to propagate truth without knowledge where men are forced at a venture to be of the religion of the country and must therefore swallow down opinions as silly people do empirics pills without knowing what they are made of or how they will work and having nothing to do but believe that they will do the cure but in this are much more miserable than they in that they are not at liberty to refuse swallowing what perhaps they had rather let alone or to choose the physician to whose conduct they would trust themselves     second cause of error want of skill to use proofs  secondly those who want skill to use those evidences they have of probabilities who cannot carry a train of consequences in their heads nor weigh exactly the preponderancy of contrary proofs and testimonies making every circumstance its due allowance may be easily misled to assent to positions that are not probable there are some men of one some but of two syllogisms and no more and others that can but advance one step further these cannot always discern that side on which the strongest proofs lie cannot constantly follow that which in itself is the more probable opinion now that there is such a difference between men in respect of their understandings i think nobody who has had any conversation with his neighbours will question though he never was at westminsterhall or the exchange on the one hand nor at almshouses or bedlam on the other which great difference in mens intellectuals whether it rises from any defect in the organs of the body particularly adapted to thinking or in the dulness or untractableness of those faculties for want of use or as some think in the natural differences of mens souls themselves or some or all of these together it matters not here to examine only this is evident that there is a difference of degrees in mens understandings apprehensions and reasonings to so great a latitude that one may without doing injury to mankind affirm that there is a greater distance between some men and others in this respect than between some men and some beasts but how this comes about is a speculation though of great consequence yet not necessary to our present purpose     third cause of error want of will to use them  thirdly there are another sort of people that want proofs not because they are out of their reach but because they will not use them who though they have riches and leisure enough and want neither parts nor learning may yet through their hot pursuit of pleasure or business or else out of laziness or fear that the doctrines whose truth they would inquire into would not suit well with their opinions lives or designs may never come to the knowledge of nor give their assent to those possibilities which lie so much within their view that to be convinced of them they need but turn their eyes that way we know some men will not read a letter which is supposed to bring ill news and many men forbear to cast up their accounts or so much as think upon their estates who have reason to fear their affairs are in no very good posture how men whose plentiful fortunes allow them leisure to improve their understandings can satisfy themselves with a lazy ignorance i cannot tell but methinks they have a low opinion of their souls who lay out all their incomes in provisions for the body and employ none of it to procure the means and helps of knowledge who take great care to appear always in a neat and splendid outside and would think themselves miserable in coarse clothes or a patched coat and yet contentedly suffer their minds to appear abroad in a piebald livery of coarse patches and borrowed shreds such as it has pleased chance or their country tailor i mean the common opinion of those they have conversed with to clothe them in i will not here mention how unreasonable this is for men that ever think of a future state and their concernment in it which no rational man can avoid to do sometimes nor shall i take notice what a shame and confusion it is to the greatest contemners of knowledge to be found ignorant in things they are concerned to know but this at least is worth the consideration of those who call themselves gentlemen that however they may think credit respect power and authority the concomitants of their birth and fortune yet they will find all these still carried away from them by men of lower condition who surpass them in knowledge they who are blind will always be led by those that see or else fall into the ditch and he is certainly the most subjected the most enslaved who is so in his understanding in the foregoing instances some of the causes have been shown of wrong assent and how it comes to pass that probable doctrines are not always received with an assent proportionable to the reasons which are to be had for their probability but hitherto we have considered only such probabilities whose proofs do exist but do not appear to him who embraces the error     fourth cause of error wrong measures of probability which are  fourthly there remains yet the last sort who even where the real probabilities appear and are plainly laid before them do not admit of the conviction nor yield unto manifest reasons but do either suspend their assent or give it to the less probable opinion and to this danger are those exposed who have taken up wrong measures of probability which are  i propositions that are in themselves certain and evident but doubtful and false taken up for principles  ii received hypotheses  iii predominant passions or inclinations  iv authority     i doubtful propositions taken for principles  the first and firmest ground of probability is the conformity anything has to our own knowledge especially that part of our knowledge which we have embraced and continue to look on as principles these have so great an influence upon our opinions that it is usually by them we judge of truth and measure probability to that degree that what is inconsistent with our principles is so far from passing for probable with us that it will not be allowed possible the reverence borne to these principles is so great and their authority so paramount to all other that the testimony not only of other men but the evidence of our own senses are often rejected when they offer to vouch anything contrary to these established rules how much the doctrine of innate principles and that principles are not to be proved or questioned has contributed to this i will not here examine this i readily grant that one truth cannot contradict another but withal i take leave also to say that every one ought very carefully to beware what he admits for a principle to examine it strictly and see whether he certainly knows it to be true of itself by its own evidence or whether he does only with assurance believe it to be so upon the authority of others for he hath a strong bias put into his understanding which will unavoidably misguide his assent who hath imbibed wrong principles and has blindly given himself up to the authority of any opinion in itself not evidently true     instilled in childhood  there is nothing more ordinary than childrens receiving into their minds propositions especially about matters of religion from their parents nurses or those about them which being insinuated into their unwary as well as unbiassed understandings and fastened by degrees are at last equally whether true or false riveted there by long custom and education beyond all possibility of being pulled out again for men when they are grown up reflecting upon their opinions and finding those of this sort to be as ancient in their minds as their very memories not having observed their early insinuation nor by what means they got them they are apt to reverence them as sacred things and not to suffer them to be profaned touched or questioned they look on them as the urim and thummim set up in their minds immediately by god himself to be the great and unerring deciders of truth and falsehood and the judges to which they are to appeal in all manner of controversies    0 of irresistible efficacy  this opinion of his principles let them be what they will being once established in any ones mind it is easy to be imagined what reception any proposition shall find how clearly soever proved that shall invalidate their authority or at all thwart with these internal oracles whereas the grossest absurdities and improbabilities being but agreeable to such principles go down glibly and are easily digested the great obstinacy that is to be found in men firmly believing quite contrary opinions though many times equally absurd in the various religions of mankind are as evident a proof as they are an unavoidable consequence of this way of reasoning from received traditional principles so that men will disbelieve their own eyes renounce the evidence of their senses and give their own experience the lie rather than admit of anything disagreeing with these sacred tenets take an intelligent romanist that from the first dawning of any notions in his understanding hath had this principle constantly inculcated viz that he must believe as the church ie those of his communion believes or that the pope is infallible and this he never so much as heard questioned till at forty or fifty years old he met with one of other principles how is he prepared easily to swallow not only against all probability but even the clear evidence of his senses the doctrine of transubstantiation this principle has such an influence on his mind that he will believe that to be flesh which he sees to be bread and what way will you take to convince a man of any improbable opinion he holds who with some philosophers hath laid down this as a foundation of reasoning that he must believe his reason for so men improperly call arguments drawn from their principles against his senses let an enthusiast be principled that he or his teacher is inspired and acted by an immediate communication of the divine spirit and you in vain bring the evidence of clear reasons against his doctrine whoever therefore have imbibed wrong principles are not in things inconsistent with these principles to be moved by the most apparent and convincing probabilities till they are so candid and ingenuous to themselves as to be persuaded to examine even those very principles which many never suffer themselves to do      received hypotheses  next to these are men whose understandings are cast into a mould and fashioned just to the size of a received hypothesis the difference between these and the former is that they will admit of matter of fact and agree with dissenters in that but differ only in assigning of reasons and explaining the manner of operation these are not at that open defiance with their senses with the former they can endure to hearken to their information a little more patiently but will by no means admit of their reports in the explanation of things nor be prevailed on by probabilities which would convince them that things are not brought about just after the same manner that they have decreed within themselves that they are would it not be an insufferable thing for a learned professor and that which his scarlet would blush at to have his authority of forty years standing wrought out of hard rock greek and latin with no small expense of time and candle and confirmed by general tradition and a reverend beard in an instant overturned by an upstart novelist can any one expect that he should be made to confess that what he taught his scholars thirty years ago was all error and mistake and that he sold them hard words and ignorance at a very dear rate what probabilities i say are sufficient to prevail in such a case and who ever by the most cogent arguments will be prevailed with to disrobe himself at once of all his old opinions and pretences to knowledge and learning which with hard study he hath all this time been labouring for and turn himself out stark naked in quest afresh of new notions all the arguments that can be used will be as little able to prevail as the wind did with the traveller to part with his cloak which he held only the faster to this of wrong hypothesis may be reduced the errors that may be occasioned by a true hypothesis or right principles but not rightly understood there is nothing more familiar than this the instances of men contending for different opinions which they all derive from the infallible truth of the scripture are an undeniable proof of it all that call themselves christians allow the text that saysword in greek to carry in it the obligation to a very weighty duty but yet how very erroneous will one of their practices be who understanding nothing but the french take this rule with one translation to be repentezvous repent or with the other fatiez penitence do penance      iii predominant passions  probabilities which cross mens appetites and prevailing passions run the same fate let ever so much probability hang on one side of a covetous mans reasoning and money on the other it is easy to foresee which will outweigh earthly minds like mud walls resist the strongest batteries and though perhaps sometimes the force of a clear argument may make some impression yet they nevertheless stand firm and keep out the enemy truth that would captivate or disturb them tell a man passionately in love that he is jilted bring a score of witnesses of the falsehood of his mistress it is ten to one but three kind words of hers shall invalidate all their testimonies quod volumus facile credimus what suits our wishes is forwardly believed is i suppose what every one hath more than once experimented and though men cannot always openly gainsay or resist the force of manifest probabilities that make against them yet yield they not to the argument not but that it is the nature of the understanding constantly to close with the more probable side but yet a man hath a power to suspend and restrain its inquiries and not permit a full and satisfactory examination as far as the matter in question is capable and will bear it to be made until that be done there will be always these two ways left of evading the most apparent probabilities      two means of evading probabilities   supposed fallacy latent in the words employed  first that the arguments being as for the most part they are brought in words there may be a fallacy latent in them and the consequences being perhaps many in train they may be some of them incoherent there are very few discourses so short clear and consistent to which most men may not with satisfaction enough to themselves raise this doubt and from whose conviction they may not without reproach of disingenuity or unreasonableness set themselves free with the old reply non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris though i cannot answer i will not yield      supposed unknown arguments for the contrary  secondly manifest probabilities maybe evaded and the assent withheld upon this suggestion that i know not yet all that may be said on the contrary side and therefore though i be beaten it is not necessary i should yield not knowing what forces there are in reserve behind this is a refuge against conviction so open and so wide that it is hard to determine when a man is quite out of the verge of it      what probabilities naturally determine the assent  but yet there is some end of it and a man having carefully inquired into all the grounds of probability and unlikeliness done his utmost to inform himself in all particulars fairly and cast up the sum total on both sides may in most cases come to acknowledge upon the whole matter on which side the probability rests wherein some proofs in matter of reason being suppositions upon universal experience are so cogent and clear and some testimonies in matter of fact so universal that he cannot refuse his assent so that i think we may conclude that in propositions where though the proofs in view are of most moment yet there are sufficient grounds to suspect that there is either fallacy in words or certain proofs as considerable to be produced on the contrary side there assent suspense or dissent are often voluntary actions but where the proofs are such as make it highly probable and there is not sufficient ground to suspect that there is either fallacy of words which sober and serious consideration may discover nor equally valid proofs yet undiscovered latent on the other side which also the nature of the thing may in some cases make plain to a considerate man there i think a man who has weighed them can scarce refuse his assent to the side on which the greater probability appears whether it be probable that a promiscuous jumble of printing letters should often fall into a method and order which should stamp on paper a coherent discourse or that a blind fortuitous concourse of atoms not guided by an understanding agent should frequently constitute the bodies of any species of animals in these and the like cases i think nobody that considers them can be one jot at a stand which side to take nor at all waver in his assent lastly when there can be no supposition the thing in its own nature indifferent and wholly depending upon the testimony of witnesses that there is as fair testimony against as for the matter of fact attested which by inquiry is to be learned vg whether there was one thousand seven hundred years ago such a man at rome as julius caesar in all such cases i say i think it is not in any rational mans power to refuse his assent but that it necessarily follows and closes with such probabilities in other less clear cases i think it is in mans power to suspend his assent and perhaps content himself with the proofs he has if they favour the opinion that suits with his inclination or interest and so stop from further search but that a man should afford his assent to that side on which the less probability appears to him seems to me utterly impracticable and as impossible as it is to believe the same thing probable and improbable at the same time      where it is in our power to suspend our judgment  as knowledge is no more arbitrary than perception so i think assent is no more in our power than knowledge when the agreement of any two ideas appears to our minds whether immediately or by the assistance of reason i can no more refuse to perceive no more avoid knowing it than i can avoid seeing those objects which i turn my eyes to and look on in daylight and what upon full examination i find the most probable i cannot deny my assent to but though we cannot hinder our knowledge where the agreement is once perceived nor our assent where the probability manifestly appears upon due consideration of all the measures of it yet we can hinder both knowledge and assent by stopping our inquiry and not employing our faculties in the search of any truth if it were not so ignorance error or infidelity could not in any case be a fault thus in some cases we can prevent or suspend our assent but can a man versed in modern or ancient history doubt whether there is such a place as rome or whether there was such a man as julius caesar indeed there are millions of truths that a man is not or may not think himself concerned to know as whether our king richard the third was crooked or no or whether roger bacon was a mathematician or a magician in these and such like cases where the assent one way or other is of no importance to the interest of any one no action no concernment of his following or depending thereon there it is not strange that the mind should give itself up to the common opinion or render itself to the first comer these and the like opinions are of so little weight and moment that like motes in the sun their tendencies are very rarely taken notice of they are there as it were by chance and the mind lets them float at liberty but where the mind judges that the proposition has concernment in it where the assent or not assenting is thought to draw consequences of moment after it and good and evil to depend on choosing or refusing the right side and the mind sets itself seriously to inquire and examine the probability there i think it is not in our choice to take which side we please if manifest odds appear on either the greater probability i think in that case will determine the assent and a man can no more avoid assenting or taking it to be true where he perceives the greater probability than he can avoid knowing it to be true where he perceives the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas  if this be so the foundation of error will lie in wrong measures of probability as the foundation of vice in wrong measures of good      iv authority  the fourth and last wrong measure of probability i shall take notice of and which keeps in ignorance or error more people than all the other together is that which i have mentioned in the foregoing chapter i mean the giving up our assent to the common received opinions either of our friends or party neighbourhood or country how many men have no other ground for their tenets than the supposed honesty or learning or number of those of the same profession as if honest or bookish men could not err or truth were to be established by the vote of the multitude yet this with most men serves the turn the tenet has had the attestation of reverend antiquity it comes to me with the passport of former ages and therefore i am secure in the reception i give it other men have been and are of the same opinion for that is all is said and therefore it is reasonable for me to embrace it a man may more justifiably throw up cross and pile for his opinions than take them up by such measures all men are liable to error and most men are in many points by passion or interest under temptation to it if we could but see the secret motives that influenced the men of name and learning in the world and the leaders of parties we should not always find that it was the embracing of truth for its own sake that made them espouse the doctrines they owned and maintained this at least is certain there is not an opinion so absurd which a man may not receive upon this ground there is no error to be named which has not had its professors and a man shall never want crooked paths to walk in if he thinks that he is in the right way wherever he has the footsteps of others to follow    not so many men in errors as is commonly supposed  but notwithstanding the great noise is made in the world about errors and opinions i must do mankind that right as to say there are not so many men in errors and wrong opinions as is commonly supposed not that i think they embrace the truth but indeed because concerning those doctrines they keep such a stir about they have no thought no opinion at all for if any one should a little catechise the greatest part of the partizans of most of the sects in the world he would not find concerning those matters they are so zealous for that they have any opinions of their own much less would he have reason to think that they took them upon the examination of arguments and appearance of probability they are resolved to stick to a party that education or interest has engaged them in and there like the common soldiers of an army show their courage and warmth as their leaders direct without ever examining or so much as knowing the cause they contend for if a mans life shows that he has no serious regard for religion for what reason should we think that he beats his head about the opinions of his church and troubles himself to examine the grounds of this or that doctrine it is enough for him to obey his leaders to have his hand and his tongue ready for the support of the common cause and thereby approve himself to those who can give him credit preferment or protection in that society thus men become professors of and combatants for those opinions they were never convinced of nor proselytes to no nor ever had so much as floating in their heads and though one cannot say there are fewer improbable or erroneous opinions in the world than there are yet this is certain there are fewer that actually assent to them and mistake them for truths than is imagined     chapter xxi  of the division of the sciences     science may be divided into three sorts  all that can fall within the compass of human understanding being either first the nature of things as they are in themselves their relations and their manner of operation or secondly that which man himself ought to do as a rational and voluntary agent for the attainment of any end especially happiness or thirdly the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated i think science may be divided properly into these three sorts     first physica  first the knowledge of things as they are in their own proper beings then constitution properties and operations whereby i mean not only matter and body but spirits also which have their proper natures constitutions and operations as well as bodies this in a little more enlarged sense of the word i call word in greek physika or natural philosophy the end of this is bare speculative truth and whatsoever can afford the mind of man any such falls under this branch whether it be god himself angels spirits bodies or any of their affections as number and figure c     secondly practica  secondly word in greek praktika the skill of right applying our own powers and actions for the attainment of things good and useful the most considerable under this head is ethics which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions which lead to happiness and the means to practise them the end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth but right and a conduct suitable to it     thirdly word in greek semeiotika  thirdly the third branch may be called word in greek semeiotika or the doctrine of signs the most usual whereof being words it is aptly enough termed also word in greek logika logic the business whereof is to consider the nature of signs the mind makes use of for the understanding of things or conveying its knowledge to others for since the things the mind contemplates are none of them besides itself present to the understanding it is necessary that something else as a sign or representation of the thing it considers should be present to it and these are ideas and because the scene of ideas that makes one mans thoughts cannot be laid open to the immediate view of another nor laid up anywhere but in the memory a no very sure repository therefore to communicate our thoughts to one another as well as record them for our own use signs of our ideas are also necessary those which men have found most convenient and therefore generally make use of are articulate sounds the consideration then of ideas and words as the great instruments of knowledge makes no despicable part of their contemplation who would take a view of human knowledge in the whole extent of it and perhaps if they were distinctly weighed and duly considered they would afford us another sort of logic and critic than what we have been hitherto acquainted with     this is the first and most general division of the objects of our understanding  this seems to me the first and most general as well as natural division of the objects of our understanding for a man can employ his thoughts about nothing but either the contemplation of things themselves for the discovery of truth or about the things in his own power which are his own actions for the attainment of his own ends or the signs the mind makes use of both in the one and the other and the right ordering of them for its clearer information all which three viz things as they are in themselves knowable actions as they depend on us in order to happiness and the right use of signs in order to knowledge being toto coelo different they seemed to me to be the three great provinces of the intellectual world wholly separate and distinct one from another   the end
