oculos ausus  lucretius at length a mighty man of greece began to assert the natural liberty of man creech there are so many young men of fortune and spirit in this kingdom who without the trouble of resorting to the founder of their philosophy or giving themselves any concern about the graius homo in my motto have nevertheless fallen upon a practice so consentaneous to the doctrines which he laid down by system that i much question if any of his professed scholars ever did him greater credit since the time he first struck out the popular project of driving all religion out of the world and introducing pleasure and voluptuousness in its stead  quare religio pedibus subjecta vicissim obteritur nos exaequat victoria coelo we tread religion under foot and rise with selfcreated glory to the skies so far from meaning to oppose myself to such a host of gay and happy mortals i wish to gain a merit with them by adding to their stock of pleasures and suggesting some hints of enjoyments which may be new to them a discovery which they well know was considered by the kings of persia who practiced their philosophy in very ancient times as a service of such importance to all the sect who had even then worn out most of their old pleasures that a very considerable reward was offered to the inventor of any new one how the stock at present stands with our modern voluptuaries i cannot pretend to say but i suspect from certain symptoms which have fallen under my observation that it is nearly run out with some amongst them to such in particular i flatter myself my discoveries will prove of value and i have for their use composed the following meditation which i have put together in the form of a soliloquy solving it step by step as regularly as any proposition in euclid and i will boldly vouch it to be as mathematically true if there is any one postulatum in the whole which the truest voluptuary will not admit to be orthodox epicurism i will consent to give up my system for nonsense and myself for an impostor i condition only with the pupil of pleasure that whilst he reads he will reflect that he will deal heartily with the truth and that he will once in his life permit a certain faculty called reason which i hope he is possessed of to come into use upon this occasion a faculty which though he may not hitherto have employed it is yet capable of supplying him with more true and lasting pleasures than any his philosophy can furnish  i now recommend him to the following meditation which i have entitled  the voluptuarys soliloquy i find myself in possession of an estate which has devolved upon me without any pains of my own i have youth and health to enjoy it and i am determined so to do pleasure is my object and i must therefore so contrive as to make that object lasting and satisfactory if i throw the means away i can no longer compass the end this is selfevident i perceive therefore that i must not game for though i like play i do not like to lose that which alone can purchase every pleasure i propose to enjoy and i do not see that the chance of winning other peoples money can compensate for the pain i must suffer if i lose my own an addition to my fortune can only give superfluities the loss of it may take away even necessaries and in the mean time i have enough for every other gratification but the desperate one of deep play it is resolved therefore that i will not be a gamester there is not common sense in the thought and therefore i renounce it  but if i give up gaming i will take my swing of pleasure that i am determined upon i must therefore ask myself the question what is pleasure is it high living and hard drinking i have my own choice to make therefore i must take some time to consider of it there is nothing very elegant in it i must confess a glutton is but a sorry fellow and a drunkard is a beast besides i am not sure my constitution can stand against it i shall get the gout that would be the devil i shall grow out of all shape i shall have a red face full of blotches a foul breath and be loathsome to the women i cannot bear to think of that for i dote upon the women and therefore adieu to the bottle and all its concomitants i prefer the favors of the fair sex to the company of the soakers and so there is an end to all drinking i will be sober only because i love pleasure  but if i give up wine for women i will repay myself for the sacrifice i will have the finest girls that money can purchase  money did i say what a sound has that  am i to buy beauty with money and cannot i buy love too for there is no pleasure even in beauty without love i find myself gravelled by this unlucky question mercenary love that is nonsense it is flat hypocrisy it is disgusting i should loath the fawning caresses of a dissembling harlot whom i pay for false fondness i find i am wrong again i cannot fall in love with a harlot she must be a modest woman and when that befalls me what then why then if i am terribly in love indeed and cannot be happy without her there is no other choice left me i think i must even marry her nay i am sure i must for if pleasure leads that way pleasure is my object and marriage is my lot i am determined therefore to marry only because i love pleasure  well now that i have given up all other women for a wife i am resolved to take pleasure enough in the possession of her i must be cautious therefore that nobody else takes the same pleasure too for otherwise how have i bettered myself i might as well have remained upon the common i should be a fool indeed to pay such a price for a purchase and let in my neighbors for a share therefore i am determined to keep her to myself for pleasure is my only object and this i take it is a sort of pleasure that does not consist in participation  the next question is how i must contrive to keep her to myself  not by force not by locking her up there is no pleasure in that notion compulsion is out of the case inclination therefore is the next thing i must make it her own choice to be faithful it seems then to be incumbent upon me to make a wise choice to look well before i fix upon a wife and to use her well when i have fixed i will be very kind to her because i will not destroy my own pleasure and i will be very careful of the temptations i expose her to for the same reason she shall not lead the life of your fine town ladies i have a charming place in the country i will pass most of my time in the country there she will be safe and i shall be happy i love pleasure and therefore i will have little to do with that cursed intriguing town of london i am determined to make my house in the country as pleasant as it is possible  but if i give up the gaieties of a town life and the club and the gamingtable and the girls for a wife and the country i will have the sports of the country in perfection i will keep the best pack of hounds in england and hunt every day in the week  but hold a moment there what will become of my wife all the while i am following the hounds will she follow nobody will nobody follow her a pretty figure i shall make to be chacing a stag and come home with the horns at least i shall not risque the experiment i shall not like to leave her at home and i cannot take her with me for that would spoil my pleasure and i hate a horsedog woman i will keep no whipperin in petticoats i perceive therefore i must give up the hounds for i am determined nothing shall stand in the way of my pleasure  why then i must find out some amusements that my wife can partake in we must ride about the park in fine weather we must visit the grounds and the gardens and plan out improvements and make plantations it will be rare employment for the poor people  that is a thought that never struck me before methinks there must be a great deal of pleasure in setting the poor to work  i shall like a farm for the same reason and my wife will take pleasure in a dairy she shall have the most elegant dairy in england and i will build a conservatory and she shall have such plants and such flowers  i have a notion i shall take pleasure in them myself  and then there is a thousand things to do withindoors it is a fine old mansion that is the truth of it i will give it an entire repair it wants new furniture that will be very pleasant work for my wife i perceive i could not afford to keep hounds and do this into the bargain but this will give me the most pleasure all to nothing and then my wife will partake of it  and we will have music and books  i recollect that i have got an excellent library  there is another pleasure i had never thought of  and then no doubt we shall have children and they are very pleasant company when they can talk and understand what is said to them and now i begin to reflect i find there is a vast many pleasures in the life i have chalked out and what a fool should i be to throw away my money at the gamingtable or my health at any table or my affections upon harlots or my time upon hounds and horses or employ either money health affections or time in any other pleasures or pursuits than these which i now perceive will lead me to solid happiness in this life and secure a good chance for what may befall me hereafter    no lxii pudore et liberalitate liberos retinere satius esse credo quam metu terent better far to bind your children to you by the ties of gentleness and modesty than fear colman geminus and gemellus were twinsons of a country gentleman of fortune whom i shall call euphorion when they were of age to begin their grammar learning euphorion found himself exceedingly puzzled to decide upon the best mode of education he had read several treatises on the subject which instead of clearing up his difficulties had increased them he had consulted the opinions of his friends and neighbors and he found these so equally divided and so much to be said on both sides that he could determine upon neither unfortunately for euphorion he had no partialities of his own for the good gentleman had had little or no education himself the clergyman of the parish preached up the moral advantages of private tuition the lawyer his near neighbor dazzled his imagination with the connections and knowledge of the world to be gained in a public school euphorion perceiving himself in a straight between two roads and not knowing which to prefer cut the difficulty by taking both so that geminus was put under private tuition of the clergyman above mentioned and gemellus was taken up to town by the lawyer to be entered at westminster school  euphorion having thus put the two systems fairly to issue waited the event but every time that gemellus came home at the breakingup the private system rose and the public sunk on the comparison in the fathers mind for gemelluss appearance no longer kept pace with his brothers wild and ragged as a colt battered and bruised and dishevelled he hardly seemed of the same species with the spruce little master in the parlour euphorion was shocked to find that his manners were no less altered than his person for he herded with the servants in the stable was for ever under the horses heels and foremost in all games and sports with the idle boys of the parish this was a sore offense in euphorions eyes for he abhorred low company and being the first gentleman of his family seemed determined to keep up to the title misfortunes multiplied upon poor gemellus and every thing conspired to put him in complete disgrace for he began to corrupt his brother and was detected in debauching him to a game at cricket from which geminus was brought home with a bruise on the shin that made a weeks work for the surgeon and what was still worse there was conviction of the blow being given by a ball from gemelluss batt this brought on a severe interdiction of all further fellowship between the brothers and they were effectually kept apart for the future  a suspicion now took place in the fathers mind that gemellus had made as little progress in his books as he had in his manners but as this was a discovery he could not venture upon in person he substituted his proxy for the undertaking gemellus had so many evasions and alibis in resource that it was long before the clergyman could bring the case to a hearing and the report was not very favorable in any sense to the unlucky schoolboy for gemellus had been seized with a violent fit of sneezing in the crisis of examination to the great annoyance of the worthy preceptor who was forced to break up the conference re infecta and in some disorder for amongst other damages which had accrued to his person and apparel he presented himself to the wondering eyes of euphorion with a huge black bush wig stuck full of paper darts and as thickly spiked as the back of a porcupine the culprit was instantly summoned and made no other defense than that they slipped out of his hand and he did not go to do it are these your westminster tricks sirrah cried the angry father and aiming a blow at his scull with his crutch brought the wrong person to the ground for the nimble culprit had slipped out of the way and euphorion being weak and gouty literally followed the blow and was laid sprawling on the floor gemellus flew to his assistance and jointly with the parson got him on his legs but his anger was now so enflamed that gemellus was ordered out of the room under sentence of immediate dismission to school euphorion declared he was so totally spoilt that he would not be troubled with him any longer in his family else he would instantly have reversed his education it was now too late he observed to the parson whilst he was drawing the paper darts from his wig and therefore he should return to the place from whence he came and order was given for passing him off by the stage next morning  a question was asked about his holidaytask but geminus who had now entered his fathers chamber in a mild and pacifying tone assured euphorion that his brother was provided in that respect for that he himself had done the task for him this was pouring oil upon flame and the idle culprit was once more called to the bar to receive a most severe reprimand for his meanness in imposing on his brothers goodnature with many dunces and blockheads cast in his teeth for not being able to do his own business gemellus was nettled with these reproaches but more than all with his brother for betraying him and drawing the task out of his pocket rolled it in his hand and threw it toward the author saying he was a shabby fellow and for his part he scorned to be obliged to any body that would do a favor and then boast of it  recollecting himself in a moment afterward he turned toward his father and begged his pardon for all offenses he hoped he was not such a blockhead but he could do his task if he pleased and he would instantly set about it and send it down to convince him that he could do his own business without any bodys help so saying he went out of the room in great haste and in less time than could be expected brought down a portion of sacred exercise in hexameter verse which the parson heartily declared was admirably well performed for his years adding that although it was not without faults there were some passages that bespoke the dawning of genius  i am obliged to you sir said gemellus it is more than i deserve and i beg your pardon for the impertinence i have been guilty of  the tears started in his eyes as he said this and he departed without any answer from his father  he had no sooner left the room than he perceived geminus had followed him and being piqued with his late treatment turned round and with a disdainful look said  brother geminus you ought to be ashamed of yourself if you was at westminster there is not a boy in the school would acknowledge you after so scandalous a behavior  i care neither for you nor your school answered the domestic youth it is you and not i should be ashamed of such reprobate manners and i shall report you to my father  do so replied gemellus and take that with you into the bargain  this was immediately seconded with a sound slap on the face with his open hand which however drew the blood in a stream from his nostrils and he ran screaming to euphorion who came out upon the alarm with all the speed he could muster gemellus stood his ground and after a severe caning was ordered to ask pardon of his brother this he peremptorily refused to do alleging that he had been punished already and to be beaten and beg pardon too was more than he would submit to no menaces being able to bring this refractory spirit to submission he was sent off to school penniless and a letter was written to the master setting forth his offense and in strong terms censuring his want of discipline for not correcting so stubborn a temper and so idle a disposition  when he returned to school the master sent for him to his house and questioned him upon the matter of complaint in his fathers letter observing that the charge being for offenses out of school he did not think it right to call him publicly to account but as he believed him to be a boy of honor he expected to hear the whole truth fairly related this drew forth the whole narrative and gemellus was dismissed with a gentle admonition that could hardly be construed into a rebuke  when the next holidays were in approach gemellus received the following letter from his brother  brother gemellus if you have duly repented of your behavior to me and will signify your contrition asking pardon as becomes you for the violence you have committed i will intercede with my father and hope to obtain his permission for your coming home in the ensuing holidays if not you must take the consequences and remain where you are for on this condition only i am to consider myself  your affectionate brother geminus   to this letter gemellus returned an answer as follows  dear brother i am sorry to find you still bear in mind a boyish quarrel so long past be assured i have entirely forgiven your behavior to me but i cannot recollect any thing in mine to you which i ought to ask your pardon for whatever consequences may befall me for not complying with your condition i shall remain  your affectionate brother gemellus   no lxiii natura tu illi pater es consiliis ego terent by nature youre his father i by counsel colman this letter fixed the fate of gemellus resentments are not easily dislodged from narrow minds euphorion had not penetration to distinguish between the characters of his children he saw no meanness in the sly insidious manners of his homebred favorite nor any sparks of generous pride in the steady inflexibility of gemellus he little knew the high principle of honor which even the youngest spirits communicate to each other in the habits and manners of a public school he bitterly inveighed against his neighbor the lawyer for persuading him to such a fatal system of education and whenever they met in company their conversation was engrossed with continual arguings and reproachings for neither party receded from his point and gemelluss advocate was as little disposed to give him up as his father was to excuse him at last they came to a compromise by which euphorion agreed to charge his estate with an annuity for the education and support of gemellus which annuity during his nonage was to be received and administered by the said awyer and geminus left heir of his whole fortune this moderate encumbrance excepted  the disinterested and proscribed offender was now turned over to the care of the lawyer who regularly defrayed his school expenses and never failed to visit him at those periods when country practitioners usually resort to town the boy apprized of his situation took no further pains to assuage his fathers resentment but full of resources within himself and possessed of an active and aspiring genius pressed forward in his business and soon found himself at the head of the school with the reputation of being the best scholar in it  he had formed a close friendship according to the custom of great schools with a boy of his own age the son of a nobleman of high distinction in whose family gemellus was a great favorite and where he never failed to pass his holidays when the school adjourned his good friend and guardian the lawyer saw the advantages of this early connection in their proper light and readily consented to admit his ward of the same college in the university when gemellus and his friend had completed their school education here the attachment of these young men became more and more solid as they advanced nearer to manhood and after a course of academical studies in which gemellus still improved the reputation he brought from westminster it was proposed that he should accompany his friend upon his travels and a proper governor was engaged for that service this proposal rather staggered gemelluss guardian on the score of expense and he now found it necessary for the first time to open himself to euphorion with this intent he called upon him one morning and taking him aside told him he was come to confer with him on the subject of gemellus  i am sorry for it interposed euphorion hold sir answered the lawyer interrupt me not if you please though gemellus is my ward he is your son and if you have the natural feelings of a father you will be proud to acknowledge your right in him as such  as he was speaking these words an awkward servant burst into the room and staring with fright and confusion told his master there was a great lord in a fine equipage had actually driven up to the hall door and was asking to speak with him euphorions surprise was now little less than his servants and not being in the habit of receiving visits from people of distinction he eagerly demanded of the lawyer who this visitor could possibly be and casting an eye of embarrassment upon his gouty foot  i am not fit to be seen said he and cannot tell how to escape for heavens fake go and see who this visitor is and keep him from the sight of me if it be possible  euphorion had scarce done speaking when the door was thrown open and the noble stranger who was no less a person than the father of gemelluss friend made his approach and having introduced himself to euphorion and apologized for the abruptness of his visit proceeded to explain the occasion of it in the following words  i wait upon you sir with a request in which i flatter myself i shall be seconded by this worthy gentleman here present you have the honor to be father to one of the most amiable and accomplished young men i ever knew it may not become me to speak so warmly of my own son as perhaps i might with truth but i flatter myself it will be some recommendation of him to your good opinion when i tell you that he is the friend and intimate of your gemellus they have now gone through school and college together and according to my notions of the world such early connections when they are well chosen are amongst the chief advantages of a public education but as i now purpose to send my son upon his travels and in such a manner as i flatter myself will be for his benefit and improvement i hope you will pardon this intrusion when i inform you that the object of it is to solicit your consent that gemellus may accompany him  euphorions countenance whilst this speech was addressed to him underwent a variety of changes surprise at hearing such an unexpected character of his son was strongly expressed a gleam of joy seemed to break out but was soon dispelled by shame and vexation at the reflection of having abandoned him he attempted to speak but confusion choked him he cast a look of embarrassment upon the lawyer but the joy and triumph which his features exhibited appeared to him like insult and he turned his eyes on the ground in silence and despair no one emotion had escaped the observation of gemelluss patron who turning to the lawyer said he believed he need not affect to be ignorant of gemelluss situation and then addressing himself again to euphorion  i can readily understand said he that such a proposal as i have now opened to you however advantageous it might promise to be to your son would not correspond with your ideas in point of expense nor come within the compass of that limited provision which you have thought fit to appoint for him this is a matter of which i have no pretensions to speak you have disposed of your fortune between your sons in the proportions you thought fit and it must be owned a youth who has had a domestic education stands the most in need of a fathers help from the little chance there is of his being able to take care of himself gemellus has talents that must secure his fortune and if my services can assist him they shall never be wanting in the mean time it is very little for me to say that my purse will furnish their joint occasions whilst they are on their travels and gemelluss little fund which is in honest and friendly hands will accumulate in the interim  the length of this speech would have given euphorion time to recollect himself if the matter of it had not presented some unpleasant truths to his reflection which incapacitated him from making a deliberate reply he made a shift however to hammer out some broken sentences and with as good a grace as he could attempted to palliate his neglect of gemellus by pleading his infirm state of health and retirement from the world  he had put him into the hands of his friend who was present and as he best knew what answer to give to the proposal in question he referred his lordship to him and would abide by his decision  he was glad to hear so favorable an account of him  it was far beyond his expectations he hoped his lordships partiality would not be deceived in him and he was thankful for the kind expressions he had thrown out of his future good offices and protection  the noble visitor now desired leave to introduce his son who was waiting in the coach and hoped gemellus might be allowed to pay his duty at the same time this was a surprise upon euphorion which he could not parry and the young friends were immediately ushered in by the exulting lawyer gemellus commanded himself with great address but the fathers look when be first discovered an elegant and manly youth in the bloom of health and comeliness with an open countenance where genius courage and philanthropy were characterized is not to be described it was a mixed expression of shame conviction and repentance nature had her share in it parental love seemed to catch a glance as it were by stealth he was silent and his lips quivered with the suppressed emotions of his heart gemellus approached and made an humble obeisance euphorion stretched forth his hand he seized it between his and reverently pressed it to his lips their meeting was not interrupted by a word and the silence was only broken by my lord who told gemellus in a low voice that his father had consented to his request and he had no longer cause to apprehend a separation from his friend the honest lawyer now could no longer repress his ecstacy but running to gemellus who met his embrace with open arms showered a flood of tears upon his neck and received the tribute of gratitude and affection in return upon his own  when their spirits were a little composed gemellus requested to see his brother a summons was accordingly issued and geminus made his entrance the contrast which this meeting exhibited spoke in stronger terms than language can supply the decided preference of a public and liberal system of education to the narrow maxims of private and domestic tuition on gemelluss part all was candor openness and cordiality he hoped all childish differences were forgiven for his share if he called them to remembrance it was only to regret that he had been so long separated from a brother who was naturally so dear to him for the remainder of their lives he persuaded himself they should be twins in affection as well as in birth on the side of geminus there was some acting and some nature but both were specimens of the worst sort hypocrisy played his part but awkwardly and nature gave a sorry sample of her performances  a few words will suffice to wind up their histories so far at least as they need be explained euphorion died soon after this interview geminus inherited his fortune and upon his very first coming to london was cajoled into a disgraceful marriage with a castoff mistress whom he became acquainted with duped by a profligate and plundered by sharpers he made a miserable waste both of money and reputation and in the event became a pensioner of his brother gemellus with great natural talents improved by education and experience with an excellent nature and a laudable ambition seconded by a very powerful connection soon rose to a distinguished situation in the state where he yet continues to act a conspicuous part to the honor of his country and with no less reputation to himself  no lxiv tantum religio potuit suadere malorum lucretius such cruelties religion could persuade creech i remember to have read an account in a foreign gazette of a dreadful fire which broke out so suddenly in a house where a great many people were assembled that five hundred persons perished miserably in the flames the compiler of this account subjoins at the foot of the above melancholy article that it is with satisfaction he can assure his readers all the above persons were jews  these poor people seem the butt at which all sects and persuasions level their contempt they are sojourners and aliens in every kingdom on earth and yet few have the hospitality to give them a welcome i do not know any good reason why these unhappy wanderers are so treated for they do not intrude upon the labourer or manufacturer they do not burden the state with their poor and here at least they neither till the earth nor work at any craft but content themselves in general to hawk about a few refuse manufactures and buy up a few castoff clothes which no man methinks would envy them the monopoly of  it is to the honor of our nation that we tolerate them in the exercise of their religion for which the inquisition would tie them to a stake and commit them to the flames in some parts of the world the burning of a few makes a festival for all good christians it brings rain and plenty in seasons of drought and famine it makes atonement for the sins of the people and mitigates the wrath of an avenging providence wherever they are obliged to conceal their religion they generally overact their hypocrisy and crowd their houses with saints and virgins whilst crucifixes charms and relics are hung in numbers round their necks the son of jewish parents is brought up in the most rigid exercises of mortification and penance and when the destined moment is in near approach when the parent must impart the dreadful secret of his faith every contrivance is put in practice to disgust and weary him with the laborious functions of their ostensible religion when this preparatory rigor is perceived to take effect and the age of the son is ripe for the occasion the father takes him into the inmost chamber of his house fastens all the doors surveys every avenue with the most mysterious attention and drawing his sword with great solemnity throws himself on his knees at his feet and laying open his breast invites him to thrust the point to his heart  for know my son he cries i am a jew as all my fathers were kill me therefore on the spot or conform to the religion of your ancestors for you are damned as a catholic if knowing what you know you neglect to betray me this as i have reason to believe is no feigned anecdote but a true account of those secret measures which many jewish families to this hour pursue for continuing the practice of their religion and securing themselves from discovery where the consequences would be so fatal  having thus by way of prelude briefly informed my readers what these miserable people are suffering in some countries where they are secretly settled i shall now proceed to lay before them a letter which i have lately received from one of that persuasion complaining of certain indignities and vexations from the humors of our common people which although they are but trifles compared to what i have been describing are nevertheless unbecoming the character of so illuminated and benevolent a nation as we have the honor to belong to  sir i am a man who stick close to my business and am married to a sober industrious woman whom i should be glad now and then to treat with a play which is the only public amusement she has ever expressed a wish to be indulged in but i am really under such difficulties that i dare not carry her thither and at the same time do not like to discover my reasons for it as i should be sorry to give her a dislike to the country she is in  you must know sir i am a jew and probably have that national cast of countenance which a people so separate and unmixt may well be supposed to have the consequence of this is that i no sooner enter a playhouse than i find all eyes turned upon me if this were the worst i would strive to put as good a face upon it as i could but this is sure to be followed up with a thousand scurrilities which i should blush to repeat and which i cannot think of subjecting my wife to hear  as i should really take great pleasure in a good play if i might be permitted to sit it out in peace i have tried every part of the house but the front boxes where i observe such a line of bullies in the back that even if i were a christian i would not venture amongst them but i no sooner put my head into an obscure corner of the gallery than some fellow or other roars out to his comrades  smoke the jew  smoke the cunning little isaac  throw him over says another hand over the smoutch  out with shylock cries a third out with the pound of mans flesh  buckles and buttons spectacles bawls out a fourth  and so on through the whole gallery till i am forced to retire out of the theater amongst hootings and hissings with a shower of rotten apples and chewed oranges vollied at my head when all the offense i have given is an humble offer to be a peaceable spectator jointly with them of the same common amusement  i hope i shall not incur your displeasure if i venture to say this is not very manly treatment in a great and generous people which i always took the english to be i have lodged my property which is not inconsiderable in this country and having no abidingplace on this earth which i could call my own i have made england my choice thinking it the safest asylum that a wanderer and an alien could fly to i hope i have not been mistaken in my opinion of it it has frequently fallen in my way to show some kindnesses to your countrymen in foreign parts and some are yet living who if they would speak the truth must confess that their best friend in life is a jew but of these things i scorn to boast however sir i must own it gave me some pain the other night to find myself very roughly handled by a seafaring fellow whom i remembered well enough in a most piteous condition at algiers where i had the good will to relieve him and set him at liberty with my own money i hope he did not recollect me i say i hope not for the honor of human nature but i am much afraid he did this i am sure would be called ingratitude even in a heathen  i observe with much concern that your great writers of plays take delight in hanging us out to public ridicule and contempt on all occasions if ever they are in search of a rogue an usurer or a buffoon they are sure to make a jew serve the turn i verily believe the odious character of shylock has brought little less persecution upon us poor scattered sons of abraham than the inquisition itself as i am interested to know if this bloodthirsty villain really existed in nature and have no means to satisfy my curiosity but your favor i take the liberty humbly to request that you will tell me how the case truly stands and whether we must of necessity own this shylock also i should be glad to know of which tribe this fellow was for if such a monster did exist i have strong suspicion he will turn out a samaritan as i cannot doubt but a gentleman of your great learning knows all these things correctly i shall wait your answer with the most anxious impatience and pray be particular as to the tribe of judah for if nothing less than half my fortune could oust him there i would pay it down to be rid of such a rascal  your compliance with the above will be the greatest obligation you can confer upon sir  your most devoted humble servant abraham abrahams p s i hope i shall not give offense by adding a postscript to say that if you could persuade one of the gentlemen or ladies who write plays with all of whom i conclude you have great interest to give us poor jews a kind lift in a new comedy i am bold to promise we should not prove ungrateful on a third night  a a     if i had really that interest with my ingenious contemporaries which mr abrahams gives me credit for i would not hesitate to exert it in his service but as i am afraid this is not the case i have taken the only method in my power of being useful to him and have published his letter  as for shylock who is so obnoxious to my correspondent i wish i could prove him the son of a samaritan as clearly as simon magus but i flatter myself the next best thing for his purpose is to prove him the son of a poet and that i will endeavor to do in my very next paper with this further satisfaction to mr abrahams that i do not despair of taking him down a step in his pedigree which for a poetical one is as it now stands of the very first family in the kingdom  as for the vulgar fun of smoking a jew which so prevails amongst us i am persuaded that my countrymen are much too generous and goodnatured to sport with the feelings of a fellow creature if they were once fairly convinced that a jew is their fellow creature and really has fellowfeelings with their own satisfy them in this point and their humanity will do the rest i will therefore hope that nothing more is wanting in behalf of my correspondent who seems a very worthy man than to put the following short questions to his persecutors  has not a jew eyes has not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter as a christian is if you prick them do they not bleed if you tickle them do they not laugh if you poison them do they not die  the man who can give a serious answer to these questions and yet persist in persecuting an unoffending being because he is a jew whatever country he may claim or whatever religion he may profess has the soul of an inquisitor and is fit for nothing else but to feed the fires of an auto da fe  when i turn my thoughts to the past and present situation of this peculiar people i do not see how any christian nation according to the spirit of their religion can refuse admission to the jews who in completion of those very prophecies on which christianity rests are to be scattered and disseminated amongst all people and nations over the face of the earth it seems therefore a thing as inconsistent with the spirit of those prophecies for any one nation to attempt to expel them as it would be to incorporate them  the sin and obduracy of their forefathers are amongst the undoubted records of our gospel but i doubt if this can be a sufficient reason why we should hold them in such general odium through so many ages seeing how naturally the son follows the faith of the father and how much too general a thing it is amongst mankind to profess any particular form of religion that devolves upon them by inheritance rather than by free election and conviction of reason founded upon examination  let me put the case of a man born a jew and settled in a kingdom where the inquisition is in force can he reconcile his natural feelings to a conversion in favor of that church which denounces everlasting damnation against him if he does not betray the secrets of his parents and impeach them to the inquisition for the concealed religion which he knows they practice though they do not profess  if we as christians owe some respect to the jews as the people chosen by god to be the keepers of those prophetic records which announce the coming of the messiah we owe it also to the truth of history to confess that the hope indulged by them that his coming would bring temporal as well as spiritual salvation was general to all the nation their ancient sages had united the military with the prophetic character some had headed their armies all had gone forth with them and even their women had contributed to the downfall of their enemies and oppressors they had been delivered from their egyptian and babylonish thraldom by the arm of god the yoke of rome laid no less heavy on their necks and they regarded their former deliverances as types and forerunners of the greater deliverance to come when the son of god should descend upon earth in the plenitude of his power to rid them from their enemies and oppressors  in place of this glittering but delusive vision they beheld a meek and humble man a teacher of peaceful doctrines who went about preaching forgiveness of injuries and submission to authorities they asked him and the question was a proving one whether he would have them render tribute unto caesar he told them in reply they should render unto caesar the things that were caesars tribute to whom tribute was due mortifying reply extinguishing at once their hopes and their ambition still there was something about him that converted many and staggered all never man spoke as he spoke never man did what he did he had evident power of working miracles the hand of god was with him and the operations of nature were under his control his power was great but was not great to their purposes and therefore they denied that it was derived from god they charged him with being a magician and casting out devils by the aid of the prince of the devils a likely intercourse between the representatives of light and of darkness a notable collusion between heaven and hell if beelzebub was to be charged with conspiring to cast out beelzebub it was at least incumbent on the abettors of the charge to prove that any being endowed with such power could be so devoid of intelligence  conviction and rebuke only rendered them more furious and inveterate despairing at length of employing his power against rome they resolved upon turning the power of rome against him they impeached him before pilate the roman procurator pilate unwillingly at their urgent requisition sentenced him to ignominious execution disavowing in the strongest terms his share in the act and by the figurative exculpation of washing his hands in public view purifying as far as such a ceremony could purify his tribunal from the guilt of spilling innocent blood  can it be a wonder with us at this hour that the jews should persist in avowing their unbelief in the messiah if they admit the evidences of the christian religion do they not become their own accusers and this although it be no reason why a man should shut his eyes against the truth will yet be a motive allowing for the imperfection of human nature why he should not seek for it  no lxv i slightly hinted in my former paper that the jew of venice would not turn out to be the proper offspring of shakespeare and as the researches of his commentators have settled this point so clearly against the legitimacy of shylock i may leave it with the readers judgment to decide whether he formed his drama immediately from the pecorone of fiorentina borrowing the incident of the caskets from boccace or at second hand as some suppose from an old ballad formed upon that story  but i had a further object in the hint i then dropped suggested to me by the perusal of a very curious old novel written by thomas nashe and published in      entitled the unfortunate traveller or the life of jacke wilton the hero is described to be one of the courtpages belonging to henry the eighth and is made to play a number of roguish pranks in the camp of that monarch before tournay he travels to munster in germany where he falls in with john of leyden the famous fanatic and is present at his defeat by the imperialists here he meets lord henry howard earl of surry and accompanies him to venice passing through wittenberg where he has an interview with luther and carlostadius from thence he repairs to rome where he relates a series of strange adventures by which he is thrown into the hands of a jew named zadock physician to pope clement viii and having forfeited his life to him by the law the jew gets the person of jack wilton in limbo with an intent to anatomize him and whilst he is dieting and bleeding him for that purpose the marchioness of mantua the popes mistress spies him out from her balcony and being smitten with his appearance contrives to get him out of zadocks hands by persuading his holiness to banish all the jews from rome and confiscate their effects upon a charge she sets up against them  with this intelligence zadock is accosted by a brother jew called zachary who comes running to him in sackcloth and ashes presently after his goods were confiscated and tells him how he is served and what decree is coming out against them all  i have made an extract of this interview between zadock and zachary which the reader will observe by the date was published before shakespeare wrote his merchant of venice and as the critics seem agreed that he was conversant in other works of nashe it is highly probable that this history of jacke wilton had also been in his hands i do not mean to infer that shakespeare took his character of shylock from this of nashes zadock for there is nothing that can warrant such an inference but i shall submit the following dialogue as an extraordinary specimen of strong empassioned writing which though it will not stand by shakespeares scene between shylock and tubal in dramatic terseness has nevertheless a force of expression that will bear a comparison with that or any other passage in our old dramatic writers  zachary having made his report as above the author thus proceeds to the introduction of his chief speaker  descriptions stand by here is to be expressed the fury of lucifer when he was turned over heavens bar for a wrangler there is a toadfish which taken out of the water swells more than one would think his skin could hold and bursts in his face that touches him so swelled zadock and was ready to burst out of his skin and shoot his bowels like chainshot full in zacharys face for bringing him such baleful tidings his eyes glared and burned blue like brimstone and aqua vitae set on fire in an eggshell his very nose lightened glowworms his teeth cracked and grated together like the joints of a high building rocking like a cradle when as a tempest takes her fullbutt against her broadside he swore and cursed and said  these be they that worship that crucified god of nazareth here is the fruits of their newfound gospel sulphur and gunpowder carry them all quick to gehennah i would spend my soul willingly to have this tripleheaded pope with all his sinabsolved whores and oilgreased priests born like a black saint on the devils backs in procession to the pit of perdition would i might sink presently into the earth so i might blow up this rome this whore of babylon into the air with my breath if i must be banished if these heathen dogs will needs rob me of my goods i will poison their springs and conduitheads whence they receive their water all about the city i will tice all the young children into my house that i can get and cutting their throats barrel them up in powdering beef tubs and so send them to victual the popes galleys ere the officers come to extend i will bestow an hundred pounds on a dole of bread which i will cause to be kneaded with scorpions oil that may kill more than the plague i will hire them that make their wafers or sacramentary gods to mix them after the same sort so in the zeal of their superstitious religion shall they languish and drop like carrion if there be ever a blasphemous conjurer that can call the winds from their brazen caves and make the clouds travel before their time i will give him the other hundred pounds to disturb the heavens a whole week together with thunder and lightning if it be for nothing but to sower all the wines in rome and turn them to vinegar as long as they have either oil or wine this plague feeds but pinchingly upon them  zadock zadock said zachary cutting him off thou threatenest the air whilst we perish here on earth it is the countess juliana the marquis of mantuas wife and no other that has complotted our confusion ask not how but insist on my words and assist in revenge  as how as how said zadock shrugging and shrubbing more happy than the patriarchs were i if crushed to death with the greatest torments romes tyrants have tried there might be quintessenced out of me one quart of precious poison i have a leg with an issue shall i cut it off and from this fount of corruption extract a venom worse than any serpents if thou will i will go to a house that is infected where catching the plague and having got a running sore upon me i will come and deliver her a supplication and breathe upon her when i am perfected with more putrefaction    zadock in conclusion is taken up and executed and the description of his tortures is terrible in the extreme every circumstance attending them is minutely delineated in colors full as strong as the above  i persuade myself the reader will not be displeased if i lay before him one extract more in which he ridicules the affected dress and manners of the traveled gentlemen of his day if we contemplate it as a painting of two hundred years standing i think it must be allowed to be a very curious sketch  what is there in france to be learned more than in england but falsehood in friendship perfect slovenry and to love no man but for my pleasure i have known some that have continued there by the space of half a dozen years and when they come home they have hid a little weerish lean face under a broad french hat kept a terrible coil with the dust in the street in their long cloaks of gray paper and spoken english strangely naught else have they profited by their travel but to distinguish the true bourdeaux grape and know a cup of neat gascoigne wine from wine of orleans yea and peradventure this also to esteem of the p  x as a pimple to wear a velvet patch on their face and walk melancholy with their arms folded  from spain what brings our traveller a scullcrowned hat of the fashion of an old deep porringer a diminutive aldermans rust with short strings like the droppings of a mans nose a closebellied doublet coming down with a peake behind as far as the crupper and cut off before by the breast bone like a partlet or neckercher a wide pair of gascoynes which ungathered would make a couple of womens ridingkirtles huge hangers that have half a cowhide in them a rapier that is lineally descended from half a dozen dukes at the least let his cloak be as long or as short as you will if long it is faced with turkey grogeran ravelled if short it has a cape like a calfs tongue and is not so deep in his whole length nor so much cloth in it i will justify as only the standing cape of a dutchmans cloak i have not yet touched all for he has in either shoe as much taffaty for his tyings as would serve for an ancient which serves him if you would have the mystery of it of the own accord for a shoerag if you talk with him he makes a dishcloth of his own country in comparison of spain but if you urge him particularly wherein it exceeds he can give no instance but in spain they have better bread than any we have when poor hungry slaves they may crumble it into water well enough and make misons with it for they have not a good morsel of meat except it be salt pilchers to eat with it all the year long and which is more they are poor beggars and lie in foul straw every night  italy the paradise of the earth and the epicures heaven how does it form our young master it makes him to kiss his hand like an ape cringe his neck like a starveling and play at heypassrepasscomealoft when he salutes a man from thence he brings the art of atheism the art of epicurizing the art of whoring the art of poisoning the art of sodomitry the only probable good thing they have to keep us from utterly condemning it is that it makes a man an excellent courtier a curious carpetknight which is by interpretation a fine close lecher a glorious hypocrite it is now a privy note amongst the better sort of men when they would set a singular mark or brand on a notorious villain to say he has been in italy  i hope i need not observe that these descriptions are not here quoted for the truth they contain but for the curiosity of them thomas nashe was the bitterest satirist and controversialist of the age he lived in  no lxvi i was some nights ago much entertained with an excellent representation of mr congreves comedy of the double dealer when i reflected upon the youth of the author and the merit of the play i acknowledged the truth of what the late dr samuel johnson says in his life of this poet that amongst all the efforts of early genius which literary history records i doubt whether any one can be produced that more surpasses the common limits of nature than the plays of congreve  the author of this comedy in his dedication informs us that he designed the moral first and to that moral invented the fable and does not know that he has borrowed one hint of it any where  i made the plot says he as strong as i could because it was single and i made it single because i would avoid confusion and was resolved to preserve the three unities of the drama as it is impossible not to give full credit to this assertion i must consider the resemblance which many circumstances in the double dealer bear to those in a comedy of beaumont and fletcher entitled cupids revenge as a casual coincidence and i think the learned biographer above quoted had good reason to pronounce of congreve that he is an original writer who borrowed neither the models of his plot nor the manner of his dialogue  mellafont the nephew and heir of lord touchwood being engaged to cynthia daughter of sir paul pliant the traversing this match forms the object of the plot on which this comedy of the double dealer is constructed the intrigue consists in the various artifices employed by lady touchwood and her agents for that purpose  that the object is as the author himself states it to be singly this will appear upon considering that although the ruin of mellafonts fortune is for a time effected by these contrivances that are employed for traversing his marriage yet it is rather a measure of necessity and selfdefence in lady touchwood than of original design it springs from the artifice of incident and belongs more properly to the intrigue than to the object of the plot  the making or obstructing marriages is the common hinge on which most comic fables are contrived to turn but in this match of mellafonts which the author has taken for the groundwork of his plot i must observe that it would have been better to have given more interest to an event which he has made the main object of the play he has taken little pains to recommend the parties to his spectators or to paint their mutual attachment with any warmth of coloring who will feel any concern whether mellafont marries cynthia or not if they themselves appear indifferent on the occasion and upon the eve of their nuptials converse in the following strain mel you seem thoughtful cynthia   cyn i am thinking though marriage makes man and wife one flesh it leaves them still two fools and they become more conspicuous by setting off one another   mel that is only when two fools meet and their follies are opposed   cyn nay i have known two wits meet and by the opposition of their wit render themselves as ridiculous as fools it is an odd game we are going to play at what think you of drawing stakes and giving over in time   mel no hang it that is not endeavoring to win because it is possible we may lose  etc etc   this scene which proceeds throughout in the same strain seems to confirm dr johnsons remark that congreve formed a peculiar idea of comic excellence which he supposed to consist in gay remarks and unexpected answers  that his scenes exhibit not much of humor imagery or passion his personages are a kind of intellectual gladiators every sentence is toward or strike the contest of smartness is never intermitted and his wit is a meteor playing to and fro with alternate coruscations  there is but one more interview between cynthia and mellafont which is the opening of the fourth act and this is of so flat and insipid a sort as to be with reason omitted in representation i think therefore it may be justly observed that this match for the prevention of which artifices of so virulent and diabolical a nature are practiced by lady touchwood and the double dealer is not pressed upon the feelings of the spectators in so interesting a manner as it should and might have been  having remarked upon the object of the plot i shall next consider the intrigue and for this purpose we must methodically trace the conduct of lady touchwood who is the poets chief engine and that of her underagent maskwell  the scene lies in lord touchwoods house but whether in town or country does not appear sir paul pliant his lady and daughter are naturally brought thither upon the day preceding cynthias marriage to adjust the settlement lord and lady froth careless and brisk are visiters on the occasion mellafont and maskwell are inmates this disposition is as happy as can be devised the incident related by mellafont to careless of the attempt upon him made by lady touchwood artfully prepares us to expect every thing that revenge and passion can suggest for frustrating his happiness and it is judicious to represent mellafont incredulous as to the criminality of maskwells intercourse with lady touchwood for if he had believed it upon carelesss suggestion it would have made his blindness to the character of maskwell not only weak which in fact it is but unnatural and even guilty  maskwell in the first act makes general promises to lady touchwood that he will defeat mellafonts match  you shall possess and ruin him too  the lady presses him to explain particulars he opens no other resource but that of possessing lady pliant with an idea that mellafont is fond of her  she must be thoroughly persuaded that mellafont loves her  so shallow a contrivance as this cannot escape the ladys penetration and she naturally answers  i dont see what you can propose from so trifling a design for her first conversing with mellafont will convince her of the contrary  in fact the authors good sense was well aware how weak this expedient is and it seems applied to no other purpose than as an incident to help on the underplot by bringing forward the comic effect of lady pliants character and that of sir paul maskwell himself is so fairly gravelled by the observation that he confesses he does not depend upon it but he observes that it will prepare something else and gain him leisure to lay a stronger plot if i gain a little time says he i shall not want contrivance  in the second act this design upon lady pliant is played off and maskwell in an interview with mellafont avows the plot and says  to tell you the truth i encouraged it for your diversion he proceeds to say that in order to gain the confidence of lady touchwood he had pretended to have been long secretly in love with cynthia that thereby he had drawn forth the secrets of her heart and that if he accomplished her designs she had engaged to put cynthia with all her fortune into his power he then discloses by soliloquy that his motive for double dealing was founded in his passion for cynthia and observes that the name of rival cuts all ties asunder and is a general acquittance this proceeding is in nature and is good comedy  the third act opens with a scene between lord and lady touchwood which is admirably conceived and executed with great spirit i question if there is any thing of the author superior to this dialogue the design of alarming the jealousy and resentment of lord touchwood now appears to have originated with the lady although maskwell was privy to it and ready for a cue to come in and confirm all had there been occasion he proposes to her to say that he was privy to mellafonts design but that he used his utmost endeavors to dissuade him from it and on the credit he thinks to establish by this proof of his honor and honesty he grounds another plot which he keeps as his ultimate and most secret resource that of cheating her lady touchwood as well as the rest he now reveals to mellafont a criminal assignation with lady touchwood in her chamber at eight and proposes to him to come and surprise them together and then says he it will be hard if you cannot bring her to any conditions  this appears to me to be a very dangerous experiment and scarce within the bounds of nature and probability if maskwell under cover of the proposal had in view nothing more than the introduction of mellafont into lady touchwoods bedchamber there to put them together and then to bring lord touchwood secretly upon them in the moment of their interview his contrivance could not have been better laid for the purpose of confirming the impression which that lord had received against his nephew in which maskwell had nothing more to do than to apprise the lady of his design and she of course could have managed the interview to the purposes of the plot and effectually have completed the ruin of mellafont this it should seem would have answered his object completely for he would have risen upon the ruin of mellafont possessed himself of lord touchwoods favor bound lady touchwood to concealment of his villainy and been as able to lay his train for the possession of cynthia as by any other mode he could choose for obtaining her but if he put it to the issue of a surprise upon lady touchwood when she was not prepared for the management of that surprise what was he to expect from the introduction of lord touchwood but discovery and defeat was it not natural to suppose mellafont would seize the opportunity of reproaching her with her criminality with maskwell it was for that very purpose he brings him thither he tells him it will be hard if he cannot then bring her to any conditions  and if this was to pass under the terror of his reproaches how could maskwell set lord touchwood upon listening to their conversation and not apprehend for a consequence apparently so unavoidable he puts every thing to risque by proposing to mellafont to conceal himself in lady touchwoods bedchamber whilst she is in the closet he then meets lord touchwood appoints him to come to the lobby by the bedchamber in a quarter of an hours time he keeps his assignation with the lady mellafont starts from his hiding place and maskwell escapes but soon returns secretly introducing lord touchwood to listen to the dialogue between his lady and nephew she accidentally discovers him without his being seen by mellafont and turns that accidental discovery against mellafont what a combination of improbabilities is here fortuitously thrown together to produce this lucky incident could maskwell reasonably presume upon a chance so beyond expectation every thing is made to turn upon the precarious point of a minute if lord touchwood who was appointed for a quarter of an hour had anticipated that appointment if lady touchwood had been less punctual to her assignation if mellafont had happened to have dropped one word in his uncles hearing charging her with his discovery as had been agreed or if either she had happened not to have seen lord touchwood of mellafont had seen him in short if any one thing had turned up which ought to have come to pass or otherwise than it was made to come to pass by the greatest violence to probability maskwell was inevitably undone it must be owned he laid a train for his own destruction but stage incident rescued him and this with the ladys adroitness effaces the improbability when it passes in representation and keeps nature out of sight had mellafont told the plain story to his uncle after lady touchwood had so unexpectedly turned it against him it would at least have put the plot to risque and of this the author seems so conscious that he does not suffer him to attempt a single word in his defense to save his villain he is compelled to sacrifice his hero  it is not sufficient to say that a poet has his characters in his power and can fashion incidents according to his own discretion he must do no violence to nature and probability for the purposes of his plot  maskwell having in this manner escaped with success begins next to put in execution his plot for obtaining cynthia and this constitutes the intrigue and catastrophe of the fifth act his plan is as follows  having imparted to lord touchwood his love for cynthia by the vehicle of a soliloquy which is to be overheard by his lordship he proposes to himself to carry off cynthia to st albans with the chaplain in the coach there to be married this she is to be trepanned into by persuading her that the chaplain is mellafont and mellafont is brought to cooperate by a promise that he shall elope with cynthia under that disguise and that the chaplain shall be made to follow on the day after and then marry him to cynthia with this view mellafont is appointed to meet maskwell in one chamber and cynthia in another the real chaplain is to be passed upon the lady for mellafont and mellafont is to be left in the lurch this plot upon cynthia maskwell confides to lord touchwood telling him there is no other way to possess himself of her but by surprise  though the author undoubtedly meant his villain should in the end outwit himself yet he did not mean him to attempt impossibilities and the absurdities of this contrivance are so many that i know not which to mention first how was maskwell to possess himself of cynthia by this scheme by what force or fraud is he to accomplish the object of marrying her we must conclude he was not quite so desperate as to sacrifice all his hopes from lord touchwood by any violence upon her person there is nothing in his character to warrant the conjecture it is no less unaccountable how mellafont could be caught by this project and induced to equip himself in the chaplains gown to run off with a lady who had pledged herself to him never to marry any other man there was no want of consent on her part a reconciliation with lord touchwood was the only object he had to look to and how was that to be effected by this elopement with cynthia  the jealousy of lady touchwood was another rock on which maskwell was sure to split it would have been natural for him to have provided against this danger by binding my lord to secrecy and the ladys pride of family was a ready plea for that purpose when he was talking to himself for the purpose of being overheard by lord touchwood he had nothing to do but to throw in this observation amongst the rest to bar that point against discovery  the reader will not suppose i would suggest a plan of operation for the double dealer to secure him against discovery i am only for adding probability and common precaution to his projects i allow that it is in character for him to grow wanton with success there is a moral in a villain outwitting himself but the catastrophe would in my opinion have been far more brilliant if his schemes had broke up with more force of contrivance laid as they are they melt away and dissolve by their own weakness and inconsistency lord and lady touchwood careless and cynthia all join in the discovery every one but mellafont sees through the plot and he is blindness itself  mr congreve in his dedication above mentioned defends himself against the objection to soliloquies but i conceive he is more open to criticism for the frequent use he makes of listening lord touchwood three times has recourse to this expedient  of the characters in this comedy lady touchwood though of an unfavourable cast seems to have been the chief care of the poet and is well preserved throughout her elevation of tone nearly approaching to the tragic affords a strong relief to the lighter sketches of the episodical persons sir paul and lady pliant lord and lady froth who are highly entertaining but much more loose than the stage in its present state of reformation would endure nothing more can be said of careless and brisk than that they are the young men of the theater at the time when they were in representation of maskwell enough has been said in these remarks nor need any thing be added to what has been already observed upon mellafont and cynthia as for the moral of the play which the author says he designed in the first place and then applied the fable to it it should seem to have been his principal object in the formation of the comedy and yet it is not made to reach several characters of very libertine principles who are left to reform themselves at leisure and the plot though subordinate to the moral seems to have drawn him off from executing his good intentions so completely as those professions may be understood to engage for  no lxvii ulcera animi sananda magis quam corporis ex sentent can thou not minister to a mind diseased macbeth it seems as if most of the ancient writers of history thought no events worth recording to posterity but accounts of battles and sieges and the overthrow of empires as if men were to be celebrated only in proportion to the devastation they had made of the human species as my respect on the contrary is directed chiefly to those peaceable characters who have been the benefactors of mankind it is with pleasure i discovered an anecdote of an ancient king of egypt of this description named osymanduas this good prince amongst other praiseworthy actions has the credit of making the first public library in that learned nation before books were collected at athens by pisistratus osymanduas made no scruple to convert one of the chief temples to this generous use and gave it in charge to the priests belonging to it to digest and arrange his collection when this was done he laid it open to the public and by a very apposite and ingenious device which he caused to be inscribed upon the front of the edifice invited all his subjects to enter in and partake of his benefaction he considered it as the duty of a good king to provide against the mental as well as bodily ailments of his people it appeared to him that books were the best medicines for the mind of man and consequently that a collection of books such as his library contained might well be entitled a magazine or warehouse of medicines for the mind with this idea he directed the following words to be engraved over the door of his library in conspicuous characters   there is a beautiful simplicity in the thought which seems to give an insight into the benevolent design of the donor and as i hold it a more noble office to preserve the mind in health than to keep the body after death from corruption i cannot hesitate to give osymanduas more credit for this benefaction of a library than if he had been foder of the pyramids  as the distempers of the mind may be figuratively classed under the several characters of those maladies which are incidental to the body so the several descriptions of books may very well be sorted into the various genera of medicines which practice has applied to those respective distempers a library thus pharmaceutically disposed would have the appearance of a dispensatory and might be properly enough so called and when i recollect how many of our eminent collectors of books have been of the medical faculty i cannot but think it probable that those great benefactors to literature ratcliffe mead sloane hunter and others have had this very idea of osymanduas in their minds when they founded their libraries if therefore it should be thought agreeable to the will of the donors and a proper mark of respect to their memories so to arrange their collections now in the repositories of oxford and the british museum it will be necessary to find out a different set of titles and instead of sorting them as they now are into the compartments of the historians the poets the divines it will be right to set up new inscriptions in their places and entitle them the alteratives the stimulatives the narcotics i need not point out to the learned keepers of these libraries how to proceed in an arrangement to which their own judgments are so fully competent nothing more will be required of them but to ascertain the particular species of disease which the mind of the patient is affected with and send him forthwith to the proper class of authors for his cure  for instance if the complaint arises from cold humors and a want of free perspiration by a stoppage and constipation of the pores of the mind by which the feelings are rendered inert and deprived of that proper emanation and expansion which the health of the soul requires let such an one be shut into the warm bath of the sudorifics which i need not explain to be the satyrists and they will soon open his pores and disperse all obstructions if the mental disease be of the inflammatory and feverish sort attended with fits and paroxysms of anger envy revenge and other atrabilious symptoms which cannot be mistaken it will be proper to turn the patient into the cell of the moralists who will naturally be found under the title of the coolers and sedatives on the contrary where the complaint is of the lethargic nature in which irritation is necessary the controversialists will furnish him a remedy in short we need only say that when the several authors are properly arranged every case may find its cure the comic writers will act as carminatives to dispel the vapors books of travels as cathartics to procure a motion memoirs and novels will operate as provocatives politics as corrosives and panegyrics as emetics two compartments should be kept apart and specially distinguished viz the sacred writings under the title of restoratives and the works of the infidels under the denominations of deadly poisons the former will be sovereign in all galloping consumptions of dissipation and the latter will be resorted to by none but suicides and desperadoes  i should now dismiss the subject but that i had forgotten to speak of the essayists who from their miscellaneous properties certainly come under the class of compounds and cannot therefore be so precisely specified as they are applicable to chronic diseases rather than acute ones they may very well stand in the list of correctors which taken in a regular course and under proper regimen are found very efficacious in all cases where the constitution is impaired by excess and bad habits of living they seem most to resemble those medicinal springs which are impregnated with a variety of properties and when critically analyzed are found to contain salt nitre steel sulphur chalk and other calcareous particles when the more respectable names of bath spa pyrmont seltzer and others are disposed of i am not without hopes these humbler essays which my candid readers are now in the course of taking may be found to have the wholesome properties of tunbridge waters  it is supposed that this library of the venerable osymanduas descended to the ptolemies augmented probably by the intermediate monarchs and ultimately brought to perfection by the learned and munificent philadelphus son of ptolemy lagus so well known for his greek translation of the hebrew septuagint  little attention was paid to literature by the romans in the early and more martial ages i read of no collections antecedent to those made by aemilius paulus and lucullus the latter of whom being a man of great magnificence allowed the learned men of his time to have free access to his library but neither in his life time nor at his death made it public property cornelius sylla before his dictatorship plundered athens of a great collection of books which had been accumulating from the time of the tyranny and these he brought to rome but did not build or endow any library for public use this was at last undertaken by julius caesar upon an imperial scale not long before his death and the learned m varro was employed to collect and arrange the books for the foundation of an ample library its completion which was interrupted by the death of julius and the civil wars subsequent thereto was left for augustus who assigned a fund out of the dalmatian booty for this purpose which he put into the hands of the celebrated asinius pollio who therewith founded a temple to liberty on mount aventine and with the help of syllas and varros collections in addition to his own purchases opened the first public library in rome in an apartment annexed to the temple above mentioned two others were afterward instituted by the same emperor which he called the octavian and palatine libraries the first so named in honor of his sister was placed in the temple of juno the latter as its title specifies was in the imperial palace these libraries were royally endowed with establishments of greek and latin librarians of which c julius hyginus the grammarian was one  the emperor tiberius added another library to the palace and attached his new building to that front which looked toward the via sacra in which quarter he himself resided vespasian endowed a public library in the temple of peace trajan founded the famous ulpian library in his new forum from whence it was at last removed to the collis viminalis to furnish the baths of dioclesian the capitoline library is supposed to have been founded by domitian and was consumed together with the noble edifice to which it was attached by a stroke of lightning in the time of commodus the emperor hadrian enriched his favorite villa with a superb collection of books and lodged them in a temple dedicated to hercules these were in succeeding times so multiplied by the munificence and emulation of the several emperors that in the reign of constantine rome contained no less than twentynine public libraries of which the principal were the palatine and ulpian  though books were then collected at an immense expense several private citizens of fortune made considerable libraries tyrannio the grammarian even in the time of sylla was possessed of three thousand volumes epaphroditus a grammarian also had in later times collected thirty thousand of the most select and valuable books but sammonicus serenus bequeathed to the emperor gordian a library containing no less than sixtytwo thousand volumes it was not always a love of literature that tempted people to these expenses for seneca complains of the vanity of the age in furnishing their banqueting rooms with books not for use but for show and in a mere spirit of profusion their baths both hot and cold were always supplied with books to fill up an idle hour amongst the other recreations of the place in like manner their country houses and even public offices were provided for the use and amusement of their guests or clients  the roman libraries in point of disposition much resembled the present fashion observed in our public ones for the books were not placed against the walls but brought into the area of the room in separate cells and compartments where they were lodged in presses the intervals between these compartments were richly ornamented with inlaid plates of glass and ivory and marble bassorelievos in these compartments which were furnished with desks and couches for the accommodation of readers it was usual to place the statues of learned men one in each and this we may observe is one of the few elegancies which rome was not indebted to greece for the first idea having been started by the accomplished pollio who in his library on mount aventine set up the statue of his illustrious contemporary varro even whilst he was living it was usual also to ornament the press where any considerable authors works were contained with his figure in brass or plaster of a small size  there is one more circumstance attending these public libraries which ought not to be omitted as it marks the liberal spirit of their institution it was usual to appropriate an adjoining building for the use and accommodation of students where every thing was furnished at the emperors cost they were lodged dieted and attended by servants specially appointed and supplied with every thing under the eye of the chief librarian that could be wanting whilst they were engaged in their studies and had occasion to consult the books this establishment was kept up in a very princely style at alexandria in particular where a college was endowed and a special fund appointed for its support with a president and proper officers under him for the entertainment of learned strangers who resorted thither from various parts to consult those invaluable collections which that famous library contained in all branches of science  no lxviii people have a custom of excusing the enormities of their conduct by talking of their passions as if they were under the control of a blind necessity and sinned because they could not help it before any man resorts to this kind of excuse it behooves him to examine the justice of it and to be sure that these passions which he thus attempts to palliate are strictly natural and do not spring either from the neglect of education or the crime of selfindulgence  of our infancy properly so called we either remember nothing or few things faintly and imperfectly some passions however make their appearance in this stage of human life and appear to be born with us others are born after us some follow us to the grave others forsake us in the decline of age  the life of man is to be reviewed under three periods infancy youth and manhood the first includes that portion of time before reason shows itself in the second it appears indeed but being incompetent to the proper government of the creature requires the aid support and correction of education in the third it attains to its maturity  now as a persons responsibility bears respect to his reason so do human punishments bear respect to his responsibility infants and boys are chastised by the hand of the parent or the master rational adults are amenable to the laws and what is termed mischief in the first case becomes a crime in the other it will not avail the man to plead loss of reason by temporary intoxication nor can he excuse himself by the plea of any sudden impulse of passion if a prisoner tells his judge that it is his nature to be cruel that anger lust or malice are inherent in his constitution no human tribunal will admit the defense yet thus it is that all people deal with god and the world when they attempt to palliate their enormities by pleading the uncontrollable propensity of their natural desires as if the creator had set up a tyrant in their hearts which they were necessitated to obey  this miserable subterfuge is no less abject than impious for what can be more degrading to a being whose inherent attribute is freeagency and whose distinguishing faculty is reason than to shelter himself from the dread of responsibility under the humiliating apology of mental slavery it is as if he should say  excuse the irregularities of my conduct for i am a brute and not a man i follow instinct and renounce all claim to reason my actions govern me not i my actions  and yet the people to whom i allude generally set up this plea in excuse for those passions in particular which have their origin in that stage of life when the human mind is in the use and possession of reason an imposition so glaring that it convicts itself notwithstanding this it is too often seen that whilst the sensualist is avowing the irresistible violence of his propensities vanity shall receive it not only as an atonement for the basest attempts but as an expected tribute to the tempting charms of beauty nay such is the perversion of principle in some men that it shall pass with them as a recommendation even of that sex the purity of whose minds should be their sovereign grace and ornament  the passion of fear seems coaeval with our nature if they who have our infancy in charge suffer this passion to fix and increase upon us if they augment our infant fears by invented terrors and present to our sight frightful objects to scare us if they practice on our natural and defenseless timidity by blows and menaces and crush us into absolute subjection of spirit in our early years a human creature thus abused has enough to plead in excuse for cowardice and yet this which is the strongest defense we can make upon the impulse of passion is perhaps the only one we never resort to in most other passions we call that constitution which is only habit  when we reflect upon the variety of passions to which the human mind is liable it should seem as if reason which is expressly implanted in us for their correction and control was greatly overmatched by such a host of turbulent insurgents but upon a closer examination we may find that reason has many aids and allies and though her antagonists are also many and mighty yet that they are divided and distracted whilst she can in all cases turn one passion against another so as to counterbalance any power by its opposite and make evil instruments in her hands conducive to moral ends avarice for instance will act as a counterpoise to lust and intemperance whilst vanity on the other hand will check avarice fear will keep a bad man honest and pride will sometimes make a coward brave  observe the manners of palpatius in company with his patron assiduous humble obliging for ever smiling and so supple and obsequious you would think he had no will of his own and was born for the uses and occasions of others follow palpatius to his house see him with his wife and children hear him dictate to his servants and the needy dependants who make suit through him to his principal you will find all things reversed the sycophant turns out a tyrant and he is only indebted to his hypocrisy for keeping his insolence out of sight  frocax is one of the most dissolute men living he is handsome impudent and insinuating qualifications that ensure his success with the ladies he professed the most vehement passion for fulvia but fulvia was on the point of marrying vetulus a rich old man who wanted an heir and till that event took place she held out against procax upon motives of convenience only fulvia soon became the wife of vetulus she had no longer any repugnance to be the mistress of procax but the same man who had pleaded the irresistible violence of his desires before marriage now pretended conscience and drew back from her advances nay he did more he put vetulus upon his guard and fulvias virtue was too closely watched to be in any future danger what sudden change was this in procax vetulus had no heirs and procax had a contingent interest in the entail of his estate  splendida in one of her morning airings was solicited for charity by a poor woman with an infant in her arms  it is not for myself madam said the wretched creature it is for my husband who lies under that hedge tormented with a fever and dying for want of relief  splendida directed her eyes toward the spot and saw a sickly object stretched upon the ground clad in the tattered regimental of a foot soldier her heart was touched and she drew out her purse which was full of guineas the blood rushed into the beggars meagre visage at the sight splendida turned over the gold her hand delayed for a moment and the impulse was lost unhappily for the suppliant splendida was alone and without a witness she put her hand once more into her pocket and taking out a solitary shilling dropped it into the shrivelled palm that was streched out to receive it and drove on splendida returned home dressed herself and went to a certain great ladys assembly a subscription was put about for the benefit of a celebrated actress the lady condescended to receive subscriptions in person and delivered a ticket to each contributor splendida drew forth the same purse and wrapping twenty guineas in a paper put them into the hand of the noble beggar the room rang with applauses of her charity  i give it says she to her virtues rather than to her talents i bestow it on the wife and mother not upon the actress splendida on her return home took out her accomptbook and set down twentyone pounds one shilling to the article of charity the shilling indeed heaven audited on the score of alms the pounds were posted to the account of vanity  no lxix favete linguis horat an ingenious author who some years ago published a volume under the title of maxims characters and reflections has the following remark  you would know how a man talks to judge of his understanding and yet possibly however great the paradox the very contrary method might be less fallible the knowing how he hears might show it you much better as i had not seen this book when i gave my account of mr jedediah fishs academy for hearing it gave me great pleasure to fall in with the sentiment of a contemporary who whilst he mixes with the world as a man of fashion reviews the living manners with the sagacity of a philosopher i transcribed the whole article from which the above passage is extracted and sent it to mr fish it will be found in the authors volume no lxxi and is aptly illustrated by two sketches of character one of which called cleon is a talker and theocles the other is a hearer  i have been favored with the following answer from mr fish  sir yours is received i approve of the extract and like the authors manner well he deals in ideas rather than in words some men talk more than they hear others write more than they read as benevolence should act without display so good advice should be given in few words  i send you the following cases according to desire  a young man known to his familiars by the name of jack chatter came under my hands the symptoms of his disorder may be thus described  garrulitas vix intermissa cum cachinno tantum non continuo  garrulity attended with immoderate fits of laughing is no uncommon case when the provocation thereunto springs from jokes of a mans own making but there was this peculiarity in mr chatters disease that he would laugh where no jest was or even at the jests of other people rather than not laugh at all i soon perceived this to be occasioned by exceedingly weak intellects and an even row of very white teeth as his malady would not yield to the ordinary prescriptions i was forced to throw him into a regimen of skating for which the season was then favorable the operation succeeded to my warmest wishes and the patient was effectually silenced by a happy dislocation of two of his foreteeth from a fall on the ice  miss kitty scandal was put into my hands by her acquaintance in a very deplorable condition it was the cacoethes defamationis scabiosum the common antidotes had no effect upon her i administered detergents out of miss carters epictetus and mrs chapones letters but the dose would not stay upon her stomach i tried the pythagorean pill but with no better success as the patient had a remarkable swelling about the waist which i conceived might arise from an overflowing of the spleen i called in my excellent friend dr ford the doctor delivered her of her swelling and miss kitty scandal has not been known to open her lips since  tom belfry was the nuisance of society he applied to me when he was far gone indeed he had been blackballed by half the clubs in town and sent to coventry by the other half i examined his case and found it under the following class  vox stentoria sempiterna cum cerebello vacuo necnon auribus obtusis admodum ac inertibus  as his organs of speech seemed in want of immediate modulation i tried the pitchpipe upon him repeatedly but the vehemence of his complaint baffled all my efforts i could never bring him down within a full octave of sound health i was unwilling to proceed to extremities till i had done all that my more regular practice could suggest for his relief but when i found none but desperate remedies could save him i caused a vein to be opened in his right arm and drew out fourteen ounces of blood this was in the month of march last and the wind was then in the east with sleet and rain i immediately ordered the patient to take boat at blackfriars and be rowed to chelseareach and back again in an open wherry the expected consequence ensued a total deprivation of voice took place and mr belfry being no longer able to articulate is become a very companiable man and is now in as much request with his club as heretofore he was in disgrace with it  counselor clack is a young man of quick parts ready wit and strong imagination but sorely troubled with the disease called lingua volubilis cum sui ipsius amore nimio et praegravante  this patient was radically cured by a strong dose of his own praises which i took from his mouth and made him swallow grain for grain as he had uttered them the nausea occasioned by this dose operated so strongly on his constitution as totally to eradicate all seeds of selfconsequence and the counselor is become one of the modestest men and best hearers in his profession  captain swagger was continually talking of battles and fieges and campaigns though he had never seen either he arraigned the conduct of every enterprise and proved to demonstration by the force of oaths how much better it would have been managed had he been the commander the symptoms were too apparent to be mistaken  os grandiloquum rotundum cum dextra bello frigida  in this state of his disorder he was recommended to my care by the officers of his mess i found the tumefaction so vehement that i prescribed an opening by incision the captain was accordingly sent out by his commanding officer upon a scoutingparty and suffered a surprise which effectually repelled the tumefaction mr swagger threw up his commission and has been a very silent member of the civil community ever since  i have sent you these cases out of many as being peculiar in common cases the general method i take to bring any gentleman to a patient hearing is to entertain him with his own commendations if this simple medicine will not serve i am forced to dash it with a few drops of slander which is the best appeaser i know for many of my patients will listen to that when nothing else can silence them this recipe however is not palatable nor ought it to be used but with caution and discretion i keep it therefore in reserve like laudanum for special occasions when a patient is far advanced toward his cure i take him with me to the gallery of the house of commons when certain orators whom i have in my eye are upon their legs to harangue and i have always found if a convalescent can hear that he can hear any thing  i am sir yours to command jedediah fish   i am not so partial to my correspondent as to defend him in all his proceedings and i suspect that whilst he is laboring to restore his patients to their ears he may chance to take away their lives men who act upon system are apt to strain it too far and as prevention is always to be preferred to remedy i could wish that parents would take early care to instruct their children in the art of hearing if it were only to guard them against falling into mr fishs hands when the malady may become stubborn  i shall suggest one hint in the way of advice to fathers and mothers which if they are pleased to attend to it may perhaps save some future trouble and vexation  i would wish all parents to believe that the human character begins to fix itself much earlier in life than they are generally aware of there is something very captivating in the dawning ideas of our children we are apt to flatter and caress them for their early vivacity we tell their smart sayings and repartees with a kind of triumph even in their presence and the company we tell them to are always polite enough to applaud and admire them by these means we instill our own vanity into their infant minds and push their genius into prematurity the forwardness which this practice of ours is sure to create passes off agreeably for a time but when infancy ceases it begins to annoy us and miss or master appear insupportably pert the parent then finds himself obliged to turn the other side of his countenance upon the witticisms of his child this is not only a painful task but probably a fruitless one for the child by this time has made its party and can find its admirers elsewhere every obliging visitor makes interest with the clever little creature the nursery the kitchen the stables echo with applause it can chatter or mimic or act its tricks before the servants and be sure of an audience the mischief is done and the parent may snub to no purpose  let parents therefore first correct themselves before they undertake that office for their children education is incompatible with selfindulgence and the impulse of vanity is too often mistaken for the impulse of nature when miss is a wit i am apt to suspect that her mother is not overwise  no lxx  mutato nomine de te fabula narratur  horat  the story slily points at you  pride is never more offensive than when it condescends to be civil whereas vanity whenever it forgets itself naturally assumes good humor nothing was ever more agreeable than vanessa the other night when i found her in a small circle over her fireside where a certain gentleman had taken the whole task of talking on himself and left vanessa nothing else to do but to show him just as much attention as served to make him believe she was listening and left her at liberty to rest her own imagination in the meantime  i found this gentleman at the close of a pathetic narrative he had been giving of some adventure which he had met with in his travels and which he wound up with saying  i am afraid ladies this story has made you melancholy if he had said weary he had been nearer to the truth methought vanessa once in her life forgot her usual politeness when she answered him  oh no not at all  but she was thinking of something else and the story i should guess had been very circumstantial so that i heartily forgave her the talking gentleman however was not disposed to take her word but stuck to his opinion and had so much consideration for the company as to promise them another story which should be altogether as diverting as the former one had been mournful there was an effort in the countenance of vanessa which convinced me of her good humor she strove to welcome this promise with a smile but it was a smile that cost her some pains to produce and if the talker had possessed but one grain of intuition he must have discovered that all such promises out up performance and that no story will endure a preface i felt at that moment all the awkward embarrassment of his situation as if it had been my own and it was a sensible relief to me when vanessa gave a little hitch to her chair as if drawing nearer to the storyteller and at the same time stooping forward put herself into a listening attitude she never appeared so amiable in my eyes and i began to take heart  what pains and trouble thought i does this poor man take to make himself agreeable when every struggle carries him further from his point and how little does he know what an easy thing it is to those who have the secret of succeeding without any effort at all  i use almost the very words of a contemporary author and i am obliged to him for them  as for the story which now followed there is no occasion to repeat it if it had made its entrance without a herald if it had grown out of the conversation naturally and not been grafted in against nature and if it had been less prolix or told with more point the story had not been amiss it was a good one in its own country but it was lamed in its journey and vanessa did not seem exactly to know when it was finished until the relater made a second apostrophe hoping he had now repaired all former damages and reinstated the ladies in their usual good spirits vanessa now found it necessary to say something and well knowing without doubt that people like to be treated as if they had sensibility although they have none she passed a few compliments upon the story very neatly turned when an elderly gentleman who as i afterward found out was father to the talking gentleman observed to him that as he had made us grave and made us merry nothing now remained but to make us wise  and who so fit for that purpose added he as the lady of the house herself vanessa very aptly replied that she knew but one way to impose that belief on the company and that was by keeping silence  and what is so edifying resumed he as to keep silence what is so good a lesson of wisdom as to see one who can talk so well forbear to do it until other tongues have run their course  i stole a glance at the talkative gentleman and to my utter surprise he was so far from being sensible of the rebuff that he was actually preparing for another onset  what you remark upon silence cried he puts me in mind of an admirable story  that may well be answered the old gentleman but give me leave first to tell you a story that may put you in mind of silence  jupiter and apollo came down from olympus upon a visit to king midas mercury had been dispatched to apprise him of the guests he was to entertain and to signify to him that it was the pleasure of the gods to be received with no extraordinary honors but to be considered only as travelers who came to pay a visit to his court and take a view of his capital on the day appointed jupiter in the person of an elderly athenian gentleman and apollo as his son presented themselves in the great saloon of the palace midas surrounded by his courtiers and glittering in his richest robes received the gods habited in this simple attire and unattended the injunctions of mercury were neglected for the feast was the most sumptuous that art and luxury could devise and the gods were disgusted with the vanity of their host and the profusion of his entertainment when midas had thus contrived to display the wealth and splendour of his court to his celestial guests his next study was to impress them with an opinion of his talents and accomplishments he discoursed to jupiter without ceasing upon his maxims and rules of government he treated him with innumerable anecdotes and events calculated to set off his own wisdom consequence and good policy and of every tale he made himself the hero the courtiers kept silence through fear the deities through contempt no voice was heard but the voice of midas he had not the sense to discern the impropriety of his being an incessant talker when he ought only to have been a respectful hearer and so consummate was his vanity that having possessed jupiter with impressions as he foolishly imagined of his wisdom and science he flattered himself nothing was wanting but to recommend himself to apollo by a specimen of his accomplishments in music and poetry a band of minstrels were summoned who performed a kind of prelude on their harps by way of flourish before the masterartist began when midas starting from his seat as if with sudden inspiration seized his lyre and struck up a strain which he accompanied with his voice whilst his selfconceit inspired him to believe he could rival apollo himself in harmony and even provoke him to envy  as soon as midas laid down his lyre the gods rose up to depart when instead of those applauses which he looked for and expected as a tribute due to his art even from the immortals themselves jupiter turning toward him with a frown which brought into his countenance the inherent majesty of the thunderer thus accosted him  had you entertained us o midas in the manner i prescribed and met the condescension of the gods with the modesty that becomes a mortal we had left a blessing with our host instead of a reproof but when you affected to dazzle me who am myself the dispenser of all mortal seize with the vain display of your wealth and wisdom and when you rashly assailed the ears of apollo himself who presides over music and poetry with the barbarous jingle of your lyre and the hoarse untuneable dissonance of your voice you foolishly forgot both yourself and us and by talking and singing without intermission when you should rather have listened to us with attention you reverse the application of those faculties i have bestowed upon you not considering that when i gave to man two organs of hearing and only one of speech i marked out the use he was to make of those dispensations to remind you therefore of my design and your duty i shall curtail your tongue and lengthen your ears  jupiter ceased speaking and whilst the deities reascended to olympus the ears of the monarch sprouted up into the ears of an ass    the moral of the fable and the personal application of it were too obvious to be mistaken by any of the company vanessas sensibility suffered visibly on the occasion but she soon broke the painful silence and addressing herself to the old gentleman  i am obliged to you for your fable says she and shall edify by the moral but still i cannot help the weakness of a woman and must feel a compassion for poor midas whose trespass being of a goodhumoured sort deserved more mercy than it met with  i confess the art of being agreeable frequently miscarries through the ambition which accompanies it wit learning wisdom  what can more effectually conduce to the profit and delight of society yet i am sensible that a man may be too invariably wise learned or witty to be agreeable and i take the reason of this to be that pleasure cannot be bestowed by the simple and unmixed exertion of any one faculty or accomplishment if every word a man speaks is to be wit or wisdom if he is never to relax either in look or utterance from his superiority of character society cannot endure it the happy gift of being agreeable seems to consist not in one but in an assemblage of talents tending to communicate delight and how many are there who by easy manners sweetness of temper and a variety of other undefinable qualities possess the power of pleasing without any visible effort without the aids of wit wisdom or learning nay as it should seem in their defiance and this without appearing even to know that they possess it whilst another by laboring to entertain us too well entertains us as poor midas did his visitors  when vanessa had done speaking the hour reminded me that i ought to take my leave which i did with regret repeating to myself as i walked homewards  this lady should never be seen in a circle  no lxxi as i was turning over a parcel of old papers some time ago i discovered an original letter from mr caswell the mathematician to the learned dr bentley when he was living in bishop stillingfleets family enclosing an account of an apparition taken from the mouth of a clergyman who saw it in this account there are some curious particulars and i shall therefore copy the whole narrative without any omission except of the name of the deceased person who is supposed to have appeared for reasons that will be obvious  to the rev mr richard bentley at my lord bishop of worcesters house in park street in westminster london sir when i was in london april last i fully intended to have waited upon you again as i said but a cold and lameness seized me next day the cold took away my voice and the other my power of walking so i presently took coach for oxford i am much your debtor and in particular for your good intentions in relation to mr d though that as it has proved would not have turned to my advantage however i am obliged to you upon that and other accounts and if i had opportunity to show it you should find how much i am your faithful servant  i have sent you enclosed a relation of an apparition the story i had from two persons who each had it from the author and yet their accounts somewhat varied and passing through more mouths has varied much more therefore i got a friend to bring me to the author at a chamber where i wrote it down from the authors mouth after which i read it to him and gave him another copy he said he could swear to the truth of it as far as he is concerned he is the curate of warblington batchelour of arts of trinity college in oxford about six years standing in the university i hear no ill report of his behavior here he is now gone to his curacy he has promised to send up the hands of the tenant and his man who is a smith by trade and the farmers men as far as they are concerned mr brereton the rector would have him say nothing of the story for that he can get no tenant though he has offered the house for ten pounds a year less mr p the former incumbent whom the apparition represented was a man of a very ill report supposed to have got children of his maid and to have murdered them but i advised the curate to say nothing himself of this last part of p but leave that to the parishioners who knew him those who knew this p say he had exactly such a gown and that he used to whistle  yours j caswell i desire you not to suffer any copy of this to be taken lest some mercury newsteller should print it till the curate has sent up the testimony of others and self  h h dec            narrative at warblington near havant in hampshire within six miles of portsmouth in the parsonage house dwelt thomas perce the tenant with his wife and a child a manservant thomas and a maidservant about the beginning of august anno      on a monday about nine or ten at night all being gone to bed except the maid with the child the maid being in the kitchen and having raked up the fire took a candle in one hand and the child in the other arm and turning about saw one in a black gown walking through the room and thence out of the door into the orchard upon this the maid hasting up stairs having recovered but two steps cried out on which the master and mistress ran down found the candle in her hand she grasping the child about its neck with the other arm she told them the reason of her crying out she would not that night tarry in the house but removed to another belonging to one henry salter farmer where she cried out all the night from the terror she was in and she could not be persuaded to go any more to the house upon any terms  on the morrow i e tuesday the tenants wife came to me lodging then at havant to desire my advice and have consult with some friends about it i told her i thought it was a flam and that they had a mind to abuse mr brereton the rector whose house it was she desired me to come up i told her i would come up and sit up or lie there as she pleased for then as to all stories of ghosts and apparitions i was an infidel i went thither and sat up the tuesday night with the tenant and his manservant about twelve or one oclock i searched all the rooms in the house to see if any body were hid there to impose upon me at last we came into a lumberroom there i smiling told the tenant that was with me that i would call for the apparition if there was any and oblige him to come the tenant then seemed to be afraid but i told him i would defend him from harm and then i repeated barbara celarent darii etc jestingly on this the tenants countenance changed so that he was ready to drop down with fear then i told him i perceived he was afraid and i would prevent its coming and repeated baralipton etc then he recovered his spirits pretty well and we left the room and went down into the kitchen where we were before and sat up there the remaining part of the night and had no manner of disturbance  thursday night the tenant and i lay together in one room and the man in another room and he saw something walk along in a black gown and place itself against a window and there stood for some time and then walked off friday morning the man relating this i asked him why he did not call me and i told him i thought that was a trick or flam he told me the reason why he did not call me was that he was not able to speak or move friday night we lay as before and saturday night and had no disturbance either of the nights  sunday night i lay by myself in one room not that where the man saw the apparition and the tenant and his man in one bed in another room and betwixt twelve and two the man heard something walk in their room at the beds foot and whistling very well at last it came to the beds side drew the curtain and looked on them after some time it moved off then the man called to me desired me to come for that there was something in the room went about whistling i asked him whether he had any light or could strike one he told me no then i leapt out of bed and not staying to put on my clothes went out of my room and along a gallery to the door which i found locked or bolted i desired him to unlock the door for that i could not get in then he got out of bed and opened the door which was near and went immediately to bed again i went in three or four steps and it being a moonshine night i saw the apparition move from the bed side and clap up against the wall that divided their room and mine i went and stood directly against it within my arms length of it and asked it in the name of god what it was that made it come disturbing of us i stood some time expecting an answer and receiving none and thinking it might be some fellow hid in the room to fright me i put out my arm to feel it and my hand seemingly went through the body of it and felt no manner of substance till it came to the wall then i drew back my hand and still it was in the same place till now i had not the least fear and even now had very little then i adjured it to tell me what it was when i had said those words it keeping its back against the wall moved gently along toward the door i followed it and it going out at the door turned its back toward me it went a little along the gallery i followed it a little into the gallery and it disappeared where there was no corner for it to turn and before it came to the end of the gallery where was the stairs then i found myself very cold from my feet as high as my middle though i was not in great fear i went into the bed betwixt the tenant and his man and they complained of my being exceeding cold the tenants man leaned over his master in the bed and saw me stretch out my hand toward the apparition and heard me speak the words the tenant also heard the words the apparition seemed to have a morning gown of a darkish color no hat nor cap short black hair a thin meagre visage of a pale swarthy color seemed to be of about fortyfive or fifty years old the eyes half shut the arms hanging down the hands visible beneath the sleeve of a middle stature i related this description to mr john lardner rector of havant and to major battin of langstone in havant parish they both said the description agreed very well to mr p a former rector of the place who has been dead above twenty years upon this the tenant and his wife left the house which has remained void since  the monday after last michaelmasday a man of chodson in warwickshire having been at havant fair passed by the foresaid parsonagehouse about nine or ten at night and saw a light in most of the rooms of the house his pathway being close by the house he wondering at the light looked into the kitchen window and saw only a light but turning himself to go away he saw the appearance of a man in a long gown he made haste away the apparition followed him over a piece of glebe land of several acres to a lane which he crossed and over a little meadow then over another lane to some pales which belong to farmer henry salter my landlord near a barn in which were some of the farmers men and some others this man went into the barn told them how he was frighted and followed from the parsonagehouse by an apparition which they might see standing against the pales if they went out they went out and saw it scratch against the pales and make a hideous noise it stood there some time and then disappeared their description agreed with what i saw this last account i had from the man himself whom it followed and also from the farmers men  tho wilkins curate of w dec         oxon i shall make no remark upon this genuine account except as to the passage which i have put in italics if mr wilkins was thoroughly possessed of himself at that moment as he deposes and is strictly correct in his fact the narrative is established  no lxxii i shall now proceed to lay before the public such an account as i have been enabled to collect of the several greek writers of comedy  the learned reader needs not to be informed how little is to be found in aristotles poetics on the subject of comedy that treatise by no means answers to the general profession of its title if it had come down to us as perfect and entire as it probably was when the author put the last hand to it and presented a correct copy of his work to alexander we might conclude otherwise of it but to speak of it as it is we can call it nothing more than a dissertation upon tragedy in which many things are evidently out of place and order some no doubt lost and others mutilated it is thus considered by the learned commentator daniel heinsius who in his supplementary treatise annexed to his edition professedly speaks only of the construction of tragedy and endeavors with great diligence and perspicuity to methodize the whole work and dispose his authors system into some order and regularity  with the exception of a few obvious remarks upon the epic as tending to illustrate the drama and two or three passages where comedy is spoken of only as contrasted with tragedy the whole of this celebrated dissertation is nothing more than a set of rules for the drama which are mere transcripts from the compositions of the great writers of the homeric tragedy aeschylus sophocles and euripides he analyzes and defines a poem then actually carried to its perfection but gives no new lights no leading instructions for the furtherance and improvement of what had not arrived to the like state of maturity  with the remains of the three tragic poets above mentioned in our hands i profess i do not see how we are edified by aristotles dissertation which offers nothing but what occurs upon the reading of their dramas unless posterity had seen fit to abide by the same laws which they observed and the modern tragedy had been made exactly to conform to the greek model  aristotle as we have before remarked speaks of no comedy antecedent to the comedy of epicharmus there is reason to think that this author did not fall in with the personal comedy in the licentious manner it prevailed upon the athenian stage even to the time of aristotle for it was not reformed there till the personal satirists were awed into better respect by the macedonian princes who succeeded to alexander whereas epicharmus wrote for the court of an absolute prince  now it is remarkable that aristotle makes no strictures upon the licentiousness of the athenian comedy nor offers any rules for the correction of the stage though the schools proscribed it and the tribunals were at open hostility with it it is plain he states things as they were not as they ought to have been for he pronounces of comedy  that it is a picture of human nature worse and more deformed than the original  i cannot hold this to be a just character of comedy as it stood at the time when aristotle pronounced it the only entire comedies we have to refer to are a contradiction to the assertion for no one will contend that the corrupt and abominable manners of the times in which aristophanes wrote did not fully warrant the severity of his satire or that his characters of depravity are in general overcharged and his pictures of human nature more deformed than their originals as for the rest of the comic fraternity their fragments only can plead for them but they are fragments of such a nature as prove them to have been moralists of the sublimest sort and they have been collected translated and applauded by the gravest and most sententious of the christian writers for many ages i will venture to say that in these scattered relics of the comic stage more useful knowledge and good sense better maxims for right conduct in life and a more generous display of benevolence justice public spirit and all the moral virtues of natural religion are to be found than in all the writings of the philosophers which are so much more entire  socrates it is true could hardly be prevailed upon to enter the comic theater but i infer very little against the poets on that account plato i am aware though an intimate of aristophanes banished the drama out of his visionary republic but what is that more than to say that if all men were virtuous there would be no need of satirists the comic poets in return lashed the philosophers over the stage and they had what they merited the public applause on their side the schools and academies of sophists furnished an inexhaustible fund for wholesome ridicule their contradictory first principles their demons and clouds and water and fire with all their idle systems and hypotheses their fabulous conceits dreams and devices to catch the vulgar and the affected rigor of their manners whilst in secret they were addicted to the grossest debauchery and impurity were continual subjects of satire and if hypocrisy is not the comic poets lawful game what is there is not a play of aristophanes to be named in which these sanctified sinners have not their share in the ridicule and amongst the fragments above mentioned a very large proportion falls to their lot  aristotle who had very little feeling for plato and his academy or indeed for practical philosophy in general which he seems to have professed only in opposition to xenocrates concerned himself no further about the state of the stage than to comment and remark upon the tragedies of the three chief writers above mentioned and it is humiliating enough to the pride of criticism to observe that tragedy after all his pains to hold it up to the standard of sophocles and euripides sunk with those authors and was no more heard of whilst comedy without his help and in defiance of his neglect rose in credit with the world till it attained perfection under the auspices of menander  i have spoken of tragedy as a written poem before comedy of the same description because i think that susarion did not write comedy though he acted it so early as the fiftieth olympiad and i also think that thespis did write tragedy in the sixtyfirst olympiad if not sooner in other words although the complexion of the original drama was comic in the most extravagant degree yet it appears probable that tragedy had the start in point of publication the nature of the first comedy compared with that of the first tragedy seems to warrant this opinion for it is easy to suppose that the raillery and satire of the village masks which would pass off at a lawless festival spoken offhand and without the malice of premeditation would not so readily have been committed to writing by the poet as the tragic drama which being composed in honor of deceased heroes or on religious and grave subjects not only called for greater deliberation on the part of the author but would also be made public without danger or offense  it now remains to enquire into the chronology of the written comedy  i have already observed that aristotle ascribes the first written comedy to epicharmus  both aristotle and horace call him a sicilian but in what particular place he was born is not agreed some contend that he was a syracusan some that he was a native of crastum others of megara in sicily diomedes the grammarian says he was born in cos and derives the word comedy from the name of that island a derivation that sets aside his authority altogether the father of epicharmus was named chimarus or according to others tityrus and his mother sicida cicero in his tusculans calls him acutum nec insulsum hominem demetrius phaleraeus celebrates him for the elegant and apposite choice of his epithets on which account the greeks gave the name of epicharmion to his style making it proverbial for its beauty and purity it is difficult to fix the precise time when he began to write comedy especially as he lived to the great age of ninetyseven it is certain however he was still writing in the reign of hiero in or about olymp lxxiv at which time phormis also wrote comedy in sicily and chionides dinolochus and magnes comic poets flourished at athens  suidass chronology does not agree with aristotles for he makes chionides antecedent to epicharmus and calls him the first writer of comedy adding that evetes euxenides and mylus all athenians were his contemporaries he allows however that epicharmus and phormis were the first writers in the island of sicily but this is in the vague manner of his dates and not to be relied upon he takes no notice of aristotles express assertion that epicharmus was long senior to chionides and yet he might have recollected that facts are so far in favor of aristotles chronology of these poets that there is a title upon record of one of chionidess plays called the persians which must have been posterior to the persian era when it is on all hands agreed that epicharmus was living  amongst the epigrams of theocritus published by henry stevens in      there are some lines upon epicharmus which appear to have been inscribed upon the pedestal of a statue of brass which the syracusans had set up in his honor as their fellowcitizen it consists of ten lines in the doric dialect which he used it settles the point of his birth expressly saying he was a syracusan and ascribes to him the invention of comedy     epicharmus the man who invented comedy in the conclusion it celebrates him for the many useful maxims which he gave for the instruction of youth but this i am disposed to think may apply to the circumstance of his having been a schoolmaster at syracuse for if we are to take our judgment of epicharmuss drama from his imitator plautus perhaps its morality though not to be overlooked amongst other excellencies is nevertheless not the most striking feature in its character and though it is probable that epicharmus did not launch out into that personality which the freer athenians indulged to such excess yet i can suppose him to have been not very chaste in his dialogue from the anecdote which plutarch gives us of his being heavily fined and compelled to manual labor by order of hiero for certain obscene jests which he suffered to pass in hearing of his queen i must ground another remark upon this anecdote respecting the time in which he is generally thought to have struck out his comedy as being long antecedent to the time of hiero which being admitted it will follow that he was near the close of his life when this sentence of manual labor was executed upon him a kind of punishment so very unlikely to be inflicted on a man of ninetysix years by a prince of hieros magnanimity and benevolence that if i am to take the anecdote for granted i cannot assent to those authorities that have placed him so high in time for the purpose only of putting his title of first founder of comedy out of dispute  upon the whole i think it likely the athenians wrote comedy as soon as the sicilians but that epicharmus was the first who formed his drama upon the poems of homer it is also clear that his countryman and contemporary phormis wrote comedy as soon or nearly as soon as he did for although theocritus in the epigram above cited says expressly that epicharmus struck out comedy yet it must be remarked that theocritus was a syracusan by birth living in the time of ptolemy lagus and in giving this testimony for his fellowcitizen it is more than probable he spoke locally of the sicilian comedy only as suidas did in after times when he said that epicharmus and phormis first struck out comedy in sicily  i would therefore fix epicharmuss first comedy antecedent to olymp lxxv at the lowest date because we have it from good authority that he was teaching scholars at syracuse four years before the persian era and this date is confirmed by the age of phormis who certainly flourished in the time of gelon and was in great favor in the court of that prince who was predecessor to hiero and was succeeded by him in olymp lxxvii  no lxxiii epicharmus was a liberal benefactor to the stage porphyry says that apollodorus the grammarian made a collection of his plays in ten volumes suidas reckons fiftytwo lycon only thirtyfive but modern philologists have given the titles of forty with the authorities by which they are ascertained  it is not my purpose in these papers to make a practice of loading the page with lists of titles which may too truly be called dead names but in the instance of an author like epicharmus who stands at the head of his department every relic seems an object of some curiosity and therefore although the following catalogue may strike the dramatic reader as what may properly enough be called a beggarly account of empty boxes yet i shall proceed to enumerate the titles of forty comedies all of which are upon good grounds of criticism ascribed to this celebrated author  titles of the comedies of epicharmus the husbandman the halcyon amycus son of neptune the banditti atalanta the bacchae busiris earth and sea the fathers of the people the bacchanalians diphilus hope the festival the celebration of the victory hebes wedding junos nuptials vulcan or the revells the ambassadors to the oracle the cyclops the reasoner the megarensian the muses the islands niobes wedding ulysses the deserter ulysses shipwreckt the chitterlings the paedagogues the paragon the persians the statesman prometheus the firestealer pyrrha the wife of deucalion the sirens the isle of scyros the sphynx the trojans philoctetes the chorus troop the potters the same respect which led me to insert these titles led me also to search with all possible diligence for every fragment which i could find of epicharmus i wish they had been more in number and of greater importance than they are but such as they are i have reason to believe they are the whole amount of what can be picked up from the wreck of this once valuable poet the reader must not expect that either in this authors instance or that of any other greek comedian except in very few cases that the particular play can be ascertained to which the fragments belong for the grammarians and others who quote them only give the name of the author and not that of the comedy from which they extract them i must in this place once for all give vent to an anxiety which presses on my mind respecting these fragments of the greek comedy whether the insertion of them will or will not be approved of by the generality of my readers my sole object is to furnish them with rational and moral amusement and if i fail of that object in these my hearty endeavors i have taken a great deal of pains to render these passages into english in the best manner my capacity enabled me to do to a very unfortunate purpose indeed the learned reader will bear me witness that these fragments have been the admiration of ages and i am sensible that very many of them possess intrinsic beauty both of style and sentiment and if my translations have not robbed them of their original merit some pleasure and let me hope some profit may attend their perusal i have studied so to class them as not to burden or distract the reader with a mere succession of miscellaneous quotations without any reference or connection which i am sensible could not be an agreeable mode of publication though stobaeus hertelius and some others have taken it up but on the contrary i have endeavored to introduce them with some anecdote or other which serves to weave them into the thread of the work most of the translations will be found in meter in which i have strove to copy the free style of our old metrical comic poets some i have turned into rhyme where the thought allowed it and the expressions were terse and epigrammatical others i have put into prose and in all i have been as close and faithful to the original as the language and my construction of the author would permit if the candid reader will accept this preface in apology i shall give him no further trouble on the subject  epicharmus in one of his comedies we may suppose the statesman introduces the following retort from some man of low birth to a prating old woman who is vapouring about her ancestry  good gossip if you love me prate no more what are your genealogies to me away to those who have more need of them let the degenerate wretches if they can dig up dead honor from their fathers tombs and boast it for their own  vain empty boast when every common fellow that they meet if accident has not cut off the scroll can show a list of ancestry as long you call the scythians barbarous and despise them yet anacharsis was a scythian born and every man of a like noble nature though he were molded from an aethiops loins is nobler than your pedigrees can make him  the following is a false antithesis in which bodily strength is substituted for mental  it demands the strength of a lion to subdue the weakness of love  moral maxims be sober in thought be slow in belief these are the sinews of wisdom  it is the part of a wise man to foresee what ought to be done so shall he not repent of what is done  throw not away thine anger upon trifles reason and not rage should govern  mankind are more indebted to industry than to ingenuity the gods set up their favors at a price and industry is the purchaser  a man without merit shall live without envy but who would wish to escape on these terms  live so as to hold yourself prepared either for a long life or for a short one  there is no subject which the comic poets whet their wits upon more frequently than marriage the wives of syracuse were not much obliged to epicharmus for the following sally  marriage is like a cast of the dice if you get a wife of good morals and a quiet temper withal happy is your lot if you light upon a gadding gossipping extravagant hussy it is not a wife you wed but an eternal plague in the apparel of a woman there is not in the habitable globe so dire a torment i feel it to my sorrow the better luck is his who has never tried it mr congreve in his double dealer has the following passage between mellafont and cynthia upon the very eve of their nuptials  cynth then i find marriage is like cards if either of us have a good hand it is an accident of fortune   mell no marriage is rather like a game at bowls fortune indeed makes the match and the two nearest and sometimes the two farthest are together but the game depends entirely upon judgment   cynth still it is a game and consequently one of us must be a loser   mell not at all only a friendly trial of skill and the winnings to be laid out in an entertainment   neither this nor any part of the scene to which it appertains is in mr congreves best manner the wit does not flow but is pumped up with labor and not very clean when it comes  of phormis the contemporary of epicharmus no fragments are to be found  chionides of athens wrote comedy before the persian era and is the oldest writer of the athenian stage all the memorials i can obtain of him are that he wrote three plays entitled the heroes the liars and the poor men  magnes was an athenian and began to appear as a writer of comedy whilst chionides was living aristophanes makes mention of him in his play of the knights the scholiast in his comment on the passage observes that all his works are perished nothing remaining but the titles of nine comedies of which two bear the same names with two of aristophanes viz the frogs and the birds the same scholiast informs us that magnes bore away two prizes  dinolochus was contemporary with magnes he used the doric dialect and is said to have produced fourteen plays some place his birth at syracuse others at agrigentum suidas says he flourished so early as olymp lxxiii but this ill agrees with the circumstance of his being the son or as others contend the scholar of epicharmus his works have totally perished  these five poets three of whom were sicilians must be called the fathers of comedy and all that now remains of them is comprised in the few short passages here inserted  whilst their comedies were in representation tragedy was advancing under pratinas and chaerilus and aeschylus had already taken possession of the stage sophocles and euripides were born the former six years before the latter ion surnamed xuthis son of orthomenes of chios began to write tragedy in the first year of olymp lxxxii aeschylus being then dead theognis from the coldness of his drama nicknamed snow was contemporary with ion  the magistracy of athens in olymp lxxxv when myrrichides was archon published a decree prohibiting the representation of comedies in athens this decree held in force only two years under glaucides and theopompus for when euthymenes succeeded to that annual dignity he found it expedient to gratify the people by a revocation of the edict and the comic muse was reinstated on the stage by the celebrated triumvirate of eupolis cratinus and aristophanes cratinus opening the theater with his celebrated comedy of the winter amusements eupolis with the new moons and aristophanes with the acharnensians  no lxxiv cratinus eupolis and aristophanes are generally classed together as rivals and principals in what is called the old comedy cratinus was senior in age to both his competitors and eupolis is charged by the old annotator upon aristophanes of having copied from him very freely i confess this is stubborn authority and yet it seems hard to believe that eupolis who was so constantly engaged in competition with his rival should expose himself to certain detection of so disgraceful a sort and had it been so i should rather have expected to meet with the charge in the text of aristophanes than in the comment i must add that upon the closest search i can find nothing that favors this imputation in any other author which speaks of eupolis but many circumstances on the contrary which seem to place his pretensions to originality on as good ground as that of his contemporaries with whom he is equally celebrated  these poets were in high favor with the people on account of the boldness and personality of their satire and for the same reason proportionably obnoxious to the nobles and magistrates whom they lashed without mercy aristophanes was much the least bitter of the three and yet we have some smart specimens of his severity persius seems to make this distinction in the following passage  audaci quicunque afflate cratino iratum eupolidem praegrandi cum seen palles aspice et haec in these lines he characterizes cratinus and eupolis by the epithets of audax and iratus whereas he introduces aristophanes under the description only of praegrandis senex which is interpreted to refer to the superior gravity and dignity of his style  horace in the fourth satire of his first book instances these three poets by preeminence from amongst all the writers of the old comedy eupolis atque cratinus aristophanesque poetae atque alii quorum comoedia prisca virorum est si quis erat dignus describi quod malus ac fur quod maechus foret aut sicarius aut alioqui famosus multa cum liberate notabant the comic poets in its earliest age who formed the manners of the grecian stage was there a villain who might justly claim a better right of being damned to fame rake cutthroat thief whatever was his crime they freely stigmatized the wretch in rhyme francis it appears by this quotation that horace does not consider their comedy in the same light with aristotle as if they represented human nature in worse colors than it deserved  quintilian expressly says that these are the chief writers of the old comedy  plures ejus auctores aristophanes tamen e eupolis cratinusque praecipui  and he recommends the old greek comedy and these authors in particular as the best model homer only excepted for his orator to form himself upon inasmuch as it is there only he will find the attic style in its purity and perfection and though the old comedy as he observes is chiefly occupied in wit and sarcasm for the purpose of chastising vice yet it has many excellences of a more general sort it is energetic elegant and full of graces so that if homer alone who like his own achilles has the privilege of being always put above comparison be excepted no other school for oratory can come in competition with this  cratinus cratinus was the son of callimedes an athenian we have the titles of at least thirty comedies of his writing so that suidas is mistaken in ascribing to him only twentyone he was a poet of strong imagination and a florid lively style he carried away no less than nine prizes which is a large proportion of success compared with others who rank amongst the highest both in the comic and tragic line a second edict came out in his time for restraining the licentiousness of the stage in point of personality and cratinus in common with the rest of his contemporaries found himself obliged to divert his satire from the living to the dead sarcasms were now levelled at mens productions not at their persons the tragic authors felt the chief weight of the attack though even homer did not escape as may be gathered from the ulysses of cratinus in which he parodies and ridicules the odyssey  cratinus lived to an extreme old age though according to the loose morals of the greeks he indulged his passions both natural and unnatural without restraint he carried his love of wine to such excess that he got the name of  launching out in praise of drinking and rallying all sobriety out of countenance asserting that no author can be good for any thing who does not love his bottle and that dramatic poets in particular ought to drink hard as a duty due to bacchus for his peculiar patronage and protection of the stage horace who was not very averse from his doctrine quotes his authority in the first lines of an epistle to mecaenas  prisco si credis mecaenas docte cratino nulla placere diu nec vivere carmina possunt quae scribuntur aquae potoribus o learned mecaenas hear cratinus speak and take this maxim from the gay old greek no verse shall please or lasting honors gain which coldly flows from waterdrinkers brain as for the love of wine it seems to have stood in the place of a merit with the greeks but cratinuss excess was attended in his old age with some marks of weakness and want of retention incidental to an exhausted constitution which gave a handle to aristophanes who was a younger man and not much more abstemious to bring his old competitor on the stage and hold him up to ridicule for this infirmity the charge was unmanly and roused the aged veteran to return the attack cratinus then nearly approaching to an hundred had left off writing but he was not yet superannuated and lived to complete a comedy which he appositely entitled the flaggon in the plot of this piece he feigns himself married to comedy whom he personifies and represents the lady in disgust with her husband for his unconjugal neglect on which account she states her charge and roundly sues for an actual divorce upon this hearing certain friends and advocates are introduced on the scene in behalf of the party accused who make suit to the dame to stay her proceedings and not be overhasty in throwing off an old spouse but on the contrary recommend to her to enter calmly into an amicable discussion of her grievances to this proposal she at length accedes and this gives occasion to take up the charge of aristophanes accusing the old bard of drunkenness and the concomitant circumstances which had been published with so much ill nature to make him ridiculous at the end of life then follows a very pleasant refutation of all these libels by which he contrives to turn the laugh against aristophanes and so concludes the comedy one feels a satisfaction even at this distance of ages to know that the old poet bore away the prize with this very comedy and soon after expired in the arms of victory at the age of ninetyseven in the first year of olymp lxxxix  the athenians gave him a monument and an epitaph in which they omit all mention of his fine talents and record nothing but his drunkenness he spared no man when living and even death itself could not protect him from retaliation   stesichorus the evil that he did lived after him the good was all interred with his bones shakespeare there is scarce a fragment of this poet once so great a favorite that is now to be found the very few scraps of sentences remaining are too imperfect to merit a translation one little spark of his genius however will be seen in the following epigrammatic turn of thought upon the loss of a statue which being the workmanship of daedalus he supposes to have made use of its privilege and escaped from its pedestal  my statues gone by daedalus twas made it is not stolen therefore it has strayed eupolis eupolis became a very popular author some years before the death of cratinus the bold strong spirit of his satire recommended him to the public more than the beauties and graces of his style which he was not studious to polish he attacked the most obnoxious and profligate characters in athens without any regard to his personal safety to expose the cheat and ridicule the impostor was the glory of his muse and neither the terrors of the magistracy nor the mysteries of superstition could divert him from it he wrote two comedies professedly against autolycus the areopagite whose misbehaviour in the chaeronensian war had made him infamous and he called them after his name the first and second autolycus in his famous comedy called the baptae he inveighs against the effeminate turpitude of his countrymen whom he exhibits dancing after the manner of the lascivious priests of cotytto viz the baptae in the habits and fashion of female minstrels  talia secreta coluerunt orgia teda cecropiam soliti baptae lassare cotytto juven the prevailing account of his death is that the persons whom he had satirized in this play of the baptae suborned certain assassins to throw him into the sea as he was passing the hellespont with the athenian forces then on an expedition against the lacedaemonians and several authorities impute this revengeful deed to alcibiades who had been severely handled in that piece but cicero in his first epistle of the sixth book to atticus speaks of this report as a vulgar error and quotes eratosthenes for the fact of eupolis having written certain comedies after the time when the event of his death is dated  redarguit eratosthenes affert enim quas ille post id tempus fabulas docuerit  pausanias tells us that his tomb was erected upon the banks of the aesopus in sicyonia and as it is not likely this honor should be paid to his memory by the sicyonians he being an athenian born unless he had died in their country the authority of pausanias seems to confirm the account of eratosthenes and discredit the fable of his being thrown into the hellespont  in his comedy called the people by the fiction of the scene he raises the shades of their departed orators and daemagogues from the dead and when pericles last of the troop arises the poet demands who it is that appears the question being answered and the spirit of pericles dismissed he pronounces his encomium  that he was preeminent as an orator for man never spoke as he spoke when he started like a courser in the race he threw all competitors out of sight so rapid was the torrent of his eloquence but with that rapidity there slowed such sweetness and persuasion from his lips that he alone of all orators struck a sting into the very souls of his hearers and left it there to remain for ever  i think it probable the following fragment has been the opening speech of this very comedy for in it he addresses the people and complains of the preference they are apt to bestow upon foreigners to the neglect of their own countrymen  receiving every thing with favor that falls from their lips and applauding them as oracles of human wisdom whereas if any one of your own countrymen addresses you though in no respect their inferior you look down upon him with contempt nay you are ready to pronounce that the man is in his dotage a fool who never had senses or a madman who has lost them  but hark ye gentlemen let me have a word with you at starting let me prevail with you to revoke these unjust proceedings and give a fellowcitizen and your humble servant a fair hearing and impartial judgment  i suspect this to be a fly blow at aristophanes who was not an athenian born and perhaps at this time had not his adoption he proceeds to lament the state of public affairs and the degeneracy of the times for in the old comedy it was usual for the poet to harangue the theater either in the opening of the piece or at any convenient interval between the scenes sometimes in his own person sometimes by the mouth of the chorus we cannot wonder if such sentiments as the following delivered from the stage should render eupolis obnoxious to men in power  address to the audience by eupolis of many things which offer themselves to my consideration i cannot find words to speak so penetrated am i with affliction when i turn my thoughts to the condition of the commonwealth for you must be conscious o citizens it was not so administered in times past when men of high birth men whose rank fortune and merit gave them a consideration in the state filled the first offices of government to such we deferred as to the deities themselves for they merited our respect and under their protection we enjoyed security now we have no other guide in our election but blind ignoble chance and on whatsoever head it falls though he be the worst and meanest of mankind he starts up a great man at once and is installed with all proper solemnity a rogue in state  here the poet speaks out of the rostrum rather than from the stage this is plain bold language and tempts me to call our countryman ben jonson on the scene who was deep in all these remnants of the old greek poets and frequently talks the very language of the athenian theater  asper in character of presenter of the play thus opens the comedy of every man out of his humor address to the audience by b jonson away who is so patient of this impious world that he can check his spirit or rein his tongue  who can behold such prodigies as these and have his lips sealed up not i my soul was never ground into such oily colors to flatter vice and dawb iniquity but with an armed and resolved hand i will strip the ragged follies of the time naked as at their birth  i fear no mood stamped in a private brow when i am pleased to unmask a public vice i fear no strumpets drugs nor ruffians stab should i detect their hateful luxuries no brokers usurers or lawyers gripe were i disposed to say they are all corrupt i fear no courtiers frown should i applaud the easy flexure of his supple hams tut these are so innate and popular that drunken custom would not shame to laugh in scorn at him that should not dare to tax them etc etc this is the very spirit of the old greek comedy speaking through the organs of our english aristophanes and old ben fills the character of the praegrandis senex as well as he for whom it was designed it is the comoedia vocem tollens and asserting her determination to keep up her rights according to ancient custom of her founders  siquis erat dignus describi  in the third year of olymp lxxxix which was two years after the decease of cratinus eupolis acted his comedy called the flatterers alcaeus being archon i cannot doubt but the following is a fragment of this comedy it is a part of the speech of a parasite and runs over a few of the arts by which he gulls the rich boobies that fall in his way  the parasite of eupolis mark now and learn of me the thriving arts by which we parasites contrive to live fine rogues we are my friend of that be sure and daintily we gull mankind  observe first i provide myself a nimble thing to be my page a varlet of all crafts next two new suits for feasts and galadays which i promote by turns when i walk forth to sun myself upon the public square there if perchance i spy some rich dull knave strait i accost him do him reverence and sauntring up and down with idle chat hold him awhile in play at every word which his wise worship utters i stop short and bless myself for wonder if he ventures on some vile joke i blow it to the skies and hold my sides for laughter  then to supper with others of our brotherhood to mess in some nightcellar on our barley cakes and club inventions for the next days shift  the parasite of ben jonson mosca  oh your parasite is a most precious thing dropped from above not bred amongst clods and clotpoles here on earth i muse the mystery was not made a science it is so liberally professed almost all the wise world is little else in nature but parasites and subparasites and yet i mean not those that have your bare townart to know who is fit to feed them have no house no family no care and therefore mould tales for mens ears to bait that sense  nor those with their court dogtricks that can fawn and fleer make their revenue out of legs and faces echo my lord and lick away a moth but your fine elegant rascal that can rise and stoop almost together like an arrow shoot through the air as nimbly as a star turn short as does a swallow and be here and there and here and yonder all at once present to any humor all occasion and change a visor swifter than a thought this is the creature had the art born with him  lucians parasite which is a masterpiece of character and comic writing and horaces dialogue between tiresias and ulysses which is the fifth satire of the second book might perhaps be traced in passages of this comedy of eupolis if we had it entire  eupolis in his lacedaemonians attacks both the public and private character of cimon charging him with improper partiality for the lacedaemonians with drunkenness and even with an incestuous commerce with his own sister pnyce plutarch takes notice of this attack and says it had a great effect in stirring up the populace against this celebrated commander  he wrote his comedy entitled marica against the orator hyperbolus whom thucydides mentions to have been banished by ostracism  we have the titles of upwards of twenty plays of this authors composition  no lxxv aristophanes ut templum charites quod non labatur haberent invenere tuum pectus aristophanes  jos scaliger ex platone this is an eulogy the more honorable to aristophanes as it fell from plato the disciple of socrates if i were to collect all the testimonies that are scattered through the works of the learned in behalf of the author we are now about to review i should fill my pages with panegyric but this i am the less concerned to do as the reader has a part of him in possession which as it is near a fourth of the whole man he has more than the foot by which to measure this hercules  both the parentage and birthplace of aristophanes are doubtful he was an adopted not a natural citizen of athens and i incline to think he was the son of philippus a native of aegina where our poet had some patrimony he was in person very tall bony and robust and we have his own authority for his baldness but whether this was as disgraceful at athens as it was amongst the romans i have not been anxious to enquire he was in private life of a free open and companiable temper and his company was sought after by the greatest characters of the age with all possible avidity plato and even socrates shared many social hours with him he was much the most popular character in athens as the great daemagogue cleon experienced to his cost not to mention socrates himself every honor that could be paid to a poet was publicly bestowed upon aristophanes by the athenian people nor did they confine their rewards to honorary prizes only but decreed him fines and pecuniary confiscations from those who ventured to attack him with suits and prosecutions dionysius of syracuse in vain made overtures to him of the most flattering sort at the time when aeschines and aristippus socratic philosophers were retained in his court with so much infamy to their private characters and when even plato himself had solicited his notice by three several visits to syracuse where he had not the good fortune to render himself very agreeable the fame of aristophanes had reached to the court of persia and his praises were there sounded by the great king himself who considered him not only as the first poet but as the most conspicuous personage at athens i do not find him marked with any other immorality than that of intemperance with regard to wine the fashionable excess of the time and in some degree a kind of prerogative of his profession a licentia poetica athenaeus the deipnosophist says he was drunk when he composed but this is a charge that will not pass upon any man who is sober and if we rejected it from sophocles in the case of aeschylus we shall not receive it but with contempt from such an accuser as athenaeus he was not happy in his domestic connections for he naturally declares that he was ashamed of his wife    and as for his two sons philippus and ararotes they did him as little credit and he considered them accordingly he was blessed with a good constitution and lived to turn above seventy years though the date of his death is not precisely laid down  though he was resolute in opposing himself to the torrent of vice and corruption which overspread the manners of his country yet he was far more temperate in his personal invective than his contemporaries he was too sensitive in his nature to undertake the performance of his own parts in person which was general with all the comic poets of his time and he stood their raillery for not venturing to tread the stage as they did amipsias and aristonymus both rival authors charged him with availing himself of the talents of other people from consciousness of his own insufficiency their raillery could not draw him out till his favorite actor callistratus declined undertaking the part of cleon in his personal comedy of the knights dreading the resentment of that powerful daemagogue who was as unforgiving as he was imperious in this dilemma aristophanes conquered his repugnance and determined upon presenting himself on the stage for the first time in his life he dressed himself in the character of this formidable tribune and having colored his face with vermilion up to the hue of the brutal person he was to resemble he entered on the part in such a style of energy and with such natural expression that the effect was irresistible and the proud factious cleon was stripped of his popularity and sentenced in a fine of five talents by the knights decree as damages for the charge he had preferred against the author touching his right of citizenship which was awarded and secured to him by the same instrument  such was aristophanes in person manners and character as a poet i might refer the learned reader to his works which speak so ably for themselves they are not only valuable as his remains but when we consider them as the only remains which give us any complete specimens of the greek comedy they become inestimable through the misfortunes of all the rest we receive them as treasures thrown up from a wreck or more properly as one passenger escaped out of a fleet whose narrative we listen to with the more eagerness and curiosity because it is from this alone we can gain intelligence of the nature of the expedition the quality of the armament and the characters and talents of the commanders who have perished and gone down into the abyss together  the comedies of aristophanes are universally esteemed to be the standard of attic writing in its greatest purity if any man would wish to know the language as it was spoken by pericles he must seek it in the scenes of aristophanes where he is not using a foreign or affected diction for the purpose of accommodating it to some particular or extravagant character the ancient authors both greek and roman who had all the productions of the athenian stage before them speak of him with such rapture and admiration as to give him a decided preference before all other comic poets with an exception as i believe of plutarch only who brings him into comparison with menander and after discussing their different pretensions decides peremptorily for menander this criticism of plutarchs i shall reserve for future consideration and when i said that he is single in his preference of menander perhaps i ought to recall the expression as that poet has his admirers but none that i know of who have deliberately given judgment in his favor upon a critical comparison with aristophanes except plutarch above mentioned  the drama of aristophanes is of a mixed species sometimes personal at other times inclining to parody according to the character of the middle comedy he varies and accommodates his style to his subject and the speakers on the scene on some occasions it is elevated grave sublime and polished to a wonderful degree of brilliancy and beauty on others it sinks and descends into humble dialogue provincial rusticity coarse naked obscenity and even puns and quibbles the versatility of his genius is admirable for he gives us every rank and description of men in his scenes and in every one is strictly characteristic in some passages and frequently in his chorusses he starts out of the ordinary province of comedy into the loftiest flights of poetry and in these i doubt if aeschylus or pindar have surpassed him in sentiment and good sense he is not inferior to euripides and in the acuteness of his criticisms equalled by none in the general purport of his moral he seldom if ever fails but he works occasionally with unclean tools and like juvenal in the lower ages chastises vice by an open exposure of its turpitude offending the ear whilst he aims to mend the heart this habit of plain speaking was the fashion of the times he wrote in and the audience demanded and would have it that he may be studied by the purest readers we should conclude when we are told he was the pillow companion of a christian saint as the wellknown anecdote of chrysostom will testify if we cannot entirely defend the indelicacy of his muse we cannot deny but that a great share of the blame rests with the spectators a dramatic poet cannot model his audience but in a certain degree must of necessity conform to their taste and humor it can be proved that aristophanes himself laments the hard task imposed upon him of gratifying the public at the expense of decency but with the example of the poet cratinus before his eyes who was driven from the stage because he scrupled to amuse the public ear with tawdry jests it is not to be wondered at if an author emulous of applause should fall in with the wishes of the theater unbecoming as they were let me add in further palliation of this fault that he never puts obscenity but in the mouths of obscene characters and so applies it as to give his hearers a disgust for such unseemly habits morality i confess deserves a purer vehicle yet i contend that his purpose was honest and i dare believe went farther toward reforming the loose athenians than all the indecisive positions of the philosophers who being enlisted into sects and factions scarce agreed in any one point of common morality  this part of his defense would have been very easily handled a century or two ago ben jonson for instance could have helped his argument out with his own example if occasion had required but the task falls very heavy upon an advocate in this age which is of purer ears than to listen to obscenity and though my particular difficulties have thereby been increased i shall never repine under the weight of any burden which the merit of my contemporaries lays upon me  his wit is of various kinds much is of a general and permanent stamp much is local personal and untransferable to posterity no author still retains so many brilliant passages yet none has suffered such injury by the depredations of time of his powers in ridicule and humor whether of character or dialogue there might be no end to instances if plautus gives us the model of epicharmus he does not equal him and if ternce translates menander his original does not approach him in these particulars i doubt if the sum total of wit and humor in all their stagelacqueys would together balance the single character of cario in the plutus his satire whether levelled against the vices and follies of the people at large against the corruption of the daemagogues the turpitude and chicanery of the philosophers or the arrogant selfsufficiency of the tragic poets cuts with an edge that penetrates the character and leaves no shelter for either ignorance or criminality  aristophanes was author of above sixty comedies though they are erroneously stated under that amount the plutus now in our hands which is the second he wrote of that title has been twice published in our language by two different translators one of these i have seen which was jointly executed by the celebrated henry fielding and the rev mr young there is an english translation as i am told of the clouds but this has never been in my hands and also a very late one of the frogs in meter which i have perused much praise is due to the labors of learned men who thus endeavor to make his wit current amongst us and every man who knows the difficulties of their task will find his candor strongly called upon to excuse any errors or inequalities that may appear in their performances  no lxxvi i said in my former paper that plutarch had made a comparison between aristophanes and menander and given his decided judgment for the latter it might well be expected that a greek of the lower ages living in the time of trajan and in courtfavour with that emperor should prefer a polished elegant author like menander to one so bold personal and sarcastic as the poet he compares with him horace even in the time of augustus had begun to decry the plautinos sales and the manners were much more refined in plutarchs time than in his as we can take little estimate of menander from the fragments only of his comedies which now remain we cannot see what general reasons plutarch or any other critic of his time might have for preferring him but as far as he has entered into strictures and objections in his examination of aristophanes so far we can follow him this part at least of his criticism is still open to be controverted and if it shall appear that he has condemned one party without reason it may be presumed he has preferred the other without justice  plutarch asserts that aristophanes is a punster a quibbler upon words and ridiculously given to parody it is unfortunate for this charge that he follows it up with quotations in every one of which aristophanes is not only to be defended but applauded he could not have selected passages less to the purpose and the accusation has accordingly been turned against him by frischlinus and other advocates of the poet  he arraigns the style of aristophanes on account of its inequalities and variations observing that it is sometimes high and sometimes low now turgid and inflated now grovelling and depressed  as if he had not been aware that the great variety of characters which his comedy exhibits naturally demands as great a variety of style he applauds menander for the uniform and equal tenor of his style not seeming to recollect that his comedy on the contrary had one uniform complexion contained no chorusses and introduced no living characters whereas aristophanes according to the spirit of the old comedy makes use of chorusses many of which are of so fanciful and imaginary a nature that it is necessary to employ all the powers of poetry in their display and in some cases even to create a new style and almost language for the occasion he also introduces gods heroes poets orators philosophers ambassadors priests on his scene some of these professedly demand a swelling tragic pomp of words for instance aeschylus sophocles and euripides in short the very excellence of aristophanes is discrimination of style and character should socrates and a slave speak in the same phrase should lamachus a mere miles gloriosus talk in the tone of a beggarly megarensian pedlar certainly not nor is there any need to dwell longer on this criticism of plutarchs in which the ingenious author has shown little of his usual candor or judgment that he should be prepossessed in favor of the new comedy is very natural elegant and moral fictions are both more pleasing and more proper subjects for the drama than bold and coarse truths and living realities the even suavity of menanders style might be more to his taste than the irregular sublimity of aristophaness but when i see him manage the argument in a manner so much below his usual sagacity i cannot help suspecting there might be some other besides general prejudice in his mind against aristophanes and i make no doubt he had fostered strong resentments against him for his attacks upon socrates i also see some grounds for believing that he had been opposed by pliny in his partiality for menander whom that author calls omnis luxuriae interpres a charge which was resented by plutarch who nevertheless was compelled to admit it it is not improbable therefore that this might have given some occasion to him for entering into a more formal comparison between the two authors and for publishing his strictures upon aristophanes upon looking over the titles of the comedies of the lastnamed author which are lost i find one entitled boeotia which play was translated and brought upon the roman stage by plautus as it is generally thought though we are told that m varro gave it to one aquilius be this as it may the comedy was produced by one or the other and there is a fragment of it in proof which will be found in pareuss edition of plautus here is fresh reason for plutarch who was a boeotian to take up a resentment against aristophanes and if it were a subject worth following i could show that plutarchs national prejudices were uncommonly strong the comedy indeed is not in existence both original and translation being perished but we can easily believe that boeotia did not escape out of aristophaness hands without a pretty smart flagellation and this was the more galling to plutarch because it was naturalized on the roman stage and if it was still in representation might give a handle to the wits of the time for a run upon his native country but i perceive my zeal is carrying me into an unprofitable research and i proceed with my subject  aristophanes has sometimes been reproached for his attacks upon euripides but this author was a fair subject for satire in his literary character and though he was the friend of socrates his private morals were no less open to reproof the voice of the heathen world has been so loud in the praise of socrates he is so decidedly the hero of all the ciceros and declaimers upon morality that even now after so many centuries of christianity it is with a kind of superstitious reverence we approach his character his contemporaries who saw him in the nearest light treat him with the least respect aristophanes as ben jonson expresses it hoisted him up with a pulley and made him play the philosopher in a basket measure how many foot a flea could skip geometrically by a just scale and edify the people from the engine  time and prejudice have since cast a veil before him that it would be a hardy deed to attempt to withdraw  this attack of aristophanes has doomed him to almost universal detestation the praise we give him is no more than his superior genius extorts and it is paid grudgingly like a tax without cordiality or good will we admire him for his bold attacks upon cleon and we can find some palliation for his strictures upon euripides the languid affectation of the poet and the turbulent ferocity of the daemagogue justify the satirist but when he assaults the sacred character of socrates when he arraigns the unspotted purity of the great master of morality it is no longer satire it is sacrilege but is all this to pass without one word for the poet was he given up by his contemporaries for this atrocious act was he given up by the friends and disciples of socrates by none not even by plato himself who on the contrary caressed admired and extolled him both in verse and prose he adopted his sentiments on the subject of love and engrafted them into his own symposium he applauded him to dionysius of syracuse and put his comedies into his hands as the only pure and perfect model of attic elegance the tyrant read them admired them and even rehearsed them by heart nay he did more he turned poet himself and wrote a play for the athenian stage which of course was honored with a prize and now why should we be more angry than plato was what have we discovered which he did not know that we should take the matter up so high we have discovered that aristophanes took a bribe of melitus and his faction to attack socrates and pave the way for their criminal charge by which he suffered and this we take upon credit from aelians insinuations in an article of his various history which for its authority in this case is about as good an evidence as any story out of the incredibilia of palaephatus heraclitus aelian however does not hardily advance this as a fact but hooks it in by way of question  where is the absurdity he asks of supposing that the poet who was known to be needy had taken a bribe  this is a mere insinuation by which he tries the credulity of his readers if they will believe it so much the better for his purpose if not he has nothing else to offer he has done his best to blacken the character of aristophanes in this case as he did in that of his intemperance he has accused him of writing plays when he was drunk and now he accuses him of taking a bribe for writing them the man who believes the one may take the other into the bargain for his own part the improbability stares him so fully in the face that he immediately subjoins to his insinuation above quoted  that for the truth of this it was best known to aristophanes himself  this can never pass with any candid reader as for the success of the attack that he confesses was beyond all example the comedy was applauded to the skies never did any poet receive such honors from the public as aristophanes for this play of the clouds  as to the charge of the bribe i need not observe that if it was not an easy thing for any advocate of the poet to prove the negative in hadrians days when aelian threw it out it cannot be less difficult now to do it when more than two millenniums have interposed between the fact and our examination of it and yet we know that aristophanes in a short time after the representation of his clouds brought this very melitus who is supposed to have suborned him by a bribe before the audience and exposed his vicious character with the most unsparing severity if this is not proving a negative it is as near it as circumstance and presumption can go  but there is another part of aelians charge which can be more clearly disproved than the above and this is the assertion he advances that this attack upon socrates from the stage was contrived by anytus and melitus as a prelude to their criminal accusation of him this aelian expressly asserts adding that the faction were afraid of his popularity and therefore set aristophanes upon him to feel the pulse of the people before they ventured to bring their public charge against him here he atly confutes himself for had this been the proving attack what experiment could answer more completely when even by his own account all athens was in raptures with the poet and the comedy went off with more general applause than any was ever known to receive nay more than this socrates himself according to aelians own account was present in the theater and stood up in view of the people all the while yet in spite of his presence in defiance of this bold appeal the theater rung with plaudits and the philosopher only stood up to be a more conspicuous mark of raillery and contempt why then did not the faction seize the opportunity and second the blow could any thing answer more fully to their wishes or rather could any event turn out more beyond their expectation from aelians account we are left to conclude that this was the case and that this attack was literally a prelude to their charge but this inference is alike disingenuous with all the rest for we know from indubitable dates that the clouds were acted at least eighteen years before the death of socrates it was in the first year of olymp lxxxix when isarchus was archon that aristophanes acted his first comedy of the clouds which was driven off the stage by alcibiades and his party in the year immediately following when aminias was archon he brought out the second of that name which is the comedy in question now in our hands these are authentic records take the earliest date for the death of socrates and it will not fall till the first year of olymp xcv when laches was archon the interval is as i state it a pretty reasonable time for such a plot to be ripening and who now will give credit to aelian and his various history  having taken some pains to prove what aristophaness motives were not it now remains to show what they were but this will be the subject of another paper  no lxxvii the clouds is a satirical and personal comedy the moral of which is to show how the sophistry of the schools may be employed as an instrument of fraud and evasion in matters of right and property this is its principal object but it touches also upon other points by the way and humorously exposes certain new and chimerical notions about the relation of children to their parents and of the influence of the clouds as superior to the superintending power of jupiter  of its moral therefore separately considered comprehending the chief duties and relations of men whether to the gods to their parents or to society at large there can be no doubt its excellence and importance speak for themselves  the comedy being written before the practice was restrained of bringing living characters on the stage a school is here introduced and the greatest philosopher of the time is represented in person on the stage this philosopher is socrates himself and the school is the school of socrates  socrates is made to advance the hypothesis of the clouds before mentioned but it should be constantly kept in remembrance that he lays down no doctrines as principles of fraud or injustice it is not the teacher who recommends but his disciples who pervert his instructions to the evil purpose of defrauding and cluding their creditors the like remark holds good in the case of the natural duty of children to their parents the son in the play it is true strikes and beats his father on the stage and he quotes the maxims of socrates in justification but he does not quote them as positive rules and injunctions for an act so atrocious he only shows that sophistry may be turned to defend that or any other thing equally violent and outrageous  there are two lights in which socrates is to be viewed first in his public character as a teacher secondly in his private one as a man it is chiefly in the former of these that aristophanes has attacked him and as i before observed it is to expose the evil uses rather than the evil nature of his doctrines that he brings his school upon the stage for when the disciple is questioned about the studies which his master is employed in he makes report of some frivolous and minute researches which are introduced only for the purpose of raising a harmless laugh and so far there can be no offense in this scene  after all it must be allowed that these seminaries of sophistry which the state of athens thought it necessary to put down by public edict could not have been improper subjects for dramatic ridicule for if the schools were found so detrimental to the morals of youth that the archons and their council after due deliberation resolved upon a general expulsion of all masters and teachers thereunto belonging and effectually did expel them surely the poet may be acquitted when he satirizes those obnoxious parties whom the laws of his country in a short time after cut off from the community  there can be little doubt but this was a public measure founded in wisdom if it were for no other reason than that the lacedaemonians never suffered a master of philosophy to open school within their realm and jurisdiction holding them in abhorrence and proscribing their academies as seminaries of evil manners and tending to the corruption of youth it is well known what peculiar care and attention were bestowed upon the education of the spartan youth and how much more moral this people was who admitted no philosophers to settle amongst them than their athenian neighbors in whose dissolute capital they swarmed in fact the enormity became too great to be redressed the whole community was infected with the enthusiasm of these sectaries and the liberties of athens which depended on the public virtue of her citizens fell a sacrifice to the corruptions of false philosophy the wiser lacedaemonians saw the fatal error of their rivals and availed themselves of its consequences they rose upon the ruins of athens and it was the triumph of wisdom over wit these philosophers were ingenious men but execrable citizens and when the raillery of the stage was turned against them the weapons of ridicule could not be more laudably employed  as for the school of socrates in particular though it may be a fashion to extol it there is no reason to believe it was in better credit than any other on the contrary it was in such public disrepute on account of the infamous characters of many of his disciples and of the disgraceful attachments he was known to have that it was at one time deserted by every body except aeschines the parasite of the tyrant dionysius and the most worthless man living this aeschines his sole and favorite disciple was arraigned by the pleader lysias and convicted of the vilest frauds and branded as a public cheat he was a wretch who employed the sophistry and cunning argumentation which he learnt of his master to the purpose only of evading his debts contracted by the most profligate extravagancies he afterwaads went over to the school of plato and when socrates was dead had influence enough with xantippe to obtain of her some dialogues from her husbands papers which he published as his own and set up for an author and preceptor in philosophy it is very probable aristophanes had in view the character of this very aeschines when he brings his old man on the scene consulting socrates for sophistical evasions how to elude his creditors  another of the scholars of socrates was simon the sophist a man whose rapacity became a proverb  simoni rapacior this simon was such a plunderer of the public money that aristophanes in his strong manner says the very wolves run off upon the sight of simon  the despicable cleonymus whose cowardice was as proverbial as simons rapacity and the profligate theorus who buried himself in the stews at corinth were also fellow students under socrates and it is with just indignation against such execrable characters that aristophanes exclaims  o jupiter if thy bolts are aimed at perjury why do these wretches of all most perjured simon cleonymus and theorus escape the stroke    aristippus the cyrenaic founder was a distinguished disciple of the socratic school a parasite also in the court of dionysius a buffoon and drunkard the avowed opposer of every thing virtuous a master and professor of immorality who laid down institutes of sensuality and reduced it to a system  of alcibiades i shall briefly speak for the stories of socratess attachment to him are such as need not be enlarged upon they obtained so generally that he was vulgarly called alcibiadess silesius when i glance at these reports in disfavour of a character which probably stands so high in the opinion of the learned reader i must hope for a candid interpretation of my motives for collecting these anecdotes which i do not wish to apply to any other purpose than merely to show that aristophanes was not singular in his attack upon this celebrated philosopher neither did this attack bear so hard against him as many stories then in general circulation otherwise did great authorities have ascribed his attachment to alcibiades to the most virtuous principle common fame or perhaps more properly speaking common defamation turned it into a charge of the impurest nature in like manner we find him ridiculed for his devotion to the noted aspasia in whose company he is said to have passed much of his time and athenaeus quotes some passages of his dialogues with her which he tells us were published by herodicus and which we must either totally reject or allow him to have been subject to such private weaknesses and frailties as were very unsuitable to his public character what were the real motives for his frequent visits to aspasia as well as for his seeming attachment to the strumpet theodote must be left to conjecture of the fact there is no room to doubt he is stigmatized for his guilty connections in his youth with his preceptor archelaus and yet this charge however improbable it may seem rests upon the authority of aristoxenus a man of the most candid character and whose credit stands high with all true critics herodicus the historian whom i have before mentioned and who lived about three hundred and fifty years before the christian era seems to have treated socrates with the greatest severity charging him with sitting up all night drinking and carousing with agatho and others whom when he had left drunk and asleep he reeled into the lyceum more fit in the words quoted from the relater for the society of homers cannibals than of those he found there in this debauch it is pretended that although phedrus eryximachus and many other potent drinkers fled the company socrates sat to the last swallowing drenches of wine out of enormous goblets of silver he describes him sitting amongst lascivious revellers at a banquet where dancinggirls and boys were exhibiting their indecent attitudes to the music of harpers and minstrels he exposes this master of morality entering into a controversy with his scholar critobulus upon the subject of male beauty and because critobulus had ridiculed him for his ugliness he asserts that socrates challenged him to a naked exhibition and that he actually exposed his unseemly person to a pathic and a dancinggirl the appointed umpires of the dispute the conqueror was to be rewarded with an embrace from each of these umpires as the prize of superior beauty and the decision was of consequence given ex absurdo to the philosopher in preference to one of the handsomest young men in greece and he enjoyed the prize annexed to the decree if we can believe this anecdote to have been gravely related by an historian who lived so near to him in point of time we shall cease to wonder that aristophanes had the whole theater on his side when such stories were in circulation against the character of socrates  as i have no other object in view but to offer what occurs to me in defense of aristophanes who appears to have been most unjustly accused of taking bribes for his attack upon socrates and of having paved the way for the cruel sentence by which he suffered death i shall here conclude an invidious task which my subject not my choice has laid upon me  in our volume of aristophanes the comedies are not placed according to the order of time in which they were produced there is reason to think that the acharnensians was the first of its author it was acted in the last year of olymp lxxxv when the edict was reversed which prohibited the representation of comedies and it is said that aristophanes brought it out in the name of callistratus the comedian  in the last year of olymp lxxxviii he produced his comedy of the knights in which he personally attacks the tribune cleon  in the first year of olymp lxxxix he produced his first comedy of the clouds and in the year following his second of that title which is now in our hands and ranks as third in the volume  in the same year was acted his comedy of the wasps in which he satirizes the general chares for his conduct in the unfortunate expedition to sicily  in the fourth year of olymp xc we may place his comedy entitled the peace in the first of olymp xci the lysistrata and in the second of the same olympiad that of the birds  the thesmophoriagusae or cerealia celebrantes and concionatrices fall within the period of olymp xcii before the death of euripides who is satirized in the former of these pieces  the frogs were performed in the last year of olymp xciii after the death of euripides  the plutus which completes the eleven comedies still remaining and the last to which he prefixed his own name was produced in the fourth year of olymp xcvii  it is generally supposed that we owe these remains of aristophanes to st chrysostom who happily rescued this valuable though small portion of his favorite author from his more scrupulous christian contemporaries whose zeal was fatally too successful in destroying every other comic author out of a very numerous collection of which no one entire scene now remains  no lxxviii i shall now proceed to mention some other principal writers of the old comedy of whose works though once the favorites of the athenian stage few memorials survive and these so small and imperfect and withal so separated from each other consisting only of short quotations in the scholiasts and grammarians that it is a task to collect them which nothing would compensate but the hope of being in some degree the instrument of saving from absolute extinction the names of authors once so illustrious  amipsias was a contemporary of aristophanes and no mean rival we have the titles of ten comedies of this author in some of these his satire was personal but all of them seem by their titles to have been levelled against the reigning vices of his time such as the gamesters the glutton the beard in which he inveighed against the hypocrisy and affectation of the priests and philosophers the adulterers the sappho wherein the morals of the fair sex were exposed the purse a second attack upon the gamesters and the philosophers cloak in which it is understood he glanced pretty severely at socrates  plato was a comic poet high in time and character a collection of no less than forty titles of his comedies has been made by the learned meursius but very few fragments of these are remaining clemens asserts that aristophanes and plato were mutually charged of borrowing from each other which in one sense makes greatly to the reputation of our poet he is quoted by plutarch in his alcibiades and very honorably mentioned by the famous galen by athenaeus clemens julius pollux and suidas there is a fragment containing four lines and a half upon a statue of mercury cut by daedalus which has an epigrammatic neatness and point in it that induced me to render it in rhyme he addresses the statue mistaking it for a living figure hoa there who art thou answer me  art dumb  warm from the hand of daedalus i come my name mercurius and as you may prove a statue but his statues speak and move   plato wrote a comedy personally against the general cleophon and called it by his name there are others of the same description in his catalogue and some of the middle sort there are a few lines upon the tomb of themistocles which have a turn of elegant and pathetic simplicity in them that deserves a better translation than i can give  on the tomb of themistocles by the seas margin on the watery strand thy monument themistocles shall stand by this directed to thy native shore the merchant shall convey his freighted store and when our fleets are summoned to the fight athens shall conquer with thy tomb in sight the following fragment of a dialogue between a father and a sophist under whose tuition he had placed his son probably belonged either to the comedy called the beard or the philosophers cloak it is pretty much in the spirit of our old english drama  father thou have destroyed the morals of my son and turned his mind not so disposed to vice unholy pedagogue with morning drams a filthy custom which he caught from thee clean from his former practice now he saps his youthful vigor is it thus you school him  sophist and if i did what harms him why complain you he does but follow what the wise prescribe the great voluptuous law of epicurus pleasure the best of all good things on earth and how but thus can pleasure be obtained  father virtue will give it him  sophist and what but virtue is our philosophy when have you met one of our sect flushed and disguised with wine or one but one of those you tax so roundly on whom to fix a fault  father not one but all all who march forth with supercilious brow higharchd with pride beating the cityrounds like constables in quest of rogues and outlaws to find that prodigy in human nature a wise and perfect man what is your science but kitchenscience wisely to descant upon the choice bits of a savoury carp and prove by logic that his summum bonum lies in his head there you can lecture well and whilst your gray beards wag the gaping guest sits wondering with a foolish face of praise  plato com crates by birth an athenian was first an actor and afterward a writer of the old comedy he performed the principal characters in cratinuss plays and was the great rival of aristophaness favorite actors callistratus and philonides we have the titles of more than twenty comedies and but four small fragments of this author i have searched for his remains more diligently from the circumstance of his having been so celebrated an actor a profession which centers in itself more gifts of nature education art and study than any other his comedies are said to have been of a very gay and facetious cast and the author of the prolegomena to aristophanes informs us that he was the first who introduced a drunken character on the athenian stage to this anecdote i give credit because no one could better know how entirely such an attempt depends upon the discretion and address of the actor who has such a part in his keeping it is plain the experiment succeeded because even the tragedians exhibited such characters in succeeding times modern experience shows us how subject such representations are to be outraged the performer generally forgetting or not knowing that his own sobriety should keep the drunkenness he counterfeits within its proper bounds aristotle ascribes to crates another innovation with respect to the iambic meter of the old comedy which he made more free and apposite to familiar dialogue this also corresponds with the natural and facetious character of his drama i cannot say the four small fragments which i have collected bear that stamp on the contrary they are of a grave and sententious cast one of them is an observation on the effects of poverty which horace has either literally translated or struck upon the very same thoughts in the following passage non habet infelix paupertas durius in se quam quod ridiculos homines facit   i find a short stricture upon the gluttony of the thessalians a remark upon the indecorum of inviting women to wedding suppers and making riotous entertainments at a ceremony which modesty would recommend to pass in private and within the respective family where it occurs  the last fragment is a short but touching picture of old age and the vanity of human wishes i think the turn of thought and expression extremely beautiful  on old age these shrivelled sinews and this bending frame the workmanship of times strong hand proclaim skilled to reverse whatever the gods create and make that crooked which they fashion straight hard choice for man to die  or else to be that tottering wretched wrinkled thing you see age then we all prefer for age we pray and travel on to lifes last lingering day then sinking slowly down from worse to worse find heavens extorted boon our greatest curse crates phrynichus was a contemporary of eupolis and a writer of the old comedy a dramatic poet of the first class in reputation as well as in time he was an athenian by birth and must not be confounded with the tragic poet of that name i find the titles of ten comedies of his writing these are the ephialtes the beard the same title with that of plato saturn the revellers the satyrs the tragedians the recluse the muses the priest and the weedingwomen we have no other guides but these titles to guess at the comedies themselves we see however by some of them what subjects his satire pointed out to the spectators in which the philosophers had their share as usual and by certain fragments it appears that alcibiades was also treated with some personal severity  pherecrates is the next author i shall notice a poet famous in his time and whose character as well as genius descends to us with the warmest testimonies of high authority his style was of that sort which has been proverbially dignified as most attic he acquired such reputation by his poems as well as plays that the meter he used was called by preeminence the pherecratian meter he was no less excellent in his private character than in his poetical one he was attached to alexander of macedon and accompanied that great conqueror in his expeditions he lived in intimacy with plato at athens and in some of his comedies was engaged in warm competition with crates the actor and author of whom i have already spoken suidas says he wrote seventeen comedies and the titles of these are still extant one of them viz the peasants is mentioned by plato in his protagoras clemens quotes a passage from his deserters of great elegance in which the gods are introduced making heavy complaints of the frauds put upon them by mankind in their sacrifices and oblations this poet also has a personal stroke at the immoral character of alcibiades  having quoted a passage from crates on the subject of old age i shall now select one from this author on the same and if the reader is curious to observe how these celebrated rivals expressed themselves on a similar sentiment he has an opportunity of making the comparison  on old age age is the heaviest burden man can bear compound of disappointment pain and care for when the minds experience comes at length it comes to mourn the bodys loss of strength resigned to ignorance all our better days knowledge just ripens when the man decays one ray of light the closing eye receives and wisdom only takes what folly leaves pherecrates pherecrates entitled one of his comedies the tyranny it does not appear what particular object he had in view under this title but from the following fragment he seems to have levelled some share of his satire against the fair sex  remark how wisely ancient art provides the broadbrimmd cup with flat expanded sides a cup contrived for mans discreeter use and sober potions of the generous juice but womans more ambitious thirsty soul soon longed to revel in the plenteous bowl deep and capacious as the swelling hold of some stout bark she shaped the hollow mould then turning out a vessel like a tun simpring exclaimed  observe i drink but one pherecrates  athenaeus has preserved a considerable fragment from this author extracted from his comedy of the miners which i look upon to be as curious a specimen of the old comedy as i have met with it is a very luxuriant description of the riches and abundance of some former times to which he alludes strongly dashed with comic strokes of wild extravagance and hyperbole these miners were probably the chorus of the drama which no doubt was of a satirical sort and pointed at the luxuries of the rich by the mention made of plutus in the first line we may suppose that these mines were of gold and probably the deity of that precious metal was one of the persons of the drama  from the miners of pherecrates the days of plutus were the days of gold the season of high feeding and good cheer rivers of goodly beef and brewis ran boiling and bubbling through the steaming streets with islands of fat dumplings cut in sops and slippery gobbets molded into mouthfuls that dead men might have swallowed floating tripes and fleets of sausages in luscious morsels stuck to the banks like oysters here and there for relishers a saltfish seasoned high swam down the savoury tide when soon behold the portly gammon sailing in full state upon his smoking platter heaves in sight encompassed with his bandoliers like guards and convoyed by huge bowls of frumenty that with their generous odours scent the air  you stagger me to tell of these good days and yet to live with us on our hard fare when deaths a deed as easy as to drink if your mouth waters now what had it done could you have seen our delicate fine thrushes hot from the spit with myrtleberries crammed and larded well with celandine and parsley bob at your hungry lips crying  come eat me nor was this all for pendant overhead the fairest choicest fruits in clusters hung girls too young girls just budding into bloom clad in transparent vests stood near at hand to serve us with fresh roses and full cups of rich and fragrant wine of which one glass no sooner was dispatched than strait behold two goblets fresh and sparkling as the first provoked us to repeat the increasing draught away then with your ploughs we need them not your scythes your sickles and your pruning hooks away with all your trumpery at once seedtime and harvesthome and vintage wakes  your holidays are nothing worth to us our rivers roll with luxury our vats overflow with nectar which providing jove showers down by cataracts the very gutters from our housetops spout wine vast forests wave whose very leaves drop fatness smoking viands like mountains rise  all natures one great feast amphis the son of amphicrates an athenian was a celebrated comic poet we have the titles of one and twenty comedies and he probably wrote many more by these titles it appears that he wrote in the satirical vein of the old comedy and i meet with a stroke at his contemporary plato the philosopher he has a play entitled the seven chiefs against thebes which is probably a parody upon aeschylus and proves that he wrote after the personal drama was prohibited there is another called the dicers and by several scattered passages he appears to have exposed the persons of drunkards gamesters courtesans parasites and other vicious characters of his time with great moral severity there are also two comedies entitled womens love and womens tyranny  hermippus was a writer of the old comedy and an athenian no less than forty comedies are given to this author by suidas he attacks pericles for his dissolute morals and in one of his plays calls him king of the satyrs advising him to assume the proper attributes of his lascivious character he was the son of lysides and the brother of myrtilus a comic writer also  hipparchus philonides and theopompus complete the list of poets of the old comedy philonides before he became a votary of the muse followed the trade of a fuller and if we are to take the word of aristophanes was a very silly vulgar fellow illiterate to a proverb athenaeus and stobaeus have however given us some short quotations which by no means favor this account and it is probable there was more satire than truth in aristophaness character of him theopompus is described as a man of excellent morals and though he was long afflicted with a defluxion in his eyes which put him from his studies time has preserved the titles of twentyfour comedies of his composing very little remains upon record either of him or his works  one short fragment of philonides is all that remains of his works and it is a specimen which convinces me that we must not always take the character of a poet from a contemporary wit engaged in the same studies fragment of philonides because i hold the laws in due respect and fear to be unjust am i a coward meek let me be to all the friends of truth and only terrible amongst its foes  soli aequus virtuti atque ejus amicis i now take leave of what is properly called the old comedy in the further prosecution of this work if that shall be permitted to me it is my intention to review the writers of the middle and conclude with those of the new comedy  no lxxix prejudice is so wide a word that if we would have ourselves understood we must always use some auxiliary term with it to define our meaning thus when we speak of national prejudices prejudices of education or religious prejudices by compounding our expression we convey ideas very different from each other  national prejudice is by some called a virtue but the virtue of it consists only in the proper application and moderate degree of it it must be confessed a happy attachment which can reconcile the laplander to his freezing snows and the african to his scorching sun there are some portions of the globe so partially endowed by providence with climate and productions that were it not for this prejudice to the natale solum the greater part of the habitable world would be a scene of envy and repining national predilection is in this sense a blessing and perhaps a virtue but if it operates otherwise than in the best sense of its definition it perverts the judgment and in some cases vitiates the heart it is an old saying that charity begins at home but this is no reason it should not go abroad a man should live with the world as a citizen of the world he may have a preference for the particular quarter or square or even alley in which he lives but he should have a generous feeling for the welfare of the whole and if in his rambles through this great city the world he may chance upon a man of a different habit language or complexion from his own still he is a fellowcitizen a short sojourner in common with himself subject to the same wants infirmities and necessities and one that has a brothers claim upon him for his charity candor and relief it were to be wished no traveller would leave his own country without these impressions and it would be still better if all who live in it would adopt them but as an observer of mankind let me speak it to the honor of my countrymen i have very little to reproach them with on this account it would be hard if a nation more addicted to travel than any other in europe had not rubbed off this rust of the soul in their excursions and collisions it would be an indelible reproach if a people so blessed at home were not benevolent abroad our ingenious neighbors the french are less agreeable guests than hosts i am afraid their national prejudices reach a little beyond candor in most cases and they are too apt to indulge a vanity which does not become so enlightened a nation by shutting their eyes against every light except their own but i do a violence to my feelings when i express myself unfavourably of a people with whom we have long been implicated in the most honorable of all connections the mutual pursuits of literary fame and a glorious emulation in arts and sciences  prejudices of education are less dangerous than religious prejudices less common than national ones and more excusable than any in general they are little else than ridiculous habits which cannot obtain much in a country where public education prevails and such as a commerce with the world can hardly fail to cure they are characteristic of seraglio princes the property of sequestered beings who live in celibacy and retirement contracted in childhood and confirmed by age a man who has passed his life on shipboard will pace the length of his quarter deck on the terrace before his house were it a mile in length  these are harmless peculiarities but it is obvious to experience that prejudices of a very evil nature may be contracted by habits of education and the very defective state of the police which is suffered yet to go on without reform in and about our capital furnishes too many examples of our fatal inattention to the morals of our infant poor amongst the many wretched culprits who suffer death by the law how many are there who when standing at the bar to receive sentence of execution might urge this plea in extenuation of their guilt  this action which you are pleased to term criminal i have been taught to consider as meritorious the arts of fraud and thieving by which i gained my living are arts instilled into me by my parents habits wherein i was educated from my infancy a trade to which i was regularly bred if these are things not to be allowed of and a violation of the laws it behoved the laws to prevent them rather than to punish them for i cannot see the equity of putting me to death for actions which if your police had taken any charge of me in my infancy i never had committed if you would secure yourselves from receiving wrong you should teach us not to do wrong and this might easily be effected if you had any eye upon your parish poor for my part i was born and bred in the parish of saint giles my parents kept a shop for the retail of gin and old rags christening i had none a church i never entered and no parish officer ever visited our habitation if he had done so he would have found a seminary of thieves and pickpockets a magazine of stolen goods a house of call where nightly depredators met together to compare accounts and make merry over their plunder amongst these and by these i was educated i obeyed them as my masters and i looked up to them as my examples i believed them to be great men i heard them recount their actions with glory i saw them die like heroes and i attended their executions with triumph it is now my turn to suffer and i hope i shall not prove myself unworthy of the calling in which i have been brought up if there be any fault in my conduct the fault is yours for being the child of poverty i was the son of the public if there be any honor it is my own for i have acted up to my instructions in all things and faithfully fulfilled the purposes of my education i cannot excuse myself from touching upon one more prejudice which may be called natural or selfprejudice under correction of the dampers i hope i may be allowed to say that a certain portion of this is a good quickener in all constitutions being seasonably applied it acts like the spur in the wing of the ostrich and keeps industry awake being of the nature of all volatiles and provocatives the merit of it consists in the moderation and discretion which administer it if a man rightly knows himself he may be called wise if he justly confides in himself he may be accounted happy but if he keeps both this knowledge and this confidence to himself he will neither be less wise nor less happy for so doing if there are any secrets which a man ought to keep from his nearest friends this is one of them if there were no better reason why a man should not vaunt himself but because it is robbing the poor mountebanks of their livelihood methinks it would be reason enough if he must think aloud upon such occasions let him lock himself into his closet and take it out in soliloquy if he likes the sound of his own praises there and can reconcile himself to the belief of them it will then be time enough to try their effect upon other people  ventidius is the modestest of all men he blushes when he sees himself applauded in the public papers he has a better reason for blushing than the world is aware of he knows himself to be the author of what he reads  it seems a matter pretty generally agreed between all tellers and hearers of stories that one party shall work by the rule of addition and the other by that of substraction in most narratives where the relater is a party in the scene i have remarked that the saysi has a decided advantage in a dialogue over the sayshe few people take an underpart in their own fable there is a salvo however which some gentlemen make use of but i cannot recommend it of hooking in a word to their own advantage with the preface of i think i may say without vanity  and after all if it was not for the vanity of it there would be no need to say it at all  i knew a gentleman who possessed more real accomplishments than fall to one mans lot in a thousand he was an excellent painter a fine musician a good scholar and more than all a very worthy man  but he could not ride it so happened that upon a mornings airing i detected him in the attempt of mounting on the back of a little pony no taller than his whip and as quiet as a lamb two stout fellows held the animal by the head whilst my friend was performing a variety of very ingenious maneuvers for lodging himself upon the saddle by the aid of a stirrup which nearly touched the ground i am afraid i smiled when i ought not so to have done for it is certain it gave offense to my worthy friend who soon after joined me on his pony which he assured me was remarkably vicious particularly at mounting but that he had been giving him some proper discipline which he doubted not would cure him of his evil tricks for you may think what you please adds he of my painting or my music or any other little talent you are pleased to credit me for the only art which i really pique myself upon  is the art of riding  no lxxx to the observer sir i am a plain man without pretensions and lead a retired life in the country the sports of the season a small farm which i hold in my own hands and a pretty good kitchen garden in which i take amusement with the help of a few english books have hitherto made my life though it is that of a bachelor pass off with more than tolerable comfort by this account of my time you will perceive that most of my enjoyments depend upon the weather and though the wearandtear of age may have made me more sensible to the seasons than i have been yet i cannot help thinking that our climate in england is as much altered for the worse as my constitution may be i do not pretend to reason upon natural causes but speak upon observation only for by an exact journal of my time which i keep more for a check upon my actions than for any importance which appertains to them i can find that i am obliged to my books for helping me through more rainy hours in the course of years last past than i have been accustomed to be or indeed than i could wish for you must know i never read when i can amuse myself out of doors  my studies are but trifling for i am no scholar but in bad weather and dark evenings they have served to fill up time a very little discouragement however suffices to put me out of conceit with my books and i have thoughts of laying them totally on the shelf as soon as ever i can provide some harmless substitute in their place this you see is not so easy for me to do being a solitary man and one that hates drinking especially by myself add to this that i smoke no tobacco and have more reasons than i choose to explain against engaging in the nuptial state my housekeeper it is true is a decent conversible woman and plays a good game at allfours and i had begun to fill up an hour in her company till i was surprised unawares by a neighbor who is a wag and has never ceased jeering me upon it ever since i took next to making nets for my current bushes but alas i have worked myself out of all employ and am got weary of the trade i have thought of making fishingrods but i have a neighbor so tenacious of his trout that i should only breed a quarrel and fish in troubled waters were i to attempt it to make short of my story sir i have been obliged after many efforts to go back to my books though i have lost all the little relish i had for them ever since i have been honored with the visits of a learned gentleman who is lately settled in my neighborhood he must be a prodigious scholar for i believe in my conscience he knows every thing that ever was written and every body that ever writes he has taken a world of kind pains i must confess to set me right in a thousand things that i was ignorant enough to be pleased with he is a finespoken man and in spite of my stupidity has the patience to convince me of the faults and blunders of every author in his turn when he shows them to me i see them as clear as day and never take up the book again he has now gone pretty nearly through my whole nest of shelves pointing out as he proceeds what i like a fool never saw before nor ever should have seen but for him i used to like a spectator now and then and generally sought out for clio which i was told were mr addisons papers but i have been in a gross mistake to lose my time with a man that cannot write common english for my friend has proved this to me out of a fine book three times as big as the spectator and which is more this great book is made by a foreign gentleman who writes and speaks clear another language from mr addison surely he must be a dunce indeed who is to be taught his mother tongue by a stranger i was apt to be tickled with some of our english poets dryden and pope and milton and one gray that turns out to be a very contemptible fellow truly for he has shown me all their secret histories in print written by a learned man greater than them all put together and now i would not give a rush for one of them i could find in my heart to send bell and all his books to the devil as for all the writers now living my neighbor who by the way has a hand in reviewing their works assures me he can make nothing of them and indeed i wonder that a man of his genius will have any thing to say to them it was my custom to read a chapter or two in the bible on a sunday night but there i am wrong again i shall not enter upon the subject here but it will not do that i am convinced of sir it positively will not do  the reason of my writing to you at all is only to let you know that i received a volume of your observer by the coach my friend has cast his eye over it and i have returned it by the wagon which he says is the fittest conveyance for waste paper  i am sir your humble servant rusticus   i shall give no other answer to my correspondent but to lament his loss of so innocent a resource as reading which i suspect his new acquirements will hardly compensate i still think that half an hour passed with mr addison over a spectator notwithstanding all his false grammar or even with one of the poets notwithstanding their infirmities might be as well employed as in weaving nets for the currantbushes or playing at allfours with his housekeeper no man has a right to complain of the critic whose sagacity discovers inaccuracies in a favorite author and some readers may probably be edified by such discoveries but the bulk of them like my correspondent rusticus will get nothing but disgust by the information every mans work is fair game for the critic but let the critic beware that his own production is not open to retaliation as for our late ingenious biographer of the poets when i compare his life of savage with that of gray i must own he has exalted the low and brought down the lofty with what justice he has done this the world must judge on the part of our authors now living whom the learned gentleman in the letter condemns in the lump i have only this to observe that the worse they fare now the better they will succeed with posterity for the critics love the sport too well to hunt any but those who can stand a good chase and authors are the only objects in nature which are magnified by distance and diminished by approach let the illustrious dead change places with the illustrious living and they shall escape no better than they have done who make room for them the more merit they bring amongst us the heavier the tax they shall pay for it  let us suppose for a moment that shakespeare was now an untried poet and opened his career with any one of his best plays the next morning ushers into the world the following or something like the following critique  last night was presented for the first time a tragedy called othello or the moor of venice avowedly the production of mr william shakespeare the actor this gentlemans reputation in his profession is of the mediocre sort and we predict that his present tragedy will not add much to it in any way  mediocribus esse poetis  the reader can supply the rest  verb sap as we profess ourselves to be friendly to the players in general we shall reserve our fuller critique of this piece till after its third night for we hold it very stuff of the conscience to use mr shakespeares own words not to war against the poets purse though we might apply the authors quaint conceit to himself  who steals his purse steals trash it is something nothing in this last reply we agree with mr shakespeare that it is nothing and our philosophy tells us ex nihilo nihil fit  for the plot of this tragedy the most we can say is that it is certainly of the moving sort for it is here and there and every where a kind of theatrical hocuspocus a creature of the pyeball breed like jacobs muttons between a black ram and a white ewe it brought to our mind the childrens game of  i love my love with an a  with this difference only that the young lady in this play loves her love with a b because he is black  risum teneatis  there is one iago a bloodyminded fellow who stabs men in the dark behind their backs now this is a thing we hold to be most vile and evertobe abhorred othello smothers his white wife in bed our readers may think this a shabby kind of an action for a general of his high calling but we beg leave to observe that it shows some spirit at least in othello to attack the enemy in her strong quarters at once there was an incident of a pockethandkerchief which othello called out for most lustily and we were rather sorry that his lady could not produce it as we might then have seen one handkerchief at least employed in the tragedy there were some vernacular phrases which caught our ear such as where the black damns his wife twice in a breath  oh damn her damn her  which we thought savoured more of the language spoken at the doors than within the doors of the theater but when we recollect that the author used to amuse a leisure hour with calling up gentlemens coaches after the play was over before he was promoted to take a part in it we could readily account for old habits though we have seen many gentlemen and ladies kill themselves on the stage yet we must give the author credit for the new way in which his hero puts himself out of the world othello having smothered his wife and being taken up by the officers of the state prepares to dispatch himself and escape from the hands of justice to bring this about he begins a story about his killing a man in aleppo which he illustrates par example by stabbing himself and so winds up his story and his life in the same moment the author made his appearance in the person of one brabantio an old man who makes his first entry from a window this occasioned some risibility in the audience the part is of an inferior kind and mr shakespeare was more indebted to the exertions of his brethren than to his own for carrying his play through upon the whole we do not think the passion of jealousy on which the plot turns so proper for tragedy as comedy and we would recommend to the author if his piece survives its nine nights to cut it down to a farce and serve it up to the public cum mica salis in that shape after this specimen of mr william shakespeares tragic powers we cannot encourage him to pursue his attempts upon melpomene for there is a good old proverb which we would advise him to bear in mind  ne suitor ultra crepidam  if he applies to his friend ben he will turn it into english for him  no lxxxi the conduct of a young lady who is the only daughter of a very worthy father and some alarming particulars respecting her situation which had come to my knowledge gave occasion to me for writing my paper no xlvi in which i endeavor to point out the consequences parents have to apprehend from novels which though written upon moral plans may be apt to take too strong a hold upon young and susceptible minds especially in the softer sex and produce an affected character where we wish to find a natural one  as the young person in question is now happily extricated from all danger and has seen her error i shall relate her story not only as it contains some incidents which are amusing but as it tends to illustrate by example the several instructions which in my paper before mentioned i endeavored to convey  sappho is the only child of clemens who is a widower a passionate fondness for this daughter tempered with a very small share of observation or knowledge of the world determined clemens to an attempt which has seldom been found to succeed of rendering sappho a miracle of accomplishments by putting her under the instructions of masters in almost every art and science at one and the same time his house now became an academy of musicians dancingmasters languagemasters drawingmasters geographers historians and a variety of inferior artists male and female all these studies appeared the more desirable to clemens from his own ignorance of them having devoted his life to business of a very different nature sappho made just as much progress in each as is usual with young ladies so attended she could do a little of most of them and talk of all she could play a concerto by heart with every grace her master had taught her note for note with the precise repetition of a barrelorgan she had stuck the room round with drawings which clemens praised to the skies and which sappho assured him had been only touched up a little by her master she could tell the capital of every country when he questioned her out of the newspaper and would point out the very spot upon the terrestrial globe where paris madrid naples and constantinople actually were to be found she had as much french as puzzled clemens and would have served her to buy blondelace and paris netting at a french milliners nay she had gone so far as to pen a letter in that language to a young lady of her acquaintance which her master who stood over her whilst she wrote it declared to be little inferior in style to madame sevignes in history both ancient and modern her progress was proportionable for she could run through the twelve caesars in a breath and reckon up all the kings from the conquest upon her fingers without putting one out of place this appeared a prodigy to clemens and in the warmth of his heart he fairly told her she was one of the worlds wonders sappho aptly set him right in this mistake by assuring him that there were but seven wonders in the world all of which she repeated to him and only left him more convinced that she herself was deservedly the eighth  there was a gentleman about fifty years old a friend of clemens who came frequently to his house and being a man of talents and leisure was so kind as to take great pains in directing and bringing sappho forward in her studies this was a very acceptable service to clemens and the visits of musidorus were always joyfully welcomed both by him and sappho herself musidorus declared himself overpaid by the delight it gave him to contemplate the opening talents of so promising a young lady and as sappho was now of years to establish her pretensions to taste and sentiment musidorus made such a selection of authors for her reading as were best calculated to accomplish her in those particulars in settling this important choice he was careful to put none but writers of delicacy and sensibility into her hands interesting and affecting tales or novels were the books he chiefly recommended which by exhibiting the fairest patterns of female purity suffering distress and even death itself from the attacks of licentious passion in the grosser sex might inspire her sympathetic heart with pity and guard it from seduction by displaying profligacy in its most odious colors  sapphos propensity to these studies fully answered the intentions of her kind director and she became more and more attached to works of sentiment and pathos musidoruss next solicitude was to form her style and with this view he took upon himself the trouble of carrying on a kind of probationary correspondence with her this happy expedient succeeded beyond expectation for as two people who saw each other every day could have very little matter to write upon there was so much the more exercise for invention and such was the copiousness and fluency of expression which she became mistress of by this ingenious practice that she could fill four sides of letter paper with what other people express upon the back of a card clemens once in the exultation of his heart put a bundle of these manuscripts into my hands which he confessed he did not clearly understand but nevertheless believed them to be the most elegant things in the language i shall give the reader a sample of two of them which i drew out of the number not by choice but by chance they were carefully folded and labelled at the back in sapphos own hand as follows musidorus to sappho of the  0 th of june underneath she had wrote with a pencil these words picturesque  here follows the note and i cannot doubt but the reader will confess that its contents deserve all that the label expresses  june the  0th      as soon as i arose this morning i directed my eyes to the east and demanded of the sun if he had given you my good morrow this was my parting injunction last night when i took leave of him in the west and he this moment plays his beams with so particular a luster that i am satisfied he has fulfilled my commission and saluted the eyelids of sappho if he is described to come forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber how much rather may it be said of him when he comes forth out of yours i shall look for him to perform his journey this day with a peculiar glee i expect he will not suffer a cloud to come near him and i shall not be surprised if through his eagerness to repeat his next mornings salutation he should whip his fieryfooted steeds to the west some hours before their time unless indeed you should walk forth whilst he is descending and he should delay the wheels of his chariot to look back upon an object so pleasing you see therefore most amiable sappho that unless you fulfill your engagement and consent to repeat our usual ramble in the cool of the evening our part of the world is likely to be in darkness before it is expected and that nature herself will be put out of course if sappho forfeits her promise to musidorus   sappho in reply to musidorus if nature holds her course till sappho forfeits her word to musidorus neither the setting nor the rising sun shall vary from his appointed time but why does musidorus ascribe to me so flattering an influence when if i have any interest with apollo it must be to his good offices only that i owe it if he bears the messages of musidorus to me is it not a mark of his respect to the person who sends him rather than to her he is sent to and whom should he so willingly obey as one whom he so copiously inspires i shall walk as usual in the cool hour of eventide listening with greedy ear to that discourse which by the refined and elevated sentiments it inspires has taught me to look down with silent pity and contempt upon those frivolous beings who talk the mere language of the senses not of the soul and to whose silly prattle i neither condescend to lend an ear or to subscribe a word know then that sappho will reserve her attention for musidorus and if apollo shall delay the wheels of his chariot to wait upon us in our evening ramble believe me he will not stop for the unworthy purpose of looking back upon sappho but for the nobler gratification of listening to musidorus   the evening walk took place as usual but it was a walk in the dusty purlieus of london and sappho sighed for a cottage and the country musidorus seconded the sigh and he had abundance of fine things to say on the occasion retirement is a charming subject for a sentimental enthusiast there is not a poet in the language but will help him out with a description musidorus had them all at his fingers ends from hesperus that led the starry host down to a glowworm  the passion took so strong a hold of sapphos mind that she actually assailed her father on the subject and with great energy of persuasion moved him to adopt her ideas it did not exactly suit clemens to break up a very lucrative profession and set out in search of some solitary cottage whose romantic situation might suit the spiritualized desires of his daughter and i am afraid he was for once in his life not quite so respectful to her wishes as he might have been sappho was so unused to contradiction that she explained herself to musidorus with some asperity and it became the subject of much debate between them not that he held a contrary opinion from here is but the difficulty which embarrassed both parties was where to find the happy scene she sighed for and how to obtain it when it was found the first part of this difficulty was at last surmounted and the chosen spot was pointed out by musidorus which according to his description was the very bower of felicity it was in a northern county at a distance from the capital and its situation was most delectable the next measure was a strong one for the question to be decided was if sappho should abandon her project or her father she called upon musidorus for his opinion and he delivered it as follows  if i was not convinced most amiable sappho that a second application to clemens would be as unsuccessful as the first i would advise you to the experiment but as there is no doubt of this it must be the height of imprudence to put that to a trial of which there is no hope it comes therefore next to be considered if you shall give up your plan or execute it without his privity in other words if you shall or shall not do that which is to make you happy if it were not consistent with the strictest purity of character i should answer no but when i reflect upon the innocence the simplicity the moral beauty of the choice you make i then regard the duty you owe to yourself as superior to all others which are falsely called natural whereas if you follow this in preference you obey nature herself if you were of an age too childish to be allowed to know what suits you best or if being old enough to be entitled to a choice you wanted wit to make one there would be no doubt in the case nay i will go so far as to say that if clemens was a man of judgment superior to your own i should be staggered with his opposition but if truth may ever be spoken it may on this occasion and who is there that does not see the weakness of the fathers understanding who but must acknowledge the preeminence of the daughters i will speak yet plainer most incomparable sappho it is not fitting that folly should prescribe to wisdom the question therefore is come to an upshot shall sappho live a life she despises and detests to humor a father whose weakness she pities but whose judgment she cannot respect  no replied sappho that point is decided pass on to the next and speak to me upon the practicability of executing what i am resolved to attempt the authority of a parent resumed musidorus is such over an unprotected child that reason will be no defense to you against obstinacy and coercion in the case of a son profession gives that defense new duties are imposed by a mans vocation which supersede what are called natural ones but in the instance of a daughter where shall she fly for protection against the imperious control of a parent but to the arms  i tremble to pronounce the word your own imagination must complete the sentence  oh horrible cried sappho interrupting him i will never marry i will never so contaminate the spotless luster of my incorporeal purity no musidorus no  i will bear my blushing honors still about me  and fit you should cried musidorus what demon dare defile them perish the man that could intrude a sensual thought within the sphere of such repelling virtue  but marriage is a form and forms are pure at least they may be such there is no pollution in a name and if a name will shelter you why should you fear to take it  i perceive answered sappho that i am in a very dangerous dilemma since the very expedient which is to protect me from violence of one sort exposes me to it under another shape too odious to mention  and is there then said musidorus sighing is there no human being in your thoughts in whom you can confide alas for me if you believe you have no friend who is not tainted with the impurities of his sex and what is friendship what but the union of souls and are not souls thus united already married for my part i have long regarded our pure and spiritualized connection in this light and i cannot foresee how any outward ceremony is to alter that inherent delicacy of sentiment which is inseparable from my souls attachment to the soul of sappho if we are determined to despise the world we should also despise the constructions of the world if retirement is our choice and the life and habits of clemens are not to be the life and habits of sappho why should musidorus who is ready to sacrifice every thing in her defense not be thought incapable of abusing her confidence when he offers the protection of his name if a few words muttered over us by a scotch blacksmith will put all our troubles to rest why should we resort to dangers and difficulties when so easy a remedy is before us  but why should i seek for arguments to allay your apprehensions when you have in me so natural a security for my performance of the strictest stipulations  and what is that security she eagerly demanded musidorus now drew back a few paces and with the most solemn air and action laying his hand upon his heart replied my age madam  that is true cried sappho and now the conversation took a new turn in the course of which they agreed upon their plan of proceeding settled their rendezvous for the next day and musidorus departed to prepare all things necessary for the security of their expedition  no lxxxii tange chloen semel arrogantem horat o cupid touch this rebel heart  upon the day appointed sappho with her fathers consent set out in a hired postchaise upon a pretended visit to a relation who lived about twenty miles from town on the northern road at the inn where she was to change horses she dismissed her london postillion with a short note to her father in which she told him she should write to him in two or three days time here she took post for the next stage upon the great road where she was met by musidorus and from thence they pressed forward with all possible expedition toward gretna green  the mind of sappho was visited with some compunctions by the way but the eloquence of her companion and the respectful delicacy of his behavior soon reconciled her conscience to the step she had taken the reflections which passed in musidoruss breast were not so easily quieted the anxiety of his thoughts and the fatigues of the journey brought so violent an attack upon him that when he was within a stage or two of his journeys end he found himself unable to proceed the gout had seized upon his stomach and immediate relief became necessary the romantic visions with which sappho hitherto had indulged her imagination now began to vanish and a gloomy prospect opened upon her in place of a comforter and companion by the way to sooth her cares and fill her mind with soft healing sentiments she had a wretched object before her eyes tormented with pain and at the point of death  the house in which she had taken shelter was of the meanest sort but the good people were humane and assiduous and the village afforded a medical assistant of no contemptible skill in his profession there was another consolation attended her situation for in the same inn was quartered a dragoon officer with a small recruiting party this young cornet was of a good family of an engaging person and very elegant address his humanity was exerted not only in consoling sappho but in nursing and cheering musidorus these charitable offices were performed with such a natural benignity that sappho must have been most insensible if she could have overlooked them her gentle heart on the contrary overflowed with gratitude and in the extremity of her distress she freely confessed to him that but for his support she must have sunk outright though the extremity of musidoruss danger was now over yet he was incapable of exertion and sappho who was at leisure to reflect upon her situation began to waver in her resolution and to put some questions to herself which reason could not readily answer her thoughts were so distracted and perplexed that she saw no resource but to unburthen them and throw herself upon the honor and discretion of lionel for so this young officer was called this she had frequently in mind to do and many opportunities offered themselves for it but still her sensibility of shame prevented it the constant apprehension of pursuit hung over her and sometimes she meditated to go back to her father in one of these moments she had begun to write a letter to clemens to prepare him for her return when lionel entered the room and informed her that he perceived so visible an amendment in musidorus that he expected to congratulate her on his recovery in a very few days  and then madam added he my sorrows will begin where yours end be it so if you are happy i must not complain i presume this gentleman is your father or near relation  father exclaimed sappho  she cast her eyes upon the letter she was inditing and burst into tears lionel approached and took her hand in his she raised her handkerchief to her eyes with the other and he proceeded  if my anxious solicitude for an unknown lady in whose happiness my heart is warmly interested exposes me to any hazard of your displeasure stop me before i speak another word if not confide in me and you shall find me ready to devote my life to serve you the mystery about you and the road you are upon were it not for the companion you are with would tempt me to believe you was upon a generous errand to reward some worthy man whom fortune and your parents do not favor but this poor object above stairs makes that impossible if however there is any favored lover waiting in secret agony for that expected moment when your release from hence may crown him with the best of human blessings the hand which now has hold of yours shall be devoted to his service command me where you will i never yet have forfeited my honor and cannot wrong your confidence  you are truly generous replied sappho there is no such man the hand you hold is yet untainted and till now has been untouched release it therefore and i will proceed  my innocence has been my error i have been the dupe of sentiment i am the only child of a fond father and never knew the blessing of a mother when i look back upon my education i perceive that art has been exhausted and nature overlooked in it the unhappy object above stairs has been my sole adviser and director for my father is immersed in business from him and from the duty which i owe him i confess i have seceded and my design was to devote myself to retirement my scheme i now perceive was visionary in the extreme left to my own reflections reason shows me both the danger and the folly of it i have therefore determined upon returning to my father and am writing to him a letter which i shall send by express to relieve him from the agonies my silly conduct has occasioned  what you have now disclosed to me said lionel with a sincerity that does equal honor to yourself and me demands a like sincerity on my part and i must therefore confess to you that musidorus believing himself at the point of death imparted to me not only every thing that has passed but a the future purposes of this treacherous plot from which you have so providentially escaped these i shall not explain to you at present but you may depend upon it that this attack upon his life has saved his conscience i cannot as a man of honor oppose myself to your resolution of returning home immediately and yet when i consider the ridicule you will have to encounter from the world at large the reflections that will arise in your mind when there is perhaps no friend at hand to assuage them but above all when i thus contemplate your charms and recollect that affectation is expelled and nature reinstated in your heart i cannot resist the impulse nor the opportunity of appealing to that nature against a separation so fatal to my peace yes loveliest of women i must appeal to nature i must hope this heart of yours where such refined sensations have resided will not be shut from others of a more generous kind what could the name of musidorus do which lionels cannot why should you not replace an unworthy friend with one of fairer principles with one of honorable birth of equal age and owner of a heart that beats with ardent passion toward you had you been made the sacrifice of this chimaera this illusion what had your father suffered if i am honored with your hand in marriage what can he complain of my conduct my connections and my hopes in life will bear the scrutiny suffer me to say you will have a protector whose character can face the world and whose spirit cannot fear it as for worldly motives i renounce them give me yourself and your affections give me possession of this hand these eyes and the soul which looks through them let your father withhold the rest now loveliest and most beloved have you the heart to share a soldiers fortune have you the noble confidence to take his word will you follow where his honor bids him go and whether a joyful victory or a glorious death attends him will you receive him living or entomb him dying in your arms  whilst lionel was uttering these words his action his emotion and that honest glow of passion which nature only can assume and artifice cannot counterfeit had so subdued the yielding heart of sappho that he must have been dull indeed if he could have wanted any stronger confirmation of his success than what her looks bestowed never was silence more eloquent the labor of language and the forms of law had no share in this contract a sigh of speechless ecstasy drew up the nuptial bond the operations of love are momentary tears of affection interchangeably witnessed the deed and the contracting parties sealed it with an inviolable embrace  every moment now had wings to waft them to that happy spot where the unholy hand of law has not yet plucked up the root of love freedom met them on the very extremity of her precincts nature held out her hand to welcome them and the loves and graces though exiled to a desert danced in her train  thus was sappho when brought to the very brink of destruction rescued by the happy intervention of providence the next day produced an interview with clemens at the house to which they returned after the ceremony in scotland the meeting as might well be expected was poignant and reproachful but when sappho in place of a superannuated sentimentalist presented to him a soninlaw in whose martial form and countenance he beheld youth honor manly beauty and every attractive grace that could justify her choice his transports became excessive and their union being now sanctified by the blessing of a father and warranted by love and nature has snatched a deluded victim from misery and error and added one conjugal instance to the scanty records of unfashionable felicity  let not my young female readers believe that the extravagance of sapphos conduct is altogether out of nature or that they have nothing to apprehend from men of musidoruss age and character my observation convinces me to the contrary gravity says lord shaftesbury is the very essence of imposture and sentimental gravity varnished over with the experienced artifice of age and wisdom is the worst of its species  no lxxxiii the deistical writers who would fain persuade us that the world was in possession of as pure a system of morality before the introduction of christianity as since affect to make a great display of the virtues of many eminent heathens particularly of the philosophers socrates plato and some others  when they set up these characters as examples of perfection which human nature with the aids of revelation either has not attained to or not exceeded they put us upon an invidious task which no man would voluntarily engage in and challenge us to discuss a question which if thoroughly agitated cannot fail to strip the illustrious dead of more than half the honors which the voice of ages has agreed to give them  it is therefore to be wished that they had held the argument to its general terms and shown us where that system of ethics is to be found which they are prepared to bring into comparison with the moral doctrines of christ this i take to be the fair ground whereon the controversy should have been decided and here it would infallibly have been brought to issue but they knew their weapons better than to trust them in so close a conflict  the maxims of some heathen philosophers and the moral writings of plato cicero and seneca contain many noble truths worthy to be held in veneration by posterity and if the deist can from these produce a system of morality as pure and perfect as that which claims its origin from divine revelation he will prove that god gave to man a faculty of distinguishing between right and wrong with such correctness that his own immediate revelation added no lights to those which the powers of reason had already discovered let us grant therefore for a moment that christs religion revealed to the world no new truths in morality nor removed any old errors and what triumph accrues to the deist by the admission the most he gains is to bring reason to a level with revelation as to its moral doctrines in so doing he dignifies mans nature and shows how excellent a faculty god gave his creatures in their original formation to guide their judgments and control their actions but will this diminish the importance of revealed religion certainly not unless he can prove one or both of the following positions viz  first that the moral tenets of christianity either fall short of or run counter to the moral tenets of natural religion or  secondly that christs mission was nugatory and superfluous because the world was already in possession of as good a system of morality as he imparted to mankind  as to the first i believe it has never been attempted by any heathen or deistical advocate to convict the gospel system of false morality or to allege that it is short and defective in any one particular duty when compared with that system which the world was possessed of without its aid no man i believe has controverted its truths though many have disputed its discoveries no man has been hardy enough to say of any of its doctrines  this we ought not to practice though many have been vain enough to cry out  all this we knew before  let us leave this position therefore for the present and pass to the next viz whether christs mission was nugatory and superfluous because the world already knew as much morality as he taught them  this will at once be answered if the gospel assertion be established that life and immortality were brought to light we need not adduce any other of the mysteries of revelation we may safely rest the question here and say with the apostle to the gentile world  behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed mark to how short an issue the argument is now brought either the apostle is not warranted in calling this a mystery or the deist is not warranted in calling christs mission nugatory and superfluous  it now rests with the deist to produce from the writings and opinions of mankind antecedent to christianity such a revelation of things to come as can fully anticipate the gospel revelation or else to admit with the apostle that a mystery was shown and if the importance of this mystery be admitted as it surely must the importance of christs mission can no longer be disputed and though revelation shall have added nothing to the heathen system of morality still it does not follow that it was superfluous and nugatory  let the deist resort to the heathen elysium and the realms of pluto in search of evidences to set in competition with the christian revelation of a future state let him call in socrates plato and as many more as he can collect in his cause it is but lost labor to follow the various tracks of reason through the pathless ocean of conjecture always wandering though with different degrees of deviation what does it avail though seneca had taught as good morality as christ himself preached from the mount how does it affect revealed religion though tullys offices were found superior to saint pauls epistles let the deist indulge himself in declaiming on the virtues of the heathen heroes and philosophers let him ransack the annals of the christian world and present us with legions of crusaders drenched in human blood furious fanatics rushing on each others throats for the distinction of a word massacring whole nations and laying nature waste for a metaphysical quibble it touches not religion let him array a host of persecuting inquisitors with all their torturing enges the picture indeed is terrible but who will say it is the picture of christianity  when we consider the ages which have elapsed since the introduction of christianity and the events attending its propagation how wonderful is the history we contemplate we see a mighty light spreading over all mankind from one spark kindled in an obscure corner of the earth an humble persecuted teacher preaches a religion of peace of forgiveness of injuries of submission to temporal authorities of meekness piety brotherly love and universal benevolence he is tried condemned and executed for his doctrines he rises from the tomb and breaking down the doors of death sets open to all mankind the evidence of a life to come and at the same time points out the sure path to everlasting happiness in that future state a few unlettered disciples his adherents and survivors take up his doctrines and going forth amongst the provinces of the roman empire then in its zenith preach a religion to the gentiles directly striking at the foundation of the most splendid fabric superstition ever reared on earth these gentiles are not a rude and barbarous race but men of illuminated minds acute philosophers eloquent orators powerful reasoners eminent in arts and sciences and armed with sovereign power what an undertaking for the teachers of christianity what a conflict for a religion holding forth no temporal allurements on the contrary promising nothing but mortification in this world and referring all hope of a reward for present sufferings to the unseen glories of a life to come  the next scene which this review presents to us shows the followers of christianity suffering under persecution by the heathen whom their numbers had alarmed and who began to tremble for their gods in the revolution of ages the church becomes triumphant and made wanton by prosperity degenerates from its primitive simplicity and running into idle controversies and metaphysical schisms persecutes its seceding brethren with unremitting fury whilst the popes thundering out anathemas and hurling torches from their throne seem the vicegerents of the furies rather than of the author of a religion of peace the present time affords a different view the temper of the church grown milder though its zeal less fervent men of different communions begin to draw nearer to each other as refinement of manners becomes more general toleration spreads we are no longer slaves to the laws of religion but converts to the reason of it and being allowed to examine the evidence and foundation of the faith that is in us we discover that christianity is a religion of charity toleration reason and peace enjoining us to have compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that we are thereunto called that we should inherit a blessing  no lxxxiv taste may be considered either as sensitive or mental and under each of these denominations is sometimes spoken of as natural sometimes as acquired i propose to treat of it in its intellectual construction only and in this sense mr addison defines it to be that faculty of the soul which discerns the beauties of an author with pleasure and the imperfections with dislike  this definition may very properly apply to the faculty which we exercise in judging and deciding upon the works of others but how does it apply to the faculty exercised by those who produced those works how does it serve to develope the taste of an author the taste of a painter or a statuary and yet we may speak of a work of taste with the same propriety as we do of a man of taste it should seem therefore as if this definition went only to that denomination of taste which we properly call an acquired taste the productions of which generally end in imitation whilst those of natural taste bear the stamp of originality another characteristic of natural taste will be simplicity for how can nature give more than she possesses and what is nature but simplicity now when the mind of any man is endued with a fine natural taste and all means of profiting by other mens ideas are out of the question that taste will operate by disposing him to select the fairest subjects out of what he sees either for art or imagination to work upon still his production will be marked with simplicity but as it is the province of taste to separate deformity or vulgarity from what is merely simple so according to the nature of his mind who possesses it beauty or sublimity will be the result of the operation if his taste inclines him to what is fair and elegant in nature he will produce beauty if to what is lofty bold and tremendous he will strike out sublimity  agreeably to this we may observe in all literary and enlightened nations their earliest authors and artists are the most simple first adventurers represent what they see or conceive with simplicity because their impulse is unbiassed by emulation having nothing in their sight either to imitate avoid or excel on the other hand their successors are sensible that one mans description of nature must be like anothers and in their zeal to keep clear of imitation and to outstrip a predecessor they begin to compound refine and even to distort i will refer to the venus de medicis and the laocoon for an illustration of this i do not concern myself about the dates or sculptors of these figures but in the former we see beautiful simplicity the fairest form in nature selected by a fine taste and imitated without affectation or distortion and as it should seem without even an effort of art in the laocoon we have a complicated plot we unravel a maze of ingenious contrivance where the artist has compounded and distorted nature in the ambition of surpassing her  virgil possessed a fine taste acccording to mr addisons definition which i before observed applies only to an acquired taste he had the faculty of discerning the beauties of an author with pleasure and the imperfections with dislike he had also the faculty of imitating what he discerned so that i cannot verify what i have advanced by any stronger instance than his i should think there does not exist a poet who has gone such lengths in imitation as virgil for to pass over his pastoral and bucolic poems which are evidently drawn from theocritus and hesiod with the assistance of aratus in every thing that relates to the scientific part of the signs and seasons it is supposed that his whole narrative of the destruction of troy with the incident of the wooden horse and the episode of sinon are an almost literal translation of pisander the epic poet who in his turn perhaps might copy his account from the ilias minor but this last is mere suggestion as for the aeneid it does little else but reverse the order of homers epic making aeneass voyage precede his wars in italy whereas the voyage of ulysses is subsequent to the operations of the iliad as apollo is made hostile to the greeks and the cause of his offense is introduced by homer in the opening of the iliad so juno in the aeneid stands in his place with every circumstance of imitation it would be an endless task to trace the various instances throughout the aeneid where scarce a single incident can be found which is not copied from homer neither is there greater originality in the executive parts of the poem than in the constructive with this difference only that he has copied passages from various authors roman as well as greek though from homer the most amongst the greeks the dramatic poets aeschylus sophocles and principally euripides have had the greatest share of his attention aristophanes menander and other comic authors callimachus and some of the lyric writers also may be traced in his imitations a vast collection of passages from ennius chiefly from lucretius furius lucilius pacuvius suevius naevius varius catullus accius and others of his own nation has been made by macrobius in his saturnalia where virgil has done little else but put their sentiments into more elegant verse so that in strictness of speaking we may say of the aeneid that it is a miscellaneous compilation of poetical passages composing all together an epic poem formed upon the model of homers iliad and odyssey abounding in beautiful versification and justly to be admired for the fine acquired taste of its author but devoid of originality either of construction or execution besides its general inferiority as being a copy from homer it particularly falls off from its original in the conception and preservation of character it does not reach the sublimity and majesty of its model but it has in a great degree adopted the simplicity and entirely avoided the rusticity of homer  lucan and claudian in later ages were perhaps as good versifiers as virgil but far inferior to him in that fine acquired taste which he excelled in they are ingenious but not simple and execute better than they contrive a passage from claudian which i shall beg the readers leave to compare with one from virgil where he personifies the evil passions and plagues of mankind and posts them at the entrance of hell to which aeneas is descending will exemplify what i have said for at the same time that it will bear a dispute whether claudians description is not even superior to virgils in poetical merit yet the judicious manner of introducing it in one case and the evident want of judgment in the other will help to show that the reason why we prefer virgil to claudian is more on account of his superiority of taste than of talents  claudians description stands in the very front of his poem on ruffinus virgils is woven into his fable and will be found in the sixth book of his aeneid as follows  vestibulum ante ipsum primisque in faucibus orci luctus

ignorance who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most faulted and to justify mine own candor for i loved the man and do honor his memory on this side idolatry as much as any he was indeed honest and of an open and free nature had an excellent fantasy brave notions and gentle expressions wherein he flowed with that facility that sometime it was necessary he should be stopped sufflaminandus erat as augustus said of haterius his wit was in his own power would the rule of it had been so too  i think there can be no doubt but this kind of indignant negligence with which shakespeare wrote was greatly owing to the slight consideration he had for his audience jonson treated them with the dictatorial haughtiness of a pedant shakespeare with the carelessness of a gentleman who wrote at his ease and gave them the first flowings of his fancy without any dread of their correction these were times in which the poet indulged his genius without restraint he stood alone and supereminent and wanted no artificial scaffold to raise him above the heads of his contemporaries he was natural lofty careless and daringly incorrect place the same man in other times amongst a people polished almost into general equality and he shall begin to hesitate and retract his sallies for in this respect poetical are like military excursions and it makes a wide difference in the movements of a skilful general whether he is to sally into a country defended by welldisciplined troops or only by an irregular mob of unarmed barbarians shakespeare might vault his pegasus without a rein mountains might rise and seas roll in vain before him nature herself could neither stop nor circumscribe his career the modern man of verse mounts with the precaution of a ridingmaster and prances round his little circle fullbitted and caparisoned in all the formality of a review whilst he is thus pacing and piaffering with every bodys eyes upon him his friends are calling out every now and then  seat yourself firm in the saddle hold your body straight keep your spurs from his sides for fear he sets a kicking have a care he does not stumble there lies a stone here runs a ditch keep your whip still and depend upon your bit if you have not a mind to break your neck  on the other quarter his enemies are bawling out  how like a tailor that fellow sits on horseback look at his feet look at his arms set the curs upon him tie a cracker to his horses tail and make sport for the spectators  all this while perhaps the poor devil could have performed passably well if it were not for the mobbing and hallooing about him whereas shakespeare mounts without fear and starting in the jockeyphrase at score cries out stand clear ye sons of earth or by the beams of my father apollo i

conversation of an elderly person present who was very deliberately casting up the several demands that the community at large had upon his property  are you aware says he how small a portion of your revenue will properly remain to yourself when you have satisfied all the claims which you must pay to society and your country for living amongst us and supporting the character of what is called a landed gentleman part of your income will be stopped for the maintenance of them who have none under the denomination of poorrates this may be called a fine upon the partiality of fortune levied by the law of society which will not trust its poor members to the precarious charity of the rich another part must go to the debts and necessities of the government which protects you in war and peace and is also a fine which you must be content to pay for the honor of being an englishman and the advantage of living in a land of liberty and security the learned professions will also have their share the church for taking care of your soul the physician for looking after your body and the lawyer must have part of your property for superintending the rest the merchant tradesman and artisan will have their profit upon all the multiplied wants comforts and indulgences of civilized life these are not to be enumerated for they depend on the humors and habits of men they have grown up with the refinements and elegancies of the age and they will further increase as these shall advance they are the conductors which like the blood vessels in the human frame circulate your wealth and every other mans wealth through every limb and even fiber of the national body the hand of industry creates that wealth and to the hand of industry it finally returns as blood does to the heart  if we trace the situation of man from a mere state of nature to the highest state of civilization we shall find these artificial wants and dependences increase with every stage and degree of his improvements so that if we consider each nation apart as one great machine the several parts and springs which give it motion naturally become more and more complicated and multifarious as the uses to which it is applied are more and more diversified again if we compare two nations in an equal state of civilization we may remark that where the greater freedom obtains there the greater variety of artificial wants will obtain also and of course property will circulate through more channels this i take to be the case upon a comparison between france and england arising from the different constitutions of them and us with respect to civil liberty  the natural wants of men are pretty much the same in most states but the humors of men will take different directions in different countries and are governed in a great degree by the laws and constitution of the realm in which they are found there are numbers of people in england who get their living by arts and occupations which would not be tolerated in a despotic government mens manners are simplified in proportion to the restraint and circumscription under which they are kept the country sports of english gentlemen furnish maintenance and employment to vast numbers of our people whereas in france and other arbitrary states men of the first rank and fortune reside in the capital and keep no establishments of this sort what a train of grooms jockies and stableboys follow the heels of our horses and hounds in tight boots and leather breeches each of which carries the clothes of six men upon his back cased in one skin of flannel under another like the coats of an onion the locomotive mania of an englishman circulates his person and of course his cash into every quarter of the kingdom a frenchman takes a journey only when he cannot help it an englishman has no other reason but because he likes it he moves with every shift of the weather and follows the changes of the most variable climate in the world a frosty morning puts him from his hunting and he is in london before night a thaw meets him in town and again he scampers into the country he has a horse to run at epsom another at salisbury and a third at york and he must be on the spot to back every one of them he has a stud at newmarket a mistress in london a shootingbox in norfolk and a pack of foxhounds in the new forest for one wheel that real business puts in motion pleasure whim ennui turn one hundred sickness which confines all the rest of the world sends him upon his travels one doctor plunges him into the sea at brighthelmstone a second steeps him in warm water at buxton and a third sends him to bath for the gentlemen of the learned faculty whether they help us into life or help us out of it make us pay toll at each gate and if at any time their art keeps us alive the fine we must pay to their ingenuity makes the renewal in some cases too hard a bargain for a poor man to profit by in all other countries upon earth a man is contented to be well and pay nothing for being so but in england even health is an expensive article as we are for ever contriving how to be a little better and physicians are too conscientious to take a fee and do nothing for it if there is any thg like ridicule in this it is against the patient and not against the physician i would wish to point it it is in england that the profession is truly dignified and if it is here accompanied with greater emoluments it is proportionably practiced with superior learning if life is more valuable in a land of freedom than in a land of slavery why should it not be paid for according to its value in despotic states where mens lives are in fact the property of the prince all subjects should in justice be cured or killed at his proper charge but where a mans house is his castle his health is his own concern  as to the other learned profession of the law to its honor be it spoken there is that charming perplexity about it that we can ruin one another and ourselves with the greatest certainty and facility it is so superior to all other sciences that it can turn demonstration into doubt truth into contradiction make improbability put matter of fact out of countenance and hang up a point for twenty years which common sense would decide in as many minutes it is the glorious privilege of the freemen of england to make their own laws and they have made so many that they can neither count them up nor comprehend them the parliament of england is without comparison the most voluminous author in the world and there is such a happy ambiguity in its works that its students have as much to say on the wrong side of every question as upon the right in all cases of discussion it is one mans business to puzzle and anothers to explain and though victory be ever so certain it is agreed between the parties to make a long battle there must be an extraordinary faculty of expression in the law when the only parts clearly understood are those which it has not committed to writing  i shall say very little in this place upon the sacred profession of divinity it is to be lamented that the church of england is not provided with a proper competency for all who are engaged in performing its functions but i cannot close with their opinion who are for stripping its dignities and equalizing those splendid benefices which are at once the glory and the support of its establishment levellers and reformers will always have the popular cry on their side and i have good reason to know with what inveteracy a man is persecuted for an opinion which opposes it and yet it is hard to give credit to the sincerity and disinterestedness of him who courts popularity and deny it to the man who sacrifices his repose and stands the brunt of abuse in defense of what he believes to be the truth  and now having fallen upon the mention of popularity i shall take leave to address that divinity with a few lines picked up from an obscure author which though below poetry are not quite prose and on that account pretty nearly suited to the level of their subject  o popularity thou giddy thing what grace or profit do thou bring thou art not honesty thou art not fame i cannot call thee by a worthy name to say i hate thee were not true contempt is properly thy due i cannot love thee and despise thee too thou art no patriot but the veriest cheat that ever traffickd in

reign of henry the fourth of england the character of the prince of wales recommended itself to his fancy as likely to supply him with a fund of dramatic incidents for what could invention have more happily suggested than this character which history presented ready to his hands a riotous disorderly young libertine in whose nature lay hidden those seeds of heroism and ambition which were to burst forth at once to the astonishment of the world and to atchieve the conquest of france this prince whose character was destined to exhibit a revolution of so brilliant a sort was not only in himself a very tempting hero for the dramatic poet who delights in incidents of novelty and surprise but also offered to his imagination a train of attendant characters in the persons of his wild comrades and associates which would be of themselves a drama here was a field for invention wide enough even for the genius of shakespeare to range in all the humors passions and extravagancies of human life might be brought into the composition and when he had grouped and personified them to his taste and liking he had a leader ready to place at the head of the train and the truth of history to give life and interest to his drama  with these materials ready for creation the great artist sat down to his work the canvass was spread before him ample and capacious as the expanse of his own fancy nature put her pencil into his hand and he began to sketch his first concern was to give a chief or captain to this gang of rioters this would naturally be the first outline he drew to fill up the drawing of this personage he conceived a voluptuary in whose figure and character there should be an assemblage of comie qualities in his person he should be bloated and blown up to the size of a silenus lazy luxurious in sensuality a satyr in intemperance a bacchanalian as he was to stand in the post of a ringleader amongst thieves and cutpurses he made him a notorious liar a swaggering coward vainglorious arbitrary knavish crafty voracious of plunder lavish of his gains without credit honor or honesty and in debt to every body about him as he was to be the chief seducer and misleader of the heir apparent of the crown it was incumbent on the poet to qualify him for that part in such a manner as should give probability and even a plea to the temptation this was only to be done by the strongest touches and the highest colorings of a master by hitting off a humor of so happy so facetious and so alluring a cast as should tempt even royalty to forget itself and virtue to turn reveller in his company his lies his vanity and his cowardice too gross to deceive were to be so ingenious as to give delight his cunning evasions his witty resources his mock solemnity his vapouring selfconsequence were to furnish a continual feast of laughter to his royal companion he was not only to be witty himself but the cause of wit in other people a whetstone for raillery a buffoon whose very person was a jest compounded of these humors shakespeare produced the character of sir john falstaff a character which neither ancient nor modern comedy has ever equalled which was so much the favorite of its author as to be introduced in three several plays and which is likely to be the idol of the english stage as long as it shall speak the language of shakespeare  this character almost singly supports the whole comic plot of the first part of henry the fourth the poet has indeed thrown in some auxiliary humors in the persons of gadshill peto bardolph and hostess quickly the two first serve for little else except to fill up the action but bardolph as a butt to falstaffs raillery and the hostess in her wrangling scene with him when his pockets had been emptied as he was asleep in the tavern give occasion to scenes of infinite pleasantry poins is contrasted from the rest of the gang and as he is made the companion of the prince is very properly represented as a man of better qualities and morals than falstaffs more immediate hangerson and dependants  the humor of falstaff opens into full display upon his very first introduction with the prince the incident of the robbery on the highway the scene in eastcheap in consequence of that ridiculous encounter and the whole of his conduct during the action with percy are so exquisitely pleasant that upon the renovation of his dramatic life in the second part of henry the fourth i question if the humor does not in part evaporate by continuation at least i am persuaded that it flattens a little in the outset and though his wit may not flow less copiously yet it comes with more labor and is farther fetched the poet seems to have been sensible how difficult it was to preserve the vein as rich as at first and has therefore strengthened his comic plot in the second play with several new recruits who may take a share with falstaff to whom he no longer entrusts the whole burden of the humor in the front of these auxiliaries stands pistol a character so new whimsical and extravagant that if it were not for a commentator now living whose very extraordinary researches amongst our old authors have supplied us with passages to illuminate the strange rhapsodies which shakespeare has put into his mouth i should for one have thought ancient pistol as wild and imaginary a being as caliban but i now perceive by the help of these discoveries that the character is made up in great part of absurd and fustian passages from many plays in which shakespeare was versed and perhaps had been a performer pistols dialogue is a tissue of old tags of bombast like the middle comedy of the greeks which dealt in parody i abate of my astonishment at the invention and originality of the poet but it does not lessen my respect for his ingenuity shakespeare founded his bully in parody jonson copied his from nature and the palm seems due to bobadil upon a comparison with pistol congreve copied a very happy likeness from jonson and by the fairest and most laudable imitation produced his noll bluff one of the pleasantest humourists on the comic stage  shallow and silence are two very strong auxiliaries to this second part of falstaffs humors and though they do not absolutely belong to his family they are nevertheless near of kin and derivatives from his stock surely two pleasanter fellows never trod the stage they not only contrast and play upon each other but silence sober and silence tipsey make the most comical reverse in nature never was drunkenness so well introduced or so happily employed in any drama the dialogue between shallow and falstaff and the description given by the latter of shallows youthful frolicks are as true nature and as true comedy as mans invention ever produced the recruits are also in the literal sense the recruits of the drama these personages have the further merit of throwing falstaffs character into a new cast and giving it the seasonable relief of variety  dame quickly also in this second part resumes her role with great comic spirit but with some variation of character for the purpose of introducing a new member into the troop in the person of doll tearsheet the common trull of the times though this part is very strongly colored and though the scene with her and falstaff is of a loose as well as ludicrous nature yet if we compare shakespeares conduct of this incident with that of the dramatic writers of his time and even since his time we must confess he has managed it with more than common care and exhibited his comic hero in a very ridiculous light without any of those gross indecencies which the poets of his age indulged themselves in without restraint  the humor of the prince of wales is not so free and unconstrained as in the first part though he still demeans himself in the course of his revels yet it is with frequent marks of repugnance and selfconsideration as becomes the conqueror of percy and we see his character approaching fast toward a thorough reformation but though we are thus prepared for the change that is to happen when this young hero throws off the reveller and assumes the king yet we are not fortified against the weakness of pity when the disappointment and banishment of falstaff takes place and the poet executes justice upon his inimitable delinquent with all the rigor of an unrelenting moralist the reader or spectator who has accompanied falstaff through his dramatic story is in debt to him for so many pleasant moments that all his failings which should have raised contempt have only provoked laughter and he begins to think they are not natural to his character but assumed for his amusement with these impressions we see him delivered over to mortification and disgrace and bewail his punishment with a sensibility that is only due to the sufferings of the virtuous  as it is impossible to ascertain the limits of shakespeares genius i will not presume to say he could not have supported his humor had he chosen to have prolonged his existence through the succeeding drama of henry the fifth we may conclude that no ready expedient presented itself to his fancy and he was not apt to spend much pains in searching for such he therefore put him to death by which he fairly placed him out of the reach of his contemporaries and got rid of the trouble and difficulty of keeping him up to his original pitch if he had attempted to carry him through a third drama after he had removed the prince of wales out of his company and seated him on the throne i cannot doubt but there were resources in shakespeares genius and a latitude of humor in the character of falstaff which might have furnished scenes of admirable comedy by exhibiting him in his disgrace and both shallow and silence would have been accessaries to his pleasantry even the field of agincourt and the distress of the kings army before the action had the poet thought proper to have produced falstaff on the scene might have been as fruitful in comic incidents as the battle of shrewsbury this we can readily believe from the humors of fluellen and pistol which he has woven into his drama the former of whom is made to remind us of falstaff in his dialogue with captain gower when he tells him that  as alexander is kill his friend clytus being in his ales and his cups so also harry monmouth being in his right wits and his goot judgments is turn away the fat knight with the great pellydoublet he was full of jests and gypes and knaveries and mocks i am forget his name  sir john falstaff  that is he  this passage has ever given me a pleasing sensation as it marks a regret in the poet to part with a favorite character and is a tender farewell to his memory it is also with particular propriety that these words are put into the mouth of fluellen who stands here as his substitute and whose humor as well as that of nym may be said to have arisen out of the ashes of falstaff  no lxxxvii singula

as wrote without an exception even of his most secret ejaculations we may judge how valuable these diaries will be to posterity when we reflect how much we should now be edified had any of the ancients given us as minute a collectanea of their illustrious contemporaries  we have it is true a few of ciceros tablejokes but how delightful would it be to know what he said when nobody heard him how piously he reproached himself when he laid in bed too late in a morning or eat too heartily at hortensiuss or caesars table we are told indeed that cato the censor loved his jest but we should have been doubly glad to have partaken of it what a pity it is that nobody thought it worth their while to record some pleasanter specimen than macrobius has given us of his retort upon q albidius a

does not appear as if his wit had been of the malicious sort and yet pompey whose temper could not stand a jest was so galled by him that he is reported to have said with great bitterness  oh that

the emperor  i did not fight for you by proxy at actium  augustus felt the reproof and condescended to his request in person when pacuvius taurus greedily solicited a largess from the emperor and to urge him to the greater liberality added that all the world would have it that he had made him a very bountiful donation  but you know better said augustus than to believe the world  and dismissed the sycophant without his errand i shall mention one more case where by a very courtly evasion he parried the solicitation of his captain of the guard who had been cashiered and was petitioning the emperor to allow him his pay telling him that he did not ask that indulgence for the sake of the money which might accrue to him but that he might have it to say he had resigned his commission and not been cashiered  if that be all your reason says the emperor tell the world that you have received it and i will not deny that i have paid it  vatinius who was noted to a proverb as a common slanderer

ancients in that case i shall not despair of being able to lay before the public a veritable roman newspaper compounded of events in the days of julius caesar by what happy chance i traced this valuable relick and with what pains i possessed myself of it may be matter of future explanation i have the satisfaction however to premise to the reader that it is written with great freedom and as well sprinkled with private anecdotes as any of the present day whose agreeable familiarity is so charming to every body but the parties concerned it has also a good dash of the dramatic and as some fastidious people have been inclined to treat our intelligencers and reviewers with a degree of neglect bordering upon contempt i shall have pleasure in showing that they have classical authority for all their quirks and conceits and that they are all written in the true quaint spirit of criticism it is to be lamented that the roman theater furnishes no ladies to match the heroines of our stage but i can produce some encomiums upon laberius roscius and the famous publius syrus which would not be unapplicable to some of our present capital actors i am sorry to be obliged to confess that they were not in the habit of speaking epilogues in those days but i have a substitute in a prologue written and spoken by decimus laberius which i am tempted to throw out as a lure to my newspaper but i must first explain upon what occasion it was composed  this laberius was a roman knight of good family and a man withal of high spirit and pretensions but unfortunately he had a talent for the drama he read his own plays better than any man then living could act them for neither garrick nor henderson were yet born p clodius the fine gentleman and rake of the age had the indecorum to press laberius to come forward on the public stage and take the principal character in one of his own plays laberius was indignant and clodius proceeded to menaces  do your worst says the roman knight you can but send me to dyracchium and back again  proudly intimating that he would suffer the like banishment with cicero rather than consent to his demand for acting was not then the amusement of people of fashion and private theaters were not thought of julius caesar was no less captivated with laberiuss talents than clodius had been and being a man not apt to be discouraged by common difficulties took up the same solicitation and assailed our roman knight who was now sixty years of age and felt his powers in their decline conscious of this decline no less than of his own dignity he resisted the degrading request he interceded he implored of caesar to excuse him it was to no purpose caesar had made it his point and his point he would carry the word of caesar was law and laberius driven out of all his defenses was obliged to submit and comply caesar makes a grand spectacle for all rome bills are given out for a play of laberius and the principal part is announced to be performed by the author himself the theater is thronged with spectators all rome is present and decimus laberius presents himself on the stage and addresses the audience in the following prologue prologue by decimus laberius o strong necessity of whose swift course so many feel so few escape the force whither ah whither in thy prone career have thou decreed this dying frame to bear me in my better days nor foe nor friend nor threat nor bribe nor vanity could bend now lured by flattery in my weaker age i sink my knighthood and ascend the stage yet muse not therefore  how shall man gainsay him whom the deities themselves obey sixty long years i have lived without disgrace a roman knight let dignity give place i am caesars actor now and compass more in one short hour than all my life before o

ear what grace to please the eye where is the action energy and art the look that guides its passion to the heart age creeps like ivy over my withered trunk its bloom all blasted and its vigor shrunk

the plot as usual was beaten by his master in this condition having marked his habit with counterfeited stripes he runs upon the stage and cries out amain  porro quirites libertatem perdimus  in good faith countrymen there is an end of freedom the indignant spectators sent up a shout it was in the language of our present playhouse bills a burst of applause a most violent burst of applause from a most crowded and brilliant house overflowing in all parts laberius not yet content with this atonement to the manes of his knighthood subjoins the following pointed allusion necesse est multos timeat quem multi timent  the man whom many fear must needs fear many all eyes were now turned upon caesar and the degraded laberius enjoyed a full revenge  we may naturally suppose this conduct lost him the favor of caesar who immediately took up publius syrus a syrian slave who had been manumitted for his ingenious talents and was acting in the country theaters with much applause caesar fetched him out of his obscurity as we bring up an actress from bath or york and pitted him against laberius it was the triumph of youth and vigor over age and decay and caesar with malicious civility said to laberius favente tibi me victus es laberi a syro  you are surpassed by syrus in spite of my support as laberius was going out of the theater he was met by syrus who was inconsiderate enough to let an expression escape him which was very disrespectful to his veteran competitor laberius felt the unbecoming insult and turning to syrus gave him this extemporary answer  to stand the first is not the lot of all it is now your turn to mount and mine to fall it is slippery ground beware you keep your feet for public favor is a public cheat non possunt primi esse omnes omni in tempore summum ad

syrus have been justly held by all the literati from seneca to scaliger who turned them into greek and it is for the honor of the fraternity of the stage that both he and sophron whose moral sentences were found under platos pillow when he died were actors by profession  i shall now only add that my newspaper contains a very interesting description of two young actors hylas and pylades who became great favorites with augustus when he was emperor and made their first appearance at the time this journal was written if the reader shall find any allusion to two very promising young performers now

fair penitent too lavish on the score of commendation the high degree of public favor in which this tragedy has long stood has ever attracted the best audiences to it and engaged the talents of the best performers in its display as there is no drama more frequently exhibited or more generally read i propose to give it a fair and impartial examination jointly with the more unknown and less popular tragedy from which it is derived  the fair penitent is in fable and character so closely copied from the fatal dowry that it is impossible not to take that tragedy along with it and it is matter of some surprise to me that row should have made no acknowledgment of his imitation either in his dedication or prologue or any where else that i am apprised of  this tragedy of the fatal dowry was the joint production of massinger and nathaniel field it takes a wider compass of fable than the fair penitent by which means it presents a very affecting scene at the opening which discovers young charalois attended by his friend romont waiting with a petition in his hand to be presented to the judges when they shall meet praying the release of his dead fathers body which had been seized by his creditors and detained in their hands for debts he had incurred in the public service as field marshal of the armies of burgundy massinger to whose share this part of the tragedy devolved has managed this pathetic introduction with consummate skill and great expression of nature a noble youth in the last state of worldly distress reduced to the humiliating yet pious office of soliciting an unfeeling and unfriendly judge to allow him to pay the solemn rites of burial to the remains of an illustrious father who had fought his countrys battles with glory and had sacrificed life and fortune in defense of an ungrateful state impresses the spectators mind with pity and respect which are felt through every passage of the play one thing in particular strikes me at the opening of the scene which is the long silence that the poet has artfully imposed upon his principal character charalois who stands in mute sorrow with his petition in his hand whilst his friend romont and his advocate charmi urge him to present himself to the judges and solicit them in person the judges now make their entrance they stop upon the stage they offer him the fairest opportunity for tendering his petition and soliciting his suit charalois remains fixed and speechless romont who is all eagerness in his cause presses him again and again  now put on your spirits  now sir lose not this offered means their looks fixed on you with a pitying earnestness invite you to demand their furtherance to your good purpose  the judges point him out to each other they lament the misfortunes of his noble house they observe it is young charalois son to the marshal from whom he inherits his fame and virtues only  romont hah they name you  dulroy his father died in prison two days since  rochfort yes to the shame of this ungrateful state that such a master in the art of war so noble and so highly meriting from this forgetful country should for want of means to satisfy his creditors the sum he took up for the general good meet with an end so infamous  romont dare you ever hope for like opportunity  it is in vain the opportunity passes off and charalois opens not his mouth nor even silently tenders his petition  i have upon a former occasion both generally and particularly observed upon the effects of dramatic silence the stage cannot afford a more beautiful and touching instance than this before us to say it is not inferior to the silence of hamlet upon his first appearance would be saying too little in its favor i have no doubt but massinger had this very case in his thoughts and i honor him no less for the imitating than i should have done for striking out a silence so naturally and so delicately preserved what could charalois have uttered to give him that interest in the hearts of his spectators which their own conclusions during his affecting silence have already impressed no sooner are the judges gone than the ardent romont again breaks forth  this obstinate spleen you think becomes your sorrow and sorts well with your black suits  this is hamlet himself his inky cloak and customary suits of solemn black the character of charalois is thus fixed before he speaks the poets art has given the prejudice that is to bear him in our affections through all the succeeding events of the fable and a striking contrast is established between the undiscerning fiery zeal of romont and charalois fine sensibility and highborn dignity of soul  a more methodical and regular dramatist would have stopped here satisfied that the impression already made was fully sufficient for all the purposes of his plot but massinger according to the busy spirit of the stage for which he wrote is not alarmed by a throng of incidents and proceeds to open the court and discuss the pleadings on the stage the advocate charmi in a set harangue moves the judges for dispensing with the rigor of the law in favor of creditors and for rescuing the marshals corpse out of their clutches he is browbeaten and silenced by the presiding judge old novall the plea is then taken up by the impetuous romont and urged with so much personal insolence that he is arrested on the spot put in charge of the officers of the court and taken to prison this is a very striking mode of introducing the set oration of charalois a son recounting the military atchievments of a newly deceased father and imploring mercy from his creditors and the law toward his unburied remains now claims the attention of the court who had been hitherto unmoved by the feeble formality of a hired pleader and the turbulent passion of an enraged soldier charalois argument takes a middle course between both the pious feelings of a son tempered by the modest manners of a gentleman the creditors however are implacable the judge is hostile and the law must take its course  creditor it is the citys doctrine we stand bound to maintain it  charalois be constant in it and since you are as merciless in your natures as base and mercenary in your means by which you get your wealth i will not urge the court to take away one scruple from the right of their laws or one good thought in you to mend your disposition with i know there is no music in your ears so pleasing as the groans of men in prison and that the tears of widows and the cries of famished orphans are the feasts that take you that to be in your danger with more care should be avoided than infectious air the loathed embraces of diseased women a flatterers poison or the loss of honor yet rather than my fathers reverend dust shall want a place in that fair monument in which our noble ancestors lie entombed before the court i offer up myself a prisoner for it load me with those irons that have worn out his life in my best strength i will run to the encounter of cold hunger and choose my dwelling where no sun dares enter so he may be released  there was yet another incident which the poets passion for business and spectacle induced him to avail himself of viz the funeral of the marshal this he displays on the stage with a train of captains and soldiers following the body of their general charalois and romont under custody of their jailors appear as chief mourners and a party of creditors are concerned in the groupe  after this solemnity is dispatched the poet proceeds to develop the amiable generosity of old rochfort who being touched with the gallant spirit of romont and still more penetrated with the filial piety of young charalois delivers them both from imprisonment and distress by discharging the debts of the marshal and dismissing the creditors this also passes before the eyes of the spectators before charalois has given full expression to his gratitude for this extraordinary benefaction rochfort follows it with a further act of bounty which he introduces in the style of a request  call in my daughter  still i have a suit to you would you requite me  this is my only child  beaumelle rochforts daughter is presented to charalois the scene is hurried on with a precipitation almost without example charalois asks the lady fair beaumelle can you love me  beaumelle yes my lord  charalois you need not question me if i can you you are the fairest virgin in dijon and rochfort is your father  the match is agreed upon as soon as proposed and rochfort hastens away to prepare the celebration  in this cluster of incidents i must not fail to remark that the poet introduces young novall upon the scene in the very moment when the short dialogue above quoted was passing this novall had before been exhibited as a suitor to beaumelle and his vain frivolous character had been displayed in a very ridiculous and contemptible light he is now again introduced to be a witness of his own disappointment and his only observation upon it is  what is this change  upon the exit of the father however he addresses himself to the lady and her reply gives the alarming hint that makes discovery of the fatal turn which the plot is now about to take for when novall turning aside to beaumelle by one word  mistress  conveys the reproach of inconstancy she replies oh servant virtue strengthen me thy presence blows round my affections vane you will undo me if you speak again exit young novall is left on the scene with certain followers and dependants which hang upon his fortune one of which pontalier by name a man under deep obligations to him yet of an honest nature advises him to an honorable renunciation of all further hopes or attempts to avail himself of the affections of beaumelle  though you have saved my life rescued me often from my wants i must not wink at your follies that will ruin you you know my blunt way and my love to truth forsake the pursuit of this ladys honor now you do see her made another mans  this honorable advice is rejected with contempt novall in whose mean bosom there does not seem a trace of virtue avows a determined perseverance and the poet having in this hasty manner completed these inauspicious nuptials closes the second act of his tragedy  no lxxxix we have now expended two entire acts of the fatal dowry in advancing to that period in the fable at which the tragedy of the fair penitent opens if the author of this tragedy thought it necessary to contract massingers plot and found one upon it of a more regular construction i know not how he could do this any otherwise than by taking up the story at the point where we have now left it and throwing the antecedent matter into narration and though these two prefatory acts are full of very affecting incidents yet the pathos which properly appertains to the plot and conduces to the catastrophe of the tragedy does not in strictness take place before the event of the marriage no critic will say that the pleadings before the judges the interference of the creditors the distresses of charalois or the funeral of the marshal are necessary parts of the drama at the same time no reader will deny and neither could row himself overlook the effect of these incidents he could not fail to foresee that he was to sacrifice very much of the interest of his fable when he was to throw that upon narration which his original had given in spectacle and the loss was more enhanced by falling upon the hero of the drama for who that compares charalois at the end of the second act of massinger with rowes altamont at the opening scene of the fair penitent can doubt which character has most interest with the spectators we have seen the former in all the most amiable offices which filial piety could perform enduring insults from his inveterate oppressors and voluntarily surrendering himself to a prison to ransom the dead body of his father from unrelenting creditors altamont presents himself before us in his wedding suit in the splendor of fortune and at the summit of happiness he greets us with a burst of exultation  let this auspicious day be ever sacred no mourning no misfortunes happen on it let it be marked for triumphs and rejoicings let happy lovers ever make it holy choose it to bless their hopes and crown their wishes this happy day that gives me my calista  the rest of the scene is employed by him and horatio alternately in recounting the benefits conferred upon them by the generous sciolto and the very same incident of the seizure of his fathers corpse by the creditors and his redemption of it is recited by horatio  when his hard creditors urged and assisted by lotharios father foe to thy house and rival of their greatness by sentence of the cruel law forbade his venerable corpse to rest in earth thou gavst thyself a ransom for his bones with piety uncommon did give up thy hopeful youth to slaves who never knew mercy  it is not however within the reach of this or any other description to place altamont in that interesting and amiable light as circumstances have already placed charalois the happy and exulting bridegroom may be an object of our congratulation but the virtuous and suffering charalois engages our pity love and admiration if row would have his audience credit altamont for that filial piety which marks the character he copied from it was a small oversight to put the following expression into his mouth  oh great sciolto oh my more than father  a closer attention to character would have reminded him that it was possible for altamont to express his gratitude to sciolto without setting him above a father to whose memory he had paid such devotion  from this contraction of his plot by the defalcation of so many pathetic incidents it became impossible for the author of the fair penitent to make his altamont the hero of his tragedy and the leading part is taken from him by horatio and even by lothario throughout the drama there are several other reasons which concur to sink altamont upon the comparison with charalois the chief of which arises from the captivating colors in which row has painted his libertine on the contrary massinger gives a contemptible picture of his young novall he makes him not only vicious but ridiculous in foppery and impertinence he is the counterpart of shakespeares osrick vainglorious purseproud and overbearing amongst his dependants a spiritless poltroon in his interview with romont lothario as johnson observes with gaiety which cannot be hated and bravery which cannot be despised retains too much of the spectators kindness his high spirit brilliant qualities and fine person are so described as to put us in danger of false impressions in his favor and to set the passions in opposition to the moral of the piece i suspect that the gallantry of lothario makes more advocates for calista than she ought to have there is another consideration which operates against altamont and it is an indelicacy in his character which the poet should have provided against he marries calista with the full persuasion of her being averse to the match in his first meeting with sciolto he says  oh could i hope there was one thought of altamont one kind remembrance in calistas breast   i found her cold as a dead lovers statue on his tomb a rising storm of passion shook her breast her eyes a piteous shower of tears let fall and then she sighed as if her heart were breaking with all the tenderest eloquence of love i begged to be a sharer in her grief but she with looks averse and eyes that froze me sadly replied her sorrows were her own nor in a fathers power to dispose of  i am aware that sciolto attempts to parry these facts by an interpretation too gross and unbecoming for a fathers character and only fit for the lips of a lothario but yet it is not in nature to suppose that altamont could mistake such symptoms and it fixes a meanness upon him which prevails against his character throughout the play nothing of this sort could be discovered by massingers bridegroom for the ceremony was agreed upon and performed at the very first interview of the parties beaumelle gave a full and unreserved assent and though her character suffers on the score of hypocrisy on that account yet charalois is saved by it less hypocrisy appears in calista but hers is the deeper guilt because she was already dishonored by lothario and beaumelles coquetry with novall had not yet reached the length of criminality add to this that altamont appears in the contemptible light of a suitor whom calista had apprized of her aversion and to whom she had done a deliberate act of dishonor though his person and character must have been long known to her the case is far otherwise between charalois and beaumelle who never met before and every care is taken by the poet to save his hero from such a deliberate injury as might convey contempt with this view the marriage is precipitated nothing is allowed to pass that might open the character of charalois to beaumelle she is hurried into an assignation with novall immediately upon her marriage every artifice of seduction is employed by her confidante bellaperte and aymer the parasite of novall to make this meeting criminal she falls the victim of passion and when detection brings her to a sense of her guilt she makes this penitent and pathetic appeal to charalois  oh my fate that never would consent that i should see how worthy thou were both of love and duty before i lost you and my misery made the glass in which i now behold your virtue  with justice therefore you may cut me off and from your memory wash the remembrance that ever i was like to some vicious purpose which in your better judgment you repent of and study to forget   yet you shall find though i was bold enough to be a strumpet i dare not yet live one let those famed matrons that are canonized worthy of our sex transcend me in their sanctity of life i yet will equal them in dying nobly ambitious of no honor after life but that when i am dead you will forgive me  compare this with the conduct of calista and then decide which frail fairone has the better title to the appellation of a penitent and which drama conveys the better moral by its catastrophe  there is indeed a grossness in the older poet which his more modern imitator has refined but he has only sweetened the poison not removed its venom nay by how much more palatable he has made it so much more pernicious it is become in his tempting sparkling cup than in the coarse deterring dose of massinger  row has no doubt greatly outstepped his original in the striking character of lothario who leaves novall as far behind him as charalois does altamont it is admitted then that calista has as good a plea as any wanton could wish to urge for her criminality with lothario and the poet has not spared the ear of modesty in his exaggerated description of the guilty scene every luxurious image that his inflamed imagination could crowd into the glowing rhapsody is there to be found and the whole is recited in numbers so flowing and harmonious that they not only arrest the passions but the memory also and perhaps have been and still can be as generally repeated as any passage in english poetry massinger with less elegance but not with less regard to decency suffers the guilty act to pass within the course of his drama the greater refinement of manners in rowes day did not allow of this and he anticipated the incident but when he revived the recollection of it by such a studied description he plainly showed that it was not from moral principle that he omitted it and if he has presented his heroine to the spectators with more immediate delicacy during the compass of the play he has at the same time given her greater depravity of mind her manners may be more refined but her principle is fouler than beaumelles calista who yielded to the gallant gay lothario hot with the tuscan grape might perhaps have disdained a lover who addressed her in the holiday language which novall uses to beaumelle  best day to natures curiosity star of dijon the luster of all france perpetual spring dwell on thy rosy cheeks whose breath is perfume to our continent see flora trimmed in her varieties  no autumn nor no age ever approach this heavenly piece which nature having wrought she lost her needle and did then despair ever to work so lively and so fair  the letter of calista which brings about the discovery by the poor expedient of lotharios dropping it and horatios finding it has not even the merit of being characteristically wicked and is both in its matter and mode below tragedy it is lotharios cruelty has determined her to yield a perfect obedience to her father and give her hand to altamont in spite of her weakness for the false lothario  if the lady had given her perfect obedience its true denomination she had called it a most dishonorable compliance and if we may take lotharios word who seems full correct enough in describing facts and particulars she had not much cause to complain of his being false for he tells rossano  i liked her would have married her but that it pleased her father to refuse me to make this honorable fool her husband  it appears by this that lothario had not been false to her in the article of marriage though he might have been cruel to her on the score of passion which indeed is confessed on his part with as much cold indifference as the most barefaced avowal could express  but to return to the letter she proceeds to tell him  that she could almost wish she had that heart and that honor to bestow with it which he has robbed her of  but lest this half wish should startle him she adds  but oh i fear could i retrieve them i should again be undone by the too faithless yet too lovely lothario  this must be owned as full a reason as she could give why she should only almost wish for her lost honor when she would make such an use of it if she had it again at her disposal and yet the very next paragraph throws every thing into contradiction for she tells him  this is the last weakness of her pen and tomorrow shall be the last in which she will indulge her eyes if she could keep to that resolution i must think the recovery of her innocence would have been worth a whole wish and many a wish unless we are to suppose she was so devoted to guilt that she could take delight in reflecting upon it this is a state of depravity which human nature hardly ever attains and seems peculiar to calista she now grows very humble and concludes in a style well suited to her humility  lucilla shall conduct you if you are kind enough to let me see you it shall be the last trouble you shall meet with from  the lost calista  it was very ill done of horatios curiosity to read this letter and i must ever regret that he has so unhandsomely exposed a ladys private correspondence to the world  no xc though the part which horatio takes in the business of the drama is exactly that which falls to the share of romont in the fatal dowry yet their characters are of a very different cast for as row had bestowed the fire and impetuosity of romont upon his lothario it was a very judicious opposition to contrast it with the cool deliberate courage of the sententious horatio the friend and brotherinlaw of altamont  when horatio has read calistas letter which lothario had dropped an accident which more frequently happens to gentlemen in comedies than in tragedies he falls into a very long meditation and closes it with putting this question to himself what if i give this paper to her father it follows that his justice dooms her dead and breaks his heart with sorrow hard return for all the good his hand has heaped on us hold let me take a moments thought   at this moment he is interrupted in his reflections by the presence of lavinia whose tender solicitude fills up the remaining part of the dialogue and concludes the act without any decisive resolution on the part of horatio an incident well contrived and introduced with much dramatic skill and effect though pressed by his wife to disclose the cause of his uneasiness he does not impart to her the fatal discovery he has made this also is well in character upon his next entrance he has withdrawn himself from the company and being alone resumes his meditation  what if while all are here intent on revelling i privately went forth and sought lothario this letter may be forged perhaps the wantonness of his vain youth to stain a ladys fame perhaps his malice to disturb my friend oh no my heart forebodes it must be true methought even now i marked the starts of guilt that shook her soul though damned dissimulation screend her dark thoughts and set to public view a specious face of innocence and beauty  this soliloquy is succeeded by the muchadmired and striking scene between him and lothario rigid criticism might wish to abridge some of the sententious declamatory speeches of horatio and shorten the dialogue to quicken the effect but the moral sentiment and harmonious versification are much too charming to be treated as intruders and the author has also struck upon a natural expedient for prolonging the dialogue without any violence to probability by the interposition of rossano who acts as a mediator between the hostile parties this interposition is further necessary to prevent a decisive rencounter for which the fable is not ripe neither would it be proper for horatio to anticipate that revenge which is reserved for altamont the altercation therefore closes with a challenge from lothario  west of the town a mile amongst the rocks two hours ere noon tomorrow i expect thee thy single hand to mine  the place of meeting is not well ascertained and the time is too long deferred for strict probability there are however certain things in all dramas which must not be too rigidly insisted upon and provided no extraordinary violence is done to reason and common sense the candid critic ought to let them pass this i take to be a case in point and though horatios cool courage and ready presence of mind are not just the qualities to reconcile us to such an oversight yet i see no reason to be severe upon the incident which is followed by his immediate recollection  two hours ere noon tomorrow hah ere that he sees calista  oh unthinking fool what if i urged her with the crime and danger if any spark from heaven remain unquenchd within her breast my breath perhaps may wake it could i but prosper there i would not doubt my combat with that loud vainglorious boaster  whether this be a measure altogether in character with a man of horatios good sense and discretion i must own is matter of doubt with me i think he appears fully satisfied of her actual criminality and in that case it would be more natural for him to lay his measures for intercepting lothario and preventing the assignation than to try his rhetoric in the present crisis upon the agitated mind of calista as it has justly occurred to him that he has been overreached by lothario in the postponement of the duel the measure i suggest would naturally tend to hasten that rencounter now though the business of the drama may require an explanation between horatio and calista whereupon to ground an occasion for his interesting quarrel with altamont yet i do not see any necessity to make that a premeditated explanation nor to sacrifice character by a measure that is inconsistent with the better judgment of horatio the poet however has decreed it otherwise and a deliberate interview with calista and horatio accordingly takes place this although introduced with a solemn invocation on his part is very clumsily conducted  teach me some power that happy art of speech to dress my purpose up in gracious words such as may softly steal upon her soul and never waken the tempestuous passions  who can expect after this preparation to hear horatio thus break his secret to calista lothario and calista  thus they join two names which heaven decreed should never meet hence have the talkers of this populous city a shameful tale to tell for public sport of an unhappy beauty a false fairone who plighted to a noble youth her faith when she had given her honor to a wretch  this i hold to be totally out of nature first because it is a palpable departure from his resolution to use gracious words next because it has a certain tendency to produce rage and not repentance and thirdly because it is founded in exaggeration and falsehood for how is he warranted to say that the story is the public talk and sport of the city if it were so what can his interference avail why seek this interview why come to tell her how she might be happy to sooth the secret anguish of her soul to comfort that fair mourner that forlorn one and teach her steps to know the paths of peace  no judge of nature will think he takes the means to lead her into the paths of peace by hurrying her to the very brink of desperation i need not enlarge upon this observation and shall therefore only remark that the scene breaks up as might be expected with the following proof of her penitence and his success in persuasion  henceforth thou officious fool meddle no more nor dare even on thy life to breathe an accent that may touch my virtue i am myself the guardian of my honor and will not bear so insolent a monitor    let us now enquire how romont the horatio of massinger conducts this incident a character from whom less discretion is to be expected than from his philosophical successor romont himself discovers beaumelle and novall engaged in the most wanton familiarities and with a warmth suitable to his zeal breaks up the amorous conference by driving novall off the scene with ineffable contempt he then applies himself to the lady and with a very natural and manly spirit says  i respect you not for yourself but in remembrance of who is your father and whose wife you now are  she replies to him with contempt and ridicule he resumes the same characteristic strain he set out with and proceeds  my intents madam deserve not this nor do i stay to be the whetstone of your wit preserve it to spend on such as know how to admire such colored stuff in me there is now speaks to you as true a friend and servant to your honor and one that will with as much hazard guard it as ever man d goodness but then lady you must endeavor not alone to be but to appear worthy such love and service    we have just now heard horatio reproach calista with the reports that were circulated against her reputation let us compare it with what romont says upon the same subject  but yet be careful detractions a bold monster and fears not to wound the fame of princes if it find but any blemish in their lives to work on but i will be plainer with you had the people been learnt to speak but what even now i saw their malice out of that would raise an engine to overthrow your honor in my sight with yonder painted fool i frighted from you you used familiarity beyond a modest entertainment you embraced him with too much ardour for a stranger and met him with kisses neither chaste nor comely but learn you to forget him as i will your bounties to him you will find it safer rather to be uncourtly than immodest  what avails it to attempt drawing a comparison between this conduct and that of horatios where no comparison is to be made i leave it to the reader and decline a task at once so unnecessary and ungrateful  when romont finds no impression is to be made upon beaumelle he meets her father and immediately falls into the same reflection that horatio had struck upon  her father  hah how if i break this to him sure it cannot meet with an ill construction his wisdom made powerful by the authority of a father will warrant and give privilege to his counsels it shall be so  if this step needs excuse the reader will consider that it is a step of prevention the experiment however fails and he is rebuffed with some asperity by rochfort this draws on a scene between him and charalois which as it is too long to transcribe so it is throughout too excellent to extract any part from it i can only express my surprise that the author of the fair penitent with this scene before him could conduct his interview between altamont and horatio upon a plan so widely different and so much inferior i must suppose he thought it a strong incident to make altamont give a blow to his friend else he might have seen an interview carried on with infinitely more spirit both of language and character between charalois and romont in circumstances exactly similar where no such violence was committed or even meditated was it because pierre had given a blow to jaffier that altamont was to repeat the like indignity to horatio for a woman of whose aversion he had proofs not to be mistaken charalois is a character at least as high and irritable as altamont and romont is out of all comparison more rough and plainspoken than horatio charalois might be deceived into an opinion of beaumelles affection for him altamont could not deceive himself into such a notion and the lady had testified her dislike of him in the strongest terms accompanied with symptoms which he himself had described as indicating some rooted and concealed affliction could any solution be more natural than what horatio gives novall was a rival so contemptible that charalois could not with any degree of probability consider him as an object of his jealousy it would have been a degradation of his character had he yielded to such a suspicion lothario on the contrary was of all men living the most to be apprehended by a husband let his confidence or vanity be ever so great row in his attempt to surprise has sacrificed nature and the truth of character for stageeffect massinger by preserving both nature and character has conducted his friends through an angry altercation with infinitely more spirit more pathos and more dramatic effect and yet dismissed them with the following animated and affecting speech from charalois to his friend you are not my friend or being so you are mad i must not buy thy friendship at this rate had i just cause thou know i durst pursue such injury through fire air water earth nay were they all shuffled again to chaos but there is none thy skill romont consists in camps not courts farewell uncivil man let us meet no more here our long web of friendship i untwist shall i go whine walk pale and lock my wife for nothing from her births free liberty that opened mine to me yes if i do the name of cuckold then dog me with scorn i am a frenchman no italian born exit it is plain that altamont at least was an exception to this remark upon italian husbands i shall pursue this comparison no further nor offer any other remark upon the incident of the blow given by altamont except with regard to horatios conduct upon receiving it he draws his sword and immediately suspends resentment upon the following motive yet hold by heaven his fathers in his face spite of my wrongs my heart runs over with tenderness and i could rather die myself than hurt him  we must suppose it was the martial attitude that altamont had put himself into which brought the resemblance of his father so strongly to the observation of horatio otherwise it was a very unnatural moment to recollect it in when he had just received the deepest insult one man can give to another it is however worth a remark that this father of altamont should act on both sides and yet miscarry in his mediation for it is but a few passages before that altamont says to horatio thou were my fathers friend he loved thee well a venerable mark of him hangs round thee and protects thee from my vengeance i cannot dare not lift my sword against thee  what this mark was is left to conjecture but it is plain it was as seasonable for horatios rescue at this moment as it was for altamont a few moments after who had certainly overlooked it when he struck the very friend against whom he could not dared not lift his sword  when lavinias entrance has parted altamont and horatio her husband complains to her of the ingratitude with which he has been treated and says  he who was all to me child brother friend with barbarous bloody malice sought my life  these are very extraordinary terms for a man like horatio to use and seem to convey a charge very unfit for him to make and of a very different nature from the hasty insult he had received in fact it appears as if the blow had totally reversed his character for the resolution he takes in consequence of this personal affront is just such an one as would be only taken by the man who dared not to resent it  from genoa from falsehood and inconstancy to some more honest distant clime well go nor will i be beholden to my country for aught but thee the partner of my flight  that horatios heroism did not consist in the ready forgiveness of injuries is evident from the obstinate sullenness with which he rejects the penitent apologies of altamont in the further progress of the play i am at a loss therefore to know what color the poet meant to give his character by disposing him to quit his country with this insult unatoned for and the additional stigma upon him of running away from his appointment with lothario for the next morning amongst the rocks had he meant to bring him off upon the repugnance he felt of resenting any injury against the son of a father whose image was so visible in his face that his heart ran over with fondness in spite of his wrongs and he could rather die than hurt him surely that image would have interceded no less powerfully for him when penetrated with remorse he intercedes for pity and forgiveness and even faints at his feet with agony at his unrelenting coduracy it would be unfair to suppose he was more like his father when he had dealt him an insulting blow than when he was atoning for an injury by the most ample satisfaction and submission  this is the light in which the conduct of horatio strikes me if i am wrong i owe an atonement to the manes of an elegant poet which upon conviction of my error i will study to pay in the fullest manner i am able  it now remains only to say a few words upon the catastrophe in which the author varies from his original by making calista destroy herself with a dagger put into her hand for that purpose by her father if i am to moralize upon this proceeding of sciolto i know full well the incident cannot bear up against it a roman father would stand the discussion better than a christian one and i also know that the most natural expedient is unluckily a most undramatic one yet the poet did not totally overlook it for he makes scioltos first thought turn upon a convent if i rightly understand the following passage  hence from my sight thy father cannot bear thee fly with thy infamy to some dark cell where on the confines of eternal night mourning misfortunes cares and anguish dwell where ugly sham hides her opprobrious head and death and hell detesied rule maintain there howl out the remainder of thy life and wish thy name may be no more remembered  whilst i am transcribing these lines a doubt strikes me that i have misinterpreted them and yet calistas answer seems to point to the meaning i had suggested perhaps however they are mere ravings in fine numbers without any determinate idea whatever they may be it is clear they do not go to the length of death he tells altamont as soon as she is departed  i wo not kill her yet by the ruin she has brought upon us the common infamy that brands us both she sha not scape  he seems in this moment to have formed the resolution which he afterward puts into execution he prompts her to selfmurder and arms her for the act this may save the spectators a sight too shocking to behold but does it convey less horror to the heart than if he had put her to death with his own hand a father killing his child for incontinence with the man whom he had not permitted to marry her when he solicited his consent is an act too monstrous to reflect upon is that father less a monster who deliberately and after full reflection puts a dagger into her hand and bids her commit selfmurder i should humbly conceive the latter act a degree in guilt beyond the former especially when i hear that father coolly demanding of his victim if she has reflected upon what may happen after death  have thou considered what may happen after it how thy account may stand and what to answer  a parent surely would turn that question upon his own heart before he precipitated his unprepared child to so awful and uncertain an account rage and instant revenge may find some plea sudden passion may transport even a father to lift his hand against his own offspring but this act of sciolto has no shelter but in heathen authority  it is justly thought and worthy of that spirit that dwelt in ancient latian breasts when rome was mistress of the world  did ever poetry beguile a man into such an allusion and to what does that piece of information tend that rome was mistress of the world if this is human nature it would almost tempt one to reply in scioltos own words  i could curse nature  but it is no more like nature than the following sentiments of calista are like the sentiments of a penitent or a christian  that i must die it is my only comfort death is the privilege of human nature and life without it were not worth our taking   and again yet heaven who knows our weak imperfect natures how blind with passions and how prone to evil makes not too strict enqiry for offenses but is atoned by penitence and prayer cheap recompense here twoud not be received nothing but blood can make the expiation  such is the catastrophe of rowes fair penitant such is the representation he gives us of human nature and such the moral of his tragedy  i shall conclude with an extract or two from the catastrophe of the fatal dowry and first for the penitence of beaumelle i shall select only the following speech addressed to her husband i dare not move you to hear me speak i know my fault is far beyond qualification or excuse that it is not fit for me to hope or you to think of mercy only i presume to entreat you would be pleased to look upon my sorrow for it and believe these tears are the true children of my grief and not a womans cunning  i need not point out the contrast between this and the quotations from calista it will require a longer extract to bring the conduct of rochfort into comparison with that of sciolto the reader will observe that novalls dead body is now on the scene charalois beaumelle and rochfort her father are present the charge of adultery is urged by charalois and appeal is made to the justice of rochfort in the case rochfort what answer makes the prisoner  beaumelle i confess the fact i am charged with and yield myself most miserably guilty  rochfort heaven take mercy upon your soul then it must leave your body   since that the politic law provides that servants to whose care we commit our goods shall die if they abuse our trust what can you look for to whose charge this most hopeful lord gave up all he received from his brave ancestors all he could leave to his posterity his honor  wicked woman in whose safety all his lifes joys and comforts were locked up which thy lust a thief has now stolen from him and therefore   charalois stay just judge  may not what is lost by her one fault for i am charitable and charge her not with many be forgotten in her fair life hereafter  rochfort never sir the wrong that is done to the chaste married bed repentant tears can never expiate and be assured to pardon such a sin is an offense as great as to commit it  in consequence of this the husband strikes her dead before her fathers eyes the act indeed is horrid even tragedy shrinks from it and nature with a fathers voice instantly cries out  is she dead then  and you have killed her  charalois avows it and pleads his sentence for the deed the revolting agonized parent breaks forth into one of the most pathetic natural and expressive lamentations that the english drama can produce   but i pronounced it as a judge only and a friend to justice and zealous in defense of your wronged honor broke all the ties of nature and cast off the love and soft affection of a father i in your cause put on a scarlet robe of red died cruelty but in return you have advanced for me no flag of mercy i looked on you as a wronged husband but you closed your eyes against me as a father oh beaumelle oh my daughter   charalois this is madness  rochfort keep from me  could not one good thought rise up to tell you that she was my ages comfort begot by a weak man and born a woman and could not therefore but partake of frailty or wherefore did not thankfulness step forth to urge my many merits which i may object to you since you prove ungrateful flintyhearted charalois   charalois nature does prevail above your virtue  what conclusions can i draw from these comparative examples which every reader would not anticipate is there a man who has any feeling for real nature dramatic character moral sentiment tragic pathos or nervous diction who can hesitate even for a moment where to bestow the palm  no xci an toti morimur seneca in troad i believe there are few people who have not at some time or other felt a propensity to humor themselves in that kind of melancholy which arises in the mind upon revisiting the scene of former happiness and contemplating the change that time has wrought in its appearance by the mournful comparison of present with past impressions  in this train of thought i was the other day carried almost imperceptibly to the country seat of a deceased friend whose loss i must ever lament i had not been there since his death and there was a dreariness in the scene as i approached that might have almost tempted me to believe even things inanimate partook of my sensations the traces of my friend whose solicitude for order and seemliness reached to every thing about him were no longer to be seen the cottages and little gardens of his poor neighbors which used to be so trim and neat whilst his eye was over them seemed to be falling into neglect the lawn before his house was now become a solitude no laborers at their work no domestics at their sports and exercises i looked around for my old acquaintance that used to be grazing up and down upon their pensions of pasturage they had probably been food for hounds long ago nature had lost her smile of hospitality and benevolence methought i never saw any thing more disconsolate  as i entered the house an aged woman whom i had long remembered as one of the family met me in the passage and looking me in the face cried out is it you sir  and burst into tears she followed me into the common sittingroom and as she was opening the shutters observed to me  that it did not look as it used to do when my lord was living it was true i had already made the remark in silence  how the face of a friend said i within myself enlivens all things about him what hours of placid delight have i passed within these walls have i ever heard a word here fall from his lips that i have wished him to recall has the reputation of the absent ever bled by a stab of his giving has the sensibility of any person present suffered for an expression of his once and only once in this very spot i drew from him the circumstantial detail of an unfortunate period in his life it was a recital so manly and ingenuous so void of coloring so disdainful of complaint and so untainted by asperity that it carried conviction to my mind and i can scarce conceive a degree of prejudice that could have held out against it but i could perceive that the greatest event in a mans history may turn by springs so subtle and concealed that they can never be laid open for public exculpation and that in the process of all human trials there may be things too small for the fingers of the law to feel motives which produce the good or ill fortunes of men and govern their actions but which cannot guide the judgments or even come under the contemplation of those who are appointed to decide upon them  i soon quitted this apartment and entered one which i contemplated with more satisfaction and even with a degree of veneration for it was the chamber in which i had seen my friend yield up the last breath of life few men had endured greater persecution in the world none could leave it in greater peace and charity if forgiveness of injuries constitutes a merit our enemies surely are those to whom we are most beholden how awful is the last scene of a mans life who has filled a dubious and important part on the stage of the world  of a truth thought i thou art happily removed out of an unfriendly world if thou had deceived my good opinion it had been an injury to my nature but though the living man can wear a mask and carry on deceit the dying christian cannot counterfeit sudden death may smite the hypocrite the sensualist the impostor and they may die in their shame but slow and gradual dissolution a lingering death of agony and decay will strip the human heart before it seizes it it will lay it naked before it stops it there is no trifling with some solemnities no prevaricating with god when we are on the very threshold of his presence many worldly friendships dissolve away with his breath to whom they were pledged but thy last moments my friend were so employed as to seal my affection to thy memory closer than it was ever attached to thy person and i have it now to say there was a man whom i have loved and served and who has not deceived or betrayed me  and what must i now think of popularity when i reflect upon those who had it and upon this man who had it not fallacious test  contemptible pursuit how often since the exile of aristides has integrity been thy victim and villainy thine idol worship it then thou filthy idolater and take the proper wages of thy servility be the dupe of cunning and the stalkinghorse of hypocrisy  what a contrast to the death i have now been reviewing occurs to my mind when i reflect upon the dreadful consummation of the once popular antitheus i remember him in the height of his fame the hero of his party no man so caressed followed and applauded he was a little loose his friends would own in his moral character but then he was the honestest fellow in the world it was not to be denied that he was rather free in his notions but then he was the best creature living i have seen men of the gravest characters wink at his sallies because he was so pleasant and so well bred it was impossible to be angry with him every thing went well with him and antitheus seemed to be at the summit of human prosperity when he was suddenly seized with the most alarming symptoms he was at his country house and which had rarely happened to him he at that time chanced to be alone wife or family he had none and out of the multitude of his friends no one happened to be near him at the moment of this attack  a neighboring physician was called out of bed in the night to come to him with all haste in this extremity he found him sitting up in his bed supported by pillows his countenance full of horror his breath struggling as in the article of death his pulse intermitting and at times beating with such rapidity as could hardly be counted antitheus dismissed the attendants he had about him and eagerly demanded of the physician if he thought him in danger the physician answered that he must fairly tell him he was in imminent danger  how so how so do you think me dying  he was sorry to say the symptoms indicated death  impossible you must not let me die i dare not die o doctor save me if you can  your situation sir is such said the physician that it is not in mine or any other mans art to save you and i think i should not do my duty if i gave you any false hopes in these moments which if i am not mistaken will not more than suffice for any worldly or other concerns which you may have upon your mind to settle  my mind is full of horror cried the dying man and i am incapable of preparing it for death  he now fell into an agony accompanied with a shower of tears a cordial was administered and he revived in a degree when turning to the physician who had his fingers on his pulse he eagerly demanded of him if he did not see that blood upon the feetcurtains of his bed there was none to be seen the physician assured him it was nothing but a vapor of his fancy  i see it plainly said antitheus in the shape of a human hand i have been visited with a tremendous apparition as i was lying sleepless in my bed this night i took up a letter of a deceased friend to dissipate certain thoughts that made me uneasy i believed him to be a great philosopher and was converted to his opinious persuaded by his arguments and my own experience that the disorderly affairs of this evil world could not be administered by any wise just or provident being i had brought myself to think no such being could exist and that a life produced by chance must terminate in annihilation this is the reasoning of that letter and such were the thoughts i was revolving in my mind when the apparition of my dead friend presented itself before me and unfolding the curtains of my bed stood at my feet looking earnestly upon me for a considerable space of time my heart sunk within me for his face was ghastly full of horror with an expression of such anguish as i can never describe his eyes were fixed upon me and at length with a mournful motion of his head  alas alas he cried we are in a fatal error  and taking hold of the curtains with his hand shook them violently and disappeared  this i protest to you i both saw and heard and look where the print of his hand is left in blood upon the curtains  antitheus survived the relation of this vision very few hours and died delirious in great agonies  what a forsaken and disconsolate creature is a man without religion  reader whosoever thou art deceive not thyself let not passion or prosperity or wit or wantonness seduce thy reason to an attempt against the truth if thou have the faculties of a man thou will never bring thyself to a fixed persuasion that there is no god struggle how thou will against the notion there will be a moment when the glaring conviction will burst upon thy mind now mark what follows  if there is a god the government of the world is in that god and this once admitted the necessity of a future state follows of consequence ask thyself then what can be the purposes of that future state what but those of justice and retribution to reward the good and to punish the evil our present life then is a life of probation a state of trial and of discipline preparatory to that future state now see what is fallen upon thee and look well to thyself for the consequences thou have let the idea of a god into thy mind because indeed thou could not keep it out and religion rushes through the breach it is natural religion hitherto and no more but no matter there is enough even in natural religion to make thee tremble whither will thou now resort for comfort whither fly for refuge from the wrath to come  behold the asylum is open christianity is thy salvation and redemption that which natural religion has shadowed out to thee in terrors christianity will reveal in glory it will clear up thy doubts disperse thy fears and turn thy hopes into certainty thy reasonings about a future state which are but reasonings it will not only verify by divine authorities but by positive proof by visible example attested by witnesses confirmed by the evidence of the senses and uncontradicted by the history of ages now thou will know to thy comfort that there is a mediator gone before thee who will help out thy imperfect atonement when thou art brought to judgment in a future state thou will indeed be told for certain that this life is a state of probation and that thou shall be brought to account for thine actions but thou will be taught an easy lesson of salvation thou will be cheared with the mercies of thy god and comforted with the assurance of pardon if thou will heartily turn to repentance thou will find that all this system of religion is conformable to those natural notions which reason suggested to thee before with this advantage that it makes them clearer purifies refines enlarges them shuts out every dismal prospect opens all that is delightful and points a road to heaven through paths of peace and pleasantness  no xcii i do not know a man in england better received in the circles of the great than jack gayless though he has no one quality for which he ought to be respected and some points in his character for which he should be held in detestation yet his manners are externally so agreeable and his temper generally so social that he makes a holiday in every family where he visits he lives with the nobility upon the easiest footing and in the great houses where he is in habits of intimacy he knows all the domestics by name and has something to say to every one of them upon his arrival he has a joke with the butler at the sideboard during dinner and sets the footman a tittering behind his chair and is so comical and so familiar  he has the best receipt book in england and recommends himself to the cook by a new sauce for he is in the secrets of the kings kitchen at versailles he has the finest breed of spaniels in europe and is never without a puppy at the command of a friend he knows the theory of hunting from top to bottom is always in with the hounds can develop every hit in a check and was never known to cheer a wrong dog in a cover when he gives his tongue if you want an odd horse to match your set jack is your man and for a neat traveling carriage there is not an item that he will not superintend if you are desirous to employ him he will be at your door with it when the builder brings it home to see that nothing is wanting he is so ready and so obliging no man canvasses a county or borough like jack gayless he is so pleasant with the freeholders and has so many songs and such facetious toasts and such a way with him amongst their wives and daughters that flesh and blood cannot hold out against him in short he is the best leader of a mob and of course the honestest fellow in england  a merchants daughter of great fortune married him for love he ran away with her from a boardingschool but her father after a time was reconciled to his soninlaw and jack during the life of the good man passed his time in a small country house on clapham common superintending the concerns of about six acres of ground being very expert however in the gardens and grapehouse and a very sociable fellow over a bottle with the citizen and his friends on a saturday and sunday he became a mighty favorite all this while he lived upon the best terms with his wife kept her a neat little palfrey and regularly took his airing on the common by her side in the most uxorious manner she was in fact a most excellent creature of the sweetest temper and mildest manners so that there seemed no interruption to their happiness but what arose from her health which was of a delicate nature after a few years the citizen died and jack whose conviviality had given him a helping hand out of the world found himself in possession of a very handsome sum of money upon casting up his affairs at his decease  jack gayless having no further purpose to serve saw no occasion to consult appearances any longer and began to form connexions in which he did not think it necessary for his wife to have a share he now set out upon the pursuit of what the world calls pleasure and soon found himself in the company of those whom the world calls the great he had the address to recommend himself to his new acquaintance and used great dispatch in getting rid of his old ones his wife was probably his greatest encumbrance on this occasion but jack possessed one art in perfection which stood him in great stead he had the civillest way of insulting that could be imagined and as the feelings of his wife were those of the fondest susceptibility operating upon a weak and delicate constitution he succeeded to admiration in tormenting her by neglect at the same time that he never gave her a harsh expression and in particular when any body else was present behaved himself toward her in so obliging a manner that all his acquaintance set him down as the best tempered fellow living and her as a lady by his report rather captious and querulential when he had thus got the world on his side he detached himself more and more from her society and became less studious to disguise the insults he put upon her she declined fast in her health and certain symptoms began to appear which convinced jack that a perseverance in his system would in a short time lay her in the grave and leave him without any further molestation her habit was consumptive for where is the human frame that can long resist the agony of the heart in this extremity she requested the assistance of a certain physician very eminent in these cases this little gentleman has a way of hitting off the complaints of his patients which is not always so convenient to those expectant parties who have made up their minds and reconciled themselves to the call of nature as jack had one object and the doctor another they did not entirely agree in their process and she was sent down by her husband into a distant county for the benefit of the air in a low situation and a damp house jack and the physician had now a scene of altercation in which it was evident that the least man of the two had the greatest spirit and the largest heart and jack certainly put up with some expressions which could only be passed over by perfect innocence or absolute cowardice the little doctor who had no objection to send jack out of the world and a very longing desire to keep his lady in it spoke like a man who had long been in the practice of holding death at defiance but what jack lost in argument he made up in address and after professing his acquiescence in the measures of his antagonist he silently determined to pursue his own and the doctors departure was very soon followed by that of his patient the dying wife made a feeble stand for a while but what can a broken heart do against a hardened one  after jack had taken such zealous pains to overruled the doctors advice it is not to be supposed but he would have accompanied his wife to the place of her destination if it had been only for the satisfaction of contemplating the effects of his own greater sagacity in her case and he protested to her in the kindest manner that nothing should have robbed him of the pleasure of attending her on the journey but the most indispensable and unexpected business he had just then received letters from two friends which would be attended with the greatest breach of honor if neglected and she knew his nicety of principle in those affairs he would not read them to her as she was in too weak a condition he observed to attend to business but she might rest assured he would if possible overtake her on the way or be with her in a few hours after her arrival for he should be impatient to be a witness of her recovery which he persuaded himself would soon take place when she had made experiment of the place he had chosen for her when he had finished his apology his wife raised her eyes from the ground where she had fixed them whilst he was speaking and with a look of such mild languor and such dying softness as would almost have melted marble into pity mournfully replied  farewell  and resigning herself to the support of her maid and a nurse was lifted into her carriage and left her husband to pursue his business without reproach  jack gayless now lost no further time in fulfilling the promise he had made to his wife and immediately began to apply himself to the letters which had so indispensably prevented him from paying her those kind offices which her situation was in so much need of these letters i shall now insert as some of my readers may probably think he wants a justification on this occasion the first was from a great lady of unblemished reputation who has a character for public charity and domestic virtues which even malice has not dared to impeach her ladyship was now at her country seat where she presided at a table of the most splendid hospitality and regulated a princely establishment with consummate judgment and decorum in this great family jack had long been a welcome visiter and as he had received a thousand kindnesses at her hands gratitude would dispose him to consider her requests as commands the most pressing the important contents were as follows viz  dear jack i am sorry your wifes so sick but methinks you would do well to change the scene and come amongst us now homes so dull you will be grieved to hear i have clapped tom jones in the back sinews ned has put a charge to him but he is so cruelly let down i am afraid he must be scord with a fine iron and that will be an eyesore to say no worse on it my lord you know hates writing so he bids me tell you to bring moll ross with you as he thinks there is a young man here will take her off your hands and as you have had the best of her and she is rather under your weight think you will be glad to get well out of her would you believe it i was eight hours in the saddle yesterday we dug a fox in lady tabbys park the old dowager goes on setting traps all the country round cries out upon it thank the fates she had a pyd peacock and a whole brood of guinea fowls carried off last night my lord says it is a judgment upon her dont forget to bring your highland tarrier as i would fain have a cross with my bitch cruel  dear jack yours    as jack gayless was not one of those milksops who let family excuses stand in the way of the more amiable office of obliging his friends and saw in its just light the ridicule he would naturally expose himself to if he sheltered himself under so silly a pretense as a wifes sickness he would infallibly have obeyed her ladyships commands and set out with the highland tarrier instead of mrs gayless if he had not been divided by another very pressing attention which every man of the world will acknowledge the importance of there was a certain young lady of easy virtue who had made a tender impression on his heart as he was innocently taking the air in hyde park he had prevailed so far with her as to gain her consent to an appointment for that day not foreseeing as i should suppose or perhaps not just at that moment recollecting his wifes journey and the call there would be upon him on that account this young lady who was wanting in no other virtue but chastity had learnt some particulars of mr gayless which she had not been informed of when she yielded to the assignation and in consequence had written him the following perplexing billet sir i am sorry it is not possible for me to receive the honor of your visit and the more so as i am afraid my reason for declining it though insuperable with me will not appear a sufficient one in your opinion i have just now been informed that you are a married man this would have been enough if i had not heard it with the addition that your lady is one of the most excellent and most injured women living  if indeed she be yet living for i learn from the same authority that she is in the last stage of a rapid decline  in what ght must i regard myself if i was to supply you with a motive for neglecting that attention which her situation demands of you dont let it surprise you that a woman who has forfeited her claim to modesty should yet retain some pretensions to humanity if you have renounced both the one and the other i have a double motive for declining your acquaintance  i am etc       the style of this letter seemed so extraordinary to jack and so unlike what he had been used to receive from correspondents of this ladys description that it is not to be wondered at if it threw him into a profound meditation not that the rebuke made any other impression on him than as it seemed to involve a mystery which he could not expound for it never entered into his head to suppose that the writer was in earnest in this dilemma he imparted it to a friend and with his usual gaiety desired his help to unriddle it his friend perused it and with a serious countenance told him he was acquainted with the lady and gave her perfect credit for the sincerity of the sentiments it contained she was a romantic girl he told him and not worth a further thought but as he perceived he was chagrined with the affair he advised him to take post for the country and attend the summons of his noble correspondent for that he himself had always found the dissipation of a journey the best remedy in all cases of vexation like the present this friendly advice was immediately followed by an order for the journey and jack gayless put himself into his postchaise with his tarrier by his side ordering his groom to follow with moll ross by easy stages  whilst jack was rapidly posting toward the house of jollity and dissipation his suffering and forsaken wife by slow stages pursued her last melancholy journey supported in her coach by her two women and attended by an old man servant of her fathers she at last reached the allotted house where her miseries were to find a period one indiscretion only a stolen and precipitate marriage had marked her life with a blemish and the husband who in early youth had betrayed her artless affection into that fatal mistake was now the chosen instrument of chastisement she bore her complicated afflictions with the most patient resignation neither sickness nor sorrow forced a complaint from her and death by the gentleness of his advances seemed to lay aside his terrors and approach her with respect and pity  jack was still upon his visit when he received the news of her death this event obliged him to break off from a most agreeable party and take a journey to london but as the season had happened to set in for a severe frost and the foxhounds were confined to their kennel he had the consolation to reflect that his amusements were not so much interrupted as they might have been he gave orders for a handsome funeral and deported himself with such outward propriety on the occasion that all the world gave him credit for his behavior and he continues to be the same popular character amongst his acquaintance and universally caressed in short jack gayless to use the phrase of fashion is the honestest fellow in england and  a disgrace to human nature  no xciii being now arrived at the conclusion of my third volume and having hitherto given my readers very little interruption in my own person i hope i may be permitted to make one short valedictory address to these departing adventurers in whose success i am naturally so much interested  i have employed much time and care in rearing up these essays to what i conceived maturity and qualifying them as far as i was able to shift for themselves in a world where they are to inherit no popularity from their author nor to look for any favor but what they can earn for themselves to any who shall question them who they are and whence they come they may truly answer  we are all one mans sons  we are indeed observers but no spies if this shall not suffice and they must needs give a farther account of themselves they will have to say that he who sent them into the world sent them as an offering of his good will to mankind that he trusts they have been so trained as not to hurt the feelings or offend the principles of any man who shall admit them into his company and that for their errors which he cannot doubt are many he hopes they will be found errors of the understanding not of the heart they are the first fruits of his leisure and retirement and as the mind of a man in that situation will naturally bring the past scenes of active life under its examination and review it will surely be considered as a pardonable zeal for being yet serviceable to mankind if he gives his experience and observations to the world when he has no further expectations from it on the score of fame or fortune these are the real motives for the publication of these papers and this the authors true state of mind to serve the cause of morality and religion is his first ambition to point out some useful lessons for amending the education and manners of young people of either sex and to mark the evil habits and unsocial humors of men with a view to their reformation are the general objects of his undertaking he has formed his mind to be contented with the consciousness of these honest endeavors and with a very moderate share of success he has ample reason notwithstanding to be more than satisfied with the reception these papers have already had in their probationary excursion and it is not from any disgust taken up in a vain conceit of his own merits that he has more than once observed upon the frauds and follies of popularity or that he now repeats his opinion that it is the worst guide a public man can follow who wishes not to go out of the track of honesty for at the same time that he has seen men force their way in the world by effrontery and heard others applauded for their talents whose only recommendation has been their ingenuity in wickedness he can recollect very few indeed who have succeeded either in same or fortune under the disadvantages of modesty and merit  to such readers as shall have taken up these essays with a candid disposition to be pleased he will not scruple to express a hope that they have not been altogether disappointed for though he has been unassisted in composing them he has endeavored to open a variety of resources sensible that he had many different palates to provide for the subject of politics however will never be one of these resources a subject which he has neither the will nor the capacity to meddle with there is yet another topic which he has been no less studious to avoid which is personality and though he professes to give occasional delineations of living manners and not to make men in his closet as some essayists have done he does not mean to point at individuals for as this is a practice which he has ever rigidly abstained from when he mixed in the world he should hold himself without the excuse even of temptation if he was now to take it up when he has withdrawn himself from the world  in the essays which he has presumed to call literary because he cannot strike upon any apposite title of an humbler sort he has studied to render himself intelligible to readers of all descriptions and the deepread scholar will not fastidiously pronounce them shallow only because he can fathom them with ease for that would be to wrong both himself and their author who if there is any vanity in a pedantic margin of references certainly resisted that vanity and as certainly had it at his choice to have loaded his page with as great a parade of authorities as any of his brother writers upon classical subjects have ostentatiously displayed but if any learned critic now or hereafter shall find occasion to charge these essays on the score of false authority or actual error their author will most thankfully meet the investigation and the fair reviewer shall find that he has either candor to adopt correction or materials enough in reserve to maintain every warrantable assertion  the moralist and the divine it is hoped will here find nothing to except against it is not likely such an offense should be committed by one who has rested all his hope in that revelation on which his faith is founded whom nothing could ever divert from his aim of turning even the gayest subjects to moral purposes and who reprobates the jest which provokes a laugh at the expense of a blush  the essays of a critical sort are no less addressed to the moral objects of composition than to those which they have more professedly in view they are not undertaken for the invidious purpose of developing errors and stripping the laurels of departed poets but simply for the uses of the living the specimens already given and those which are intended to follow in the further prosecution of the work are proposed as disquisitions of instruction rather than of subtlety and if they shall be found more particularly to apply to dramatic compositions it is because their author looks up to the stage as the great arbiter of more important delights than those only which concern the taste and talents of the nation it is because he sees with serious regret the buffoonery and low abuse of humor to which it is sinking and apprehends for the consequences such an influx of folly may lead to it will be readily granted there are but two modes of combating this abasement of the drama with any probability of success one of these modes is by an exposition of some one or other of the productions in question which are supposed to contribute to its degradation the other is by inviting the attention of the public to an examination of better models in which the standard works of our early dramatists abound if the latter mode therefore should be adopted in these essays and the former altogether omitted none of their readers will regret the preference that has been given upon such an alternative  if the ladies of wit and talents do not take offense at some of these essays it will be a test of the truth of their pretensions when they discern that the raillery pointed only at affectation and false character has no concern with them there is nothing in which this nation has more right to pride itself than the genius of its women they have only to add a little more attention to their domestic virtues and their same will fly over the face of the globe if i had ever known a good match broken off on the part of the man because a young lady had too much modesty and discretion or was
