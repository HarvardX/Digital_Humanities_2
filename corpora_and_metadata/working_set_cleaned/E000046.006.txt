correspondence and miscellaneous writings     –         thomas jefferson september        paris james madison to james madison j mss paris september        dear sir —i sit down to write to you without knowing by what occasion i shall send my letter i do it because a subject comes into my head which i would wish to develope a little more than is practicable in the hurry of the moment of making up general despatches the question whether one generation of men has a right to bind another seems never to have been started either on this or our side of the water yet it is a question of such consequences as not only to merit decision but place also among the fundamental principles of every government the course of reflection in which we are immersed here on the elementary principles of society has presented this question to my mind and that no such obligation can be transmitted i think very capable of proof i set out on this ground which i suppose to be self evident that the earth belongs in usufruct to the   living that the dead have neither powers nor rights over it the portion occupied by any individual ceases to be his when himself ceases to be and reverts to the society if the society has formed no rules for the appropriation of its lands in severalty it will be taken by the first occupants these will generally be the wife and children of the decedent if they have formed rules of appropriation those rules may give it to the wife and children or to some one of them or to the legatee of the deceased so they may give it to his creditor but the child the legatee or creditor takes it not by any natural right but by a law of the society of which they are members and to which they are subject then no man can by natural right oblige the lands he occupied or the persons who succeed him in that occupation to the paiment of debts contracted by him for if he could he might during his own life eat up the usufruct of the lands for several generations to come and then the lands would belong to the dead and not to the living which would be reverse of our principle what is true of every member of the society individually is true of them all collectively since the rights of the whole can be no more than the sum of the rights of individuals to keep our ideas clear when applying them to a multitude let us suppose a whole generation of men to be born on the same day to attain mature age on the same day and to die on the same day leaving a succeeding generation in the moment of attaining their mature age all together let the ripe age be supposed of    years and their period of life    years more that being the   average term given by the bills of mortality to persons who have already attained    years of age each successive generation would in this way come on and go off the stage at a fixed moment as individuals do now then i say the earth belongs to each of these generations during its course fully and in their own right the  d generation receives it clear of the debts and incumbrances of the  st the  d of the  d and so on for if the  st could charge it with a debt then the earth would belong to the dead and not the living generation then no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of its own existence at    years of age they may bind themselves and their lands for    years to come at    for    at    for    and at    for one year only because these are the terms of life which remain to them at those respective epochs but a material difference must be noted between the succession of an individual and that of a whole generation individuals are parts only of a society subject to the laws of a whole these laws may appropriate the portion of land occupied by a decedent to his creditor rather than to any other or to his child on condition he satisfies his creditor but when a whole generation that is the whole society dies as in the case we have supposed and another generation or society succeeds this forms a whole and there is no superior who can give their territory to a third society who may have lent money to their predecessors beyond their faculty of paying what is true of a generation all arriving to selfgovernment on the same day and dying all on the   same day is true of those on a constant course of decay and renewal with this only difference a generation coming in and going out entire as in the first case would have a right in the  st year of their self dominion to contract a debt for    years in the  0th for    in the  0th for    in the  0th for   whereas generations changing daily by daily deaths and births have one constant term beginning at the date of their contract and ending when a majority of those of full age at that date shall be dead the length of that term may be estimated from the tables of mortality corrected by the circumstances of climate occupation c peculiar to the country of the contractors take for instance the table of m de buffon wherein he states       deaths and the ages at which they happened suppose a society in which       persons are born every year and live to the ages stated in this table the conditions of that society will be as follows  st it will consist constantly of     0  persons of all ages  dly of those living at any one instant of time one half will be dead in    years   months  dly  0    will arrive every year at the age of    years complete  thly it will constantly have        persons of all ages above    years  ly and the half of those of    years and upwards living at any one instant of time will be dead in    years   months or say    years as the nearest integral number then    years is the term beyond which neither the representatives of a nation nor even the whole nation itself assembled can validly extend a debt to render this conclusion palpable by example   suppose that louis xiv and xv had contracted debts in the name of the french nation to the amount of  0000 milliards of livres and that the whole had been contracted in genoa the interest of this sum would be  00 milliards which is said to be the whole rentroll or nett proceeds of the territory of france must the present generation of men have retired from the territory in which nature produced them and ceded it to the genoese creditors no they have the same rights over the soil on which they were produced as the preceding generations had they derive these rights not from their predecessors but from nature they then and their soil are by nature clear of the debts of their predecessors again suppose louis xv and his contemporary generation had said to the money lenders of genoa give us money that we may eat drink and be merry in our day and on condition you will demand no interest till the end of    years you shall then forever after receive an annual interest of      per cent the money is lent on these conditions is divided among the living eaten drank and squandered would the present generation be obliged to apply the produce of the earth and of their labour to replace their dissipations not at all i suppose that the received opinion that the public debts of one generation devolve on the next has been suggested by our seeing habitually in private life that he who succeeds to lands is required to pay the debts   of his ancestor or testator without considering that this requisition is municipal only not moral flowing from the will of the society which has found it convenient to appropriate the lands become vacant by the death of their occupant on the condition of a paiment of his debts but that between society and society or generation and generation there is no municipal obligation no umpire but the law of nature we seem not to have perceived that by the law of nature one generation is to another as one independant nation to another the interest of the national debt of france being in fact but a two thousandth part of its rentroll the paiment of it is practicable enough and so becomes a question merely of honor or expediency but with respect to future debts would it not be wise and just for that nation to declare in the constitution they are forming that neither the legislature nor the nation itself can validly contract more debt than they may pay within their own age or within the term of    years and that all future contracts shall be deemed void as to what shall remain unpaid at the end of    years from their date this would put the lenders and the borrowers also on their guard by reducing too the faculty of borrowing within its natural limits it would bridle the spirit of war to which too free a course has been procured by the inattention of money lenders to this law of nature that succeeding generations are not responsible for the preceding on similar ground it may be proved that no society can make a perpetual constitution or even a   perpetual law the earth belongs always to the living generation they may manage it then and what proceeds from it as they please during their usufruct they are masters too of their own persons and consequently may govern them as they please but persons and property make the sum of the objects of government the constitution and the laws of their predecessors extinguished them in their natural course with those whose will gave them being this could preserve that being till it ceased to be itself and no longer every constitution then and every law naturally expires at the end of    years if it be enforced longer it is an act of force and not of right it may be said that the succeeding generation exercising in fact the power of repeal this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law had been expressly limited to    years only in the first place this objection admits the right in proposing an equivalent but the power of repeal is not an equivalent it might be indeed if every form of government were so perfectly contrived that the will of the majority could always be obtained fairly and without impediment but this is true of no form the people cannot assemble themselves their representation is unequal and vicious various checks are opposed to every legislative proposition factions get possession of the public councils bribery corrupts them personal interests lead them astray from the general interests of their constituents and other impediments arise so as to prove to every practical man that a law of limited duration is much more manageable than one which needs a repeal  0 this principle that the earth belongs to the living and not to the dead is of very extensive application and consequences in every country and most especially in france it enters into the resolution of the questions whether the nation may change the descent of lands holden in tail whether they may change the appropriation of lands given antiently to the church to hospitals colleges orders of chivalry and otherwise in perpetuity whether they may abolish the charges and privileges attached on lands including the whole catalogue ecclesiastical and feudal it goes to hereditary offices authorities and jurisdictions to hereditary orders distinctions and appellations to perpetual monopolies in commerce the arts or sciences with a long train of et ceteras and it renders the question of reimbursement a question of generosity and not of right in all these cases the legislature of the day could authorize such appropriations and establishments for their own time but no longer and the present holders even where they or their ancestors have purchased are in the case of bona fide purchasers of what the seller had no right to convey turn this subject in your mind my dear sir and particularly as to the power of contracting debts and develope it with that perspicuity and cogent logic which is so peculiarly yours your station in the councils of our country gives you an opportunity of producing it to public consideration of forcing it into discussion at first blush it may be rallied as a theoretical speculation but examination will prove it to be solid and salutary it would furnish matter for a    fine preamble to our first law for appropriating the public revenue and it will exclude at the threshold of our new government the contagious and ruinous errors of this quarter of the globe which have armed despots with means not sanctioned by nature for binding in chains their fellowmen we have already given in example one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from the executive to the legislative body from those who are to spend to those who are to pay i should be pleased to see this second obstacle held out by us also in the first instance no nation can make a declaration against the validity of longcontracted debts so disinterestedly as we since we do not owe a shilling which may not be paid with ease principal and interest within the time of our own lives establish the principle also in the new law to be passed for protecting copy rights and new inventions by securing the exclusive right for    instead of    years a line entirely faded an instance the more of our taking reason for our guide instead of english precedents the habit of which fetters us with all the political herecies of a nation equally remarkable for its encitement from some errors as long slumbering under others i write you no news because when an occasion occurs i shall write a separate letter for that     thomas jefferson sep         paris william carmichael to william carmichael j mss paris sep         dear sir —i have duly received your favor of aug    and i have written to francesco and giuseppe chiappe both to assure them of the friendly light in which our government will view the restitution of the schooner from salem made by the emperor i have lately received letters  papers from america to the   th of july new york and n hampshire had elected their senators so that that branch of our legislature was complete congress had decided that the president should have no title of courtesy the bill for the impost was past that also for establishing an office of foreign affairs bills for establishing offices of war  of finance for establishing a federal judicature for the government of the western country establishing a land office for an impost on tonnage for fixing the presidents allowance at   000  the vicepresidents at  000 dollars a year were so far advanced as to be near    their passage they had refused to establish a secretary for the domestic departments new york had passed a law appointing commissioners to agree with the state of vermont on the conditions of its independence none of the higher federal offices were yet filled with respect to the extraordinary expences which you may be under the necessity of incurring at the coronation i am not authorized to give any advice nor does any body my dear sir need it less than yourself i should certainly suppose that the representative of the u s at madrid was to do as the representatives of other sovereignties do and that it would be viewed as the complement of our nation  not of its minister if this be the true point of view it proves at whose expence it should be but my opinion would be viewed as an interested one  therefore of no weight in some letter which i had the honor of writing you a year  a half or two years ago for having packed my letters i cannot name the date exactly i took the liberty of saying what i thought would be prudent relative to the algerine captives from that time forward the two accompts you send me i will take with me to america  undertake to place you at ease as to them but i believe you cannot keep yourself too clear as to others i will write you more fully when i shall have conferred with our government and if you are not placed more at ease on other accounts it will not be that i have not a due sense of the necessity of it nor that i shall be wanting in expressing that sense i have received my leave of absence  my baggage is already gone    off i shall follow myself in about  0 days so as to sail about the last of the month i am not certain whether from havre or lorient mr short being named chargé des affairs in my absence will be happy in your correspondence till i can resume it thomas jefferson sep         paris ralph izard to ralph izard j mss paris sep         dear sir —i have received by mr cutting your favor of april   in order to ascertain what proportion of your rice might be taken off by this country i applied to the proper officer and obtained a statement of their importations of rice for a twelve month and from what countries this i inclose to you you will observe it is between    and    thousand quintals which i suppose to be about a fourth or fifth of your whole exportation a part of this will always be from piedmont but yours may gain ground from two causes  st its preference over that of piedmont increases  dly the consumption increases paris and the seaport towns are the principal places of consumption but most of all paris havre therefore is unquestionably the deposit for it because from thence it may come up the river or be shipped to any foreign market as conveniently as from cowes i wish much you had a good merchant or consignee there there is a brother of cuttings there of whom i hear good spoken but i do not know him myself all i know is that an honest intelligent  active consignee there or two of them could do immense    service to your countrymen—when i received your letter i was too near the time of my departure to undertake to procure from constantinople the intelligence you desired relative to that as a market for your rice i therefore wrote to a merchant of my acquaintance at marseilles engaged in the levant and also in the american trade i asked from him the prices current of constantinople  of marseilles for some years past i inclose you his answer giving only the present price at marseilles  the price of a particular cargo only at constantinople when i return here i will try through the french ambassador at constantinople to get more particular information but we must get rid of the algerines i think this practicable by means honorable  within our power but of this we will converse when i shall have the honor of seeing you at new york which will be in february if there be no particular cause for my going on there till i shall have arranged the private business which has rendered it necessary for me to visit my country—i wish the cargo of olives spoken of in the inclosed letter  which went to baltimore may have got on safe to carolina  that the one he is about to send may also arrive safe this my dear friend should be the object of the carolina patriot after bread i know no blessing to the poor in this world equal to that of oil but there should be an annual sum steadily applied to that object because a first and second essay may fail the plants cost little the transportation little it is unremitting attention which is requisite a common country labourer whose business it should be to    prepare and pack his plants at marseilles  to go on with them through the canal of languedoc to bordeaux and there stay with them till put on board a ship to charleston  to send at the same time great quantities of the berries to sow for stocks would require but a moderate annual sum he would make the journey every fall only till you should have such a stock of plants taken in the country as to render you sure of success but of this too we will talk on meeting the crisis of this country is not yet absolutely past the unskilfulness of new administrators leaves the capital in danger of the confusion which may attend the want of bread surrounded by a country which has just gathered in a plentiful harvest thomas jefferson sep  0      havre john jay to the secretary for foreign affairs john jay j mss havre sep  0      sir —no convenient ship having offered from any port of france i have engaged one from london to take me up to cowes and am so far on my way thither she will land me at norfolk  as i do not know any service that would be rendered by my repairing immediately to new york i propose in order to economise time to go directly to my own house get through the business which calls me there and then repair to new york where i shall be ready to reembark for europe but should there be any occasion for government to receive any information i can give immediately on my arrival i will go to new    york on receiving your orders at richmond they may probably be there before me as this goes by mr trumbull bound directly for new york i inclose you herewith the proceedings of the national assembly on saturday last wherein you will perceive that the comittee had approved the plan of mr neckar i can add from other sure information received here that the assembly adopted it the same evening this plan may possibly keep their paiments alive until their new government gets into motion tho i do not think it very certain the public stocks lowered so exceedingly the last days of my stay at paris that i wrote to our bankers at amsterdam to desire that they retain till further orders the  0000 guilders or so much of it as was not yet come on and as to what might be already coming on i recommended to mr short to go  take the acceptances himself  keep the bill in his own hands till the time of paiment he will by that time be able to see what is best to be done with the money in taking leave of monsieur de montmorin i asked him whether their west india ports would continue open to us awhile he said they would be immediately declared open till february and we may be sure they will be so till the next harvest he agreed with me that there would be two or three months provision for the whole kingdom wanting for the ensuing year the consumption of bread for the whole kingdom is two millions of livres tournois a day the people pay the real price of their bread everywhere except at paris  versailles there the price is suffered to vary very little as to them     government pays the difference it has been supposed that this difference for some time past has cost a million a week i thought the occasion favorable to propose to monsieur de montmorin the free admission of our salted provisions observing to him particularly that our salted beef from the eastern states could be dealt out to the people of paris for   or   sols the pound which is but half the common price they pay for fresh beef that the parisian paying less for his meat might pay more for his bread  so relieve government from its enormous loss on that article his idea of this resource seemed unfavorable we talked over the objections of the supposed unhealthiness of that food its tendency to produce scurvy the chance of its taking with a people habituated to fresh meat their comparative qualities of rendering vegetables eatable  the interests of the gabelles he concluded with saying the experiment might be tried  with desiring me to speak with mr neckar i went to mr neckar  he was gone to the national assembly on my return to paris therefore i wrote to him on the subject going over the objections which monsieur de montmorin had started mr short was to carry the letter himself  to pursue the subject having observed that our commerce to havre is considerably on the increase  that most of our vessels coming there  especially those from the eastward are obliged to make a voyage round to the neighborhood of the loire  garonne for salt a voyage attended with expense delay  more risk i have obtained from the farmers general that they shall be supplied    from their magazines at honfleur opposite to havre at a mercantile price they fix it at present at  0 livres the muid which comes to about    sous or  ½d sterling our bushel but it will vary as the price varies at the places from which they bring it as this will be a great relief to such of our vessels coming to havre as might wish to take back salt it may perhaps be proper to notify it to our merchants i inclose herewith mr neckars discourse to the assembly which was not printed when i left paris thomas jefferson octobr         cowes james rumsey to james rumsey j mss cowes octobr         dear sir —i am honoured with your favor of the  th instant and will pay attention to what you say on the subject of the barkers mill your friends beyond the water are about to erect i am sincerely sorry not to have known the result of your experiment for steam navigation before my departure tho i have already been detained here  at havre    days by contrary winds i must hope that detention will not continue till your experiment be tried as i feel infinitely interested in its success would you be so good my dear sir as to drop me a line on the subject as soon as the experiment shall be made if directed to me at richmond to the care of mr alexr donald  sent by a virginia ship i shall get it with certainty as soon as your experiment shall be over mr short will do for you at paris whatever i could have done towards obtaining you a patent there  0 thomas jefferson nov         lynhaven bay william short to william short j mss lynhaven bay nov         dear sir —tho a committee of american captains at cowes had determined we must expect a nine weeks passage the winds and weather have so befriended us that we are come to an anchorage here    days after weighing anchor at yarmouth having been only    days from land to land after getting clear of the eternal fogs of europe which required   or   days sailing the sun broke out upon us  gave us fine autumn weather almost constantly thro the rest of the voyage  so warm that we had no occasion for fire in the gulph stream only we had to pass thro the squalls of wind  rain which hover generally over that tepid current  thro the whole we had had nothing stronger than what seamen call a stiff breeze so that i have now passed the atlantic twice without knowing what a storm is when we had passed the meridian of the western islands our weather was so fine that it would have been madness to go  000 miles out of our way to seek what would not have been better so we determined to push on the direct course we left the banks of newfoundland about as far on our right as the western islands on our left notwithstanding the evidence of their quadrants to the contrary some of the sailors insisted we were in the trade winds our sickness in the beginning was of     or   days severe enough since that we have been perfectly well we separated from mr trumbulls ship the evening on which i wrote you from the needles  i never saw her more our ship is    two years old only excellently accommodated in ballast and among the swiftest sailors on the ocean her captain a bold  judicious seaman a native of norfolk whose intimate knowledge of our coast has been of both confidence  security to us so that as we had in prospect every motive of satisfaction we have found it still greater in event we came to anchor here because no pilot has yet offered

which it may be consigned my plants  shepherd dogs are well remember me to enquiring friends and accept assurances of sincere esteem  attachment with which i am dear sir thomas jefferson nov

presence there and this done go on to new york in order for my embarcation where i shall first have occasion to confer with you in order to take the sense of government on some subjects which require

leaves it optional in me to accept of that or remain at paris as i chuse it was impossible to give a flat refusal to such a nomination my answer therefore is that the office i hold is more agreeable to me but yet if the president thinks the public service will be better promoted by my taking that at new york i shall do it i do not know how it will end but i suppose in my remaining as i am—frugality is a good deal restored in this country  domestic manufactures resumed mr skipwith who is here promises me to write you fully on your affairs i make up a bundle of newspapers for you but

jefferson december   th      chesterfield george washington to the president of the united states j mss chesterfield december   th      sir —i have received at this place the honor of your letters of october   th and november the  0th and am truly flattered by your nomination of me to the very dignified office of secretary of state for which permit me here to return to you my very    humble thanks could any circumstance induce me to overlook the disproportion between its duties and my talents it would be the encouragement of your choice but when i contemplate the extent of that office embracing as it does the principal mass of domestic administration together with the foreign i can not be insensible to my inequality to it and i should enter on it with gloomy forebodings from the criticisms and censures of a public just indeed in their intentions but sometimes misinformed and misled and always too respectable to be neglected i can not but foresee the possibility that this may end disagreeably for me who having no motive to public service but the public satisfaction would certainly retire the moment that satisfaction should appear to languish on the other hand i feel a degree of familiarity with the duties of my present office as far at least as i am capable of understanding its duties the ground i have already passed over enables me to see my way into that which is before me the change of government too taking place in the country where it is exercised seems to open a possibility of procuring from the new rulers some new advantages in commerce which may be agreeable to our countrymen so that as far as my fears my hopes or my inclination might enter into this question i confess they would not lead me to prefer a change but it is not for an individual to choose his post you are to marshal us as may be best for the public good and it is only in the case of its being indifferent to you that i would avail myself of the option    you have so kindly offered in your letter if you think it better to transfer me to another post my inclination must be no obstacle nor shall it be if there is any desire to suppress the office i now hold or to reduce its grade in either of these cases be so good as only to signify to me by another line your ultimate wish and i will conform to it accordingly if it should be to remain at new york my chief comfort will be to work under your eye my only shelter the authority of your name and the wisdom of measures to be dictated by you and implicitly executed by me whatever you may be pleased to decide i do not see that the matters which have called me hither will permit me to shorten the stay i originally asked that is to say to set out on my journey northward till the middle of march as early as possible in that month i shall have the honor of paying my respects to you in new york in the meantime i have that of tendering you the homage of those sentiments of respectful attachment with which i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson jan       0 monticello charles clay to the rev charles clay j mss monticello jan       0 dear sir —i had hoped that during my stay here i could have had the pleasure of seeing you in bedford but i find it will be too short for that besides views of business in that county i had wished again to visit that greatest of our curiosities the natural bridge and did not know but you might  0 have the same desire—i do not know yet how i am to be disposed of whether kept at new york or sent back to europe if the former one of my happinesses would be the possibility of seeing you there for i understand you are a candidate for the representation of your district in congress i cannot be with you to give you my vote nor do i know who are to be the competitors but i am sure i shall be contented with such a representative as you will make because i know you are too honest a patriot not to wish to see our country prosper by any means tho they be not exactly those you would have preferred and that you are too well informed a politician too good a judge of men not to know that the ground of liberty is to be gained by inches that we must be contented to secure what we can get from time to time and eternally press forward for what is yet to get it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good wishing you every prosperity in this  in all your other undertakings for i am sure from my knowlege of you they will always be just i am with sincere esteem  respect dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson feb       0 monticello george washington to the president of the united states j mss monticello feb       0 sir —i have duly received the letter of the   st of january with which you have honored me and no longer hesitate to undertake the office to which you are pleased to call me your desire that i    should come on as quickly as possible is a sufficient reason for me to postpone every matter of business however pressing which admits postponement still it will be the close of the ensuing week before i can get away  then i shall have to go by the way of richmond which will lengthen my road i shall not fail however to go on with all the despatch possible nor to satisfy you i hope when i shall have the honor of seeing you in new york that the circumstances which prevent my immediate departure are not under my controul i have now that of being with sentiments of the most perfect respect  attachment sir your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson february       0 monticello john jay to john jay j mss monticello february       0 dear sir —i am honored with your favor of december    and thank you for your friendly congratulations on my return to my native country as well as for the interest you are pleased to express in the appointment with which i have been honored i have thought it my duty to undertake it though with no prepossessions in favor of my talents for executing it to the satisfaction of the public with respect to the young gentlemen in the office of foreign affairs their possession and your recommendation are the strongest titles but i suppose the ordinance establishing my office allows but one assistant and i should be wanting in candor to you and them were i not to tell you that another candidate    has been proposed to me on ground that cannot but command respect i know neither him nor them and my hope is that as but one can be named the object is too small to occasion either mortification or disappointment to either i am sure i shall feel more pain at not being able to avail myself of the assistance but of one of the gentlemen than they will at the betaking themselves to some better pursuit i ask it of your friendship my dear sir to make them sensible of my situation and to accept yourself assurances of the sincere esteem and respect with which i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson feb       0 virginia nicholas jacob van staphorst hubbard to nicholas and jacob van staphorst and hubbard j mss monticello in virginia feb       0 gentlemen —i have written to you in date may    sep    jan    last past inclosing several remittances for mr mazzei and one for myself by triplicates to which i refer you if there be any indiscretion in the application i am now about to make to you ascribe it to the sentiments of friendship and confidence with which your conduct has inspired me  which i had wished to make reciprocal and freely decline it if inconsistent with your conscience assuring yourselves it will not in the least alter my dispositions to esteem  serve you these can merit respect no longer than they are disinterested i will be short in my explanations after an absence of ten years from my estate i found    it much deteriorated  requiring time  advances to bring it back again to the productive state of which it was susceptible but i am only a farmer and have no resource but the productions of the farms themselves to bring them into a state of profit if their profits be small their restoration will be slow in proportion an advance of from one to two thousand dollars would produce a state of productiveness which without it will be tardy my estate is a large one for the country to wit upwards of ten thousand acres of valuable land on the navigable parts of james river and two hundred negroes and not a shilling out of it is or ever was under any incumbrance for debt i may be excused in mentioning this as it is a proper ground whereon to ask you whether you would be willing to answer my draughts to any  what amount within the bounds before mentioned i ask it of nobody in this country because capitals here are small and employed in more active business than simple loans i will send you my bond for the money payable at what time or times you please this by the laws of this state the same in this respect as those of england will render my lands as well as my personality responsible for the debt in case of my death the interest say six per cent shall be remitted annually with perfect punctuality tho it would be more convenient to pay it to your agent here as in my inland situation it is difficult to invest money in good bills perhaps it would be more convenient to you that your agent here should furnish the money at any rate it would be advantageous in the sale of my bills    that he should endorse them—i repeat it again that i do not mean to lay you under any restraint by this application but shall be better pleased with your doing on it what best pleases yourselves only making it known to me as soon as convenient in every event i shall preserve for you and your interest the sentiments of esteem  respect with which i am gentlemen your friend  humble servt thomas jefferson mar       0 alexandria william hunter to the mayor of alexandria  william hunter j mss alexandria mar       0 sir —accept my sincere thanks for yourself and the worthy citizens of alexandria for their kind congratulations on my return to my native country i am happy to learn that they have felt a benefit from the encouragements to our commerce which have been given by an allied nation but truth  candor oblige me at the same time to declare you are indebted for these encouragements solely to the friendly dispositions of that nation which has shown itself ready on every occasion to adopt all arrangements which might strengthen our ties of mutual interest and friendship convinced that the republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind my prayers  efforts shall be cordially distributed to the support of that we have so happily established it is indeed    an animating thought that while we are securing the rights of ourselves  our posterity we are pointing out the way to struggling nations who wish like us to emerge from their tyrannies also heaven help their struggles and lead them as it has done us triumphantly thro them accept sir for yourself and the citizens of alexandria the homage of my thanks for their civilities  the assurance of those sentiments of respect  attachment with which i have the honor to be sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson march       0 alexandria william short to william short  alexandria march       0 dear sir —    i have received my letters from new york very regularly every week by post i now therefore am at about the  th of october      as to what has been passing in europe that is to say i know no one circumstance later than the kings removal to paris i will complain not only of your not writing but of your writing so illegibly that i am half a day decyphering one page and then guess at much of it    i wrote on what footing i had placed the presidents proposal to me to undertake the office of secretary of state his answer still left me at liberty to accept it or return to france but i saw plainly he preferred the former and have learned from several quarters it will be generally more agreeable    consequently to have gone back would have exposed me to the danger of giving disgust and i value no office enough for that i am therefore now on my way to enter on the new office not a word has been said about my successor but on that subject you shall hear from me as soon as i arrive in new york    thomas jefferson mar       0 new york thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph  j mss new york mar       0 dear sir —i arrived here on the   st inst after as laborious a journey of a fortnight from richmond as i ever went through resting only one day at alexandria and another at baltimore i found my carriage  horses at alexandria but a snow of    inches deep falling the same night i saw the impossibility of getting on in my own carriage so left it there to be sent to me by water and had my horses led on to this place taking my passage on the stage tho relieving myself a little sometimes by mounting my horse the roads thro the whole were so bad that we could never go more than three miles an hour sometimes not more than two and in the night but one my first object was to look out a house in the broadway if possible as being the center of my business finding none there vacant for the present i have taken a small one in maiden lane which may give me time to look about me much business had been put by for my arrival so    that i found myself all at once involved under an accumulation of it when this shall be got thro i may be able to judge whether the ordinary business of my department will leave me any leisure i fear there will be little letters from paris to the   th of december inform us that the revolution there was still advancing with a steady pace there had been two riots since my departure the one on the  th   th of october which occasioned the royal family to remove to paris in which   or  0 of the gardes du corps fell and among these a chevalier de varicourt brother of made de la villatte  of mademlle varicourt patseys friend the second was on the   st of the same month in which a baker had been hung by the mob on this occasion the government i e the national assembly proclaimed martial law in paris and had two of the ringleaders of the mob seized tried  hung which was effected without any movement on the part of the people others were still to be tried the troubles in brabant become serious the insurgents have routed the regular troops in every rencounter congress is principally occupied by the treasury report the assumption of the state debts has been voted affirmatively in the first instance but it is not certain it will hold its ground thro all the stages of the bill when it shall be brought in i have recommended mr d r to the president for the office he desired in case of a vacancy it seemed however as if the president had had no intimation before that a vacancy was expected i shall not fail to render in this every service in my power to your friend i    inclose to patsey a letter from i do not know whence mrs trist complains of her so does miss rittenhouse  so will i fear her friends beyond the atlantic be so good as to assure her and marie of my tender affections i shall be happy to hear from you frequently as you can do me the favor to write to me no body has your health  happiness more at heart nor wishes more a place in your esteem i am my dear sir with compliments to colo randolph yours affectionately thomas jefferson april      0 opinion on communications to congress j mss april      0 th jefferson has the honor to inform the president that mr madison has just delivered to him the result of his reflections on the question how shall communications from the several states to congress through the channel of the president be made he thinks that in no case would it be proper to go by way of letter from the secretary of state that they should be delivered to the houses either by the secretary of state in person or by mr lear he supposes a useful division of the office might be made between these two by employing the one where a matter of fact alone is to be communicated or a paper delivered in the ordinary course of things and where nothing is required by the president and using the agency of the other where the president chuses to recommend any measure to the legislature and to attract their attention to it the president will be pleased to order in this    what he thinks best t jefferson supposes that whatever may be done for the present the final arrangement of business should be considered as open to alteration hereafter the government is yet so young that cases enough have not occurred to enable a division of them into classes and the distribution of these classes to the persons whose agency would be the properest he sends some letters for the presidents perusal praying him to alter freely any thing in them which he thinks may need it thomas jefferson april      0 new york marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette j mss new york april      0 behold me my dear friend elected secretary of state instead of returning to the far more agreeable position which placed me in the daily participation of your friendship i found the appointment in the newspapers the day of my arrival in virginia i had indeed been asked while in france whether i would accept of any appointment at home  i had answered that without meaning to remain long where i was i meant it to be the last office i should ever act in unfortunately this letter had not arrived at the time of arranging the new government i expressed freely to the president my desire to return he left me free but still shewing his own desire this and the concern of others more general than i had a right to expect induced me after   months parleying to sacrifice my own inclinations i have been here then ten days harnessed in new  0 geer wherever i am or ever shall be i shall be sincere in my friendship to you and to your nation i think with others that nations are to be governed according to their own interest but i am convinced that it is their interest in the long run to be grateful faithful to their engagements even in the worst of circumstances and honorable and generous always if i had not known that the head of our government was in these sentiments and that his national  private ethics were the same i would never have been where i am i am sorry to tell you his health is less firm than it used to be however there is nothing in it to give alarm the opposition to our new constitution has almost totally disappeared some few indeed had gone such lengths in their declarations of hostility that they feel it awkward perhaps to come over but the amendments proposed by congress have brought over almost all their followers if the president can be preserved a few years till habits of authority  obedience can be established generally we have nothing to fear the little vautrien rhode island will come over with a little more time our last news from paris is of the  th of january so far it seemed that your revolution had got along with a steady pace meeting indeed occasional difficulties  dangers but we are not to expect to be translated from despotism to liberty in a featherbed i have never feared for the ultimate result tho i have feared for you personally indeed i hope you will never see such another  th   th of october take care of yourself my dear friend for tho i think your    nation would in any event work out her salvation i am persuaded were she to lose you it would cost her oceans of blood  years of confusion  anarchy kiss  bless your dear children for me learn them to be as you are a cement between our two nations i write to madame de la fayette so have only to add assurances of the respect  esteem of your affectionate friend  humble servant thomas jefferson april      0 new york madame la duchesse dauville to madame la duchesse dauville j mss new york april      0 i had hoped madame la duchesse to have again had the honor of paying my respects to you in paris but the wish of our government that i should take a share in its administration has become a law to me could i have persuaded myself that public offices were made for private convenience i should undoubtedly have preferred a continuance in that which placed me nearer to you but believing on the contrary that a good citizen should take his stand where the public authority marshals him i have acquiesced among the circumstances which reconcile me to my new position the most powerful is the opportunities it will give me of cementing the friendship between our two nations be assured that to do this is the first wish of my heart i have but one system of ethics for men  for nations—to be grateful to be faithful to all engagements and under all circumstances to be open  generous promotes in the long run even the interests of both    and i am sure it promotes their happiness the change in your government will approximate us to one another you have had some checks some horrors since i left you but the way to heaven you know has always been said to be strewed with thorns why your nation have had fewer than any other on earth i do not know unless it be that it is the best on earth if i assure you madam moreover that i consider yourself personally as with the foremost of your nation in every virtue it is not flattery my heart knows not that it is a homage to sacred truth it is a tribute i pay with cordiality to a character in which i saw but one error it was that of treating me with a degree of favor i did not merit be assured i shall ever retain a lively sense of all your goodness to me which was a circumstance of principal happiness to me during my stay in paris i hope that by this time you have seen that my prognostications of a successful issue to your revolution have been verified i feared for you during a short interval but after the declaration of the army tho there might be episodes of distress the denoument was out of doubt heaven send that the glorious example of your country may be but the beginning of the history of european liberty and that you may live many years in health  happiness to see at length that heaven did not make man in its wrath accept the homage of those sentiments of sincere and respectful esteem with which i have the honor to be madame la duchesse your most affectionate  obedient humble servant    thomas jefferson april       0 new york william carmichael to the

of the president of the united states i have entered on the duties of secretary of state comprehending the department of foreign affairs mr jays letter of october the  d acknowledged the receipt of the last of yours which have come to hand since that date he wrote you on the  th of december enclosing a letter for mr chiappe the receipt of his letter of september the  th      having never been acknowledged the contents of which were important and an answer wished for i send you herewith a duplicate lest it should have miscarried you will also receive herewith a letter of credence for yourself to be delivered to the count de florida blanca after putting thereon the proper address with which i am unacquainted a copy of it is enclosed for your information i beg leave to recommend the case of don blas gonzalez to your good offices with the court of spain enclosing you the documents necessary for its illustration you will perceive that two vessels were sent from boston in the year      on a voyage of discovery and commercial experiment in general but more particularly to try a fur trade with the russian settlements on the northwest coast of our continent of which such wonders had been published in captain    cooks voyages that it excited similar expeditions from other countries also and that the american vessels were expressly forbidden to touch at any spanish port but in cases of extreme distress accordingly through the whole of their voyage through the extensive latitudes held by that crown they never put into any port but in a single instance in passing near the island of juan fernandez one of them was damaged by a storm her rudder broken her masts disabled and herself separated from her companion she put into the island to refit and at the same time to wood and water of which she began to be in want don blas gonzalez after examining her and finding she had nothing on board but provisions and charts and that her distress was real permitted her to stay a few days to refit and take in fresh supplies of wood and water for this act of common hospitality he was immediately deprived of his government unheard by superior order and remains still under disgrace we pretend not to know the regulations of the spanish government as to the admission of foreign vessels into the ports of their colonies but the generous character of the nation is a security to us that their regulations can in no instance run counter to the laws of nature and among the first of her laws is that which bids us to succor those in distress for an obedience to this law don blas appears to have suffered and we are satisfied it is because his case has not been able to penetrate to his majestys ministers at least in its true colors we would not choose to be committed by a formal solicitation but we would wish you to    avail yourself of any good opportunity of introducing the truth to the ear of the minister and of satisfying him that a redress of this hardship on the governor would be received here with pleasure as a proof of respect to those laws of hospitality which we would certainly observe in a like case as a mark of attention towards us and of justice to an individual for whose sufferings we cannot but feel with the present letter you will receive the public and other papers as usual and i shall thank you in return for a regular communication of the best gazettes published in madrid thomas jefferson april       0 new york francis willis to francis willis j mss new york april       0 my dear friend —your favor of feb  0 came to me here a few days ago nothing would have made me happier than to have been able to see you on my way through the lower part of virginia but the short time destined for my stay in that country did not permit me to turn to the right or left your recommendation of mr reynolds would have given me all the dispositions possible to have found a place for him but in the office to which i have been called all was full and i could not in any case think it just to turn out those in possession who have behaved well merely to put others in i have not therefore had a single appointment to make nor is there any thing within my appointment but mere copying clerks at  00 dollars a year  two at  00—    i fear there is as little prospect that any office can occur in williamsburg i know of none but in the law line which was never your favorite line i can therefore only express to you my wishes to serve you you complain of the difficulties which have strowed the path of life for you be assured my friend that mine has not been strowed with flowers the happiest moments of my life have been the few which i have past at home in the bosom of my family emploiment any where else is a mere illegible of time it is burning the candle of life in perfect waste for the individual himself i have no complaint against any body i have had more of the confidence of my country than my share i only say that public emploiment contributes neither to advantage nor happiness it is but honorable exile from ones family  affairs i wish you every possible felicity to yourself mrs willis  your family and am with great sincerity dear sir your affectionate friend  servt thomas jefferson april       0 new york thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss new york april       0 dear sir —i wrote you on the   th of march to

men van murren commanded in both cases the news of the death of the emperor which the english newspapers gave us was not true but i know that it may be daily  hourly expected—here the public has been a good deal agitated with the question in congress on the assumption of the state debts the first decision has been not to assume by a majority of    to    it will still be brought on in another form it appears to me one of those questions which present great inconveniences whichever way it is decided so that it offers only a choice of evils—in the way of small news we have the marriage of mr page with a miss louther  the death of judge harrison of maryland mad judge bedford of delaware the other day wounded dangerously his wife  killed her adulterer with the same shot—we have had here a series of as disagreeable weather as i have seen it is now raining and snowing most furiously  has been doing so all night as soon as i get into the house i have hired which will be the  st of may i will propose to you to keep a diary of the weather here  wherever you shall be exchanging observations from time to time i should like to compare the two climates by cotemporary observations my method is to make two observations a day the one as early as possible in the morning the other from   to   o clock because i have found   o clock the    hottest  day light the coldest point of the    hours i

observe these things to you because in order that our observations may present a full comparison of the two climates they should be kept on the same plan    i have no barometer here  was without one at paris still if you chuse to take barometrical observations you can insert a  d morning column and a  d afternoon column my most friendly respects to colo randolph and my love to patty  polly and believe me to be sincerely  affectionately yours p s i spoke again with —  on the subject of mr d randolph a few days ago he still knows nothing of hs intention to resign  he never promises any thing but he said as much as he could short of a promise and i believe you may assure mr randolph that in such an event he will probably have the appointment but do not let a word of this transpire beyond him thomas jefferson april       0 opinion on the powers of the senate j mss april       0 opinion on the question whether the senate has the right to negative the grade of persons appointed by the executive to fill foreign missions the constitution having declared that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls the president desires my opinion whether the senate has a right to negative the grade he may think it expedient to use in a foreign mission as well as the person to be appointed  0 i think the senate has no right to negative the grade the constitution has divided the powers of government into three branches legislative executive and judiciary lodging each with a distant magistracy the legislative it has given completely to the senate and house of representatives it has declared that the executive powers shall be vested in the president submitting only special articles of it to a negative by the senate and it has vested the judiciary power in the courts of justice with certain exceptions also in favor of the senate the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether it belongs then to the head of that department except as to such portions of it as are specially submitted to the senate exceptions are to be construed strictly the constitution itself indeed has taken care to circumscribe this one within very strict limits for it gives the nomination of the foreign agent to the president the appointment to him and the senate jointly and the commissioning to the president this analysis calls our attention to the strict import of each term to nominate must be to propose appointment seems the only act of the will which constitutes or makes the agent and the commission is the public evidence of it but there are still other acts previous to these not specially enumerated in the constitution — to wit   the destination of a mission to the particular country where the public service calls for it and   the character or grade to be employed in it the natural order of    all these is   destination   grade   nomination   appointment   commission if appointment does not comprehend the neighboring acts of nomination or commission and the constitution says it shall not by giving them exclusively to the president still less can it pretend to comprehend those previous and more remote of destination and grade the constitution analyzing the three last shows they do not comprehend the two first the fourth is the only one it submits to the senate shaping it into a right to say that a or b is unfit to be appointed now this cannot comprehend a right to say that a or b is indeed fit to be appointed but the grade fixed on it is not the fit one to employ or our connections with the country of his destination are not such as to call for any mission the senate is not supposed by the constitution to be acquainted with the concerns of the executive department it was not intended that these should be communicated to them nor can they therefore be qualified to judge of the necessity which calls for a mission to any particular place or of the particular grade more or less marked which special and secret circumstances may call for all this is left to the president they are only to see that no unfit person be employed it may be objected that the senate may by continual negatives on the person do what amounts to a negative on the grade and so indirectly defeat this right of the president but this would be a breach of trust an abuse of the power confided to the senate of which that body cannot be supposed capable so the president has a power to convoke    the legislature and the senate might defeat that power by refusing to come this equally amounts to a negative on the power of convoking yet nobody will say they possess such a negative or would be capable of usurping it by such oblique means if the constitution had meant to give the senate a negative on the grade or destination as well as the person it would have said so in direct terms and not left it to be effected by a sidewind it could never mean to give them the use of one power through the abuse of another thomas jefferson april       0 new york colonel henry lee to colonel henry lee j mss new york april       0 dear sir —i am honored with your favor of the  d instant and would have been happy to be useful to mr lee had there been any opening as i should be hereafter were any to occur there are no offices in my gift but of meer sic scribes in the office room at  00   00 dollars a year these i found all filled  of long possession in the hands of those who held them and i thought it would not be just to remove persons in possession who had behaved well to make place for others there was a single vacancy only  that required to be filled up with a regard to the elegance of handwriting only because it was to continue the record of the acts of congress which had been begun in a hand remarkably fine i am sensible of the necessity as well as justice of dispersing emploiments over the whole of the u s but this is difficult as to the smaller    offices which require to be filled immediately as they become vacant  are not worth coming for from the distant states hence they will unavoidably get into the sole occupation of the vicinities of the seat of government a reason the more for removing that seat to the true center the question of assumption still occupies congress the partisans of both sides of it are nearly equally divided  both extremely eager to carry their point it will probably be sometime before it is ultimately decided in the mean while the voice of the nation will perhaps be heard unluckily it is one of those cases wherein the voice will be all on one side  therefore likely to induce a false opinion of the real wish of the public what would be the fate of this question in the senate is yet unknown thomas jefferson april       0 new york william short to william short  j mss new york april       0 dear sir —    j walker is appointed senator in the room of grayson  arrived

mention to whom you should address such of my things as are to go directly to virginia to capt maxwell at norfolk if you please or mr james brown mercht at richmond according to the destination of the    vessel on conversing with mr hamilton yesterday i find that the funds in the hands of the w w v stap  hub are exhausted should the joint houses therefore make any difficulties about answering your bills for my purposes i think the latter one will not be so good as to assure them in case it comes to that that their advances for me shall be reimbursed as soon as made known    the management of the foreign establishment awaits the passage of a bill on the subject one conversation only has taken place but no resolutions reached are discernible a minister will certainly be appointed and from

can before you come over in order to add the better knowledge of the country to your qualifications for future office we have london news to march    paris news only to feb  0 your note with a packet from miss botidour for my daughter is come to hand you will see in the newspapers which accompany this the details of dr franklins death the house of representatives resolved to wear mourning  do it the senate neither resolved it nor do it—what is become of rumsey  his steamship not a word is known here i fear therefore he has failed adieu my dear sir and believe me to be your affectionate friend  servt    thomas jefferson may  d    0 opinion on georgian land grants  may  d    0 opinion upon the validity of a grant made by the state of georgia to certain companies of individuals of a tract of country whereof the indian right had never been extinguished with power to such individuals to extinguish the indian right the state of georgia having granted to certain individuals a tract of country within their chartered limits whereof the indian right has never yet been acquired with a proviso in the grants which implies that those individuals may take measures for extinquishing the indian rights under the authority of that government it becomes a question how far this grant is good a society taking possession of a vacant country and declaring they mean to occupy it does thereby appropriate to themselves as prime occupants what was before common a practice introduced since the discovery of america authorized them to go further and to affix the limits which they assume to themselves and it seems for the common good to admit this right to a moderate and reasonable extent if the country instead of being altogether vacant is thinly occupied by another nation the right of the native forms an exception to that of the new comers that is to say these will only have a right against all other nations except the natives consequently they have the exclusive privilege of acquiring the native right by purchase or other just means this    is called the right of preemption and is become a principle of the law of nations fundamental with respect to america there are but two means of acquiring the native title first war for even war may sometimes give a just title second contracts or treaty the states of america before their present union possessed completely each within its own limits the exclusive right to use these two means of acquiring the native title and by their act of union they have as completely ceded both to the general government art  d section  st the president shall have power by and with the advice of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur art  st section  th the congress shall have power to declare war to raise and support armies section  0th no state shall enter into a treaty alliance or confederation no state shall without the consent of congress keep troops or ships of war in time of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power or engage in war unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay these paragraphs of the constitution declaring that the general government shall have and that the particular ones shall not have the right of war and treaty are so explicit that no commentary can explain them further nor can any explain them away consequently georgia possessing the exclusive right to acquire the native title but having relinquished the means of doing it to the general government can only have put her grantee into her    own condition she could convey to them the exclusive right to acquire but she could not convey what she had not herself that is the means of acquiring for these they must come to the general government in whose hands they have been wisely deposited for the purposes both of peace and justice what is to be done the right of the general government is in my opinion to be maintained the case is sound and the means of doing it as practicable as can ever occur but respect and friendship should i think mark the conduct of the general towards the particular government and explanations should be asked and time and color given them to tread back their steps before coercion is held up to their view i am told there is already a strong party in georgia opposed to the act of their government i should think it better then that the first measures while firm be yet so temperate as to secure their alliance and aid to the general government might not the eclat of a proclamation revolt their pride and passion and throw them hastily into the opposite scale it will be proper indeed to require from the government of georgia in the first moment that while the general government shall be expecting and considering her explanations things shall remain in statu quo and not a move be made towards carrying what they have begun into execution perhaps it might not be superfluous to send some person to the indians interested to explain to them the views of government and to watch with their aid the territory in question    thomas jefferson may       0 new york william short to william short j mss new york may       0 dear sir —a periodical headache has put it out of my power for near a month to attend to any business or correspondence public or private and such is my present situation that favorable as the opportunity is by mr crevecœur i had not meant to venture to write to you but the receipt of yours of mar    has decided me to try it    i should not write to you again till i should emerge i mentioned too the footing on which stood the proposal for my translation to a new office it was not till the middle of february that a second letter from the president determined me to accept it and i left monticello in a fortnight after for new york at alexandria friday a vessel bound for france i wrote to you to wit mar    of this letter i have sent triplicates since my arrival here i have written mar    apr         0 sending duplicates  triplicates of some of them the day after the date of the last i was taken with the illness which still confines me in the mean time we have been here near losing the president he was taken with a peripneumony and on the  th day he was pronounced by two of the three physicians present to be in the act of death a successful effort of nature however relieved him  us you cannot conceive the public alarm on this occasion it proves how much depends on his life no successor at paris is yet named nor is any other mission on the carpet i wish that while you stay you could obtain the free introduction of our salted provisions into france    nothing would be so generally pleasing from the chesapeek to new hampshire you will see in the newspapers a bill for increasing the tonnage of nations not in treaty with us to a given time  then prohibiting their transporting our commodities this i think will pass in the house of representatives there is a great majority for it the hope i have held out of obtaining the introduction of our salted provisions into france has been an efficacious incitement to this bill a motion is now before the senate for having the next meeting of congress at philadelphia  it is rather possible it will be carried in both houses in that case we shall remove to philadelphia about the  st of september i wish it may be decided in time for me to give you notice so that petit  my baggage may come directly to philadelphia with respect to the loss of your money by nomeny i do not apprehend there can be any difficulty only take care and establish on the best testimony the case will admit how much of it was to be paid for public purposes  how much was for your private use this being done i suppose the principles to be well established in law which will make the first a public  the latter your private loss it cannot be brought on till the settlement of your account  then it will be decided on not only by congress but the regular judge in that department you will see by the virginia papers that colo dudley digges is dead that mr henry is elected contrary to what has been said of his retiring c c for these papers which i will regularly send you will  0 convey to you all the small news i know madison of the college is coming here to be made a bishop send me if you please the records of the bastile which they had begun to publish i send by mr crevecœur my alarm watch to be mended there is a paper of explanation with it i send also by him about ½ doz lb of balsanum canadensa for m deville which be pleased to ask his acceptance of from me  apologize from my sickness for my not writing i wish if it be practicable that you could make all the paiments of rent for my house since my departure enter into mr grands accounts so that i may have no occasion to place them in mine at all press the affairs of the algerine redemption and write its progress continually present me to all my friends as if they were here named and be assured of the constant esteem  attachment of dear sir your sincere  affectionate friend p s may    last night i received your letters to me of jan     feb  0  to mr jay of jan     feb  0 they had arrived at baltimore gone to mr jay at portsmouth in new hampshire  returned here the packet being to sail tomorrow i doubt the possibility of sending you the two copies of the federalist bound if it cannot be done now it shall be by another opportunity the motion for removal to philadelphia has been evaded in the senate and withdrawn it is now moved in the other house but probability is now rather against its success the president is well enough to resume business    thomas jefferson may  0    0 new york thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss new york may  0    0 dear sir —i at length find myself tho not quite well yet sufficiently so to resume business in a moderate degree i have therefore to answer your two favors of apr     may   and in the first place to thank you for your attention to the paccan gloucester  european walnuts which will be great acquisitions at monticello i will still ask your attention to mr fosters boring machine lest he should go away suddenly  so the opportunity of getting it be lost—i enquired of mr hamilton the quantity of coal imported but he tells me there are not returns as yet sufficient to ascertain it but as soon as there shall be i shall be informed i am told there is a considerable prejudice against our coal in these northern states i do not know whence it proceeds perhaps from the want of attention to the different species and an ignorant application of them to crosspurposes i have not begun my meteorological diary because i have not yet removed to the house i have taken i remove tomorrow but as far as i can judge from its aspects there will not be one position to be had for the thermometer free from the influence of the sun both morning  evening however as i go into it only till i can get a better i shall hope ere long to find a less objectionable situation you know that during my short stay at monticello i kept a diary of the weather mr madison has just received one comprehending the same period kept at his fathers in orange the hours of observation were the same    and he has the fullest confidence in the accuracy of the observer all the morning observations in orange are lower than those of monticello from one to i believe    or    degrees the afternoon observations are near as much higher than those of monticello nor will the variations permit us to ascribe them to any supposed irregularities in either tube because in that case at the same point the variations would always be the same which it is not you have often been sensible that in the afternoon or rather evening the air has become warmer in ascending the mountain the same is true in the morning this might account for a higher station of the mercury in the morning observations at monticello again when the air is equally dry in the lower  higher situations which may be supposed the case in the warmest part of the day the mercury should be lower on the latter because all other circumstances the same the nearer the common surface the warmer the air so that on a mountain it ought really to be warmer in the morning  cooler in the heat of the day than on the common plain but not in so great a degree as these observations indicate as soon as i am well enough i intend to examine them more accurately—your resolution to apply to the study of the law is wise in my opinion  at the same time to mix it with a good degree of attention to the farm the one will relieve the other the study of the law is useful in a variety of points of view it qualifies a man to be useful to himself to his neighbors  to the public it is the most certain stepping stone to preferment in the political line in    political economy i think smiths wealth of nations the best book extant in the science of government montesquieus spirit of laws is generally recommended it contains indeed a great number of political truths but also an equal number of heresies so that the reader must be constantly on his guard there has been lately published a letter of helvetius who was the intimate friend of montesquieu  whom he consulted before the publication of his book helvetius advised him not to publish it  in this letter to a friend he gives us a solution for the mixture of truth  error found in this book he sais montesquieu was a man of immense reading that he had commonplaced all his reading  that his object was to throw the whole contents of his commonplace book into systematical order  to shew his ingenuity by reconciling the contradictory facts it presented lockes little book on government is perfect as far as it goes descending from theory to practice there is no better book than the federalist burghs political disquisitions are good also especially after reading de lolme several o humes political essays are good there are some excellent books of theory written by turgot  the economists of france for parliamentary knowlege the lex parliamentaria is the best book—on my return to virginia in the fall i cannot help hoping some practicable plan may be devised for your settling in albemarle should your inclination lead you to it nothing could contribute so much to my happiness were it at the same time consistent with yours you might get into the assembly    for that county as soon as you should please a motion has been made in the senate to remove the federal government to philadelphia there was a trial of strength on a question for a weeks postponement on that it was found there would be    for the removal     against it the motion was therefore withdrawn  made in the other house where it is still depending  of very incertain event—the question of the assumption is again brought on the parties were so nearly equal on the former trial that it is very possible that with some modifications it may yet prevail the tonnage bill will probably pass and must i believe produce salutary effects it is a mark of energy in our government in a case where i believe it cannot be parried the french revolution still goes on well tho the danger of a suspension of paiment is very imminent their appeal to the inhabitants of their colonies to say on what footing they wish to be placed will end i hope in our free admission into their islands with our produce this precedent must have consequences it is impossible the world should continue long insensible to so evident a truth as that the right to have commerce  intercourse with our neighbors is a natural right to suppress this neighborly intercourse is an exercise of force which we shall have a just right to remove when the superior force present my warm affections to the girls i am afraid they do not follow my injunctions of answering by the first post the weekly letter i address to them i inclose some letters for patsy from paris and the newspapers for yourself with assurances of    the sincere  cordial esteem of dear sir your affectionate friend p s i must refer the description of the mould board to another occasion the president is well enough to do business colo bland dangerously ill thomas jefferson june  d    0 opinion on soldiers accounts j mss june  d    0 opinion in favor of the resolutions of may   st    0 directing that in all cases where payment had not been already made the debts due to the soldiers of virginia and north carolina should be paid to the original claimants or their attorneys and not to their assignees the accounts of the soldiers of virginia and north carolina having been examined by the proper officer of government the balances due to each individual ascertained and a list of these balances made out this list became known to certain persons before the soldiers themselves had information of it and those persons by unfair means as is said and for very inadequate considerations obtained assignments from many of the soldiers of whatever sum should be due to them from the public without specifying the amount the legislature to defeat this fraud passed resolutions on the   st of may    0 directing that where payment had not been made to the original claimant in person or his representatives it shall    be made to him or them personally or to their attorney producing a power for that purpose attested by two justices of the county where he resides and specifying the certain sum he is to receive it has been objected to these resolutions that they annul transfers of property which were good by the laws under which they were made that they take from the assignees their lawful property are contrary to the principles of the constitution which condemn retrospective laws and are therefore not worthy of the presidents approbation i agree in an almost unlimited condemnation of retrospective laws the few instances of wrong which they redress are so overweighed by the insecurity they draw over all property and even over life itself and by the atrocious violations of both to which they lead that it is better to live under the evil than the remedy the only question i shall make is whether these resolutions annul acts which were valid when they were done this question respects the laws of virginia and north carolina only on the latter i am not qualified to decide and therefore beg leave to confine myself to the former by the common law of england adopted in virginia the conveyance of a right to a debt or other thing whereof the party is not in possession is not only void but severely punishable under the names of maintenance and champerty the lawmerchants however which is permitted to have course between merchants allows the assignment of a bill    of exchange for the convenience of commerce this therefore forms one exception to the general rule that a mere right or thing in action is not assignable a second exception has been formed by an english statute copied into the laws of virginia permitting promisory notes to be assigned the laws of virginia have gone yet further than the statute and have allowed as a third exception that a bond should be assigned which cannot be done even at this day in england so that in virginia when a debt has been settled between the parties and put into the form of a bill of exchange promisory note or bond the law admits it to be transferred by assignment in all other cases the assignment of a debt is void the debts from the united states to the soldiers of virginia not having been put into either of these forms the assignments of them were void in law a creditor may give an order on his debtor in favor of another but if the debtor does not accept it he must be sued in the creditors name which shows that the order does not transfer the property of the debts the creditor may appoint another to be his attorney to receive and recover his debt and he may covenant that when received the attorney may apply it to his own use but he must sue as attorney to the original proprietor and not in his own right this proves that a power of attorney with such a covenant does not transfer the property of the debt a further proof in both cases is that the original creditor may at any time before payment or acceptance revoke either his order or his power of attorney in that event the person in whose favor they were    given has recourse to a court of equity if he finds his transaction has been a fair one he gives him aid if he finds it has been otherwise not permitting his court to be made a handmaid to fraud he leaves him without remedy in equity as he was in law the assignments in the present case therefore if unfairly obtained as seems to be admitted are void in equity as they are in law and they derive their nullity from the laws under which they were made not from the new resolutions of congress these are not retrospective they only direct their treasurer not to give validity to an assignment which had it not before by payments to the assignee until he in whom the legal property still is shall order it in such a form as to show he is apprized of the sum he is to part with and its readiness to be paid into his or any other hands and that he chooses notwithstanding to acquiesce under the fraud which has been practised on him in that case he had only to execute before two justices a power of attorney to the same person expressing the specific sum of his demand and it is to be complied with actual payment in this case is an important act if made to the assignee it would put the burthen of proof and process on the original owner if made to that owner it puts it on the assignee who must then come forward and show that his transaction has been that of an honest man government seems to be doing in this what every individual i think would feel himself bound to do in the case of his own debt for being free in the law to pay to one or the other he would certainly    give the advantage to the party who has suffered wrong rather than to him who has committed it it is not honorable to embrace a salutary principle of law when a relinquishment of it is solicited only to support a fraud i think the resolutions therefore merit approbation i have before professed my incompetence to say what are the laws of north carolina on this subject they like virginia adopted the english laws in the gross these laws forbid in general the buying and selling of debts and their policy in this is so wise that i presume they had not changed it till the contrary be shown thomas jefferson june      0 new york william short to william short j mss new york june

and looks better than before his illness the question of removal to philadelphia was carried in the house of representatives by    against    it is thought the senate will be equally divided and consequently that the decision will rest on the vicepresident who will be himself divided between his own decided inclinations to stay here  the unpopularity of being the  0 sole obstacle to what appears the wish of so great a majority of the people expressed by proportional representation rhode island has at length acceded to the union by a majority of two voices only in their convention her senators will be here in about  0 days or a fortnight the opposers of removal in the senate try to draw out time till their arrival therefore they have connected the resolution of the lower house with a bill originated with them to fix a permanent residence  have referred both to the same committee—deaths are colonel bland at this place and old colo corbin in virginia the naming a minister for

finished you are desirous    of obtaining some clerkship or something else under government whereby you may turn your talents to some account for yourself and he had supposed it might be in my power to provide you with some such office his commendations of you are such as to induce me to wish sincerely to be of service to you but there is not and has not been a single vacant office at my disposal nor would i as your friend ever think of putting you into the petty clerkships in the several offices where you would have to drudge through life for a miserable pittance without a hope of bettering your situation but he tells me you are also disposed to the study of the law this therefore brings it more within my power to serve you it will be necessary for you in that case to go and live somewhere in my neighborhood in albemarle the inclosed letter to colo lewis near charlottesville will show you what i have supposed could be best done for you there it is a general practice to study the law in the office of some lawyer this indeed gives to the student the advantage of his instruction but i have ever seen that the services expected in return have been more than the instructions have been worth all that is necessary for a student is access to a library and directions in what order the books are to be read this i will take the liberty of suggesting to you observing previously that as other branches of science and especially history are necessary to form a lawyer these must be carried on together i will arrange the books to be read into three columns and propose that you should read those in the first column till    oclock    every day those in the  d from    to   those in the  d after candlelight leaving all the afternoon for exercise and recreation which are as necessary as reading i will rather say more necessary because health is worth more than learning  st  d  d coke on littleton dalrymples feudal system mallets north antiquit cokes  d  d   th institutes

that begins there is an end of reading i shall be glad to hear from you from time to time and shall hope to see you in the fall in albemarle to which place i propose a visit in that season in the mean

new york george mason to george mason j mss new york june       0 dear sir —i have deferred acknowleging the receipt of your favor of mar    expecting daily that the business of the consulships would have been finished but this was delayed by the presidents illness  a very long one of my own so that it is not till within these two or three days that it has been settled that of bordeaux is given to mr fenwick according to your desire the commission is making out and will be signed tomorrow or next day i intended fully to have had the pleasure of seeing you at gunstan hall on my way here but the roads being so bad that i was obliged to leave my own carriage to get along as it could  to take my passage in the stage i could not deviate from the stage road i should have been happy in a conversation with you on the subject of our new government of which tho i approve of the mass i would wish to see some amendments further than those which have been proposed and fixing it more surely on a republican basis i have great hopes that pressing forward with constancy to these amendments they will be obtained before the want of them will do any harm to secure the ground we gain  gain what more we can is i think the wisest course i think much has been gained by the late constitution for the former one was terminating in anarchy as necessarily consequent to inefficiency the house of representatives have voted to remove to baltimore by a majority of    against   this was not the effect of choice but of the confusion into which they    had been brought by the event of other questions  their being hampered with the rules of the house it is not certain what will be the vote of the senate some hope an opening will be given to convert it into a vote of the temporary seat at philadelphia  the permanent one at georgetown the question of the assumption will be brought on again  its event is doubtful perhaps its opponents would be wiser to be less confident in their success  to compromise by agreeing to assume the state debts still due to individuals on condition of assuming to the states at the same time what they have paid to individuals so as to put the states in the shoes of those of their creditors whom they have paid off great objections lie to this but not so great as to an assumption of the unpaid debts only my duties preventing me from mingling in these questions i do not pretend to be very competent to their decision in general i think it necessary to give as well as take in a government like ours i have some hope of visiting virginia in the fall in which case i shall still flatter myself with the pleasure of seeing you in the meantime i am with unchanged esteem  respect my dear sir your most obedient friend  servt thomas jefferson june  0    0 new york thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss new york june  0    0 dear sir —your favor of may    came to hand on the  th inst i am infinitely pleased at your predilection for settling in albemarle certainly no    circumstance in life is so near my heart as to have you near me this will fix beyond a doubt my intended visit to virginia in the fall in order to see what arrangements may be taken for settling you in albemarle in the meanwhile perhaps it might be as well for you to defer purchasing the  00 acres of land you mention unless indeed colo randolph were disposed to let you have a part of edgehill i cannot but hope that he you  myself contributing what we can may be able to accommodate you with as much at least of edgehill as colo randolph seemed willing to sell to mr harvie on this subject i must propose a negotiation with him—on enquiry i find that new england is not the place to look out for skilful farmers that is scarcely a country where wheat is cultivated at all the best farmers in america i am told are those on the delaware i shall take measures for knowing whether one can be got for you  at what price congress are much embarrassed by the two questions of assumption and residence all proceedings seem to be arrested till these can be got over and for the peace  continuance of the union a mutual sacrifice of opinion  interest is become the duty of everyone for it is evident that if every one retains inflexibly his present opinion there will be no bill passed at all for funding the public debts  if they separate without funding there is an end of the government in this situation of things the only choice is among disagreeable things the assumption must be admitted but in so qualified a form as to divest it of its injustice this may be done by assuring to    the creditors of every state a sum exactly proportioned to the contribution of the state so that the state will on the whole neither gain nor lose there will remain against the measure only the objection that congress must lay taxes for these debts which might be better laid  collected by the states on the question of residence the compromise proposed is to give it to philadelphia for    years  then permanently to george town by the same act this is the best arrangement we have now any prospect of  therefore the one to which all our wishes are at present pointed if this does not take place something much worse will to wit an unqualified assumption  the permanent seat on the delaware the delegations of this state and pennsylvania have conducted themselves with great honor and wisdom on these questions they have by a steady yet not a stipulated concurrence avoided insidious baits which have been held out to divide them  defeat their object the revolution in france is still going on slowly  surely there is a league of prussia poland sweden  turkey formed under the auspices of england  holland against the two empires who are scarcely in a condition to oppose such a combination there is also a possibility of immediate war between england and spain the day before the mail of the last packet came away that is on the  th of may the king by a message to both houses informed them of the capture of two british vessels by the spaniards at nootka sound under a claim of exclusive right to those coasts that he had demanded satisfaction and    was arming to obtain it there was a very hot press of seamen  several ships of war had already put to sea both houses unanimously promised support  it seems as if they would insist on an unequivocal renunciation of her vague claims on the part of spain perhaps they are determined to be satisfied with nothing less than war dismemberment of the spanish empire and annihilation of their fleet thomas jefferson june  0    0 new york james monroe to james monroe j mss new york june  0    0 dear sir —an attack of a periodical headach which tho violent for a few days only yet kept me long in a lingering state has hitherto prevented my sooner acknowledging the receipt of your favor of may    i hope the uneasiness of mrs monroe  yourself has been removed by the reestablishment of your daughter we have been in hopes of seeing her here and fear at length some change in her arrangements for that purpose congress has been long embarrassed by two of the most irritating questions that ever can be raised among them   the funding the public debt and   the fixing on a more central residence after exhausting their arguments  patience on these subjects they have for some time been resting on their oars unable to get along as to these businesses and indisposed to attend to anything else till they are settled and in fine it has become probable that unless they can be reconciled by some plan of compromise    there will be no funding bill agreed to our credit raised by late prospects to be the first on the exchange at amsterdam where our paper is above par will burst and vanish and the states separate to take care every one of itself this prospect appears probable to some well informed and welldisposed minds endeavours are therefore using to bring about a disposition to some mutual sacrifices the assumption of state debts has appeared as revolting to several states as their nonassumption to others it is proposed to strip the proposition of the injustice it would have done by leaving the states who have redeemed much of their debts on no better footing than those who have redeemed none on the contrary it is recommended to assume a fixed sum allotting a portion of it to every state in proportion to its census consequently every one will receive exactly what they will have to pay or they will be exonerated so far by the general governments taking their creditors off their hands there will be no injustice then but there will be the objection still that congress must then lay taxes for these debts which would have been much better laid  collected by the state governments and this is the objection on which the accommodation now hangs with the nonassumptioners many of whom committed themselves in their advocation of the new constitution by arguments drawn from the improbability that congress would ever lay taxes where the states could do it separately these gentlemen feel the reproaches which will be levelled at them personally i have been  still am of  0 their opinion that congress should always prefer letting the states raise money in their own way where it can be done but in the present instance i see the necessity of yielding for this time to the cries of the creditors in certain parts of the union for the sake of union and to save us from the greatest of all calamities the total extinction of our credit in europe on the other subject it is proposed to pass an act fixing the temporary residence of    or    years at philadelphia and that at the end of that time it shall stand ipso facto  without further declaration transferred to georgetown in this way there will be something to displease  something to soothe every part of the union but new york which must be contented with what she has had if this plan of compromise does not take place i fear one infinitely worse an unqualified assumption  the perpetual residence on the delaware the pennsylvania  virginia delegations have conducted themselves honorably  unexceptionably on the question of residence without descending to talk about bargains they have seen that their true interests lay in not listening to insidious propositions made to divide  defect them and we have seen them at times voting against their respective wishes rather than separate    i flatter myself with being in virginia in the autumn the particular time depends on too many contingencies to be now fixed i shall hope the pleasure of seeing yourself  mrs monroe either in albemarle or wherever else our routes may cross each other present me affectionately to her and    to my good neighbors generally and be assured of the great  sincere esteem of dear sir your affectionate friend  humble servt thomas jefferson june       0 new york c w f dumas to c w f dumas j mss new york june       0 dear sir —i arrived at this place the latter end of march and undertook the office to which the president had been pleased to appoint me of secretary of state which comprehends that of foreign affairs before i had got through the most pressing matters which had been accumulating a long illness came upon me and put it out of my power for many weeks to acknowledge the receipt of your letters    we are much pleased to learn the credit of our paper at amsterdam we consider it as of the first importance to possess the first credit there and to use it little our distance from the wars of europe and our disposition to take no part in them will we hope enable us to keep clear of the debts which they occasion to other powers it will be well for yourself and our bankers to keep in mind always that a great distinction is made here between our foreign and domestic paper as to the foreign congress is considered as the representative of one party only and i think i can say with truth that there is not one single individual in the united states either in or out of office who supposes they can ever do anything which might impair their foreign contracts    but with respect to domestic paper it is thought that congress being the representative of both parties may shape their contracts so as to render them practicable only seeing that substantial justice be done this distinction will explain to you their proceedings on the subject of their debts the funding their foreign debts according to express contract passed without a debate and without a dissenting voice the modelling and funding the domestic debt occasions great debates and great difficulty the bill of ways and means was lately thrown out because an excise was interwoven into its texture and another ordered to be brought in which will be clear of that the assumption of the debts contracted by the states to individuals for services rendered the union is a measure which divides congress greatly some think that the states could much more conveniently levy taxes themselves to pay off these and thus save congress from the odium of imposing too heavy burthens in their name this appears to have been the sentiment of the majority hitherto but it is possible that modifications may be proposed which may bring the measure yet into an acceptable form we shall receive with gratitude the copy of rymers federa which you are so good as to propose for the use of our offices here thomas jefferson june       0 new york dr david ramsay to dr david ramsay j mss new york june       0 dear sir —    congress proceed heavily their funding plans are embarrassed with a proposition    to assume the state debts which is as disagreeable to a part of the union as desireable to another part i hope some compromise will be found great endeavors are using to get the temporary seat of government to philadelphia  the permanent one to george town the counter project is new york  baltimore no time for their adjournment can be yet calculated on    thomas jefferson june       0 new york dr george gilmer to dr george gilmer j mss new york june       0 dear doctor —i have duly received your favor of may    and thank you for the details it contains congressional proceedings go on rather heavily the question for assuming the state debts has created greater animosities than i ever yet saw take place on any occasion there are three ways in which it may yet terminate   a rejection of the measure which will prevent their funding any part of the public debt and will be something very like a dissolution of the government   a bargain between the eastern members who have it so much at heart  the middle members who are indifferent about it to adopt those debts without any modification on condition of removing the seat of government to philadelphia or baltimore   an adoption of them with this modification that the whole sum to be assumed shall be divided among the states in proportion to their census so that each shall receive as much as they are to pay  perhaps this might bring about so much good humour as to induce them    to give the temporary seat of government to philadelphia  then to georgetown permanently it is evident that this last is the least bad of all the turns the thing can take the only objection to it will be that congress will then have to lay  collect taxes to pay these debts which could much better have been laid  collected by the state governments this tho an evil is a less one than any of the others in which it may issue and will probably give us the seat of government at a day not very distant which will vivify our agriculture  commerce by circulating thro our state an additional sum every year of half a million of dollars when the last packet left england there was a great appearance of an immediate rupture with spain should that take place france will become a party i hope peace  profit will be our share present my best esteem to mrs gilmer  my enquiring neighbors thomas jefferson july      0 new york francis eppes to francis eppes j mss new york july      0 dear sir —the business of congress has proceeded very slowly lately two interesting questions have so chafed the members that they can scarcely go on with one another one of these is happily getting over the senate has passed the bill for transferring the temporary residence of congress to philadelphia for  0 years and the permanent one to george town thenceforward the other question relative to the assumption of the state debts is still undecided in the form in which it has been proposed    it will not can never be admitted but neither can the proposition be totally rejected without preventing the funding the public debt altogether which would be tantamount to a dissolution of the government i am in hopes it will be put into a just form by assuming to the creditors of each state in proportion to the census of each state so that the state will be exonerated toward its creditors just as much as it will have to contribute to the assumption  consequently no injustice done the only objection then would be that the states could more conveniently levy taxes themselves to pay these debts i am clearly of this opinion but i see the necessity of sacrificing our opinions some times to the opinions of others for the sake of harmony there is some prospect of a war between spain and england should this take place france will certainly be involved in it  it will be as general a war as has ever been seen in europe consequently it will be long patching up a peace which will adjust so many interests in the meantime i hope peace  profit will be our lot—i think there is every prospect of a good price for our produce  particularly our wheat for years to come—the revolution in france goes on with a slow but steady step their west india islands are all in combustion there is no government in them consequently their trade entirely open to us i shall come to virginia in september most probably early in the month tho i had rather make it a little later if the time to be fixed by the president for removal to philadelphia will admit it for i take it for granted the bill will pass the h of    representatives where it has been read once or twice and will be finally decided on the day after tomorrow present me most affectionately to mrs eppes and the family i am my dear sir your affectionate friend  servt thomas jefferson july      0 new york edward rutledge to edward rutledge j mss new york july      0 my dear sir —your favor of apr    came to hand may    and found me under a severe indisposition which kept me from all business more than a month and still permits me to apply but very sparingly that of june  0 was delivered me two days ago by young mr middleton whom i was very glad to see as i am every body  every thing which comes from you it will give me great pleasure to be of any use to him on his fathers account as well as yours in yours of apr    you mention dr turnbulls opinion that force alone can do our business with the algerines i am glad to have the concurrence of so good an authority on that point i am clear myself that nothing but a perpetual cruize against them or at least for   months of the year  for several years can put an end to their piracies and i believe that a confederacy of the nations not in treaty with them can be effected so as to make that perpetual cruise or our share of it a very light thing and i am in hopes this may shortly be the case—i participate fully of your indignation at the trammels imposed on our commerce with great britain some attempts have been made in congress and others    are still making to meet their restrictions by effectual restrictions on our part it was proposed to double the foreign tonnage for a certain time  after that to prohibit the exportation of our commodities in the vessels of nations not in treaty with us this has been rejected it is now proposed to prohibit any nation from bringing or carrying in their vessels what may not be brought or carried in ours from or to the same ports also to prohibit those from bringing to us any thing not of their own produce who prohibit us from carrying to them any thing but our own produce it is thought however that this cannot be carried the fear is that it would irritate great britain were we to feel any irritation ourselves you will see by the debates of congress that there are good men and bold men  sensible men who publicly avow these sentiments your observation on the expediency of making short treaties are most sound our situation is too changing  too improving to render an unchangeable treaty expedient for us but what are these enquiries on the part of the british minister which lead you to think he means to treat may they not look to some other object i suspect they do  can no otherwise reconcile all circumstances i would thank you for a communication of any facts on this subject some questions have lately agitated the mind of congress more than the friends of union on catholic principles could have wished the general assumption of state debts has been as warmly demanded by some states as warmly rejected by others i hope still that this question may be so divested of the    injustice imputed to it as to be compromised the question of residence you know was always a heating one a bill has passed the senate for fixing this at philadelphia ten years  then at george town and it is rather probable it will pass the lower house that question then will be put to sleep for ten years  this and the funding business being once out of the way i hope nothing else may be able to call up local principles—if the war between spain  england takes place i think france will inevitably be involved in it in that case i hope the new world will fatten on the follies of the old if we can but establish the principles of the armed neutrality for ourselves we must become the carriers for all parties as far as we can raise vessels the president had a hair breadth escape but he is now perfectly reestablished  looks much better than before he was sick—i expect daily to see your nephew mr j rutledge arrive here as he wrote me by the may packet that he would come in that of june he is a very hopeful young man sensible wellinformed prudent  cool our southern sun has been accused of sometimes sublimating the temper too highly i wish all could think as coolly but as soundly  firmly too as you do adieu my dear friend yours affectionately thomas jefferson july       0 new york james monroe to james monroe j mss new york july       0 dear sir —i wrote you last on the  0th of june the bill for removing the federal government to    philadelphia for  0 years  then to georgetown has at length passed both houses the offices are to be removed before the first of december i presume it will be done during the presidents trip to virginia about the  st of september  october i hope to set out for virginia about the  st of september and to pass three or four weeks at monticello congress will now probably proceed in better humour to funding the public debt this measure will secure to us the credit we now hold at amsterdam where our european paper is above par which is the case of no other nation our business is to have great credit and to use it little whatever enables us to go to war secures our peace at present it is essential to let both spain  england see that we are in a condition for war for a number of collateral circumstances now render it probable that they will be in that condition our object is to feed  theirs to fight if we are not forced by england we shall have a gainful time of it—a vessel from gibraltar of the  0th of june tells us ohara was busily fortifying  providing there  that the english consuls in the spanish ports on the mediterranean had received orders to dispatch all their vessels from those ports immediately the captain saw    spanish ships of war going to cadiz it is said that arnold is in detroit reviewing the militia there other symptoms indicate a general design on all louisiana  the two floridas what a tremendous position would success

particularly should the latter attempt the conquest of louisiana  the floridas  the dangers to us should great britain possess herself of those countries    she will possess a territory equal to half ours beyond the missisipi she will reduce that half of ours which is on this side the missisipi by her language laws religion manners government commerce capital by the possession of n orleans which draws to it ye dependence of all ye waters of misspi    by the markets she can offer them in the gulph of mexico  elsewhere she will take from the remaining part of our states the markets they now have for their produce by furnishing those markets cheaper with the same articles tobo rice indigo bread lumber naval stores furs    she will have then possessions double the size of ours as good in soil  climate she will encircle us compleatly by these possessions on our land board and her fleets on our seaboard instead of two neighbors balancing each other we shall have one with more than the strength of both would the prevention of this be worth a war consider our abilities to take part in a war our operations would be by land only how many men should we need to employ— their cost our resources of taxation  credit equal to this weigh the evil of this new accumulation of debt against the loss of markets  eternal expence  danger from so overgrown a neighbor but this is on supposition that france as well as spain shall be engaged in the war for with spain alone the war would be unsuccessful  our situation rendered worse no need to take a part in the war as yet—we may chuse our own time delay gives us many chances to avoid it altogether in such a choice of objects gr britain may not single out louisiana  the floridas she may fail in her attempt on them france and spain may recover them if all these chances fail we should have to retake them    the difference between retaking  preventing overbalanced by the benefits of delay delay enables us to be better prepared to obtain from the allies a price for our assistance suppose these our ultimate views what is to be done at this time   as to spain if she be as sensible as we are that she cannot save louisiana and the floridas might she not prefer their independance to their subjection to gr britain does not the proposition of the ct destaing furnish us an opening to communicate our ideas on this subject to the court of france and thro them to that of madrid and our readiness to join them in guaranteeing the independance of those countries this might save us from a war if gr britain respects our weight in a war and if she does not the object would place the war on popular ground with us   as to england say to beckwith that as to a treaty of commerce we would prefer amicable to adversary arrangements tho the latter would be infallible and in our power that our ideas are that such a treaty should be founded in perfect reciprocity and wd therefore be its own price that as to an alliance we can say nothing till its object be shewn  that it is not to be inconsistent with existing engagements    that in the event of a war between gr britain  spain we are disposed to be strictly neutral that however we should view with extreme uneasiness any attempt of either power to seize the possessions of the other on our frontier as we consider our own safety interested in a due balance between our neighbors it might be advantageous to express this latter sentiment because if there be any difference of opinion in their councils whether to bend their force against north or south america or the islands and certainly there is room for difference and if these opinions be nearly balanced that balance might be determined by the prospect of having an enemy the more or less according to the object they should select thomas jefferson       0 new york c w f dumas to c w f dumas j mss new york july       0 sir —    congress are still engaged in their funding bills the foreign debts did not admit of any difference of opinion they were settled by a single and unanimous vote but the domestic debt requiring modifications and settlements these produce great difference of opinion and consequently retard the passage of the funding bill the states had individually contracted considerable debts for their particular defence in addition to what was done by congress some of the states have so exerted themselves since the war as to have paid off near the    half of their individual debts others have done nothing the state creditors urge that these debts were as much for general purposes as those contracted by congress and insist that congress shall assume and pay such of them as have not been yet paid by their own states the states who have exerted themselves most find that notwithstanding the great payments they have made they shall by this assumption still have nearly as much to pay as if they had never paid anything they are therefore opposed to it i am in hopes a compromise will be effected by a proportional assumption which may reach a great part of the debts and leave still a part of them to be paid by those states who have paid few or none of their creditors this being once settled congress will probably adjourn and meet again in december at philadelphia the appearance of war between our two neighbors spain and england would render a longer adjournment inexpedient thomas jefferson july       0 george washington to the president of the united states d s mss thursday july       0 sir —i have formed an opinion quite satisfactory to myself that the adjournment of congress may be by law as well as by resolution without touching the constitution i am now copying fair what i had written yesterday on the subject  will have the honor of laying it before you by ten oclock the address to the president contains a very full digest of all the arguments urged against the bill on the    point of unconstitutionality on the floor of congress it was fully combated on that ground in the committee of the whole  on the third reading the majority a southern one overruled the objection as a majority a northern one had overruled the same objection the last session on the susquehanna residence bill so that two majorities in the two different sessions  from different ends of the union have overruled the objection and may be fairly supposed to have declared the sense of the whole union i shall not lose a moment in laying before you my thoughts on the subject thomas jefferson july       0 opinion on residence bill j mss july       0 opinion upon the question whether the president should veto the bill declaring that the seat of government shall be transferred to the potomac in the year    0 a bill having passed both houses of congress and being now before the president declaring that the seat of the federal government shall be transferred to the potomac in the year    0 that the session of congress next ensuing the present shall be held in philadelphia to which place the offices shall be transferred before the  st of december next a writer in a public paper of july    has urged on the consideration of the president that the constitution has given to the two houses of congress the exclusive right to adjourn themselves that the will of the    president mixed with theirs in a decision of this kind would be an inoperative ingredient repugnant to the constitution and that he ought not to permit them to part in a single instance with their constitutional rights consequently that he ought to negative the bill that is now to be considered every man and every body of men on earth possesses the right of selfgovernment they receive it with their being from the hand of nature individuals exercise it by their single will collections of men by that of their majority for the law of the majority is the natural law of every society of men when a certain description of men are to transact together a particular business the times and places of their meeting and separating depend on their own will they make a part of the natural right of selfgovernment this like all other natural rights may be abridged or modified in its exercise by their own consent or by the law of those who depute them if they meet in the right of others but as far as it is not abridged or modified they retain it as a natural right and may exercise them in what form they please either exclusively by themselves or in association with others or by others altogether as they shall agree each house of congress possesses this natural right of governing itself and consequently of fixing its own times and places of meeting so far as it has not been abridged by the law of those who employ them that is to say by the constitution this act manifestly considers them as possessing this right    of course and therefore has nowhere given it to them in the several different passages where it touches this right it treats it as an existing thing not as one called into existence by them to evince this every passage of the constitution shall be quoted where the right of adjournment is touched and it will be seen that no one of them pretends to give that right that on the contrary every one is evidently introduced either to enlarge the right where it would be too narrow to restrain it where in its natural and full exercise it might be too large and lead to inconvenience to defend it from the latitude of its own phrases where these were not meant to comprehend it or to provide for its exercise by others when they cannot exercise it themselves a majority of each house shall constitute a quorum to do business but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members art   sec   a majority of every collection of men being naturally necessary to constitute its will and it being frequently to happen that a majority is not assembled it was necessary to enlarge the natural right by giving to a smaller number than a majority a right to compel the attendence of the absent members and in the meantime to adjourn from day to day this clause then does not pretend to give to a majority a right which it knew that majority would have of themselves but to a number less than a majority a right to which it knew that lesser number could not have of themselves neither house during the session of congress  00 shall without the consent of the other adjourn for more than three days nor to any other place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting ibid each house exercising separately its natural right to meet when and where it should think best it might happen that the two houses would separate either in time or place which would be inconvenient it was necessary therefore to keep them together by restraining their natural right of deciding on separate times and places and by requiring a concurrence of will but as it might happen that obstinacy or a difference of object might prevent this concurrence it goes on to take from them in that instance the right of adjournment altogether and to transfer it to another by declaring art   sec   that in case of disagreement between the two houses with respect to the time of adjournment the president may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper these clauses then do not import a gift to the two houses of a general right of adjournment which it was known they would have without that gift but to restrain or abrogate the right it was known they would have in an instance where exercised in its full extent it might lead to inconvenience and to give that right to another who would not naturally have had it it also gives to the president a right which he otherwise would not have had to convene both houses or either of them on extraordinary occasions thus substituting the will of another where they are not in a situation to exercise their own  0  every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of adjournment shall be presented to the president for his approbation c art i sec   the latitude of the general words here used would have subjected the natural right of adjournment of the two houses to the will of the president which was not intended they therefore expressly except questions of adjournment out of their operation they do not here give a right of adjournment which it was known would exist without their gift but they defend the existing right against the latitude of their own phrases in a case where there was no good reason to abridge it the exception admits they will have the right of adjournment without pointing out the source from which they will derive it these are all the passages of the constitution one only excepted which shall be presently cited where the right of adjournment is touched and it is evident that none of these are introduced to give that right but every one supposes it to be existing and provides some specific modification for cases where either a defeat in the natural right or a too full use of it would occasion inconvenience the right of adjournment then is not given by the constitution and consequently it may be modified by law without interfering with that instrument it is a natural right and like all other natural rights may be abridged or regulated in its exercise by law and the concurrence of the third branch in any law regulating its exercise is so efficient an ingredient in  0  that law that the right cannot be otherwise exercised but after a repeal by a new law the express terms of the constitution itself show that this right may be modified by law when in art i sec   the only remaining passage on the subject not yet quoted it says the congress shall assemble at least once in every year and such meeting shall be the first monday in december unless they shall by law appoint a different day then another day may be appointed by law and the presidents assent is an efficient ingredient in that law nay further they cannot adjourn over the first monday of december but by a law this is another constitutional abridgment of their natural right of adjournment and completing our review of all the causes in the constitution which touch that right authorizes us to say no part of that instrument gives it and that the houses hold it not from the constitution but from nature a consequence of this is that the houses may by a joint resolution remove themselves from place to place because it is a part of their right of selfgovernment but that as the right of selfgovernment does not comprehend the government of others the two houses cannot by a joint resolution of their majorities only remove the executive and judiciary from place to place these branches possessing also the rights of selfgovernment from nature cannot be controlled in the exercise of them but by a law passed in the forms of the constitution the clause of the bill in question therefore was necessary to be put into the form of a law and to be submitted to the  0  president so far as it proposes to effect the removal of the executive and judiciary to philadelphia so far as respects the removal of the present houses of legislation thither it was not necessary to be submitted to the president but such a submission is not repugnant to the constitution on the contrary if he concurs it will so far fix the next session of congress at philadelphia that it cannot be changed but by a regular law the sense of congress itself is always respectable authority it has been given very remarkably on the present subject the address to the president in the paper of the   th is a complete digest of all the arguments urged on the floor of the representatives against the constitutionality of the bill now before the president and they were overruled by a majority of that house comprehending the delegation of all the states south of the hudson except south carolina at the last cession of congress when the bill for remaining a certain term in new york and then removing to susquehanna or germantown was objected to on the same ground the objection was overruled by a majority comprehending the delegations of the northern half of the union with that of south carolina so that the sense of every state in the union has been expressed by its delegation against this objection south carolina excepted and excepting also rhode island which has never yet had a delegation in place to vote on the question in both these instances the senate concurred with the majority of the representatives the sense of the two houses is stronger authority in  0  this case as it is given against their own supposed privilege it would be as tedious as it is unnecessary to take up and discuss one by one the objections proposed in the paper of july    every one of them is founded on the supposition that the two houses hold their right of adjournment from the constitution this error being corrected the objections founded on it fall of themselves it would also be work of mere supererogation to show that granting what this writer takes for granted that the presidents assent would be an inoperative ingredient because excluded by the constitution as he says yet the particular views of the writer would be frustrated for on every hypothesis of what the president may do congress must go to philadelphia   if he assents to the bill that assent makes good law of the part relative to the patomac and the part for holding the next session at philadelphia is good either as an ordinance or a vote of the two houses containing a complete declaration of their will in a case where it is competent to the object so that they must go to philadelphia in that case   if he dissents from the bill it annuls the part relative to the patomac but as to the clause for adjourning to philadelphia his dissent being as inefficient as his assent it remains a good ordinance or vote of the two houses for going thither and consequently they must go in this case also   if the president withholds his will out of the bill altogether by a ten days silence then the part relative to the potomac becomes a good law  0  without his will and that relative to philadelphia is good also either as a law or an ordinance or a vote of the two houses and consequently in this case also they go to philadelphia thomas jefferson july       0 new york william temple franklin to william temple franklin j mss new york july       0 dear sir —on further reflection it appears to me that the houses you mentioned of mrs buddin would suit me so perfectly that i must beg the favor of you to insure me the refusal of two of them adjoining to each other on the best terms you can houses will doubtless rise in the first moment but as the residence of congress really calls for but a very few houses such as those probably not a dozen i suppose there will be new buildings immediately erected more than equal to the new demand this ought to be a consideration with the proprietor to be moderate in order to ensure the continuance of a tenant my object in taking two houses is to assign the lower floor of both to my public offices and the first floor and both gardens entirely to my own use perhaps the third floor of one of them might also be necessary

the countercheat every one is justifiable in rejecting both except so far as his contracts bind him i shall carry these papers to virginia and there settle the matter war or no war between england  spain is still a doubtful question if there be war france will probably take part in it this we cannot help and therefore we must console ourselves with the good price for wheat which it will bring us the assumption of the state debts will i believe be agreed to somewhat on the plan mentioned to  0  you in my last they assume particularly for the state of virginia the exact quota she will be liable to of the whole sum assumed but the same justice is not done to the other states more is given to some who owed more  less to others who owed  asked less it is a measure of necessity i hope to set out

mr austin shall certainly receive every aid i can give him that which he asks from congress i suppose very doubtful no body can say where such a precedent would carry them a contract to supply government with the lead it may want i should think him entitled to on principles of sound policy it is still uncertain whether there will be war between spain  england if there is france will probably embark in it her revolution is so far advanced that it cannot be disturbed by a war perhaps it may improve their constitution by adapting  0  it to that circumstance as yet appearances indicate war tho there is a leading fact against it that of a british ambassador having actually gone to madrid be this as it will there will be war enough to give us high prices for wheat for years to come  this single commodity will make us a great  happy nation the assumption will i believe pass in the form in which you see it in the publick papers that is to say a fixed sum will be assumed

indebted in a still higher proportion that virginia might not lose the benefit from the paiements she has made of her domestic debt they assume for her exactly what it is supposed she will have to furnish of the whole sum assumed it is imagined too this sum will cover the whole of her remaining domestic debt to other states which owed  asked less less is apportioned with respect to virginia the measure is thus divested of its injustice it remains liable however to others founded in policy i have no doubt that the states should be left to do whatever acts they can do as well as the general government and that they could have availed themselves of resources for this paiment which are cut off from the general government by the prejudices existing against direct taxation in their hands they must push therefore the tax on imports as far as it will bear and this is not a proper object to bear all the taxes of a state  0  however the impossibility that certain states could ever pay the debts they had contracted the acknowledgement that nine tenths of these debts were contracted for the general defence as much as those contracted by congress directly the clamours of the creditors within those states and the possibility that these might defeat the funding any part of the public debt if theirs also were not assumed were motives not to be neglected i saw the first proposition for this assumption with as much aversion as any man but the development of circumstances have convinced me that if it is obdurately rejected something much worse will happen considering it therefore as one of the cases in which mutual sacrifice  accommodation is necessary i shall see it pass with acquiescence it is to be observed that the sums to be assumed are to be on account only—mcgillivray  his chiefs are here we hope good from this visit congress i think will adjourn between the  th and   th of august the president will very soon after set out for virginia i shall avail myself of this interregnum to visit virginia thomas jefferson july   th    0 opinion on indian trade july   th    0 opinion in regard to the continuance of the monopoly of the commerce of the creek nation enjoyed by col mcgillivray colonel mcgillivray with a company of british merchants having hitherto enjoyed a monopoly of   0 the commerce of the creek nation with a right of importing their goods duty free and considering these privileges as the principal sources of his power over that nation is unwilling to enter into treaty with us unless they can be continued to him and the question is how this may be done consistently with our laws and so as to avoid just complaints from those of our citizens who would wish to participate of the trade our citizens at this time are not permitted to trade in that nation the nation has a right to give us their peace and to withhold their commerce to place it under whatever monopolies or regulations they please if they insist that only colonel mcgillivray and his company shall be permitted to trade among them we have no right to say the contrary we shall even gain some advantage in substituting citizens of the united states instead of british subjects as associates of colonel mcgillivray and excluding both british and spaniards from the country suppose then it be expressly stipulated by treaty that no person be permitted to trade in the creek country without a license from the president that but a fixed number shall be permitted to trade there at all and that the goods imported for and sent to the creek nation shall be duty free it may further be either expressed that the person licensed shall be approved by the leader or leaders of the nation or without this it may be understood between the president and mcgillivray that the stipulated number of licenses shall be sent to him blank to fill up     a treaty made by the president with the concurrence of twothirds of the senate is a law of the land and a law of superior order because it not only repeals past laws but cannot itself be repealed by future ones  the treaty then will legally control the duty acts and the acts for licensing traders in this particular instance when a citizen applies for a license who is not of mcgillivrays partnership he will be told that but a given number could be licensed by the treaty and that the number is full it seems that in this way no law will be violated and no just cause of complaint will be given on the contrary the treaty will have bettered our situation though not in the full degree which might have been wished thomas jefferson august      0 new york william carmichael to the u s chargé daffaires in spain william carmichael s p new york august      0 dear sir —this letter will be delivered to you by colonel humphreys whose character is so well known to you as to need no recommendations from me the present appearances of war between our two neighbors spain and england cannot but excite all our attention the part we are to act is uncertain and will be difficult the unsettled state of our     dispute with spain may give a turn to it very different from what we would wish as it is important that you should be fully apprized of our way of thinking on this subject i have sketched in the enclosed paper  general heads of consideration arising from present circumstances these will be readily developed by your own reflections and in conversations with colonel humphreys who possessing the sentiments of the executive on this subject being well acquainted with the circumstances of the western country in particular and of the state of our affairs in general comes to madrid expressly for the purpose of giving you a thorough communication of them he will therefore remain there as many days or weeks as may be necessary for this purpose with this information written and oral you will be enabled to meet the minister in conversations on the subject of the navigation of the mississippi to which we wish you to lead his attention immediately impress him thoroughly with the necessity of an early and even an immediate settlement of this matter and of a return to the field of negotiation for this purpose and though it must be done delicately yet he must be made to understand unequivocally that a resumption of the negotiation is not desired on our part unless he can determine in the first opening of it to yield the immediate and full enjoyment of that navigation i say nothing of the claims of spain to our territory north of the thirtyfirst degree and east of the mississippi they never merited the respect of an answer     and you know it has been admitted at madrid that they were not to be maintained it may be asked what need of negotiation if the navigation is to be ceded at all events you know that the navigation cannot be practised without a port where the sea and river vessels may meet and exchange loads and where those employed about them may be safe and unmolested the right to use a thing comprehends a right to the means necessary to its use and without which it would be useless the fixing on a proper port and the degree of freedom it is to enjoy in its operations will require negotiation and be governed by events there is danger indeed that even the unavoidable delay of sending a negotiator here may render the mission too late for the preservation of peace it is impossible to answer for the forbearance of our western citizens we endeavor to quiet them with the expectation of an attainment of their rights by peaceable means but should they in a moment of impatience hazard others there is no saying how far we may be led for neither themselves nor their rights will ever be abandoned by us you will be pleased to observe that we press these matters warmly and firmly under this idea that the war between spain and great britain will be begun before you receive this and such a moment must not be lost but should an accommodation take place we retain indeed the same object and the same resolutions unalterably but your discretion will suggest that in that event they must be pressed more softly and that patience and persuasion must     temper your conferences till either these may prevail or some other circumstance turn up which may enable us to use other means for the attainment of an object which we are determined in the end to obtain at every risk thomas jefferson august      0 george washington to the president d s mss friday august      0 th jefferson has the honor to inform the president that in a conversation with mr hawkins yesterday evening it came out that he had seen mcgillivrays letter to govr houston  houstons answer he thinks they were dated the latter end of      but is sure they were some time in the year preceding the treaty of galphinton to which he was sent he recites the substance and purport of mcgilivrays letter but does not recollect that of houstons previous to the treaty of galphinton some of the indians disavowed to him that of augusta  declared the lands ceded were of those which belonged to the whole nation  not to the lower creeks in particular i am not certain whether he did not say this conversation was in      but i am sure he repeated it as precedent to the treaty of galphinton thomas jefferson august  0    0 new york william short to the u s chargé daffaires in france william short s p new york august  0    0 dear sir —this letter with the very confidential papers it encloses will be delivered to you by mr     barrett with his own hands if there be no war between spain and england they need to be known to yourself alone but if that war be begun or whenever it shall begin we wish you to communicate them to the marquis de la fayette on whose assistance we know we can count in matters which interest both our countries he and you will consider how far the contents of these papers may be communicated to the count de montmorin and his influence be asked with the court of madrid france will be called into the war as an ally and not on any pretence of the quarrel being in any degree her own she may reasonably require then that spain should do everything which depends on her to lessen the number of her enemies she cannot doubt that we shall be of that number if she does not yield our right to the common use of the mississippi and the means of using and securing it you will observe we state in general the necessity not only of our having a port near the mouth of the river without which we could make no use of the navigation at all but of its being so well separated from the territories of spain and her jurisdiction as not to engender daily disputes and broils between us it is certain that if spain were to retain any jurisdiction over our entrepôt her officers would abuse that jurisdiction and our people would abuse their privileges in it both parties must foresee this and that it will end in war hence the necessity of a welldefined separation nature has decided what shall be the geography of that in the end whatever it might be in the beginning by cutting off from     the adjacent countries of florida and louisiana and enclosing between two of its channels a long and narrow slip of land called the island of new orleans the idea of ceding this could not be hazarded to spain in the first step it would be too disagreeable at first view because this island with its town constitutes at present their principal settlement in that part of their dominions containing about ten thousand white inhabitants of every age and sex reason and events however may by little and little familiarize them to it that we have a right to some spot as an entrepôt for our commerce may be at once affirmed the expediency too may be expressed of so locating it as to cut off the source of future quarrels and wars a disinterested eye looking on a map will remark how conveniently this tongue of land is formed for the purpose the iberville and amit channel offering a good boundary and convenient outlet on the one side for florida and the main channel an equally good boundary and outlet on the other side for louisiana while the slip of land between is almost entirely morass or sandbank the whole of it lower than the water of the river in its highest floods and only its western margin which is the highest ground secured by banks and inhabited i suppose this idea too much even for the count de montmorin at first and that therefore you will find it prudent to urge and get him to recommend to the spanish court only in general terms a port near the mouth of the river with a circumjacent territory sufficient for its support well defined and extraterritorial     to spain leaving the idea to future growth i enclose you the copy of a paper distributed by the spanish commandant on the west side of the mississippi which may justify us to m de montmorin for pushing this matter to an immediate conclusion it cannot be expected we shall give spain time to be used by her for dismembering us it is proper to apprize you of a circumstance which may show the expediency of being in some degree on your guard even in your communications to the court of france it is believed here that the count de moustier during his residence with us conceived the project of again engaging france in a colony upon our continent and that he directed his views to some of the country on the mississippi and obtained and communicated a good deal of matter on the subject to his court he saw the immediate advantage of selling some yards of french cloths and silks to the inhabitants of new orleans but he did not take into account what it would cost france to nurse and protect a colony there till it should be able to join its neighbors or to stand by itself and then what it would cost her to get rid of it i hardly suspect that the court of france could be seduced by so partial a view of the subject as was presented to them and i suspect it the less since the national assembly has constitutionally excluded conquest from the object of their government it may be added too that the place being ours their yards of cloth and silk would be as freely sold as if it were theirs     you will perceive by this letter and the papers it encloses what part of the ideas of count destaing correspond with our views the answer to him must be a compound of civility and reserve expressing our thankfulness for his attentions that we consider them as proofs of the continuance of his friendly dispositions and that though it might be out of our system to implicate ourselves in transatlantic guarantees yet other parts of his plans are capable of being improved to the common benefit of the parties be so good as to say to him something of this kind verbally and so as that the matter may be ended as between him and us on the whole in the event of war it is left to the judgment of the marquis de la fayette and yourself how far you will develop the ideas now communicated to the count de montmorin and how far you will suffer them to be developed to the spanish court i enclose you a pamphlet by hutchins for your further information on the subject of the mississippi and am with sentiments of perfect esteem and attachment dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson august       0 new york colonel david humphreys to the u s secret agent colonel david humphreys j mss new york august       0 sir —the president having thought proper to confide several special matters in europe to your     care it will be expedient that you take your passage in the first convenient vessel bound to the port of london when there you will be pleased to deliver to mr g morris and to mr johnson the letters and papers you will have in charge for them to communicate to us from thence any interesting public intelligence you may be able to obtain and then to take as early a passage as possible to lisbon at lisbon you will deliver the letter with which you are charged for the chevalier pinto putting on it the address proper to his present situation you know the contents of this letter and will make it the subject of such conferences with him as may be necessary to obtain our point of establishing there the diplomatic grade which alone coincides with our system and of insuring its reception and treatment with the requisite respect communicate to us the result of your conferences and then proceed to madrid there you will deliver the letters and papers which you have in charge for mr carmichael the contents of all which are known to you be so good as to multiply as much as possible your conferences with him in order to possess him fully of the special matters sketched out in those papers and of the state of our affairs in general your stay there will be as long as its object may require only taking care to return to lisbon by the time you may reasonably expect that our answers to your letters to be written from lisbon may reach that place this cannot be earlier than the first or   0 second week of january these answers will convey to you the presidents further pleasure through the whole of this business it will be best that you avoid all suspicion of being on any public business this need be known only to the chevalier pinto and mr carmichael the former need not know of your journey to madrid or if it be necessary he may be made to understand that it is a journey of curiosity to fill up the interval between writing your letters and receiving the answers to every other person it will be best that you appear as a private traveller the president of the united states allows you from this date at the rate of two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars a year for your services and expenses and moreover what you may incur for the postage of letters until he shall otherwise order thomas jefferson aug       0 new york benjamin smith barton to benjamin smith barton j mss new york aug       0 sir —i have been duly honored with yours of the  th instant and in order to answer it must enter into a detail of facts in the formation of the higher departments there were some endeavors in congress to establish a separate minister for the domestic business this was disapproved by a considerable majority of congress and they therefore united that with the foreign business under the department of the secretary of state—when i arrived here i found mr alden     at the head of the home office  mr remsen at that of the foreign office neither could descend to a secondary appointment  yet they were each so well acquainted with their respective departments  the papers in them that it was extremely desirable to keep both on this ground of their peculiar familiarity with the papers  proceedings of their respective offices which made them necessary to me as indexes i asked permission to appoint two chief clerks the legislature received the proposition with some jealousy lest it might be intended to bring forward again the plan of two departments and tho the bill past it was after considerable delay and being quite satisfied i had no other view than to be enabled to keep the two gentlemen so peculiarly familiar with the papers under their care one of them chusing afterwards to engage in another line i could do nothing less in return to the complaisance of the legislature than declare that as the ground on which alone they were induced to allow the second office was now removed i considered the office as at an end and that the arrangements should return to the order desired by the legislature this declaration has been given to some applications already made for this office i should have had real pleasure sir in serving you on this occasion but the preceding detail of facts will serve to shew you that the appointment cannot be renewed the testimony i have received would otherwise be quite sufficient to convince me that i could not fill the office better than by naming you were it considered as now existing     thomas jefferson august       0 new york gouverneur morris to the u s informal agent in great britain gouverneur morris s p new york august       0 dear sir —your letter of may the   th to the president of the united states has been duly received you have placed their proposition of exchanging a minister on proper ground it must certainly come from them and come in unequivocal form with those who respect their own dignity so much ours must not be counted at naught on their own proposal formally to exchange a minister we sent them one they have taken no notice of that and talk of agreeing to exchange one now as if the idea were new besides what they are saying to you they are talking to us through quebec but so informally that they may disavow it when they please it would only oblige them to make the fortune of the poor major whom they would pretend to sacrifice through him they talk of a minister a treaty of commerce and alliance if the object of the latter be honorable it is useless if dishonorable inadmissible these tamperings prove they view a war as very possible and some symptoms indicate designs against the spanish possessions adjoining us the consequences of their acquiring all the country on our frontier from the st croix to the st marys are too obvious to you to need development you will readily see the dangers which would then environ us we wish you therefore to intimate to them that we cannot be indifferent to enterprises of this kind that we should contemplate a change of neighbors with extreme uneasiness and that a due     balance on our borders is not less desirable to us than a balance of power in europe has always appeared to them we wish to be neutral and we will be so if they will execute the treaty fairly and attempt no conquests adjoining us the first condition is just the second imposes no hardship on them they cannot complain that the other dominions of spain would be so narrow as not to leave them room enough for conquest if the war takes place we would really wish to be quieted on these two points offering in return an honorable neutrality more than this they are not to expect it will be proper that these ideas be conveyed in delicate and friendly terms but that they be conveyed if the war takes place for it is in that case alone and not till it be begun that we should wish our dispositions to be known but in no case need they think of our accepting any equivalent for the posts thomas jefferson aug   d    0 mr carmichael heads of consideration on the navigation of the mississippi for mr carmichael  aug   d    0 we have a right to the navigation of the mississippi—  by nature   by treaty it is necessary to us more than half the territory     of the united states is on the waters of that river two hundred thousand of our citizens are settled on them of whom forty thousand bear arms these have no other outlet for their tobacco rice corn hemp lumber house timber ship timber we have hitherto respected the indecision of spain because we wish peace—because our western citizens have had vent at home for their productions a surplus of production begins now to demand     foreign markets whenever they shall say we cannot we will not be longer shut up the united states will be reduced to the following dilemma   to force them to acquiescence   to separate from them rather than take part in a war against spain   or to preserve them in our union by joining them in the war the  st is neither in our principles nor in our power  d a multitude of reasons decide against the second     it may suffice to speak out one were we to give up half our territory rather than engage in a just war to preserve it we should not keep the other half long  d the third is the alternative we must adopt how are we to obtain that navigation a by force i acting separately that we can effect this     with certainty and promptitude circumstances decide objection we cannot retain new orleans for instance were we to take it answer a moderate force may be so secured as to hold out till succored our succors can be prompt and effectual suppose after taking it we withdraw our force if spain retakes it by an expedition we can recover it     by a counterexpedition and so as often as the case shall happen their expedition will be slow expensive and lead to catastrophes ours sudden economical and a check can have no consequences we should associate the country to our union the inhabitants wish this they are not disposed to be of the spanish government it is idle in spain to suppose our western inhabitants will unite with them they could be quiet but a short time under a goverment so repugnant to their feelings were they to come under it for present purposes it would be with a view to throw it off soon should they remain they would communicate a spirit of independence to those with whom they should be mixed ii acting in conjunction with great britain and with a view to partition the floridas including new orleans would be assigned to us louisiana or all the western waters of the mississippi to them we confess that such an alliance is not what we would wish because it may eventually lead us into embarrassing situations with our best friend and put the power of two neighbors into the hands of one l lansdowne has declared he gave the floridas to spain rather than the united states as a bone of discord with the house of bourbon and of reunion with great britain connollys attempt as well as other facts proves they keep it in view b by negotiation     i what must spain do of necessity the conduct of spain has proved that the occlusion of the mississippi is system with her if she opens it now it will be because forced by imperious circumstances she will consequently shut it again when these circumstances cease treaty will be no obstacle irregularities real or pretended in our navigators will furnish color enough perpetual broils and finally war will ensue prudence and even necessity imposes on us the law of settling the matter now finally and not by halves with experience of the past and prospect of the future it would be imbecility in us to accept the naked navigation with that we must have what is necessary to its use and without which it would be useless to secure its continuance that is a port near the mouth to receive our vessels and protect the navigation but even this will not secure the floridas and louisiana against great britain if we are neutral she will wrest those possessions from spain the inhabitants french english scotch american would prefer england to spain ii what then had spain better do of choice cede to us all the territory on our side of the mississippi on condition that we guarantee all her possessions on the western waters of that river she agreeing further to subsidize us if the guarantee brings us into the war should great britain possess herself of the   0 floridas and louisiana her governing principles are conquest colonization commerce monopoly she will establish powerful colonies in them these can be poured into the gulf of mexico for any sudden enterprise there or invade mexico their next neighbor by land whilst a fleet cooperates along shore and cuts off relief and proceed successively from colony to colony with respect to us if great britain establishes herself on our whole landboard our lot will be bloody and eternal war or indissoluble confederacy which ought we to choose what will be the lot of the spanish colonies in the jaws of such a confederacy what will secure the ocean against the monopoly safer for spain that we should be her neighbor than england conquest not in our principles inconsistent with our government not our interest to cross the mississippi for ages and will never be our interest to remain united with those who do intermediate chances save the trouble of calculating so far forward consequences of this cession and guarantee   every subject of difference will be removed from between spain and the united states   our interest will be strongly engaged in her retaining her american possessions   spain will be quieted as to louisiana and her territories west of that   she may employ her whole force in defence of her     islands and southern possessions   if we preserve our neutrality it will be a very partial one to her   if we are forced into the war it will be as we wish on the side of the house of bourbon   her privateers will commit formidable depredation on the british trade and occupy much of their force   by withholding supplies of provision as well as by concurring in expeditions the british islands will be in imminent danger   their expenses of precaution both for their continental and insular possessions will be so augmented as to give a hope of running their credit down in fine for a narrow slip of barren detached and expensive country spain secures the rest of her territory and makes an ally where she might have a dangerous enemy thomas jefferson august       0 opinion on foreign debt august       0 opinion respecting our foreign debt on consideration of the letter of our banker of january   th    0 the secretary of the treasurys answer to it and the draught of powers and instructions to him i am of opinion as i always have been that the purchase of our debt to france by private speculators would have been an operation extremely injurious to our credit and that the consequence foreseen by our banker that the purchasers would have been obliged in order to make good their     payments to deluge the markets of amsterdam with american paper of all sorts and to sell it at any price was a probable one and the more so as we know that the particular individuals who were engaged in that speculation possess no means of their own adequate to the payments they would have had to make while we must not doubt that these motives together with a proper regard for the credit of the united states had real and full weight with our bankers towards inducing them to counterwork these private speculations yet to ascribe their industry in this business wholly to these motives might lead to a too great and dangerous confidence in them it was obviously their interest to defeat all such speculations because they tended to take out of their hands or at least to divide with them the profits of the great operation of transferring the french debt to amsterdam an object of firstrate magnitude to them and on the undivided enjoyments of which they might count if private speculators could be baffled it has been a contest of dexterity and cunning in which our champions have obtained the victory the manœuvre of opening a loan of three millions of florins has on the whole been useful to the united states and though unauthorized i think should be confirmed the measure proposed by the secretary of the treasury of sending a superintendent of their future operations will effectually prevent their doing the like again and the funding laws leave no danger that such an expedient might at any future time be useful to us     the report of the secretary of the treasury and the draught of instructions present this plan to view first to borrow on the best terms we can not exceeding those limited by the law such a sum as may answer all demands of principal or interest of the foreign debts due or to become due before the end of      this i think he supposes will be about three and a half millions of dollars second to consider two of the three millions of florins already borrowed by our bankers as so far an execution of this operation consequently there will remain but about two and a half millions of dollars to be borrowed on the old terms third to borrow no more as yet towards completing the transfer of the french debt to amsterdam unless we can do it on more advantageous terms fourth to consider the third million of florins already borrowed by our bankers as so far an execution of the powers given the president to borrow two millions of dollars by the act of the   th of august the whole of this appears to me to be wise if the third million be employed in buying up our foreign paper on the exchange of amsterdam by creating a demand for that species of paper it will excite a cupidity in the monied men to obtain more of it by new loans and consequently enable us to borrow more and on lower terms the saving of interest too on the sum so to be bought may be applied in buying up more principal and thereby keep this salutary operation going i would only take the liberty of suggesting the insertion of some such clause as the following into     the instructions the agents to be employed shall never open a loan for more than one million of dollars at a time nor open a new loan till the preceding one has been filled and expressly approved by the president of the united states a new man alighting on the exchange of amsterdam with powers to borrow twelve millions of dollars will be immediately beset with bankers and brokers who will pour into his ear from the most unsuspected quarters such informations and suspicions as may lead him exactly into their snares so wonderfully dexterous are they in wrapping up and complicating their propositions they will make it evident even to a clearheaded man not in the habit of this business that two and two make five the agent therefore should be guarded even against himself by putting it out of his power to extend the effect of any erroneous calculation beyond one million of dollars were he able under a delusive calculation to commit such a sum as twelve millions of dollars what would be said of the government our bankers told me themselves that they would not choose in the conduct of this great loan to open for more than two or three millions of florins at a time and certainly never for more than five by contracting for only one million of dollars at a time the agent will have frequent occasions of trying to better the terms i dare say that this caution though not expressed in the instructions is intended by the secretary of the treasury to be carried into their execution but perhaps it will be desirable for the president that his sense of it also should be expressed in writing     thomas jefferson august       0 new york william short to the u s chargé daffaires in france william short s p new york august       0 dear sir —my last letters to you have been of the   th of july and  0th instant yours of may the   th no    has come to hand i enclose you sundry papers by which you will perceive that the expression in the eleventh article of our treaty of amity and commerce with france viz that the subjects of the united states shall not be reputed aubaines in france and consequently shall be exempted from the droit daubaine or other similar duty under what name soever has been construed so rigorously to the letter as to consider us as aubaines in the colonies of france our intercourse with those colonies is so great that frequent and important losses will accrue to individuals if this construction be continued the death of the master or supercargo of a vessel rendered a more common event by the unhealthiness of the climate throws all the property which was either his or under his care into contest i presume that the enlightened assembly now engaged in reforming the remains of feudal abuse among them will not leave so inhospitable an one as the droit daubaine existing in france or any of its dominions if this may be hoped it will be better that you should not trouble the minister with any application for its abolition in the colonies as to us this would be erecting into a special favor to us the extinction of a general abuse which will i presume extinguish of itself only be so good as to see that in abolishing this     odious law in france its abolition in the colonies also be not omitted by mere oversight but if contrary to expectations this fragment of barbarism be suffered to remain then it will become necessary that you bring forward the enclosed case and press a liberal and just exposition of our treaty so as to relieve our citizens from this species of risk and ruin hereafter supposing the matter to rest on the eleventh article only it is inconceivable that he who with respect to his personal goods is as a native citizen in the mother country should be deemed a foreigner in its colonies accordingly you will perceive by the opinions of dr franklin and dr lee two of our ministers who negotiated and signed the treaty that they considered the rights stipulated for us in france were meant to exist in all the dominions of france considering this question under the second article of the treaty also we are exempted from the droit daubaine in all the dominions of france for by that article no particular favor is to be granted to any other nation which shall not immediately become common to the other party now by the fortyfourth article of the treaty between france and england which was subsequent to ours it is stipulated que dans tout ce qui concerne—les successions des biens mobiliers—les sujets des deux hautes parties contractantes auront dans les états respectifs les mêmes privileges libertés et droits que la nation la plus favorisée this gave to the english the general abolition of the droit daubaine enjoyed by the hollanders under the first article of their     treaty with france of july the   d      which is in these words les sujets des e g des p u des paysbas ne seront point assujettis au droit daubaine dans les états de s m t c this favor then being granted to the english subsequent to our treaty we become entitled to it of course by the article in question i have it not in my power at this moment to turn to the treaty between france and russia which was also posterior to ours if by that the russians are exempted from the droit daubaine dans les états de s m t c it is a ground the more for our claiming the exemption to these you will be pleased to add such other considerations of reason friendship hospitality and reciprocity as will readily occur to yourself about two or three weeks ago a mr campbell called on me and introduced himself by observing that his situation was an awkward one that he had come from denmark with an assurance of being employed here in a public character that he was actually in service though unannounced he repeated conversations which had passed between count bernstorff and him and asked me when a minister would be appointed to that court or a character sent to negotiate a treaty of commerce he had not the scrip of a pen to authenticate himself however informally i told him our government had not yet had time to settle a plan of foreign arrangements that with respect to denmark particularly i might safely express to him those sentiments of friendship which our government entertained for that country and assurances that the kings subjects would     always meet with favor and protection here and in general i said to him those things which being true might be said to anybody you can perhaps learn something of him from the baron de blome if he be an unauthorized man it would be well it should be known here as the respect which our citizens might entertain and the credit they might give to any person supposed to be honored by the kings appointment might lead them into embarrassment you know the situation of the new loan of three millions of florins going on at amsterdam about one half of this is destined for an immediate payment to france but advantage may be gained by judiciously timing the payment the french colonies will doubtless claim in their new constitution a right to receive the necessaries of life from whomsoever will deliver them cheapest to wit grain flour live stock salted fish and other salted provisions it would be well that you should confer with their deputies guardedly and urge them to this demand if they need urging the justice of the national assembly will probably dispose them to grant it and the clamors of the bordeaux merchants may be silenced by the clamors and arms of the colonies it may cooperate with the influence of the colonies if favorable dispositions towards us can be excited in the moment of discussing this point it will therefore be left to you to say when the payment shall be made in confidence that you will so time it as to forward this great object and when you make this payment you may increase its effect by adding assurances to the minister that measures     have been taken which will enable us to pay up within a very short time all arrears of principal and interest now due and further that congress has fully authorized our government to go on and pay even the balance not yet due which we mean to do if that money can be borrowed on reasonable terms and that favorable arrangements of commerce between us and their colonies might dispose us to effect that payment with less regard to terms you will of course find excuses for not paying the money which is ready and put under your orders till you see that the moment has arrived when the emotions it may excite may give a decisive cast to the demands of the colonies thomas jefferson aug       0 new york henry knox to the secretary of war henry knox j mss new york aug       0 dear sir —on the hasty view which the shortness of time permits me to take of the treaty of hopewell the act of cession of n carolina  the act of acceptance by congress i hazard the following sentiments were the treaty of hopewell and the act of acceptance of congress to stand in any point in direct opposition to each other i should consider the act of acceptance as void in that point because the treaty is a law made by two parties and not revocable by one of the parties either acting alone or in conjunction with a third party if we consider the acceptance as a legislative act of congress it   0 is the act of one party only if we consider it as a treaty between congress  n carolina it is but a subsequent treaty with another power  cannot make void a preceding one with a different power but i see no such opposition between these two instruments the cherokees were entitled to the sole occupation of the lands within the limits guaranteed to them the state of north carolina according to the jus gentium established for america by universal usage had only a right of preemption of these lands against all other nations it could convey then to its citizens only this right of preemption and the right of occupation could not be united to it until obtained by the u s from the cherokees the act of cession of n carolina only preserves the rights of its citizens in the same state as they would have been had that act never been passed it does not make imperfect titles perfect but only prevents their being made worse congress by their act accept on these conditions the claimants of n c then and also the cherokees are exactly where they would have been had neither the act of cession nor that of acceptance been ever made that is the latter possess the right of occupation  the former the right of preemption tho these deductions seem clear enough yet the question would be a disagreeable one between the general government a particular government  individuals and it would seem very desireable to draw all the claims of preemption within a certain limit by commuting for those out of it and then to purchase of the cherokees the right of occupation     thomas jefferson aug        george washington opinion on course of united states towards great britain and spain  aug       0 opinion upon the question what the answer of the president should be in case lord dorchester should apply for permission to march troops through the territory of the united states from detroit to the mississippi i am so deeply impressed with the magnitude of the dangers which will attend our government if louisiana and the floridas be added to the british empire that in my opinion we ought to make ourselves parties in the general war expected to take place should this be the only means of preventing the calamity but i think we should defer this step as long as     possible because war is full of chances which may relieve us from the necessity of interfering and if necessary still the later we interfere the better we shall be prepared it is often indeed more easy to prevent the capture of a place than to retake it should it be so in the case in question the difference between the two operations of preventing and retaking will not be so costly as two three or four years more of war so that i am for preserving neutrality as long and entering into the war as late as possible if this be the best course it decides in a good degree what should be our conduct if the british ask leave to march troops through our territory or march them without leave it is well enough agreed in the laws of nations that for a neutral power to give or refuse permission to the troops of either belligerent party to pass through their territory is no breach of neutrality provided the same refusal or permission be extended to the other party if we give leave of passage then to the british troops spain will have no just cause of complaint against us provided we extend the same leave to her when demanded if we refuse as indeed we have a right to do and the troops should pass notwithstanding of which there can be little doubt we shall stand committed for either we must enter immediately into the war or pocket an acknowledged insult in the face of the world and one insult pocketed soon produces another     there is indeed a middle course which i should be inclined to prefer that is to avoid giving any answer they will proceed notwithstanding but to do this under our silence will admit of palliation and produce apologies from military necessity and will leave us free to pass it over without dishonor or to make it a handle of quarrel hereafter if we should have use for it as such but if we are obliged to give an answer i think the occasion not such as should induce us to hazard that answer which might commit us to the war at so early a stage of it and therefore that the passage should be permitted if they should pass without having asked leave i should be for expressing our dissatisfaction to the british court and keeping alive an altercation on the subject till events should decide whether it is most expedient to accept their apologies or profit of the aggression as a cause of war thomas jefferson august       0 opinion on st clair expedition j mss august       0 opinion on the question whether it will be expedient to notify to lord dorchester the real object of the expedition preparing by governor st clair on considering more fully the question whether it will be expedient to notify to lord dorchester the real object of the expedition preparing by governor st clair i still think it will not be expedient for if the notification be early he will get the indians out of the way and defeat our object if it be so late as not to leave him time to withdraw them     before our stroke be struck it will then be so late also as not to leave him time to withdraw any secret aids he may have sent them and the notification will betray to him that he may go on without fear in his expedition against the spaniards and for which he may yet have sufficient time after our expedition is over on the other hand if he should suspect our preparations are to prevent his passing our territory these suspicions may induce him to decline his expedition as even should he think he could either force or steal a passage he would not divide his troops leaving as he would suppose an enemy between them able to take those he should leave and cut off the return of those he should carry these suspicions too would mislead both him and the indians and so enable us to take the latter more completely by surprise and prevent him from sending secret aid to those whom he would not suppose the objects of the enterprise thus effecting a double purpose of preventing his enterprise and securing our own might it not even be expedient with a view to deter his enterprise to instruct governor st clair either to continue his pursuit of the indians till the season be too far advanced for lord dorchester to move or on disbanding his militia to give them general orders which might reach the ears of lord dorchester to be ready to assemble at a moments warning though no such assembly be really intended always taking care neither to say nor do against their passage what might directly commit either our peace or honor     thomas jefferson aug       0 new york alexander

their prices in order to furnish me with a bill of exchange sufficient to cover the costs  charges in the multiplicity of his business before his departure he has forgot to do this and it remains that we do not permit him to be disappointed of his wine by this omission but how to do it for the amount of the whole i suppose will be  000 and the being obliged to set up a house in new york then to abandon it  remove here has really put me out of condition to advance such a sum here i think however it can be done without incommoding you by your drawing on the bankers in amsterdam on the

without any special mention in the public accounts i will make any necessary explanations at the treasury should any be necessary i write for wines for my own use at the same time these will amount to about   0 livres i have sent out to seek for a bill of exchange to that amount if it can be got today i will inclose it herein if not i will charge the person with whom i leave the present letter not to send it off till he has got such a bill and to inclose one herewith and forward a duplicate by some other opportunity i leave the letter to     fenwick open to the end that you may see the

here my several letters private will have left me little to add on the subject of your stay in europe one circumstance only in your letters must be corrected that is your idea of my influence in the foreign affairs you have forgotten your countrymen altogether as well as the nature of our government which renders its heads too responsible to permit them to resign the direction of affairs to those under them the public would not be satisfied with that kind of resignation  be assured it does not exist  consequently that your     destination does not depend on me i think it possible that it will be established into a maxim of the new government to discontinue its foreign servants after a certain time of absence from their own country because they lose in time that sufficient degree of intimacy with its circumstances which alone can enable them to know  pursue its interests seven years have been talked of be assured it is for your happiness  success to return every day increases your attachment to europe  renders your future reconcilement to your own country more desperate and you must run the career of public office here if you mean to stand on high  firm ground hereafter were you here now you would be put into the senate of congress in the place of grayson whose successor is to be chosen next month for the late appointment was only for the fragment of his time which remained there would scarcely be a dissenting vote to your appointment but it is too late for that monroe will be pressed into the service really against his will but two years hence will come on another election in the place of r h l who will unquestionably be dropped if you were to be here a few months before i would forfeit every thing if you were not elected it will be for   years and is the most honorable  independent station in our government one where you can peculiarly raise yourself in the public estimation i cannot then but recommend it to you to have this in your view i do not exactly see to what your late mission to amsterdam may lead either to nothing or something infirm and by which you ought not to suffer yourself to be     led on to the loss of an appointment here which will not recur for years  never under such certainty your compeer in a neighboring kingdom is a proof of the necessity of refreshing his acquaintance with his own country and will do wisely if he does as bourgoin announced to you i know not what to do in the case of tolozon  baqueville  indeed i can do nothing till i see the president they must not lose their perquisite it is a part of their livelihood but i think that delicacy should yield to the inflexibility of our constitution assure them of my friendly recollection of their attentions and my resolution that some how or other they must accept the usual present i will write further after having consulted the president whom i shall not see however till december the house at paris will certainly not be taken by the public for the use of their legation you will have seen that by the new arrangement that article will be at their own charge very possibly and very probaably my successor may take it be that as it may i have nothing to do with it after the expiration of six months from the day of the notification it is well known to m de langeac and to m perrier the notary that the notification i had given of determining the lease was to be void and the lease to go on as if nothing had happened except as to the single circumstance of an abatement of the rent which was therefore provided by a kind of marginal note and no new lease they may call it prorogation or what they please—no new commencement was meant besides if it had been an absolutely new lease i was   0 not obliged to keep it one day i had exactly the same kind of lease with the same condition from gueraud for the house in tetebout i entered it oct         and determined the lease march  0      by a notification given sep  0      gueraud was sufficiently litigious  desirous to continue the lease but knew he could not the objection too that it must be given up at no other time but the beginning of a term is contrary to the express letter of the lease i gave up guerauds house the  0th of march  my notification to the count de langeac in oct      was that his lease should finish apr         both admitted my right to do so  accepted the notification if langeac  his notary perrier for i trusted to his notary because he had a candid appearance have used words of a contrary import it is one of those cheats against which the diplomatic indemnities were meant to be a protection foreign ministers are not bound to an acquaintance with the laws of the land they are priviledged by their ignorance of them they are bound by the laws of natural justice only these are in my favor be the laws of the land  its forms what they will i shall fulfil substantially my real engagement with the count de langeac and will certainly disregard the snares of formality in which they meant to take me give up the house at all events on the day six months from the notification—i am really sorry petit does not come i am sure he will be disappointed in the expectation of employment from my successor besides that it will be some time in the next year before he can go should he be a married man as     all americans are his wife will not employ a maitre dhotel who cannot speak english if she employs one at all i still wish him to come if he will not i think madme de corny when she reformed her house parted with her maitre dhotel and with great reluctance and that she speaks of him to me in very high terms i wish you would enquire about him and barely sound him to see if he will come on moderate wages  having his passage paid but do not

when it found me on my way to virginia it should not otherwise have been so long unanswered i am certainly flattered by the approbation you are so good as to express of the notes on virginia the passage relative to the english which has excited disagreeable sensations in your mind is accounted for by observing that it was written during the war while they were committing depredations in my own country and on my own property never practised by a civilized nation perhaps their conduct and dispositions towards us since the war have not been as well calculated as they might have been to excite more favorable dispositions on our part still as a political man they shall never find any passion in me either for or against them whenever their avarice of commerce will let them meet us fairly half way i should meet them with satisfaction because     it would be for our benefit but i mistake their character if they do this under present circumstances the rumours of war seem to pass away such an event might have produced to us some advantages but it might also have exposed us to dangers and on the whole i think a general peace more desireable be so good as to present my respects

an intermediate one which has never come to hand and the letter of july   itself was not received till the   th of october while i was in virginia from which i am but just returned the president is not yet returned tho expected tomorrow the declaration  counterdeclaration established with us a full expectation that peace would be continued perhaps this is still the most rational opinion tho the english papers continue to talk of preparations for war that such an event would have ensured good prices for our produce and so far have been advantageous is probable but it would have exposed us to risks also which are better deferred for some years at least it is not to be expected that our system of     finance has met your approbation in all its parts it has excited even here great opposition and more especially that part of it which transferred the state debts to the general government the states of virginia  n carolina are peculiarly dissatisfied with this measure i believe however that it is harped on by many to mask their disaffection to the government on other grounds its great foe in virginia is an implacable one  he avows it himself but does not avow all his motives for it the measures and tone of the government threaten abortion to some of his speculations most particularly to that of the yazoo territory but it is too well nerved to be overawed by individual opposition it is proposed to provide additional funds to meet the additional debt by a tax on spirituous liquors foreign and homemade so that the whole interest will be paid by taxes on consumption if a sufficiency can now be raised in this way to pay the interest at present its increase by the increase of population suppose   per cent per annum will alone sink the principle within a few years operating as it will in the way of compound interest add to this what may be done by throwing in the aid of western lands  other articles as a sinking fund and our prospect is really a bright one a pretty important

referred to in his letter accompanying it i therefore take the liberty of proposing to you to give you a complete copy of the same map or the price of it in exchange for the remaining sheets to which the one in our possession belonged i am in the hopes you will continue in the mind of publishing dr franklins works in  vo otherwise i think you will find few purchasers till the irish printers by a

hundred square miles in any form to be located by metes and bounds three commissioners to be appointed i suppose them not entitled to any salary if they live near the place they may in some instances be influenced by self interest and partialities but they will push the work with zeal if they are from a distance and northwardly they will be more impartial but may affect delays the commissioners to purchase or accept such quantity of land on the east side of the river as the president shall deem proper for the united states viz for the federal capitol the offices the presidents house and gardens the town house market house public walks and hospital for the presidents house offices and gardens i should think two squares should be consolidated for the capitol and offices one square for the market one square for the public walks nine squares consolidated the expression such quantity of land as the president shall deem proper for the united states is vague it may therefore be extended to the acceptance     or purchase of land enough for the town and i have no doubt it is the wish and perhaps expectation in that case it will be to be laid out in lots and streets i should propose these to be at right angles as in philadelphia and that no street be narrower than one hundred feet with foot ways of fifteen feet where a street is long and level it might be one hundred and twenty feet wide i should prefer squares of at least two hundred yards every way which will be about eight acres each the commissioners should have some taste in architecture because they may have to decide between different plans they will however be subject to the presidents direction in every point when the president shall have made up his mind as to the spot for the town would there be any impropriety in his saying to the neighboring land holders i will fix the town here if you will join and purchase and give the lands they may well afford it by the increase of value it will give to their own circumjacent lands the lots to be sold out in breadths of fifty feet their depths to extend to the diagonal of the square i doubt much whether the obligation to build the houses at a given distance from the street contributes to its beauty it produces a disgusting monotony all persons make this complaint against philadelphia the contrary practice varies the appearance and is much more convenient to the inhabitants in paris it is forbidden to build a house beyond a     given height and it is admitted to be a good restriction it keeps down the price of ground keeps the houses low and convenient and the streets light and airy fires are much more manageable where houses are low thomas jefferson dec      0 philadelphia noah webster to noah webster j mss philadelphia dec      0 sir

for that intended for myself be pleased to accept my thanks i return you the order on mr allen that on dobson having been made use of instead of it i submit to your consideration whether it might not be advisable to record a second time your right to the grammatical institutes in order to bring the lodging of the copy in my office within the   months made a condition in the law i have not at this moment an opportunity of turning to the law to see if that may be done but i suppose it possible that the failure to fulfil the legal condition on the first record might excite objections against the validity of that in mentioning me in your essays  and canvassing my opinions you have done what every man has a right to do and it is for the good of society that that right should be freely exercised no republic is     more real than that of letters and i am the last in principles as i am the least in pretensions to any dictatorship in it had i other dispositions the philosophical  dispassionate spirit with which you have expressed your own opinions in opposition to mine would still have commanded my approbation a desire of being set right in your opinion which i respect too much not to entertain that desire induces me to hazard to you the following observations it had become an universal and almost uncontroverted position in the several states that the purposes of society do not require a surrender of all our rights to our ordinary governors that there are certain portions of right not necessary to enable them to carry on an effective government  which experience has nevertheless proved they will be constantly encroaching on if submitted to them that there are also certain fences which experience has proved peculiarly efficacious against wrong and rarely obstructive of right which yet the governing powers have ever shown a disposition to weaken and remove of the first kind for instance is freedom of religion of the second trial by jury habeas corpus laws free presses these were the settled opinions of all the states of that of virginia of which i was writing as well as of the others the others had in consequence delineated these unceded portions of right and these fences against wrong which they meant to exempt from the power of their governors in instruments called declarations of rights  constitutions and as they did this by conventions which they appointed for the   0 express purpose of reserving these rights and of delegating others to their ordinary legislative executive and judiciary bodies none of the reserved rights can be touched without resorting to the people to appoint another convention for the express purpose of permitting it where the constitutions then have been so formed by conventions named for this express purpose they are fixed  unalterable but by a convention or other body to be specially authorized and they have been so formed by i believe all the states except virginia that state concurs in all these opinions but has run into the wonderful error that her constitution tho made by the ordinary legislature cannot yet be altered by the ordinary legislature i had therefore no occasion to prove to them the expediency of a constitution alterable only by a special convention accordingly i have not in my notes advocated that opinion tho it was  is mine as it was and is theirs i take that position as admitted by them and only proceed to adduce arguments to prove that they were mistaken in supposing their constitution could not be altered by the common legislature among other arguments i urge that the convention which formed the constitution had been chosen merely for ordinary legislation that they had no higher power than every subsequent legislature was to have that all their acts are consequently repealable by subsequent legislatures that their own practice at a subsequent session proved they were of this opinion themselves that the opinion  practice of several subsequent legislatures had been the same and so conclude that their constitution is alterable     by the common legislature yet these arguments urged to prove that their constitution is alterable you cite as if urged to prove that it ought not to be alterable and you combat them on that ground an argument which is good to prove one thing may become ridiculous when exhibited as intended to prove another thing i will beg the favor of you to look over again the passage in my notes and am persuaded you will be sensible that you have misapprehended the object of my arguments and therefore have combated them on a ground for which they were not intended my only object in this is the rectification of your own opinion of me which i repeat that i respect too much to neglect i have certainly no view of entering into the contest whether it be expedient to delegate unlimited powers to our ordinary governors my opinion is against that expediency but my occupations do not permit me to undertake to vindicate all my opinions nor have they importance enough to merit it it cannot however but weaken my confidence in them when i find them opposed to yours there being no one who respects the latter more than sir

granted both before and after      by authority from the commandant of the post who according to the usage under the french and british governments thinking himself authorized to grant lands delegated that authority to a court of civil and criminal jurisdiction whose grants before      amount to twentysix thousand acres and between that and      when the practice was stopped to twentytwo thousand acres they are generally in parcels from four hundred acres down to the size of house lots and some of them under considerable improvement some of the tenants urge that they were induced by the court itself to come and settle these lands under assurance of their authority to grant them and that a loss of the lands and improvements will involve them in ruin besides these small grants there are some much larger sometimes of many leagues square which a sense of their impropriety has prevented the grantees from bringing forward many pretended grants too of this class are believed to be forgeries

northwestern territory thinks it his duty to extract therefrom for the notice of the president of the united states the articles of april   th june  th   th and   th some of which are hereto annexed conceiving that the regulations purported in these articles are beyond the competence of the executive of the said government that they amount in fact to laws and as such could only flow from its regular legislature that it is the duty of the general government to guard its subordinate members from the encroachments of each other even when they are made through error or inadvertence and to cover its citizens from the exercise of powers not authorized by the law the secretary of state is of opinion that the said articles be laid before the attorney general for consideration and if he

j mss december       0 report on certain letters from the president to mr gouverneur morris and from mr morris to the president relative to our difficulties with england—   0 the secretary of state

th may  st   th july  d august   th and september   th referred to him by the president makes the following report thereon the presidents letter of january   d authorized mr morris to enter into conference with the british ministers in order to discover their sentiments on the following subjects   their retention of the western posts contrary to the treaty of peace   indemnification for the negroes carried off against the stipulations of the same treaty   a treaty for the regulation of the commerce between the two countries   the exchange of a minister the letters of mr morris before mentioned state the communications oral and written which have     passed between him and the ministers and from these the secretary of state draws the following inferences   that the british court is decided not to surrender the post in any event and that they will urge as a pretext that though our courts of justice are now open to british subjects they were so long shut after the peace as to have defeated irremedially the recovery of debts in many cases they suggest indeed the idea of an indemnification on our part but probably were we disposed to admit their right to indemnification they would take care to set it so high as to insure a disagreement   that as to indemnification for the negroes their measures for concealing them were in the first instance so efficacious as to reduce our demand for them so far as we can support it by direct proof to be very small indeed its smallness seems to have kept it out of discussion were other difficulties removed they would probably make none of this article   that they equivocate on every proposal of a treaty of commerce and authorize in their communications with mr morris the same conclusions which have been drawn from those they had had from time to time with mr adams and those through major beckwith to wit that they do not mean to submit their present advantages in commerce to the risk which might attend a discussion of them whereon some reciprocity could not fail to be demanded unless indeed we would agree to make it a treaty of alliance as well as commerce so as to undermine     our obligations with france this method of stripping that rival nation of its alliances they tried successfully with holland endeavored at it with spain and have plainly and repeatedly suggested to us for this they would probably relax some of the rigors they exercise against our commerce   that as to a minister their secretary for foreign affairs is disposed to exchange one but meets with opposition in his cabinet so as to render the issue uncertain from the whole of which the secretary of state is of opinion that mr morris letters remove any doubts which might have been entertained as to the intentions and dispositions of the british cabinet that it would be dishonorable to the the united states useless and even injurious to renew the propositions for a treaty of commerce or for the exchange of a minister and that these subjects should now remain dormant till they shall be brought forward earnestly by them that the demands of the posts and of indemnification for the negroes should not be again made till we are in readiness to do ourselves the justice which may be refused that mr morris should be informed that he fulfilled the object of his agency to the satisfaction of the president inasmuch as he has enabled him to judge of the real views of the british cabinet and that it is his pleasure that the matters committed to him be left in the situation in which the letter shall find them that a proper compensation be given to mr   0 morris for his services herein which having been begun on the   d of january and ended the   th of september comprehended a space of near eight months that the allowance to an agent may be properly fixed anywhere between the half and the whole of what is allowed to a chargé daffaires which according to the establishment of the united states at the time of this appointment was at the rate of  000 a year consequently that such a sum of between one and two thousand dollars be allowed him as the president shall deem proper on a view of the interference which this agency may have had

informed of the receipt of my letter covering your commission as consul for the united states in the port of london yet knowing that the ship has arrived by which it went i take for granted the letter and commission have gone safe to hand and that you have been called into the frequent exercise of your office for the relief of our seamen upon whom such multiplied acts of violence have been committed in england by pressgangs pretending to take them for british subjects not only without evidence but against evidence by what means may be procured for our seamen while in british ports that security for their persons     which the laws of hospitality require and which the british nation will surely not refuse remains to be settled in the meantime there is one of these cases wherein so wilful and so flagrant a violation has been committed by a british officer on the person of one of our citizens as requires that it be laid before his government in friendly and firm reliance of satisfaction for the injury and of assurance for the future that the citizens of the united states entering the ports of great britain in pursuit of a lawful commerce shall be protected by the laws of hospitality in usage among nations it is represented to the president of the united states that hugh purdie a native of williamsburg in virginia was in the month of july last seized in london by a party of men calling themselves pressofficers and pretending authority from their government to do so notwithstanding his declarations and the evidence he offered of his being a native citizen of the united states and that he was transferred on board the crescent a british ship of war commanded by a captain young passing over the intermediate violences exercised on him because not peculiar to his case so many other american citizens having suffered the same i proceed to the particular one which distinguishes the present representation satisfactory evidence having been produced by mr john brown cutting a citizen of the united states to the lords of the admiralty that hugh purdie was a native citizen of the same states they in their justice issued orders to the lord howe their admiral for his discharge in the meantime the     lord howe had sailed with the fleet of which the crescent was but on the   th of august he wrote to the board of admiralty that he had received their orders for the discharge of hugh purdie and had directed it accordingly notwithstanding these orders the receipt of which at sea captain young acknowledges notwithstanding captain youngs confessed knowledge that hugh purdie was a citizen of the united states from whence it resulted that his being carried on board the crescent and so long detained there had been an act of wrong which called for expiatory conduct and attentions rather than new injuries on his part towards the sufferer instead of discharging him according to the orders he had received on his arrival in port which was on the   th of september he on the   th confined him in irons for several hours then had him bound and scourged in presence of the ships crew under a threat to the executioner that if he did not do his duty well he should take the place of the sufferer at length he discharged him on the   th without the means of subsistence for a single day to establish these facts i enclose you copies of papers communicated to me by mr cutting who laid the case of purdie before the board of admiralty and who can corroborate them by his personal evidence he can especially verify the letter of captain young were it necessary to verify a paper the original of which is under the command of his majestys ministers and this paper is so material as to supersede of itself all other testimony confessing the orders to discharge purdie that yet he had whipped him and     that it was impossible without giving up all sense of discipline to avoid whipping a free american citizen we have such confidence in the justice of the british government in their friendly regard to these states in their respect for the honor and good understanding of the two countries compromitted by this act of their officer as not to doubt their due notice of him indemnification to the sufferer and a friendly assurance to these states that effectual measures shall be adopted in future to protect the persons of their citizens while in british ports by the express command of the president of the united states you are to lay this case and our sense of it before his britannic majestys minister for foreign affairs to urge it on his particular

i came into office i found the clerkships all filled by gentlemen who had been in them several years and who to the title of possession added that of irreproachable conduct i have therefore not had a single appointment to make this answer has been given to near an hundred letters which i have had to write in reply to applications of this nature i wish with all my soul i could have obliged my friends on this occasion     thomas jefferson jan         hamilton report on tonnage law  j mss jan         the secretary of state having received from the chargé des affaires of france a note on the tonnage     payable by french vessels in the ports of the united states has had the same under his consideration and thereupon makes the following report to the president of the united states the chargé des affaires of france by a note of the   th of december represents by order of his court that they consider so much of the acts of congress of july  0th      and    0 as imposes an extraordinary tonnage on foreign vessels without excepting those of france to be in contravention of the  th article of the treaty of amity and commerce between the two nations that this would have authorised on their part a proportional modification in the favours granted to the american navigation but that his sovereign had thought it more conformable to his principles of friendship and attachment to the united states to order him to make representations thereon and to ask in favour of french vessels a modification of the acts which impose an extraordinary tonnage on foreign vessels the secretary of state in giving this paper to the president of the united states thinks it his duty to accompany it with the following observations the  d and  th articles of the treaty of amity     and commerce between france and the united states subject the vessels of each nation to pay in the ports of the other only such duties as are paid by the most favoured nation and give them reciprocally all the privileges and exemptions in navigation and commerce which are given by either to the most favoured nations had the contracting parties stopped here they would have been free to raise or lower their tonnage as they should find it expedient only taking care to keep the other on the footing of the most favoured nation the question then is whether the  th article cited in the note is anything more than an application of the principle comprised in the  d and  th to a particular object or whether it is an additional stipulation of something not so comprised i that it is merely an application of a principle comprised in the preceding articles is declared by the express words of the article to wit dans lexemption cidessus est nommément compris c in the above exemption is particularly comprised the imposition of  00 sols per ton established in france on foreign vessels here then is at once an express declaration that the exemption from the duty of  00 sols is comprised in the  d and  th articles that is to say it was one of the exemptions enjoyed by the most favoured nations and as such extended to us by those articles if the exemption spoken of in this  st member of the  th article was comprised in the  d and  th articles as is expressly declared then the reservation by france out of that exemption which makes the  d member of the same     article was also comprised that is to say if the whole was comprised the part was comprised and if this reservation of france in the  d member was comprised in the  d and  th articles then the counter reservation by the united states which constitutes the  d and last member of the same article was also comprised because it is but a corresponding portion of a similar whole on our part which had been comprised by the same terms with theirs in short the whole article relates to a particular duty of  00 sols laid by some antecedent law of france on the vessels of foreign nations relinquished as to the most favoured and consequently to us it is not a new and additional stipulation then but a declared application of the stipulations comprised in the preceding articles to a particular case by way of greater caution the doctrine laid down generally in the  d and  th articles and exemplified specially in the  th amounts to this the vessels of the most favoured nations coming from foreign ports are exempted from the duty of  00 sols therefore you are exempted from it by the  d and  th articles the vessels of the most favoured nations coming coastwise pay that duty therefore you are to pay it by the  d and  th articles we shall not think it unfriendly in you to lay a like duty on coasters because it will be no more than we have done ourselves you are free also to lay that or any other duty on vessels coming from foreign ports provided they apply to all other nations even the most favoured we are free to do the same under the same restriction     our exempting you from a duty which the most favoured nations do not pay does not exempt you from one which they do pay in this view it is evident that the  th article neither enlarges nor abridges the stipulations of the  d and  th the effect of the treaty would have been precisely the same had it been omitted altogether consequently it may be truly said that the reservation by the united states in this article is completely useless and it may be added with equal truth that the equivalent reservation by france is completely useless as well as her previous abandonment of the same duty and in short the whole article each party then remains free to raise or lower its tonnage provided the change operates on all nations even the most favoured without undertaking to affirm we may obviously conjecture that this article has been inserted on the part of the united states from an overcaution to guard nommément by name against a particular aggrievance which they thought they could never be too well secured against and that has happened which generally happens doubts have been produced by the two great number of words used to prevent doubt ii the court of france however understands this article as intended to introduce something to which the preceding articles had not reached and not merely as an application of them to a particular case their opinion seems to be founded on the general rule in the construction of instruments to leave no words merely useless for which any rational   0 meaning can be found they say that the reservation by the united states of a right to lay a duty equivalent to that of the  00 sols reserved by france would have been completely useless if they were not left free by the preceding articles to lay a tonnage to any extent whatever consequently that the reservation of a part proves a relinquishment of the residue if some meaning and such a one is to be given to the last member of the article some meaning and a similar one must be given to the corresponding member if the reservation by the united states of a right to lay an equivalent duty implies a relinquishment of their right to lay any other the reservation by france of a right to continue the specified duty to which it is an equivalent must imply a relinquishment of the right on her part to lay or continue any other equivalent reservations by both must imply equivalent restrictions on both the exact reciprocity stipulated in the preceding articles and which pervades every part of the treaty insures a counterright to each party for every right ceded to the other let it be further considered that the duty called tonnage in the united states is in lieu of the duties for anchorage for the support of bouys beacons and lighthouses to guide the mariner into harbour and along the coast which are provided and supported at the expence of the united states and for fees to measurers weighers gaugers c who are paid by the united states for which articles among many others light excepted duties are paid by us     in the ports of france under their specific names the government has hitherto thought these duties consistent with the treaty and consequently the same duties under a general instead of specific names with us must be equally consistent with it it is not the name but the thing which is essential if we have renounced the right to lay any port duties they must be understood to have equally renounced that of either laying new or continuing the old if we ought to refund the port duties received from their vessels since the date of the act of congress they should refund the port duties they have received from our vessels since the date of the treaty for nothing short of this is the reciprocity of the treaty if this construction be adopted then each party has forever renounced the right of laying any duties on the vessels of the other coming from any foreign port or more than  00 sols on those coming coastwise could this relinquishment be confined to the two contracting parties alone the united states would be the gainers for it is well known that a much  greater number of american than of french vessels are employed in the commerce between the two countries but the exemption once conceded by the one nation to the other becomes immediately the property of all others who are on the footing of the most favoured nations it is true that those others would be obliged to yield the same     compensation that is to say to receive our vessels duty free whether we should gain or lose in the exchange of the measure with them is not easy to say another consequence of this construction will be that the vessels of the most favoured nations paying no duties will be on a better footing than those of nations which pay a moderate duty consequently either the duty on these also must be given up or they will be supplanted by foreign vessels in our own ports the resource then of duty on vessels for the purposes either of revenue or regulation will be forever lost to both it is hardly conceivable that either party looking forward to all these consequences would see their interest in them iii but if france persists in claiming this exemption what is to be done the claim indeed is couched in mild and friendly terms but the idea leaks out that a refusal would authorize them to modify proportionally the favours granted by the same article to our navigation perhaps they may do what we should feel much more severely they may turn their eyes to the favours granted us by their arrets of december   th      and december  th      which hang on their will alone unconnected with the treaty those arrets among other advantages admit our whale oils to the exclusion of that of all other foreigners and this monopoly procures a vent for seven twelfths of the produce of that fishery which experience has taught us could find no other market near two thirds of the produce of our cod fisheries too have lately     found a free vent in the colonies of france  this indeed has been an irregularity growing out of the anarchy reigning in those colonies yet the demands of the colonists even of the government party among them if an auxiliary disposition can be excited by some marks of friendship and distinction on our part may perhaps produce a constitutional concession to them to procure their provisions at the cheapest market that is to say at ours considering the value of the interests we have at stake and considering the smallness of difference between foreign and native tonnage on french vessels alone it might perhaps be thought advisable to make the sacrifice asked and especially if it can be so done as to give no title to other the most favoured nations to claim it if the act should put french vessels on the footing of those of natives and declare it to be in consideration of the favours granted us by the arrets of decr   th      and december  th      and perhaps this would satisfy them no nation could then demand the same     favour without offering an equivalent compensation it might strengthen too the tenure by which those arrets are held which must be precarious so long as they are gratuitous it is desirable in many instances to exchange mutual advantages by legislative acts rather than by treaty because the former though understood to be in consideration of each other and therefore greatly respected yet when they become too inconvenient can be dropped at the will of either party whereas stipulations by treaty are forever irrevocable but by joint consent let a change of circumstances render them ever so burthensome   on the whole if it be the opinion that the  st construction is to be insisted on as ours in opposition to the  d urged by the court of france and that no relaxation is to be admitted an answer shall be given to that court defending that construction and explaining in as friendly terms as possible the difficulties opposed to the exemption they claim   if it be the opinion that it is advantageous for us to close with france in her interpretation of a reciprocal and perpetual exemption from tonnage a repeal of so much of the tonnage law will be the answer   if it be thought better to waive rigorous and nice discussions of right and to make the modification an act of friendship and of compensation for favours received the passage of such a bill will then be the answer     thomas

feb        dear sir —i am to make you my acknowledgments for your favor of jan  0  the information from france which it contained it confirmed what i had heard more loosely before and accounts still more recent are to the same effect i look with great anxiety for the firm establishment of the new government in france being perfectly convinced that if it takes place there it will spread sooner or later all over europe on the contrary a check there would retard the revival of liberty in other countries i consider the establishment and success     of their government as necessary to stay up our own and to prevent it from falling back to that kind of halfway house the english constitution it cannot be denied that we have among us a sect who believe that to contain whatever is perfect in human institutions that the members of this sect have many of them names  offices which stand high in the estimation of our countrymen i still rely that the great mass of our community is untainted with these heresies as is its head on this i build my hope that we have not laboured in vain and that our experiment will still prove that men can be governed by reason you have excited my curiosity in saying there is a particular circumstance little attended to which is continually sapping the republicanism of the united states what is it what is said in our country of the fiscal arrangements now going on i really fear their effect when i consider the present temper of the southern states whether these measures be right or wrong abstractedly more attention should be paid to the general opinion however all will pass—the excise will pass—the bank will pass the only corrective of what is corrupt in our present form of government will be the augmentation of the numbers in the lower house so as to get a more agricultural representation which may put that interest above that of the stockjobbers i had no occasion to sound mr madison on your fears expressed in your letter i knew before as possessing his sentiments fully on that subject that his value for you was undiminished i have always     heard him say that though you and he appeared to differ in your systems yet you were in truth nearer together than most persons who were classed under the same appellation you may quiet yourself in the assurance of possessing his complete esteem i have been endeavoring to obtain some little distinction for our useful customers the french but there is a particular interest opposed to it which i fear will prove too strong we shall soon see i will send you a copy of a report i have given in as soon as it is printed i know there is one part of it contrary to your sentiments yet i am not sure you will not become sensible that a change should be slowly preparing certainly whenever i pass your road i shall do myself the pleasure of turning into it our last years experiment however is much in favor of that by newgate thomas jefferson feb        philadelphia robert r livingston to robert

advertisement had better be omitted or any thing else inserted be so good as to make it what you think it should be  understanding that tobo is still low in virginia and the price here for such as mine being from    to  0 virginia money i have concluded to try an     experiment of bringing part of it here  if it suits the market the rest may come also not being able to wait till the order could go through you i have written to mr hylton to send me immediately  0 hhds of it as they are now in want here  the river now opening they will soon have their supply i am in hopes it may come in time to order on the residue if the experiment succeeds however i would not have the shipment of the rest to mr maury delayed on that account as perhaps i may find the bringing it here not to answer the proceeds of these  0 hhds shall be immediately remitted to mr lyle or hanson wheat is here at a french crown tho in truth there is little brought to market i have no doubt it will fall as soon as the farmers come in congress will rise on the  d of march they have passed an excise bill which considering the present circumstances of the union is not without objection and a bill for establishing a bank to which it is objected that they have transcended their powers there are certainly persons in all the departments who are for driving too fast government being founded on opinion the opinion of the public even when it is wrong ought to be respected to a certain degree the prudence of the president is an anchor of safety to us i received mrs lewiss letter of jan    and return her many thanks for it as well as for her kind attention to my daughter who expresses great sensibility for her goodness ps i must pray you to get the contract with ronald completely executed  particularly as to the mortgage of his beverdam lands i observe part of     my cumberland lands advertised for the taxes of      which i mention lest the advertisement should have escaped you thomas jefferson feb         draft for presidents message concerning negotiations with great britain  j mss feb         gentlemen of the senate  of the house of representatives soon after i was called to the administration of the government i found it important to come to an understanding with the court of london on several points interesting to the u s and particularly to know whether they were disposed to enter into arrangements by mutual consent which might fix the commerce between the two nations on principles of reciprocal advantage for this purpose i authorized informal conferences with their ministers and from these i do not infer any disposition on their part to enter into any arrangements merely commercial i have thought it proper to give you this information as it might at some time have influence on matters under your consideration  gentlemen of the senate conceiving that in the possible event of a refusal of justice on the part of gr britain we should stand     less committed should it be made to a private rather than to a public person i employed mr gouv morris who was on the spot  without giving him any definite character to enter informally into the conferences before mentioned for your more particular information i lay before you the instructions i gave him and those parts of his communications wherein the british ministers appear either in conversation or by letter these are two letters from the d of leeds to mr morris and three letters of mr morris giving an account of two conferences with the d of leeds  one with him  mr pitt the sum of these is that they declare without scruple they do not mean to fulfil what remains of the treaty of peace to be fulfilled on their part by which we are to understand the delivery of the posts  payment for property carried off till performance on our part  compensation where the delay has rendered performance now impracticable that on the subject of a treaty of commerce they avoided direct answers so as to satisfy mr morris they did not mean to enter into one unless it could be extended to a treaty of alliance offensive  defensive or unless in the event of a rupture with spain as to the sending a minister here they made excuses in the first conference seem disposed to it in the second and in the last express an intention of so doing their views being thus sufficiently ascertained i have directed mr morris to discontinue his communications with them     thomas jefferson february         opinion on the constitutionality of a national bank february         the bill for establishing a national bank undertakes among other things—   to form the subscribers into a corporation   to enable them in their corporate capacities to receive grants of land and so far is against the laws of mortmain    to make alien subscribers capable of holding land and so far is against the laws of alienage   to transmit these lands on the death of a proprietor to a certain line of successors and so far changes the course of descents   to put the lands out of the reach of forfeiture or escheat and so far is against the laws of forfeiture and escheat   to transmit personal chattels to successors in a certain line and so far is against the laws of distribution   to give them the sole and exclusive right of banking under the national authority and so far is against the laws of monopoly   to communicate to them a power to make laws paramount to the laws of the states for so they must be construed to protect the institution from the control of the state legislatures and so probably they will be construed     i consider the foundation of the constitution as laid on this ground that all powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states or to the people xiith amendment to take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn around the powers of congress is to take possession of a boundless field of power no longer susceptible of any definition the incorporation of a bank and the powers assumed by this bill have not in my opinion been delegated to the united states by the constitution i they are not among the powers specially enumerated for these are  st a power to lay taxes for the purpose of paying the debts of the united states but no debt is paid by this bill nor any tax laid were it a bill to raise money its origination in the senate would condemn it by the constitution  d to borrow money but this bill neither borrows money nor ensures the borrowing it the proprietors of the bank will be just as free as any other money holders to lend or not to lend their money to the public the operation proposed in the bill first to lend them two millions and then to borrow them back again cannot change the nature of the latter act which will still be a payment and not a loan call it by what name you please   to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states and with the indian tribes to erect a bank and to regulate commerce are very different acts he who erects a bank creates a subject of commerce in its bills so does he who     makes a bushel of wheat or digs a dollar out of the mines yet neither of these persons regulates commerce thereby to make a thing which may be bought and sold is not to prescribe regulations for buying and selling besides if this was an exercise of the power of regulating commerce it would be void as extending as much to the internal commerce of every state as to its external for the power given to congress by the constitution does not extend to the internal regulation of the commerce of a state that is to say of the commerce between citizen and citizen which remain exclusively with its own legislature but to its external commerce only that is to say its commerce with another state or with foreign nations or with the indian tribes accordingly the bill does not propose the measure as a regulation of trade but as productive of considerable advantages to trade still less are these powers covered by any other of the special enumerations ii nor are they within either of the general phrases which are the two following—   to lay taxes to provide for the general welfare of the united states that is to say to lay taxes for the purpose of providing for the general welfare for the laying of taxes is the power and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised they are not to lay taxes ad libitum for any purpose they please but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the union in like manner they are not to do anything they please to provide for the general welfare but only to lay taxes for that  00 purpose to consider the latter phrase not as describing the purpose of the first but as giving a distinct and independent power to do any act they please which might be for the good of the union would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless it would reduce the whole instrument to a single phrase that of instituting a congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the united states and as they would be the sole judges of the good or evil it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please it is an established rule of construction where a phrase will bear either of two meanings to give it that which will allow some meaning to the other parts of the instrument and not that which would render all the others useless certainly no such universal power was meant to be given them it was intended to lace them up straitly within the enumerated powers and those without which as means these powers could not be carried into effect it is known that the very power now proposed as a means was rejected as an end by the convention which formed the constitution a proposition was made to them to authorize congress to open canals and an amendatory one to empower them to incorporate but the whole was rejected and one of the reasons for rejection urged in debate was that then they would have a power to erect a bank which would render the great cities where there were prejudices and jealousies on the subject adverse to the reception of the constitution  0    the second general phrase is to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers but they can all be carried into execution without a bank a bank therefore is not necessary and consequently not authorized by this phrase it has been urged that a bank will give great facility or convenience in the collection of taxes suppose this were true yet the constitution allows only the means which are necessary not those which are merely convenient for effecting the enumerated powers if such a latitude of construction be allowed to this phrase as to give any nonenumerated power it will go to every one for there is not one which ingenuity may not torture into a convenience in some instance or other to some one of so long a list of enumerated powers it would swallow up all the delegated powers and reduce the whole to one power as before observed therefore it was that the constitution restrained them to the necessary means that is to say to those means without which the grant of power would be nugatory but let us examine this convenience and see what it is the report on this subject page   states the only general convenience to be the preventing the transportation and retransportation of money between the states and the treasury for i pass over the increase of circulating medium ascribed to it as a want and which according to my ideas of paper money is clearly a demerit every state will have to pay a sum of tax money into the treasury and the treasury will have to pay in every state a part  0  of the interest on the public debt and salaries to the officers of government resident in that state in most of the states there will still be a surplus of tax money to come up to the seat of government for the officers residing there the payments of interest and salary in each state may be made by treasury orders on the state collector this will take up the greater part of the money he has collected in his state and consequently prevent the great mass of it from being drawn out of the state if there be a balance of commerce in favor of that state against the one in which the government resides the surplus of taxes will be remitted by the bills of exchange drawn for that commercial balance and so it must be if there was a bank but if there be no balance of commerce either direct or circuitous all the banks in the world could not bring up the surplus of taxes but in the form of money treasury orders then and bills of exchange may prevent the displacement of the main mass of the money collected without the aid of any bank and where these fail it cannot be prevented even with that aid perhaps indeed bank bills may be a more convenient vehicle than treasury orders but a little difference in the degree of convenience cannot constitute the necessity which the constitution makes the ground for assuming any nonenumerated power besides the existing banks will without a doubt enter into arrangements for lending their agency and the more favorable as there will be a competition among them for it whereas the bill delivers us up bound to the national bank who are free to refuse  0  all arrangement but on their own terms and the public not free on such refusal to employ any other bank that of philadelphia i believe now does this business by their postnotes which by an arrangement with the treasury are paid by any state collector to whom they are presented this expedient alone suffices to prevent the existence of that necessity which may justify the assumption of a nonenumerated power as a means for carrying into effect an enumerated one the thing may be done and has been done and well done without this assumption therefore it does not stand on that degree of necessity which can honestly justify it it may be said that a bank whose bills would have a currency all over the states would be more convenient than one whose currency is limited to a single state so it would be still more convenient that there should be a bank whose bills should have a currency all over the world but it does not follow from this superior conveniency that there exists anywhere a power to establish such a bank or that the world may not go on very well without it can it be thought that the constitution intended that for a shade or two of convenience more or less congress should be authorized to break down the most ancient and fundamental laws of the several states such as those against mortmain the laws of alienage the rules of descent the acts of distribution the laws of escheat and forfeiture the laws of monopoly nothing but a necessity invincible by any other means can justify such a prostitution of laws which constitute the pillars of our whole  0  system of jurisprudence will congress be too straightlaced to carry the constitution into honest effect unless they may pass over the foundationlaws of the state government for the slightest convenience of theirs the negative of the president is the shield provided by the constitution to protect against the invasions of the legislature   the right of the executive   of the judiciary   of the states and state legislatures the present is the case of a right remaining exclusively with the states and consequently one of those intended by the constitution to be placed under its protection it must be added however that unless the presidents mind on a view of everything which is urged for and against this bill is tolerably clear that it is unauthorised by the constitution if the pro and the con hang so even as to balance his judgment a just respect for the wisdom of the legislature would naturally decide the balance in favor of their opinion it is chiefly for cases where they are clearly misled by error ambition or interest that the constitution has placed a check in the negative of the president thomas jefferson feb        report on admission of vermont j mss feb         the secretary of state having received from the commissioners for the state of vermont a letter proposing these questions   whether as that state will not be a distinct member of the union till the  th day of march next the president can before  0  that day nominate officers for it and   if he can not whether he can nominate them after the recess of the senate makes thereon to the president of the u s the following report he is of opinion the president cannot before the  th of march make nominations which will be good in law because till that day it will not be a separate  integral member of the u s and it is only to integral members of the union that his right of nomination is given by the constitution but that nomination may be made on the  th of march and if the senate will meet on that day may be reported to them for their approbation it is true that the two or three new members will be absent unless they chuse to come in for this purpose but as the occasion of consulting an imperfect senate will not be produced by any act of the president and as it is in the power of the new senators to render the body perfect by coming on if they chuse it this difficulty appears smaller than that of making original nominations without the concurrence of the senate this therefore is what the secretary of state thinks best to be done thomas jefferson feb         philadelphia william smith to the rev william smith  philadelphia feb         dear sir —i feel both the wish  the duty to communicate in compliance with your request  0  whatever within my knowledge might render justice to the memory of our great countryman dr franklin in whom philosophy has to deplore one of its principal luminaries extinguished but my opportunities of knowing the interesting facts of his life have not been equal to my desire of making them known i could indeed relate a number of those bon mots with which he used to charm every society as having heard many of them but these are not your object particulars of greater dignity happened not to occur during his stay of nine months after my arrival in france a little before that argand had invented his celebrated lamp in which the flame is spread into a hollow cylinder  thus brought into contact with the air within as well as without doctr franklin had been on the point of the same discovery the idea had occurred to him but he had tried a bullrush as a wick which did not succeed his occupations did not permit him to repeat  extend his trials to the introduction of a larger column of air than could pass through the stem of a bullrush the animal magnetism too of the maniac mesmer had just received its death wound from his hand in conjunction with his brethren of the learned committee appointed to unveil that compound of fraud  folly but after this nothing very interesting was before the public either in philosophy or politics during his stay  he was principally occupied in winding up his affairs there i can only therefore testify in general that there appeared to me more respect  veneration attached  0  to the character of doctor franklin in france than to that of any other person in the same country foreign or native i had opportunities of knowing particularly how far these sentiments were felt by the foreign ambassadors  ministers at the court of versailles the fable of his capture by the algerines propagated by the english newspapers excited no uneasiness as it was seen at once to be a dish cooked up to the palate of their readers but nothing could exceed the anxiety of his diplomatic brethren on a subsequent report of his death which tho premature bore some marks of authenticity i found the ministers of france equally impressed with the talents  integrity of doctr franklin the ct de vergennes particularly gave me repeated and unequivocal demonstrations of his entire confidence in him when he left passy it seemed as if the village had lost its patriarch on taking leave of the court which he did by letter the king ordered him to be handsomely complimented  furnished him with a litter  mules of his own the only kind of conveyance the state of his health could bear no greater proof of his estimation in france can be given than the late letters of condolence on his death from the national assembly of that country  the community of paris to the president of the united states  to congress and their public mourning on that event it is i believe the first instance of that homage having been paid by a public body of one nation to a private citizen of another his death was an affliction which was to happen to  0  us at some time or other we have reason to be thankful he was so long spared that the most useful life should be the longest also that it was protracted so far beyond the ordinary span allotted to man as to avail us of his wisdom in the establishment of our own freedom  to bless him with a view of its dawn in the east where they seemed till now to have learned everything but how to be free the succession to dr franklin at the court of france was an excellent school of humility on being presented to any one as the minister of america the commonplace question used in such cases was cest vous monsieur qui remplace le docteur franklin it is you sir who replace doctor franklin i generally answered no one can replace him sir i am only his successor these small offerings to the memory of our great  dear friend whom time will be making greater while it is spunging us from its records must be accepted by you sir in that spirit of love  veneration for him in which they are made and not according to their insignificance in the eyes of a world who did not want this mite to fill up the measure of his worth thomas jefferson mar        draft of presidents

recognition  renewal of your former acquaintance and shall be happy to continue it by an exchange of epistolary communications yours to me will be always welcome your first gives me information in the line of natural history  the second not yet received promises political news the first is my passion the last is my duty and therefore both desireable i believe entirely with you that the remains of fortifications found in the western country have been the works of the natives nothing i have ever yet heard of proves the existence of a nation here who knew the use of iron i have never heard even of burnt bricks though they might be made without iron the statue you have been so kind as to send me and for which i beg you to accept my thanks would because of the hardness   0 of the stone be a better proof of the use of iron than i ever yet saw but as it is a solitary fact and possible to have been made with implements of stone and great patience for which the indians are remarkable i consider it to have been so made it is certainly the best piece of workmanship i ever saw from their hands if the artist did not intend it he has very happily hit on the representation of a woman in the first moments of parturition mr brown the bearer of this will give you the congressional news some good some so so like everything else in this world our endeavors the last year to punish your enemies have had an unfortunate issue the federal council has yet to learn by experience what experience has long ago taught us in virginia that rank and file fighting will not do against indians i hope this years experiment will be made in a more auspicious form will it not be possible for you to bring general clark forward i know the greatness of his mind  am the more mortified at the cause which obscures it had not this unhappily taken place there was nothing he might not have hoped could it be surmounted his lost ground might yet be recovered no man alive rated him higher than i did  would again were he to become again what i knew him we are made to hope he is engaged in writing the account of his expeditions north of ohio they will be valuable morsels of history and will justify to the world those who have told them how great he was mr brown will tell you also that we are not inattentive to the interests of your navigation nothing     short of actual rupture is omitted what its effect will be we cannot yet foretell but we should not stop even here were a favorable conjuncture to arise the move we have now made must bring the matter to issue i can assure you of the most determined zeal of our chief magistrate in this business and i trust mine will not be doubted so far as it can be of any avail the nail will be driven as far as it will go peaceably and farther the moment that circumstances become favorable thomas jefferson mar        philadelphia william short to the u s chargé daffaires in france  william short j mss philadelphia mar        dear sir —    no decision yet with respect to the missions either of france or holland the less they are pressed the better for your wishes as the president will know you more and more himself to overdo a thing with him is to undo it i am steering the best i can for you the excessive unpopularity of the excise and bank bills in the south i apprehend will produce a stand against the federal government in this case the public paper will tumble precipitately i wish there were some one here authorized to read sell out yours because if the danger does not take place or passes easily he could buy in again to advantage indeed you could not do better than subscribe it into the bank where you can not receive less than six per cent     and may perhaps receive ten very particular reasons prohibit me from acting for you in this way by no means appoint any body of the treasury thomas jefferson march  0      philadelphia quesada to the governor of florida quesada j mss philadelphia march  0      sir —we have received with great satisfaction notification of the orders of his catholic majesty not to permit that persons held in slavery within the united states introduce themselves as free persons into the province of florida the known justice of his majesty and his government was a certain dependence to us that such would be his will the assurances your excellency has been pleased to give us of your friendly dispositions leave us no doubt you will have faithfully executed a regulation so essential to harmony and good neighborhood as a consequence of the same principles of justice and friendship we trust that your excellency will permit and aid the recovery of persons of the same description who have heretofore taken refuge within your government the bearer hereof is authorized to wait on your excellency to confer on this subject and to concur in such arrangements as you shall approve for the recovery of such fugitives i beg you to be assured that no occasion shall be neglected of proving our dispositions to reciprocate these principles of justice and friendship with the subjects of his catholic majesty and that you will     be pleased to accept the homage of those sentiments of respect and esteem with which i have the honor to be sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson march   th      philadelphia william carmichael to the u s chargé daffaires in spain william carmichael j mss philadelphia march   th      sir —i enclose you a statement of the case of joseph st marie a citizen of the united states of america whose clerk mr swimmer was in the latter part of the year      seized on the eastern side of the mississippi in latitude   ° 0′ together with his goods of the value of    0 dollars by a party of spanish soldiers they justified themselves under the order of a mr valliere their officer who avowed authority from the governor of new orleans requiring him to seize and confiscate all property found on either side of the mississippi below the mouth of the ohio the matter being then carried by ste marie before the governor of new orleans instead of correcting the injury he avowed the act and its principle and pretended orders from his court for this and more we have so much confidence however in the moderation and friendship of the court of madrid that we are more than ready to ascribe this outrage to officers acting at a distance than to orders from a just sovereign we have hitherto considered the delivery of the post of the natchez on the part of spain as only awaiting the result of those arrangements which have been under amicable     discussion between us but the remaining in possession of a post which is so near our limit of   ° as to admit some colour of doubt whether it be on our side or theirs is one thing while it is a very different one to launch   0 miles further and to seize the persons and property of our citizens and that too in the very moment that a friendly accommodation of all differences is under discussion our respect for their candour and good faith does not permit us to doubt that proper notice will be taken of the presumption of their officer who has thus put to hazard the peace of both nations and we particularly expect that indemnification will be made to the individual injured on this you are desired to insist in the most friendly terms but with that earnestness and perseverance which the complexion of this wrong requires the papers enclosed will explain the reasons of the delay which has intervened it is but lately they have been put in the hands of our government we cannot omit this occasion of urging on the court of madrid the necessity of hastening a final acknowledgment of our right to navigate the mississippi a right which has been long suspended in exercise with extreme inconvenience on our part merely with a desire of reconciling spain to what it is impossible for us to relinquish an accident at this day like that now complained of would put further parley beyond our power yet to such accidents we are every day exposed by the irregularities of their officers and the impatience of our citizens should any spark kindle these dispositions of our     borderers into a flame we are involved beyond recall by the eternal principles of justice to our citizens which we will never abandon in such an event spain cannot possibly gain what may she not lose— the boldness of this act of the governor of new orleans and of his avowal of it renders it essential to us to understand the court of spain on this subject you will therefore avail yourself of the earliest occasions of obtaining their sentiments and of communicating them to us thomas jefferson march         philadelphia william short to the u s chargé daffaires in france william short j mss philadelphia march         dear sir —the enclosed papers will explain to you a case which imminently endangers the peace of the united states with spain it is not indeed of recent date but it has been recently laid before government and is of so bold a feature as to render dangerous to our rights a further acquiescence in their suspension the middle ground held by france between us and spain both in friendship and interest requires that we should communicate with her with the fullest confidence on this occasion i therefore enclose you a copy of my letter to mr carmichael and of the papers it refers to to be communicated to monsieur de montmorin whose efficacious interference with the court of madrid you are desired to ask we rely with great confidence on his friendship justice and influence a cession of the navigation of the mississippi with     such privileges as to make it useful and free from future chicane can be no longer dispensed with on our part and perhaps while i am writing something may have already happened to cut off this appeal to friendly accommodation to what consequences such an event would lead cannot be calculated to such very possibly as we should lament without being able to control your earnestness with monsieur de montmorin and with the court of spain cannot be more pressing than the present situation and temper of this country requires the case of st marie happens to be the incident presenting itself in the moment when the general question must otherwise have been brought forward we rely on this occasion on the good offices of the marquis de la fayette whom you are desired to interest in it thomas jefferson march         philadelphia harry innes to harry innes j mss philadelphia march         dear sir —your favour of feb  0 came to my hands only four days ago and i have taken the first moment in my power to prepare my answer which i now enclose it is in fact a copy of what i had prepared while in virginia when i had the subject under contemplation except that some useless asperities are rubbed off i am in hopes either mr g carr or mr anderson of richmond has given you a copy of my opinions of june  0      and sept       0 wherein i have cited the cases upon which i ground my defence for my nephew i consider that of pouri  corbet   fr atk     as establishing a rule     of construction peculiarly applicable to our case  decisive of it what is said with you of the most prominent proceedings of the last congress the disapprobation of the assumption with you leads us naturally to attend to your reception of laws for carrying it into effect which have been thought to present themselves in an unfavorable view what will be thought of measures taken to force gr britain by a navigation act to come forward in fair treaty and let us substantially into her islands as a price for the advantages in navigation and commerce which she now derives from us this is interesting to our agriculture provided the means adopted be sufficiently gradual i wish you would come forward to the federal legislature and give your assistance on a larger scale than that on which you are acting at present i am satisfied you could render essential service and i have such confidence in the purity of your republicanism that i know your efforts would go in a right direction zeal and talents added to the republican scale will do no harm in congress it is fortunate that our first executive magistrate is purely and zealously republican we cannot expect all his successors to be so and therefore should avail ourselves the present day to establish principles and examples which may fence us against future heresies preached now to be practised hereafter i repeat my wish that i could see you come into the federal councils no man living joining more confidence in your principles and talents to higher personal esteem than dear sir your most obedient humble servant     thomas

the next as their time being up on the  d of march they were obliged to postpone everything which would admit of it it will be taken up at the meeting of the next which will be on the  th monday of october this act is perfectly innocent as to other nations is strictly just as to the english cannot be parried by them  if adopted by other nations would inevitably defeat their navigation act  reduce their power on the sea within safer limits it is indeed extremely to be desired that other nations would adopt it i send copies of it to mr short  mr carmichael could those three countries agree to concur in such a measure it would soon be fatally felt by the navy of england no body can better judge of its effect than mr pinto to whom i would wish you to communicate it  see whether he would not think it expedient for portugal i inclose you a letter for mr carmichael which being of importance i wish you could find a safe private conveyance for it we have no letter from him since you

for the most part  very few changes made this is one of many proofs that the proceedings of the new government have given general satisfaction some acts indeed have produced local discontents but these can never be avoided the new congress will meet on the  th monday of october inclosed is the copy of an act reported by a committee of the late congress who not having time to go through the subject referred it to me to be examined  reported to the next congress this measure therefore will be proposed to them as a first  immediate step and perhaps something further at a more distant day i have sent copies of this act to mr short  colo humphreys  i inclose this to you that you may communicate it to the court of madrid as a measure in contemplation with us how far such an one may be politic to be adopted by spain france  portugal is for them to consider the measure is perfectly     innocent as to all nations except those or rather that which has a navigation act and to that it retorts only its own principles being founded in universal reciprocity it is impossible it should excite a single complaint its consequences on that nation are such as they cannot avoid for either they must repeal their navigation act in order to be let in to a share of foreign carriage or the shipping they now employ in foreign carriage will be out of employ and this act frustrated on which their naval power is built consequently that power will be reduced within safer limits and the freedom of the ocean be better secured to all the world the more extensive the adoption of this measure is the more irritable will be its effect we would not wish to be declared the excitors of such a concert of measures but we have thought it expedient to suggest informally to the courts of france spain  portugal the measure we propose to take and to leave with them to decide on the motives of their own interest how far it may be expedient for them to adopt a similar measure their concurrence will more completely ensure the object of our act and therefore i leave it to yourself to insinuate it with all the discretion and effect you can your letter of may        is still the last we have received  that is now near two years old a letter from colo humphreys written within    hours after his arrival at madrid reached us within two months   0 days after its date a full explanation of the causes of this suspension of all information from you is expected in answer to my letter of aug   it will     be waited for yet a reasonable time  in the mean while a final opinion suspended by the first vessel to cadiz the laws  gazettes shall be forwarded thomas jefferson march         philadelphia william short to the u s chargé daffaires in france william short j mss philadelphia march         dear sir —your letter of november the  th no    by mr osmont came to hand yesterday and i have just time before the departure of mr terrasson the bearer of my letter of the   th instant and despatches accompanying it to acknowledge the receipt and inform you that it has been laid before the president on consideration of the circumstances stated in the second page of your letter he is of opinion that it is expedient to press at this moment a settlement of our difference with spain you are therefore desired instead of confining your application for the interference of the court of france to the simple case of st marie mentioned in my letter of the   th to ask it on the broad bottom of general necessity that our right of navigating the mississippi be at length ceded by the court of madrid and be ceded in such form as to render the exercise of it efficacious and free from chicane this cannot be without an entrepôt in some convenient port of the river where the river and sea craft may meet and exchange loads without any control from the laws of the spanish government this subject was so fully developed to you in my letter of august the      0th    0 that i shall at present only refer to that we wish you to communicate this matter fully to the marquis de la fayette to ask his influence and assistance assuring him that a settlement of this matter is become indispensable to us any further delay exposing our peace both at home and abroad to accidents the result of which are incalculable and must no longer be hazarded his friendly interposition on this occasion as well as that of his nation will be most sensibly felt by us to his discretion therefore and yours we confide this matter trusting that you will so conduct it as to obtain our right in an efficacious form and at the same time to preserve to us the friendship of france and spain the latter of which we value much and the former infinitely mr carmichael is instructed to press this matter at madrid yet if the marquis and yourself think it could be better effected at paris with the count de nunnez it is left to you to endeavor to try it there indeed we believe it would be more likely to be settled there than at madrid or here observe always that to accept the navigation of the river without an entrepôt would be perfectly useless and that an entrepôt if tramelled would be a certain instrument for bringing on war instead of preventing it thomas jefferson mar         philadelphia george nicholas to the attorney of the district of kentucky george nicholas j mss philadelphia mar         sir —a certain james ofallon is as we are informed undertaking to raise organize  commission     an army of his own authority  independant of that of the government the object of which is to go and possess themselves of lands which have never yet been granted by any authority which the government admits to be legal and with an avowed design to hold them by force against any power foreign or domestic as this will inevitably commit our whole nation in war with the indian nations and perhaps others it cannot be permitted that all the inhabitants of the u s shall be involved in the calamities of war and the blood of thousands of them be poured out merely that a few adventurers may possess themselves of lands nor can a well ordered government tolerate such an assumption of its sovereignty by unauthorized individuals i send you herein the attorney generals opinion of what may legally be done with a desire that you proceed against the said ofallon according to law it is not the wish to extend the prosecution to other individuals who may have given thoughtlessly into this unlawful proceeding i enclose you a proclamation to this effect but they may be assured that if this undertaking be prosecuted the whole force of the u s will be displayed to punish the transgression i enclose you one of ofallons commissions signed as is said by himself thomas jefferson march   th      philadelphia martha jefferson randolph to martha jefferson randolph  philadelphia march   th      my dear daughter —the badness of the roads retards the posts so that i have received no letter     this week from monticello i shall hope soon to have one from yourself to know from that that you are perfectly reestablished that the little anne is becoming a big one that you have received dr gregorys book and are daily profiting from it this will hardly reach you in time to put you on the watch for the annular eclipse of the sun which is to happen on sunday sennight to begin about sunrise it will be such a one as is rarely to be seen twice in one life i have lately received a letter from fulwar skipwith who is counsul for us in martinique and guadaloupe he fixed himself first in the former but has removed to the latter are many of your acquaintances in either of these islands if they are i wish you would write to them and recommend him to their acquaintance he will be a sure medium through which you may exchange souvenirs with your friends of a more useful kind than those of the convent he sent me half a dozen pots of very fine sweatmeats apples and cider are the greatest presents which can be sent to those islands i can make those presents for you whenever you choose to write a letter to accompany them only observing the season for apples they had better deliver their letters for you to f s skipwith things are going on well in france the revolution being past all danger the national assembly being to separate soon that event will seal the whole with security their islands but more particularly st domingo and martinique are involved in a horrid civil war nothing can be more distressing than the situation of their inhabitants as their slaves have     been called into action and are a terrible engine absolutely ungovernable it is worse in martinique which was the reason mr skipwith left it an army and fleet from france are expected every hour to quell the disorders i suppose you are busily engaged in your garden i expect full details on that subject as well as from poll that i may judge what sort of a gardener you make present me affectionately to all around you and be assured of the tender and unalterable love of yours thomas jefferson mar         philadelphia william telfair to the governor of georgia  william telfair philadelphia mar         sir —your favor of the  d of january was received the  th instant the dispositions expressed by the governour of florida give reason to hope he will execute with good faith the orders of his sovereign to prevent the future reception within his province of slaves flying from the united states how far he may think himself authorized to give up those who have taken refuge there heretofore is another question i observe that the orders he announces to have received say nothing of the past it is probable therefore that an application from us to give them retrospective effect may require his asking new orders from his court the delay which will necessarily attend the answer the doubts what that     answer may be  if what we wish the facility of evading the execution if there be a disposition to evade it are circumstances to be weighed beforehand as well as the probable amount of the interest it would be possible to recover if this last be small it may be questionable how far the government ought in prudence to commit itself by a demand of such dilatory  doubtful effect as the president will be at augusta in the course of the tour in which he is now engaged you will have an opportunity of explaining to him the extent of the losses complained of  how far they could probably be recovered even were the dispositions of your neighbours favourable to the recovery  what those dispositions may actually be thomas jefferson march         l w otto to the french chargé daffaires  l w otto j mss march         sir —the note of december   th which you did me the honor to address to me on the acts of congress of the  0th of july      and    0 fixing the tonnage payable by foreign vessels arriving from a foreign port without excepting those of france has been submitted to the government of the united states they consider the conduct of his most christian majesty in making this the subject of fair discussion and explanation as a new proof of his justice and friendship and they have entered on the consideration with all the respect due to whatever comes     from his majesty or his ministers and with all the dispositions to find grounds for an union of opinion which a sincere attachment to your nation and a desire to meet their wishes on every occasion could inspire but the  th article of the treaty of amity and commerce is not seen here exactly in the point of view in which your note places it the  d and  th articles subject the vessels of each nation to pay in the ports of the other only such duties as are paid by the most favoured nation and give them reciprocally all the privileges and exemptions in navigation and commerce which are given by either to the most favoured nations had the contracting parties stopped here they would have been free to raise or lower their tonnage as they should find it expedient only taking care to keep the other on the footing of the most favoured nation the question then is whether the  th article cited in the note is anything more than an application of the principle comprised in the  d and  th to a particular object or whether it is an additional stipulation of some thing not so comprised i that it is merely an application of a principle comprised in the preceding articles is declared by the express words of the article to wit dans lexemption cidessus est nommément compris c in the above exemption is particularly comprised the imposition of  00 sols per ton established in france on foreign vessels here then is at once an express declaration that the exemption from the duty of  00 sols is comprised in the  d and  th articles that is to say it was one of the exemptions enjoyed by the     most favoured nations and as such extended to us by those articles if the exemption spoken of in this  st member of the  th article was comprised in the  d and  th articles as is expressly declared then the reservation by france out of that exemption which makes the  d member of the same article was also comprised that is to say if the whole was comprised the part was comprised and if this reservation of france in the  d member was comprised in the  d and  th articles then the counter reservation by the united states which constitutes the  d and last member of the same article was also comprised because it is but a corresponding portion of a similar whole on our part which had been comprised by the same terms with theirs in short the whole article relates to a particular duty of  00 sols laid by some antecedent law of france on the vessels of foreign nations relinquished as to the most favoured and consequently to us it is not a new and additional stipulation then but a declared application of the stipulations comprised in the preceding articles to a particular case by way of greater caution the doctrine laid down generally in the  d and  th articles and exemplified specially in the  th amounts to this the vessels of the most favoured nations coming from foreign ports are exempted from the duty of  00 sols therefore you are exempted from it by the  d and  th articles the vessels of the most favoured nations coming coastwise pay that duty therefore you are to pay it by the  d and  th articles we shall not think it   0 unfriendly in you to lay a like duty on coasters because it will be no more than we have done ourselves you are free also to lay that or any other duty on vessels coming from foreign ports provided they apply to all other nations even the most favoured we are free to do the same under the same restriction but exempting you from a duty which the most favoured nations do not pay does not exempt you from one which they do pay in this view it is evident that the  th article neither enlarges nor abridges the stipulations of the  d and  th the effect of the treaty would have been precisely the same had it been omitted altogether consequently it may be truly said that the reservation by the united states in this article is completely useless and it may be added with equal truth that the equivalent reservation by france is completely useless as well as her previous abandonment of the same duty and in short the whole article each party then remains free to raise or lower its tonnage provided the change operates on all nations even the most favoured without undertaking to affirm we may obviously conjecture that this article has been inserted on the part of the united states from an over caution to guard nommement by name against a particular aggrievance which they thought they could never be too well secured against and that has happened which generally happens doubts have been produced by the too great number of words used to prevent doubt ii the court of france however understands     this article as intended to introduce something to which the preceding articles had not reached and not merely as an application of them to a particular case this opinion seems to be founded on the general rule in the construction of instruments to leave no words merely useless for which any rational meaning can be found they say that the reservation by the united states of a right to lay a duty equivalent to that of the  00 sols reserved by france would have been completely useless if they were left free by the preceding articles to lay a tonnage to any extent whatever consequently that the reservation of a part proves a relinquishment of the residue if some meaning and such a one is to be given to the last member of the article some meaning and a similar one must be given to the corresponding member if the reservation by the united states of a right to lay an equivalent duty implies a relinquishment of their right to lay any other the reservation by france of a right to continue the specified duty to which it is an equivalent must imply a relinquishment of the right on her part to lay or continue any other equivalent reservations by both must imply equivalent restrictions on both the exact reciprocity stipulated in the preceding articles and which pervades every part of the treaty ensures a counter right to each party for every right ceded to the other let it be further considered—that the duty called tonnage in the united states is in lieu of the duties for anchorage for the support of buoys beacons     and lighthouses to guide the mariner into harbour and along the coast which are provided and supported at the expence of the united states and for fees to measurers weighers gaugers c who are paid by the united states for which articles among many others light excepted duties are paid by us in the ports of france under their specific names that government has hitherto thought these duties consistent with the treaty and consequently the same duties under a general instead of specific monies with us must be equally consistent with it it is not the name but the thing which is essential if we have renounced the right to lay any port duties they must be understood to have equally renounced that of either laying new or continuing the old if we ought to refund the port duties received from their vessels since the date of the act of congress they should refund the port duties they have received from our vessels since the date of the treaty for nothing short of this is the reciprocity of the treaty if this construction be adopted then each party has forever renounced the right of laying any duties on the vessels of the other coming from any foreign port or more than  00 sols on those coming coastwise could this relinquishment be confined to the two contracting parties alone its effect would be calculable but the exemption once conceded by the one nation to the other becomes immediately the property of all others who are on the footing of the most favoured nations it is true that those others would be obliged to yield the same compensation     that is to say to receive our vessels duty free whether france and the united states would gain or lose in the exchange of the measure with them is not easy to say another consequence of this construction will be that the vessels of the most favoured nations paying no duties will be on a better footing than those of nations which pay a moderate duty consequently either the duty on these also must be given up or they will be supplanted by foreign vessels in our own ports the resource then of duty on vessels for the purposes either of revenue or regulation will be forever lost to both it is hardly conceivable that either party looking forward to all these consequences would see their interest in them so that on the whole sir we consider the  th article of the treaty merely as an illustration of the  d and  th articles by an application of the principles comprised in them to the case stated in that and that a contrary construction would exceedingly embarrass and injure both the contracting parties we feel every disposition on our part to make considerable sacrifices where they would result to the sole benefit of your nation but where they would excite from other nations corresponding claims it becomes necessary to proceed with caution you probably know sir that the general subject of navigation was before our legislature at their last session and was postponed merely for the want of time to go through it before the period arrived to which the constitution had limited their existence it will be resumed at     the meeting of the new legislature and from a knowledge of the sincere attachment of my countrymen to the prosperity of your nation and to the increase of our intercourse with it i may safely say for the new legislature that the encouragement of that intercourse for the advantage of both parties will be considered as among the most interesting branches of the general subject submitted to them from a perfect conviction of the coincidence of our interests nobody wishes more sincerely to cultivate the habit of mutual good offices and favours than he who has the honor to be with sentiments of the greatest respect and esteem sir your most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson march   st      philadelphia mary jefferson to mary jefferson

the top broken in two mr randolphs letter referring to me the name of your niece was very long on the road i answered it as soon as i received it and hope the answer got duly to hand lest it should have been     delayed i repeated last week to your sister the name of anne which i had recommended as belonging to both families i wrote you in my last that the frogs had begun their songs on the  th since that the bluebirds saluted us on the   th the weepingwillow began to leaf on the   th the lilac and gooseberry on the   th and the goldenwillow on the   th i inclose for your sister three kinds of flowering beans very beautiful and very rare she must plant and nourish them with her own hand this year in order to save enough seeds for herself and me tell mr randolph i have sold my tobacco for five dollars per c and the rise between this and september warehouse and shipping expenses in virginia freight and storage here come to  s  d a hundred so that it is as if i had sold it in richmond for   s  d credit till september or half per cent per month discount for the ready money if he chooses it his bedford tobacco may be included in the sale kiss everybody for me yours affectionately thomas jefferson apr        philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states d s mss philadelphia apr        sir —i had the honor of addressing you on the   th ult since which letters are received of jan    from mr carmichael and of jan       madrid and feb   and    lisbon from colonel humphreys as these are interesting and may tend to settle suspense of mind to a certain degree i shall     trouble you with quotations from some parts  the substance of others colo h says i learn from other good authority as well as from mr carmichael that all the representations of gardoqui when minister in america tended to excite a belief that the most respectable  influential people throughout the u s did not wish to have the navigation of the mississippi opened for years to come from an apprehension such an event would weaken the government  impoverish the atlantic states by emigrations it was even pretended that none but a handful of settlers on the western waters  a few inhabitants of the southern states would acquiesce in the measure this is the state of mind to which they have reverted since the crisis with england is passed for during that the count de florida blanca threw out general assertions that we should have no reason to complain of their conduct with respect to the mississippi which gave rise to the report its navigation was opened the following passages will be astonishing to you who recollect that there was not a syllable in your letters to mr g m which looked in the most distant manner to spain mr carmichael says something however might have been done in a moment of projects and apprehension had not a certain negotiation carried on on our part at london transpired  which i think was known here rather from british policy than from the vigilance of the marquis del campo entirely unacquainted     with this manœuvre although in correspondence with the person employed i was suspected to be in the secret this suspicion banished confidence which returns by slow degrees this circumstance induced me to drop entirely my correspondence with g m to continue it would have done harm  certainly could do no good i have seen extracts of the presidents letter communicated to the duke of leeds perhaps mutilated or forged to serve here the views of the british cabinet i do not yet despair of obtaining copies of those letters through the same channel that i procured the first account of the demands of g b and the signature of the late convention colo humphreys says the minister had intimations from del campo of the conferences between mr morris  the duke of leeds which occasioned him to say with warmth to mr carmichael now is your time to make a treaty with england fitzherbert availed himself of these conferences to create apprehensions that the americans would aid his nation in case of war your genuine letter could have made no such impression the british court then must have forged one to suit their purpose and i think it will not be amiss to send a genuine copy to carmichael to place our faith on its just ground the principal hope of doing anything now is founded either on an expected removal of the count de f b from the ministry in which case persons will be employed who are more friendly to america or to the bursting out of that fire which both gentlemen think but     superficially covered mr carmichael justifies himself by the interception of his letters he has shown the originals to colonel h he concludes his present letter with these words relying on the good opinion of me that you have been pleased to express on many occasions i entreat you to engage the president to permit me to return to my native country colo humphreys on the subjects of his justification and return says after speaking of the persons likely to come into power mr carmichael being on terms of intimacy with the characters here is certainly capable of effecting more at this court than any other american he is heartily desirous of accomplishing the object in view at all events  fully determined to return to america in    or    months at farthest he has expressed that intention repeatedly to be invested with full powers perhaps he would be able to do something before his departure from the continent in his letter of jan    he says mr carmichaels ideas are just his exertions will be powerful  unremitting to obtain the accomplishment of our desires before his departure from this country the task will now be difficult if not impracticable in that of feb   he says mr carmichael is much mortified that so many of his despatches have miscarried by the original documents which i have seen in his hands i am convinced he has been extremely assiduous and successful in procuring early  authentic intelligence     it is difficult for a person at a distance to form an adequate judgment of the embarrassments to which a public man situated as he was is subjected in making written communications from such an inland place  under such a jealous government he appears disgusted with the country  the mode of life he is compelled to lead he desires ardently to return to his native land but he wishes to distinguish himself first by rendering some essential service to it if possible i propose to write to mr carmichael that your absence prevents my asking the permission he desires that as it is natural he should wish to do something which may make favorable impressions here before his return  an opportunity is now offered him i will suspend asking his recall till i hear further from him governor quesada by order of his court is inviting foreigners to go and settle in florida this is meant for our people debtors take advantage of it  go off with their property our citizens have a right to go where they please it is the business of the states to take measures to stop them till their debts are paid this done i wish a hundred thousand of our inhabitants would accept the invitation it will be the means of delivering to us peaceably what may otherwise cost us a war in the meantime we may complain of this seduction of our inhabitants just enough to make them believe we think it very wise policy for them  confirm them in it this is my idea of it   0 thomas jefferson apr         philadelphia david humphreys to the u s minister to portugal david humphreys j mss philadelphia apr         dear sir —i wrote you mar    with postscripts of the   th    th since that yours of jan   no  0 jan    no    from madrid and feb   no     feb    no    from lisbon are received they covered a letter from mr carmichael the only one we have from him of later date than may      you know that my letter to him of which you were the bearer took notice of the intermission of his correspondence and the one inclosed to him in my letter to you of mar    being written when this intermission was felt still stronger as having continued so much longer conveyed stronger marks of dissatisfaction tho his letter now received convinces us he has been active in procuring intelligence yet it does not appear that he has been equally assiduous in procuring means of correspondence which was the more incumbent on him in proportion as the government was more jealous  watchful still however i wish him to receive the letter now inclosed for him herein as it softens what had been harder said and shews a disposition rather to look forward than backward i hope you will receive it in time to forward with the other it contains important matter pressing on him as i wish to do on you  have done on mr short to engage your respective courts in a cooperation in our navigation act procure for us all the information possible as to the strength riches resources lights and dispositions of brazil the jealousy of the court of lisbon     on this subject will of course inspire you with due caution in making and communicating these inquiries  thomas jefferson apr         philadelphia james monroe to james monroe j mss philadelphia apr         dear sir —your favor of mar         came to hand last night i sincerely sympathize with you on the step which your brother has taken without consulting you and wonder indeed how it could be done with any attention in the agents to the laws of the land i fear he will hardly persevere in the second plan of life adopted for him as matrimony illy agrees with study especially in the first stages of both however you will readily perceive that the thing being done there is now but one question that is what is to be done to make the best of it in respect both to his  your happiness a step of this kind indicates no vice nor other foible than of following too hastily the movements of a warm heart it admits therefore of the continuance of cordial affection  calls perhaps more indispensably for your care  protection to conciliate the affection of all parties and to banish all suspicion of discontent will conduce most to your own happiness also i am sorry to hear that your daughter has been unwell  hope she is recovered ere this and that mrs monroe enjoys good health affairs in france are still going on well the late pacification between spain  england has not been a reconciliation it     is thought the fire is but slightly covered  may burst out should the northern war spread as is expected great britain is still endeavoring to plunder us of our carrying business the parliament have a bill before them to admit wheat brought in british bottoms to be warehoused rent free so that the merchants are already giving a preference to british bottoms for that commodity should we lose the transportation of our own wheat it will put down a great proportion of our shipping already pushed by british vessels out of some of the best branches of business in order further to circumscribe our carrying the commissioners of the treasury have lately determined to admit no vessel as american unless built here this takes from us the right of prescribing by our own laws the conditions of naturalizing vessels in our own country and in the event of a war in which we should be neutral prevents our increasing by purchase the quantity of our shipping so as to avail ourselves of the full benefit of the neutrality of our flag if we are to add to our own stock of shipping only as much as we can build a war will be over before we shall be the better of it we hear of continual murders in the westward i hope we shall drub the indians well this summer  then change our plan from war to bribery we must do as the spaniards  english do keep them in peace by liberal  constant presents they find it the cheapest plan  so shall we the expence of this summers expedition would have served for presents for half a century in this way hostilities being suspended for some length of time a real affection may     succeed on our frontiers to that hatred now existing there another powerful motive is that in this way we may leave no pretext for raising or continuing an army every rag of an indian depredation will otherwise serve as a ground to raise troops with those who think a standing army and a public debt necessary for the happiness of the u s and we shall never be permitted to get rid of either our treasury still thinks that these new encroachments of gr brit on our carrying trade must be met by passive obedience and nonresistance lest any misunderstanding with them should affect our credit or the prices of our public paper new schemes are on foot for bringing more paper to market by encouraging great manufacturing companies to form and their actions or papershares to be transferrable as bankstock we are ruined sir if we do not over rule the principles that the more we owe the more prosperous we shall be that a public debt furnishes the means of enterprise that if ours should be once paid off we should incur another by any means however extravagant c c—colo eveleigh died yesterday morng—present me affectionately  most affectionately to mrs monroe i cannot be with you till september adieu my dear sir thomas jefferson apr         philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states j mss philadelphia apr         sir —i had the honor of addressing you on the  d which i supposed would find you at richmond and again on the  0th which i thought would     overtake you at wilmington the present will probably find you at charleston according to what i mentioned in my letter of the  0th the vicepresident secretaries of the treasury  war  myself met on the   th colo hamilton presented a letter from mr short in which he mentioned that the month of february being one of the periodical months in amsterdam when from the receipt of interest and refunding of capitals there is much money coming in there  free to be disposed of he had put off the opening his loan till then that it might fill the more rapidly a circumstance which would excite the presumption of our credit that he had every reason to hope it would be filled before it would be possible for him after his then communication of the conditions to receive your approbation of them  orders to open a second which however should be awaited according to his instructions but he pressed the expediting the order that the stoppage of the current in our favor might be as short as possible we saw that if under present circumstances your orders should be awaited it would add a month to the delay and we were satisfied were you present you would approve the conditions  order a second loan to be opened we unanimously therefore advised an immediate order on condition the terms of the  d loan should not be worse than those of the  st genl knox expressed an apprehension that the   nations might be induced to join our enemies there being some suspicious circumstances and he wished to send colo pickering to confirm them in their neutrality this     he observed would occasion an expense of about two thousand dollars as the indians were never to be met emptyhanded we thought the mission adviseable as to myself i hope we shall give the indians a thorough drubbing this summer and i should think it better afterwards to take up the plan of liberal  repeated presents to them this would be much the cheapest in the end  would save all the blood which is now split in time too it would produce a spirit of peace  friendship between us the expense of a single expedition would last very long for presents i mentioned to the gentlemen the idea of suggesting thro colo beckwith our knowledge of the conduct of the british officers in furnishing the indians with arms  ammunition and our dissatisfaction colo hamilton said that beckwith had been with him on the subject and had assured him they had given the indians nothing more than the annual present  at the annual period it was thought proper however that he should be made sensible that this had attracted the notice of government i thought it the more material lest having been himself the first to speak of it he might suppose his excuses satisfactory  that therefore they might repeat the annual present this year as beckwith lodges in the same house with mr madison i have desired the latter to find some occasion of representing to beckwith that tho an annual present of arms  ammunition be an innocent thing in time of peace it is not so in time of war that it is contrary to the laws of neutrality for a neutral power to furnish military implements to either party     at war  that if their subjects should do it on private account such furniture might be seized as contraband to reason with him on the subject as from himself but so as to let him see that government thought as himself did you knew i think before you left us that the british parliament had a bill before them for allowing wheat imported in british bottoms to be warehoused rent free in order further to circumscribe the carrying business of the u s they now refuse to consider as an american bottom any vessel not built here by this construction they take from us the right of defining by our own laws what vessels shall be deemed ours  naturalized here and in the event of a war in which we should be neutral they put it out of our power to benefit ourselves of our neutrality by increasing suddenly by purchase  naturalization our means of carriage if we are permitted to do this by building only the war will be over before we can be prepared to take advantage of it this has been decided by the lords commissioners of the treasury in the case of one green a merchant of new york from whom i have received a regular complaint on the subject i enclose you the copy of a note from mr king to colonel hamilton on the subject of the appointment of a british minister to come here i suspect it however to be without foundation colonel eveleigh died yesterday supposing it possible you might desire to appoint his successor as soon as you could decide on one i enclose you a blank commission which when you shall be pleased     to fill it up and sign can be returned for the seal and countersignature i enclose you a letter from mr coxe to yourself on the subject of this appointment and so much of one to me as related to the same having torn off a leaf of compliment to lighten and lessen my enclosures to you should distributive justice give preference to a successor of the same state with the deceased i take the liberty of suggesting to you mr hayward of south carolina whom i think you told me you did not know and of whom you are now on the spot of inquiry i enclose you also a continuation of the pennsylvania debates on the bill for federal buildings after the postponement by the senate it was intended to bring on the reconsideration of that vote but the hurry at winding up their session prevented it they have not chosen a federal senator thomas jefferson april         philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states j

 th of feb mr short informs me that he has received a letter from m de montmorin announcing to him that the king has named ternant his minister here the questions on our tobacco  oil have taken unfavorable turns the former will pay  0 livres the thousand weight less when carried in french than foreign     bottoms oil is to pay twelve livres a kental which amounts to a prohibition of the common oils the only kind carried there tobacco will not feel the effect of these measures till time will be given to bring it to rights they had only  0000 hhds in the kingdom in novemb last  they consume  000 hhds a month so that they must immediately come forward  make great purchases  not having as yet vessels of their own to carry it they must pay the extra duties on ours i have been puzzled about the delays required by mr barclays affairs he gives me reason to be tolerably assured that he will go in the first vessel which shall sail after the last day of may there is no vessel at present whose destination would suit believing that even with this we shall get the business done sooner than thro any other channel i have thought it best not to change the plan—the last leyden gazettes give us what would have been the first object of the british arms had the rupture with spain taken place you know that admiral cornish had sailed on an unknown destination before the convention was received in london immediately on its receipt they sent an express after him to madeira in hopes of finding him there he was gone  had so short a passage that in    days he had arrived in barbadoes the general rendezvous all the troops of the islands were collecting there and genl matthews was on his way from antigua to take command of the land operations when he met with the packet boat which carried the counterorders trinidad was the object of the expedition matthews returned     to antigua  cornish is arrived in england this island at the mouth of the oronoko is admirably situated for a lodgment from which all the country up that river  all the northern coast of south america spanish french dutch  portuguese may be suddenly assailed colo pickering is now here  will set out in two or three days to meet the indians as mentioned in my last—the intimation to colo beckwith has been given by mr madison he met it on very different ground from that on which he had placed it with colo hamilton he pretended ignorance  even disbelief of the fact when told that it was out of doubt he said he was positively sure the distribution of arms had been without the knowlege and against the orders of lo dorchester  of the government he endeavored to induce a formal communication from me when he found that could not be effected he let mr madison perceive that he thought however informal his character he had not been sufficiently noticed said he was in n york before i came into office and that tho he had not been regularly turned over to me yet i knew his character in fine he promised to write to lo dorchester the general information we had received  our sense of it and he saw that his former apologies to colo hamilton had not been satisfactory to the government—nothing further from moose island nor the posts on the northern border of newyork nor anything of the last week from the western country arthur campbell has been here he is the enemy   0 of p henry he says the yazoo bargain is like to drop with the consent of the purchasers he explains it thus they expected to pay for the lands in public paper at par which they had bought at half a crown the pound since the rise in the value of the public paper they have gained as much on that as they would have done by investing it in the yazoo lands perhaps more as it puts a large sum of specie at their command which they can turn to better account they are therefore likely to acquiesce under the determination of the government of georgia to consider the contract as forfeited by nonpayment—i direct this letter to be forwarded from charleston to cambden the next will be from petersburg to taylors ferry and after that i shall direct to you at mount vernon thomas jefferson may

have a pair of puppies of the shepherds dog selected for the president a committee of the philosophical society is charged with collecting materials for the natural history of the hessian fly i do not think that of the weavil of virginia has been yet sufficiently detailed what do you think of beginning to turn your attention to this insect in order to give its history to the phil society it would require some summers observations—bartram here tells me that it is one  the same insect which by depositing its egg in the young plumbs apricots nectarines  peaches renders them gummy  good for nothing he promises to shew me the insect this summer—i long to be free for pursuits of this kind instead of the detestable ones in which i am now labouring without pleasure to myself or profit to

detachment of colo floyd which consisted of between     000 men the latter lost most of his baggage  artillery and retreated under the pursuit of the enemy the loss of men is pretended by their own papers to have been   or  00 only but the loss and character of the officers killed makes one suspect that the situation has been such as to force the best officers to expose themselves the most  consequently that more men must have fallen the main body with general meedons at their head are pretended to be going on boldly yet ld cornwallis is going to take the field in person this shews that affairs are in such a situation as to give anxiety upon the whole the account received thro paris proves true notwithstanding the minister had declared to the house of commons in his place that the public accounts were without foundation  that nothing amiss had happened     our loan in amsterdam for  ½ million of florins filled in two hours  a half after it was opened the vicepresident leaves us tomorrow we are told that mr morris gets £ 0000 sterl for the lands he has sold a mr noble has been here from the country where they are busied with the sugar maple tree he thinks mr cooper will bring  000 £s worth to market this season and gives the most flattering calculations of what may be done in that way he informs me of another very satisfactory fact that less profit is made by converting the juice into spirit than into sugar he gave me specimens of the spirit which is exactly whiskey i have arrived at baltimore from marseilles  0 olive trees of the best kind from marseilles  a box of

president of the united states d s mss philadelphia may        sir —the last week does not furnish one single public event worthy communicating to you so that     i have only to say all is well paines answer to burkes pamphlet begins to produce some squibs in our public papers in fennos paper they are burkites in the others painites one of fennos was evidently from the author of the discourses on davila i am afraid the indiscretion of a printer has committed me with my friend mr adams for whom as one of the most honest  disinterested men alive i have a cordial esteem increased by long habits of concurrence in opinion in the days of his republicanism and even since his apostacy to hereditary monarchy  nobility tho we differ we differ as friends should do beckley had the only copy of paines pamphlet  lent it to me desiring when i should have read it that i would send it to a mr j b smith who had asked it for his brother to reprint it being an utter stranger to j b smith both by sight  character i wrote a note to explain to him why i a stranger to him sent him a pamphlet to wit that mr beckley had desired it  to take off a little of the dryness of the note i added that i was glad to find it was to be reprinted that something would at length be publicly said against the political heresies which had lately sprung up among us  that i did not doubt our citizens would rally again round the standard of common sense that i had in my view the discourses on davila which have filled fennos papers for a twelvemonth without contradiction is certain but nothing was ever further from my thoughts than to become myself the contradictor before the public to my great astonishment however when the     pamphlet came out the printer had prefixed my note to it without having given me the most distant hint of it mr adams will unquestionably take to himself the charge of political heresy as conscious of his own views of drawing the present government to the form of the english constitution and i fear will consider me as meaning to injure him in the public eye i learn that some anglo men have censured it in another point of view as a sanction of paines principles tends to give offence to the british government their real fear however is that this popular  republican pamphlet taking wonderfully is likely at a single stroke to wipe out all the unconstitutional doctrines which their bellweather davila has been preaching for a twelvemonth i certainly never made a secret of my being antimonarchical  antiaristocratical but i am sincerely mortified to be thus brought forward on the public stage where to remain to advance or to retire will be equally against my love of silence  quiet  my abhorrence of dispute—i do not know whether you recollect that the records of virginia were destroyed by the british in the year      particularly the transactions of the revolution before that time i am collecting here all the letters i wrote to congress while i was in the administration there and this being done i shall then extend my views to the transactions of my predecessors in order to replace the whole in the public offices in virginia i think that during my administration say between june         june        i had the honor of writing frequent letters to you on public affairs which perhaps may be among     your papers at mount vernon would it be consistent with any general resolution you have formed as to your papers to let my letters of the above period come here to be copied in order to make them a part of the records i am endeavoring to restore for the state or would their selection be too troublesome if not i would beg the loan of them under an assurance that they shall be taken the utmost care of  safely returned to their present deposit the quiet  regular movements of our political affairs leaves nothing to add but constant prayers for your health  welfare and assurances of the sincere respect  attachment of sir your most obedient  most humble servt thomas jefferson may        philadelphia james madison to james madison j mss philadelphia may        dear sir —your favor of the  st came to hand on the  d mr freneau has

can be through them by the end of the week in which case i will be with you by tuesday or wednesday if nothing new comes in to delay me rittenhouse will probably not go he says he cannot find a good horse i shall propose to you when we back about from the extremity of our journey instead of coming back the same way to cross over through vermont to connecticut river  down that to newhaven then through longisland     to n y  so to philade be this however as you will our news from virginia is principally of deaths to wit colo b harrison of barclay turner southall dixon the printer colo overton of hanover walker gilmer son of the doctor a peter randolph of chatsworth has had a fit of madness which he has recovered from wheat has suffered by drought yet it is tolerably good the fruit not entirely killed—at this place little new f hopkinson lies at extremities with regular epileptic fits from which they think he cannot recover colo hamilton set out today for bethlehem have you seen the philadelphia edn of paines pamphlet you know you left beckleys copy in my hands he called on me for it before i had quite finished it  desired me when done to send it to j b smith whose brother was to reprint it when i was proceeding to send it i found it necessary to write a note to mr smith to explain why i a perfect stranger to him sent him the pamphlet i mentioned it to be by the desire of mr beckley  to take off a little of the dryness of the note added currente calamo that i was pleased to find it was to be reprinted here that something was at length to be publicly said against the political heresies which had of late sprung up among us not doubting but that our citizens would rally again round the standard of common sense i thought no more of this  heard no more till the pamphlet appeared to my astonishment with my note at the head of it i never saw j b smith or the printer either before or since i had in view certainly the doctrines of davila i tell the writer     freely that he is a heretic but certainly never meant to step into a public newspaper with that in my mouth i have just reason therefore to think he will be displeased colo hamilton  colo beckwith are openmouthed against me taking it in another view as likely to give offence to the court of london h adds further that it makes my opposition to the government thus endeavoring to turn upon the government itself those censures i meant for the enemies of the government to wit those who want to change it into a monarchy i have reason to think he has been unreserved in uttering these sentiments i send you some letters received for you adieu thomas jefferson may         philadelphia benjamin vaughan to benjamin vaughan j mss philadelphia may         dear sir —it is rare that my public occupations will permit me to take up the pen for my private correspondencies however desirable to me this must be my apology for being so late in acknowleging the receipt of your favors of sep    oct    dec        jan   the parcels of mountain rice from timor came to hand too late in the last season to produce seed i have sowed this spring some of the same but it has not yet come up i was fortunate in receiving from the coast of africa last fall a cask of mountain rice of the last years growth this i have dispersed into many hands having sent the mass of it to s carolina the information which accompanied this cask was that they have there   0 on the coast of africa   kinds of mountain rice which sowed at the same time comes to harvest a month distant from each other they did not say of which kind that is which was sent to me the kind which ripens quickest will surely find sun enough to ripen it in our middle states i thank you my dear sir for the sacontalá and for smeetons book but the latter is of a value which obliged me to request you to put more reasonable bounds to your liberalities neither the state of the sciences nor of the arts here putting it in my power to fulfil that reciprocity which my wishes would lead me to the revolution of france does not astonish me so much as the revolution of mr burke i wish i could believe the latter proceeded from as pure motives as the former but what demonstration could scarcely have established before less than the hints of dr priestly  mr paine establish firmly now how mortifying that this evidence of the rottenness of his mind must oblige us now to ascribe to wicked motives those actions of his life which wore the mark of virtue  patriotism to judge from what we see published we must believe that the spirit of toryism has gained nearly the whole of the nation that the whig principles are utterly extinguished except in the breasts of certain descriptions of dissenters this sudden change in the principles of a nation would be a curious morsel in the history of man—we have some names of note here who have apostatised from the true faith but they are few indeed and the body of our citizens pure  insusceptible of taint in their republicanism mr paines     answer to burke will be a refreshing shower to their minds it would bring england itself to reason  revolution if it was permitted to be read there however the same things will be said in milder forms will make their way among the people  you must reform at last we have great reason to be satisfied with the train of our affairs our government is going on with a firm  steady pace our taxes increasing with our population are always ahead of our calculations favorable seasons for several years past have given great crops of produce and the increase of industry economy  domestic manufacture are very sensible our credit both at home  abroad equal to our wishes so that on the whole we are in as prosperous a way as a nation can well be this shews the advantage of the changeableness of a constitution had our former one been unalterable pardon the absurdity of the hypothesis we must have gone to ruin with our eyes open—we are in hopes the operations of this summer will bring our savage neighbors to accept our peace friendship  good offices which is all we desire of them if you see ld wycombe sometimes present my esteem to him

and i have been longer than common without any letters from mr short colo hamilton has taken a trip to bethlehem i think to avail myself also of the present interval of quiet to get rid of a head ach which is very trouble some by giving more exercise to the body  less to the mind i shall set out tomorrow for new york where mr madison is waiting for me to go up the north river  return down connecticut river and through longisland my progress up the north river will be limited by the time i allot for my whole journey which is a month so that i shall turn about when ever that renders it necessary i leave orders in case a letter should come from you covering the commission for colo eveleighs successor that it should be opened the great seal put to it and then given out my countersign may be added on my return i presume i shall be back here about the time of your arrival at mount vernon where you will receive this letter the death of judge hopkinson has made a vacancy for you to

it come here i shall be obliged to send it back again to richmond which will cost a dollar a hundred the coming  going i am afraid my letter of feb   to mr lewis never got to hand the objects of it were to inform him of the sale of my tobo here to press a final settlement of my bargain with ronald and to advertise the elkhill lands for sale not having seen the advertisement in daviess paper has excited my fear that the letter miscarried perhaps it may have been put into some other paper for fear it should have miscarried i will add the same form for the advertisement at the end of this letter that of feb   was important for the other two objects also it certainly ought to have got to hand before the date of your letter of apr   wherein you say he was still waiting my directions relative to the tobo i set out tomorrow on a journey to lakes george  champlain down connecticut river  through long island back to n york  this place so that you will not hear from me for a month to come i inclose you baches as well as fennos papers you will have perceived that the latter is a paper of pure toryism disseminating the doctrines of monarchy aristocracy  the exclusion of the influence of the people we have been trying to get another weekly or half weekly paper set up excluding advertisements so that it might go through the states  furnish a whig vehicle of intelligence we hoped at one time     to have persuaded freneau to set up here but failed in the mean time baches paper the principles of which were always republican improves in its matter if we can persuade him to throw all his advertisements on one leaf by tearing that off the leaf containing intelligence may be sent without overcharging the post  be generally taken instead of fennos i will continue to send it

affectionately thomas jefferson may   st      lake champlain martha jefferson randolph to martha jefferson randolph  lake champlain may   st      my dear martha —i wrote to maria while sailing on lake george and the same kind of leisure is afforded me today to write to you lake george is without comparison the most beautiful water i ever saw formed by a contour of mountains into a basin thirty five miles long and from two or four miles broad finely interspersed with islands its water limpid as crystal and the mountain sides covered with rich groves of thuja silver fir white pine aspen and paper birch down to the wateredge here and there precipices of rock to checker the scene and save it from monotony an abundance of speckled trout salmon trout bass and other fish with which it is stored have added to our other amusements     the sport of taking them lake champlain though much larger is a far less pleasant water it is muddy turbulent and yields little game after penetrating into it about twentyfive miles we have been obliged by a head wind and a high sea to return having spent a day and a half in sailing on it we shall take our route again through lake george pass through vermont down connecticut river through long island to new york and philadelphia our journey has hitherto been prosperous and pleasant except as to the weather which has been as sultry and hot through the whole as could be found in carolina or georgia i suspect indeed that the heats of the northern climates may be more powerful than those of southern ones in proportion as they are shorter perhaps vegetation required this there is as much fever and ague too and other bilious complaints on lake champlain as on the swamps of carolina strawberries here are in the blossom or just formed with you i suppose the season is over on the whole i find nothing anywhere else in point of climate which virginia need envy to any part of the world here they are locked up in snow and ice for six months spring and autumn which make a paradise of our country are rigorous winter with them and a tropical summer breaks on them all at once when we consider how much climate contributes to the happiness of our condition by the fine sensations it excites and the productions it is the parent of we have reason to value highly the accident of birth in such a one as that of virginia     from this distance i can have little domestic to write to you about i must always repeat how much i love you kiss the little anne for me i hope she grows lustily enjoys good health and will make us all and long happy as the centre of our common love adieu my dear thomas jefferson june        bennington george washington to the president of the united states d s mss bennington june        sir —in my last letter from philadelphia i mentioned that mr madison  myself were about to take a trip up the north river as far as circumstances should permit the levelness of the roads led us quite on to lake george where taking boat we went through that and about    miles into lake champlain returning then to saratoga we concluded to cross over thro vermont to connecticut river and go down that instead of the north river which we had already seen and we are so far on that rout in the course of our journey we have had opportunities of visiting stillwater saratoga forts wm henry  george ticonderoga crown point  the scene of genl starkes victory i have availed myself of such opportunities as occurred to enquire into the grounds of the report that something disagreeable had taken place in the vicinities of the british posts it seems to have been the following incident they had held a small post at a block house on the north hero an island on the vermont side of lake champlain      something further south than their principal post at the point au fer the maria hitherto stationed at the latter for customhouse purposes was sent to the blockhouse  there exercised her usual visits on boats passing to  from canada this being an exercise of power further within our jurisdiction became the subject of notice  clamour with our citizens in that quarter the vessel has been since recalled to the point au fer  being unfit for service a new one is to be built to perform her functions this she has usually done at the point au fer with a good deal of vigour bringing all vessels to at that place  some times under such circumstances of wind  weather as to have occasioned the loss of two vessels  cargoes these circumstances produce strong sensations in that quarter  not friendly to the character of our government the establishment of a customhouse at albany nearly opposite to point au fer has given the british considerable alarm a groundless story of  00 americans seen in arms near point au fer has been the cause or the pretext of their reinforcing that place a few days ago with a company of men from st johns it is said here they have called in their guard from the blockhouse but the information is not direct enough to command entire belief on enquiring into the dispositions in canada on the subject of the projected form of government there we learn that they are divided into two parties the english who desire something like an english constitution but so modelled as to oblige the french to chuse a certain proportion of english representatives      the french who wish a continuance of the french laws moderated by some engraftments from the english code the judge of their common pleas heads the former party  smith the chief justice secretly guides the latter we encounter the green mountains tomorrow with cavalry in part disabled so as to render our progress a little uncertain i presume however i shall be in philadelphia in a fortnight thomas jefferson june        bennington thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph j mss bennington in vermont june        dear sir —mr madison  myself are so far on the tour we had projected we have visited in the course of it the principal scenes of genl burgoynes misfortunes to wit the grounds at stillwater where the action of that name was fought  particularly the breastworks which cost so much blood to both parties the encampments at saratoga  ground where the british piled their arms the field of the battle of bennington about   miles from this place we have also visited forts wm henry  george ticonderoga crown point c which have been scenes of blood from a very early part of our history we were more pleased however with the botanical objects which continually presented themselves those either unknown or rare in virgna were the sugar maple in vast abundance the silver fir white pine pitch pine spruce pine a shrub with decumbent stems which they call juniper an azalea very     different from the nudiflora with very large clusters of flowers more thickly set on the branches of a deeper red  high pinkfragrance it is the richest shrub i have seen the honeysuckle of the gardens growing wild on the banks of l george the paperbirch an aspen with a velvet leaf a shrubwillow with downy catkins a wild gooseberry the wild cherry with single fruit not the bunch cherry strawberries in abundance from the highlands to the lakes it is a limestone country it is in vast quantities on the eastern sides of the lakes but none on the western sides the sandy hill falls  wings falls two very remarkable cataracts of the hudson of about    f or  0 f each between f edward  f george are of limestone in horizontal strata those of the cohoes on the w side of the hudson  of  0 f height we thought not of limestone we have met with a small red squirrel of the color of our foxsquirrel with a black stripe on each side weighing about   oz generally and in such abundance on l champlain particularly as that twenty odd were killed at the house we lodged in opposite crown point the morning we arrived there without going  0 yards from the door we killed   crossing the lakes one of them just as he was getting ashore where it was   miles wide  where with the high wind then blowing he must have made it   or   miles i think i asked the favr of you to send for anthony in the season for inoculn as well as to do what is necessary in the orchard as to pursue the object of inoculating all the spontaneous cherry trees in the fields with good fruit   0 we have now got over about  00 miles of our tour and have still about   0 more to go over arriving here on the saturday evening and the laws of the state not permitting us to travel on the sunday has given me time to write to you from hence i expect to

d s mss philadelphia june  0      sir —    the papers from the free people of colour in grenada which you did me the honour to inclose i apprehend it will be best to take no notice of they are parties in a domestic quarrel which i think we should leave to be settled among themselves nor should i think it desireable were it justifiable to draw a body of sixty thousand free blacks  mulattoes into our country the instructions from the government of the united netherlands by which mr shaw has suffered merit serious notice the channel thro which application shall be made is the only difficulty dumas being personally disagreeable to that government however either thro him or some other it should certainly be conveyed mr remsen had unluckily sent off to new york all my letters on the very day of my arrival here which puts it out of my power to give you the state of things brought by the last packet i expect they     will be returned tomorrow  that my next may communicate to you whatever they contain interesting i received yesterday a letter from colo ternant informing me of his appointment  that he should sail about the latter end of may the court of madrid has sent over a don joseph jaudenes as a joint commissioner with de viar till a charge shall be named he presented me the letter of credence from the count de florida blanca when i was at new york he is a young man who was under secretary to mr gardoqui when here our tour was performed in somewhat less time than i had calculated i have great hopes it has rid me of my head ach having scarcely had any thing of it during

mad mss philadelphia june         dear sir —i arrived here on sunday evening yesterday i sent your note to leiper who immediately called and paid the  00 dollars which i have exchanged for a post note  now inclose i mentioned to the atty gen that i had a note on him  afterwards sent it to him saying nothing as to time i inclose you also a post note for    dollars to make up my deficit of expenses       d to pay mr elsworth  the smith  also to get me from rivington hamilton mores practical navigator if his be     the  th edn as i believe it is this is the best edn revised  printed under the authors eye the later edn are so incorrect as to be worth nothing the president will leave mt vernon on the   th he will be stayed a little at georgetown—colo h lee is here he gives a very different account from carrington of the disposition of the upper country of virginia towards the excise law—he thinks resistance possible i am sorry we did not bring with us some leaves of the different plants which struck our attention as it is the leaf which principally decides specific differences you may still have it in your power to repair the omission in some degree the balsam tree at govr robinsons is the balsam poplar populus balsamifera of linnæus the arolea i can only suspect to be the viscosa because i find but two kinds the nudiflora viscosa acknoleged to grow with us i am sure it is not the nudiflora the white pine is the pinus strobus i will thank you if in your journey northward you will continue the enquiries relative to the hessian fly  note them the post is almost on its departure so adieu thomas jefferson june         philadelphia david humphreys to the u s minister to portugal david humphreys j mss philadelphia june         dear sir —    as yet no native candidate such altogether as we would wish has offered for the consulate of lisbon and as it is a distinguished     place in our commerce we are somewhat more difficult in that than other appointments very considerable discouragements are recently established by france spain  england with respect to our commerce the first as to whale oil tobacco  ships the second as to corn  the third as to corn  ships should these regulations not be permanent still they add to the proofs that too little reliance is to be had on a steady  certain course of commerce with the countries of europe to permit us to depend more on that than we cannot avoid our best interest would be to employ our principal labour in agriculture because to the profits of labour which is dear this adds the profits of our lands which are cheap but the risk of hanging our prosperity on the fluctuating counsels  caprices of others renders it wise in us to turn seriously to manufactures and if europe will not let us carry our provisions to their manufactures we must endeavor to bring their manufactures to our provisions a very uncommon drought has prevailed thro most of the states so that our crops of wheat will be considerably shorter than common our public paper continues high and the proofs that our credit is now the first in europe are unequivocal the indians north of the ohio have hitherto continued their cattle depredations but we are in daily expectation of hearing the success of a first excursion to their towns by a party of   or  00 mounted infantry under genl scott two or three similar expeditions will follow successively under other officers while a principal one is prepairing to take place at a later season     i thank you for your communication from mr carmichael his letter of jan    is still the only one we have from him until some surer means of hearing from madrid can be devised i must beg of you to give us from time to time all the intelligence you can from that capital the conveyance by the british packets is tolerably sure when direct conveyances fail you will receive herewith a continuation of the newspapers for yourself as also a letter  newspapers for mr carmichael which i must beg the favour of you to convey as safely as you can the president is expected here the beginning of the ensuing month being arrived at mt vernon on his return from his southern tour thomas jefferson

stage with respect to the edition of hamilton mores book i took pains to satisfy myself of the best edition when i was in a better situation than i now am to do it with success the result was that the  th edn was the last published under the examination of the author  that the subsequent editions in order to cheapen them had been so carelessly supervised as to be full of typographical errors in the tables i therefore prefer waiting till i can get the  th i learned further that     after the  th edn the author abandoned all attention to the work himself i inclose you the pamphlet on the banks and must trouble you to procure a pamphlet for me which is only in a private hand in n york this is a description of the genisee country but more particularly of mr morriss purchase of goreham  phelps in  to with a map  it was printed in london under the agency of w t franklin to captivate purchasers there is no name to it colo smith brought in   copies if one of them can be drawn from him i should be very glad of it will you also be so good as to ask of him whether he can give me any information of the progress of the map of s america which he at my request put into the hands of an engraver the french proceedings against our tobo  ships are very eccentric  unwise with respect to the former however which you consider as a commencement of hostilities against the brit navign act it is only a continuation of the decision of the council of berni since which the importn of tobo into france in any but american or french bottoms has been prohibited the spanish as well as english proceedings against our commerce are also serious nobody doubts here who is the author of publicola any more than of davila he is very indecently attacked in browns  baches papers from my european letters i am inclined to think peace will take place between the     porte  russia the article which separates them is so minute that it will probably be got over  the war is so unpopular in england that the ministers will probably make that an excuse to the k of prussia for not going all lengths with him his only object is thorn  dantzic  he has secretly intimated at petersbg that if he could be accommodated with this he would not be tenacious against their keeping ozakoff this has leaked out  is working duly in poland i think the president will contrive to be on the road out of the reach of ceremony till after the  th of july adieu my dear sir thomas jefferson june  0      richard peters to richard peters  june  0      i should sooner have answered your kind note my dear sir but that i had hoped to meet you the day before yesterday and to tell you vivâ voce that even without that i meant to be troublesome to you in my afternoon excursions that being the part of the day which business and long habit have allotted to exercise with me i shall certainly feel often enough the inducements to belmont among the chief of which will be your society and the desire of becoming acquainted with mrs peters call on me in your turn whenever you come to town and if it should be about the hour of three i shall rejoice the more you will find a bad dinner a good glass of wine and a host thankful for your favor and desirous of     encouraging repetitions of it without number form or ceremony when madison returns you will often find him here without notice  always with it and if you complain again of not seeing him it will be that the place of rendesvous does not enjoy your favour he is at present in new york undecided as to his next movement adieu thomas jefferson july        philadelphia james madison to james madison j mss philadelphia july        dear sir —i have duly received your favours of june     july   the last came only this morning i now return colo smiths map

thomas jefferson july  0      philadelphia james madison to james madison mad mss philadelphia july  0      my dear sir —your indisposition at the date of your last and hearing nothing from you since make me fear it has continued the object of the present is merely to know how you do  from another hand if you are not well enough we have little now but what you will see in the public papers—you see there the swarm of antipublicolas the disavowal by a printer only does not appear to satisfy  we have no news yet of the event of scotts expedition the marquis fayette has certainly resumed his command  on a ground which must strengthen him  also the public cause the subscriptions to the bank from virginia were almost none pickett mcclurg  dr lee are the only names i have heard mentioned this gives so much uneasiness to colo h that he thinks to propose to the president to sell some of the public shares to subscribers from virge  n caroline if any more should offer this partiality would offend the other states without pleasing those two for i presume they would rather the capitals of their citizens should be employed in commerce than be locked up in a strong box here nor can sober thinkers prefer a paper medium at    per cent interest to gold  silver for nothing adieu my dear friend yours affectionately p s osgood is resigning the postmasters place i shall press paine for

the lodgings langdon had but the landlord is doubtful whether he will let them at all if he will not i will endeavor to do the best i can i can accommodate you myself with a stable  coach house without any expense as i happen to have two on hand and indeed in my new one i have had stalls enough prepared for   horses which are   more than i keep of my success in procuring rooms i shall bring you news myself tho as yet the time of my visit to albemarle is unfixed mr madison will both go  come with me he is at present at new york his journey with me to the lakes placed him in better health than i have seen him but the late heats have brought on some bilious dispositions the papers which i send mr randolph weekly  which i presume you see will have shown you what a dust paines pamphlet has kicked up here my last to mr randolph will have given an explanation as to myself which i had not time to give when i sent you the pamphlet a writer under the name of publicola in attacking all paines principles is very desirous of involving me in the same censure with the author i certainly merit the same for i profess the same principles but it is equally certain i never meant to have entered as a volunteer into the cause my occupations do not permit it some persons here are insinuating that i am brutus that i am agricola that i am philodemus c c i     am none of them being decided not to write a word on the subject unless any printed imputation should call for a printed disavowal to which i should put my name a boston paper has declared that mr adams has no more concern in the publication of the writings of publicola than the author of the rights of man himself if the equivoque here were not intended the disavowal is not entirely credited because not from mr adams himself  because the stile  sentiments raise so strong a presumption besides to produce any effect he must disavow davila  the defence of the american constitutions a host of writers have risen in favor of paine  prove that in this quarter at least the spirit of republicanism is sound the contrary spirit of the high officers of the government is more understood than i expected colo hamilton avowing that he never made a secret of his principles yet taxes the imprudence of mr adams in having stirred the question and agrees that his business is done jay covering the same principles under the vail of silence is rising steadily on the ruins of his friends the bank filled  overflowed in the moment it was opened instead of  0 thousand shares    thousand were offered  a great many unpresented who had not suspected that so much haste was necessary thus it is that we shall be paying    per cent per ann for   millions of paper money instead of having that circulation of gold  silver for nothing experience has proved to us that a dollar of silver disappears for every dollar of paper emitted and for the paper emitted from the bank   per cent profits will be     received by the subscribers for it as bank paper according to the last division of profits by the philadelphia bank and   per cent on the public paper of which it is the representative nor is there any reason to believe that either the   millions of public paper or the   millions of specie deposited will not be suffered to be withdrawn and the paper thrown into circulation the cash deposited by strangers for safe keeping will probably suffice for cash demands very few subscribers have offered from virginia or n carolina which gives uneasiness to h it is impossible to say where the appetite for gambling will stop the landoffice the federal town certain schemes of manufacture are all likely to be converted into aliment for that rage—but this subject is too copious for a letter and must be reserved for conversation—the respite from occupation which my journey procured has entirely removed my headaches kiss and bless mrs monroe  eliza for dear sir yours affectionately thomas jefferson july         philadelphia john adams to john adams j mss philadelphia july         dear sir —i have a dozen times taken up my pen to write to you  as often laid it down again suspended between opposing considerations i determine however to write from a conviction that truth between candid minds can never do harm the first of paines pamphlets on the rights of man which came to hand here belonged to mr beckley he lent it to mr madison who lent it to me and     while i was reading it mr beckley called on me for it  as i had not finished it he desired me as soon as i should have done so to send it to mr jonathan b smith whose brother meant to reprint it i finished reading it and as i had no acquaintance with mr jonathan b smith propriety required that i should explain to him why i a stranger to him sent him the pamphlet i accordingly wrote a note of compliment informing him that i did it at the desire of mr beckley  to take off a little of the dryness of the note i added that i was glad it was to be reprinted here  that something was to be publicly said against the political heresies which had sprung up among us c i thought so little of this note that i did not even keep a copy of it nor ever heard a title more of it till the week following i was thunderstruck with seeing it come out at the head of the pamphlet  i hoped however it would not attract notice but i found on my return from a journey of a month that a writer came forward under the signature of publicola attacking not only the author  principles of the pamphlet but myself as its sponsor by name soon after came hosts of other writers defending the pamphlet  attacking     you by name as the writer of publicola thus were our names thrown on the public stage as public antagonists that you  i differ in our ideas of the best form of government is well known to us both but we have differed as friends should do respecting the purity of each others motives  confining our difference of opinion to private conversation and i can declare with truth in the presence of the almighty that nothing was further from my intention or expectation than to have either my own or your name brought before the public on this occasion the friendship  confidence which has so long existed between us required this explanation from me  i know you too well to fear any misconstruction of the motives of it some people here who would wish me to be or to be thought guilty of improprieties have suggested that i was agricola that i was brutus c c i never did in my life either by myself or by any other have a sentence of mine inserted in a newspaper without putting my name to it  i believe i never shall while the empress is refusing peace under a mediation unless crakow  its territory be ceded to her she is offering peace on the perfect statu quo to the porte if they will conclude it without a mediation france has struck a severe blow at our navigation by a difference of duty on tobo carried in our  their ships  by taking from foreign built ships the capability of naturalization she has placed our whale oil on rather a better footing than ever by consolidating the duties into a single one of   livres they amounted before to some sous over that sum i am     told i know not how truly that england has prohibited our spermaceti oil altogether  will prohibit our wheat till the price there is    the quarter which it almost never is we expect hourly to hear the true event of genl scotts expedition reports give favorable hopes of it be so good as to present my respectful compliments to mrs adams  to accept

the president is indisposed with the same blind tumour  in the same place which he had the year before last in new york as yet it does not promise either to suppurate or be discussed he is obliged to lye constantly on his side  has at times a little fever the young grandson has had a long  dangerous fever he is thought better today no news yet from genl scott nor anything from europe worth

edmund pendleton to edmund pendleton j mss philadelphia july         dear sir —i received duly your favour of the   th and communicated it to the president the titles of your relation were unquestionably strong of themselves  still strengthened by your recommendation but the place was before proposed to another whose acceptance will probably fix it the president is indisposed with a tumour like what he had in new york the year before last it does not as yet seem as if it would come to a head we are wonderfully slow in receiving news from genl scott the common accounts give reason to hope his expedition has succeeded well you will have seen the rapidity with which the subscriptions to the bank were filled as yet the delirium of speculation is too strong to admit sober reflection it remains to be seen whether in a country whose capital is too small to carry on its own commerce to establish manufactures erect buildings c such sums should have been withdrawn from these useful pursuits to be employed in gambling whether it was well judged to force on the public a paper circulation of so many millions for which they will be paying about   per cent per ann  thereby banish as many millions of gold  silver for which they would have paid no interest i am afraid it is the     intention to nourish this spirit of gambling by throwing in from time to time new aliment the question of war  peace in europe is still doubtful the french revolution proceeds steadily  is i think beyond the danger of accident of every kind the success of that will ensure the progress of liberty in europe and its preservation here the failure of that would have been a powerful argument with those who wish to introduce a king lords  commons here a sect which is all head and

you charge it on the ground of abandoning any claim to an outfit if you continue in europe an outfit will certainly be allowed you if you do not still a partial allowance may be justly claimed in whatever form i receive your account i will take the liberty of modelling it so as to preserve to you every interest which justice and usage will admit with respect to the expences of your journey to

france william short philadelphia july         dear sir —    the difference of    0 the hogshead established by the national assembly on tobacco brought in their and our ships is such an act of hostility against our navigation as was not to have been expected from the friendship of that nation it is as new in its nature as extravagant in its degree since it is unexampled that any nation has endeavoured to wrest from another the carriage of its own produce except in the case of their colonies the british navigation act so much and so justly complained of leaves to all nations the carriage of their own commodities free this measure too is calculated expressly to take our own carriage from us and give the equivalent to other nations for it is well known that the shipping of france is not equal to the carriage of their whole commerce but the freight in other branches of navigation being on an equal footing with only  0 the hogshead in ours and this new arrangement giving them    0 the hogshead in addition to their freight that is to say  0  0 instead of  0 their vessels will leave every other branch of business to fill up this they will consequently leave a void in those other branches which will be occupied by english dutch and swedes on the spot they complain of our tonnage duty but it is because it is not understood in the ports of france we pay fees for anchorage buoys and beacons fees to measurers weighers and guagers and in some     countries for lighthouses we have thought it better that the public here should pay all these and reimburse itself by a consolidation of them into one fee proportioned to the tonnage of the vessel and therefore called by that name they complain that the foreign tonnage is higher than the domestic if this complaint had come from the english it would not have been wonderful because the foreign tonnage operates really as a tax on their commerce which under this name is found to pay   ½ dollars for every dollar paid by france it was not conceived that the latter would have complained of a measure calculated to operate so unequally on her rival—and i still suppose she would not complain if the thing were well understood the refusing to our vessels the faculty of becoming national bottoms on sale to their citizens was never before done by any nation but england i cannot help hoping that these were wanderings of a moment founded in misinformation which reflection will have corrected before you receive this whenever jealousies are expressed as to any supposed views of ours on the dominion of the west indies you cannot go farther than the truth in asserting we have none if there be one principle more deeply rooted than any other in the mind of every american it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest as to commerce indeed we have strong sensations in casting our eyes over the earth we see no instance of a nation forbidden as we are by foreign powers to deal with neighbours and obliged with them to carry into another hemisphere the mutual supplies necessary to     relieve mutual wants this is not merely a question between the foreign power and our neighbour we are interested in it equally with the latter and nothing but moderation at least with respect to us can render us indifferent to its continuance an exchange of surplusses and wants between neighbour nations is both a right and a duty under the moral law and measures against right should be mollified in their exercise if it be wished to lengthen them to the greatest term possible circumstances sometimes require that rights the most unquestionable should be advanced with delicacy it would seem that the one now spoken of would need only a mention to be assented to by any unprejudiced mind but with respect to america europeans in general have been too long in the habit of confounding force with right the marquis de la fayette stands in such a relation between the two countries that i should think him perfectly capable of seizing what is just as to both perhaps on some occasion of free conversation you might find an opportunity of impressing these truths on his mind and that from him they might be let out at a proper moment as matters meriting consideration and weight when they shall be engaged in the work of forming a constitution for our neighbours in policy if not in justice they should be disposed to avoid oppression which falling on us as well as on their colonies might tempt us to act together  the element of measure adopted by the national assembly excludes ipso facto every nation on earth     from a communion of measure with them for they acknowledge themselves that a due proportion for admeasurement of a meridian crossing the   th degree of latitude and terminating at both ends in the same level can be found in no other country on earth but theirs it would follow then that other nations must trust to their admeasurement or send persons into their country to make it themselves not only in the first instance but when ever afterwards they may wish to verify their measures instead of concurring then in a measure which like the pendulum may be found in every point of the   th degree and through both hemispheres and consequently in all the countries of the earth lying under that parallel either northern or southern they adopt one which can be found but in a single point of the northern parallel and consequently only in one country and that country is theirs i left with you a statement of the case of schweighauser  dobrée with the original vouchers on which it depends from these you will have known that being authorized by congress to settle this matter i began by offering to them an arbitration before honest and judicious men of a neutral nation they declined this  had the modesty to propose an arbitration before merchants of their own town i gave them warning then that as the offer on the part of a sovereign nation to submit to a private arbitration was an unusual condescendence if they did not accept it then it would not be repeated and that the united states would judge the case for themselves hereafter they continued to decline it and     the case now stands thus the territorial judge of france has undertaken to call the united states to its jurisdiction and has arrested their property in order to enforce appearance and possess themselves of a matter whereon to found a decree but no court can have jurisdiction over a sovereign nation this position was agreed to but it was urged that some act of mr barclays had admitted the jurisdiction it was denied that there had been any such act by mr barclay and disavowed if there was one as without authority from the united states the property on which the arrest was made having been purchased by dr franklin and remaining in his possession till taken out of it by the arrest on this disavowal it was agreed that there could be no further contest and i received assurance that the property should be withdrawn from the possession of the court by an evocation of the cause before the kings council on which without other proceedings it should be delivered to the united states applications were repeated as often as dignity or even decency would permit but it was never done thus the matter rests and thus it is meant it should rest no answer of any kind is to be given to schweighauser  dobrée if they think proper to apply to their sovereign i presume there will be a communication either through you or their representative here and we shall have no difficulty to show the character of the treatment we have experienced i will observe for your information that the sustenance of our captives at algiers is committed to col humphreys     you will be so kind as to remember that your public account from the  st day of july    0 to the last of june      inclusive is desired before the meeting of congress that i may be able to lay before them the general account of the foreign fund for that year general scott has returned from a successful expedition against the northern indians having killed    warriors taken    women and children prisoners and destroyed three towns and villages with a great deal of corn in grain and growth a similar expedition was to follow immediately while preparation is making for measures of more permanent effect so that we may reasonably hope the indians will be induced to accept of peace which is all we desire our funds have risen nearly to par the eight millions for the bank was subscribed as fast as it could be written and that stock is now above par our crops of wheat have been rather abundant and of excellent quality those of tobacco are not very promising as yet the census is not yet completed but from what we hear we may expect our whole numbers will be nearer four than three millions i inclose a sketch of the numbers as far as we yet know them thomas jefferson july         philadelphia thomas paine to thomas paine j mss philadelphia july         dear sir —your favor of sep       0 did not come to my hands till feb    and i have not answered it sooner because it said you would be here     in the spring that expectation being past i now acknowlege the receipt indeed i am glad you did not come away till you had written your rights of man that has been much read here with avidity and pleasure a writer under the signature of publicola has attacked it a host of champions entered the arena immediately in your defence the discussion excited the public attention recalled it to the defence of the american constitutions and the discourses on davila which it had kindly passed over without censure in the moment and very general expressions of their sense have been now drawn forth  i thank god that they appear firm in their republicanism notwithstanding the contrary hopes  assertions of a sect here high in names but small in numbers these had flattered themselves that the silence of the people under the defence and davila was a symptom of their conversion to the doctrine of king lords  commons they are checked at least by your pamphlet  the people confirmed in their good old faith your observations on the subject of a copper coinage have satisfied my mind on that subject which i confess had wavered before between difficulties as a different plan is under consideration of congress  will be taken up at their meeting i think to watch the proper moment  publish your observations except the notes which contain facts relative to particular persons which i presume you would dislike to see published  which are not necessary to establish the main object adding your name because it will attract attention  give weight to the     publication as this cannot take place under four months there is time for you to forbid me if it should be disagreeable to you to have the observations published which however i hope it will not be genl scott has just returned from a successful expedition against the indians having killed    warriors  taken    women and children  burnt several towns i hope they will now consent to peace which is all we ask our funds are near par the crops of wheat remarkably fine and a great degree of general prosperity arising from   years successive of plentiful crops a great diffusion of domestic manufacture a return to economy  a reasonable faith in the new

president of the united states d s mss philadelphia july  0      sir —i have the honour to inclose for your perusal a letter which i have prepared for mr short the ill humour into which the french colonies are getting and the little dependance on the troops sent thither may produce a hesitation in the national assembly as to the conditions they will impose in their constitution in a moment of hesitation small matters may influence their decision they may see the impolicy of insisting on particular conditions which operating as grievances on us as well as on their colonists might produce a concert of action  00 i have thought it would not be amiss to trust to mr short the sentiments in the cyphered part of the letter leaving him to govern himself by circumstances whether to let them leak out at all or not  whether so as that it may be known or remain unknown that they come from us a perfect knowledge of his judgment  discretion leaves me entirely satisfied that they will be not used or so used as events shall render proper but if you think that the possibility that harm may be done overweighs the chance of good i would expunge them as in the case of doubt it is better to say too little than too much thomas jefferson july         philadelphia james sullivan to james sullivan j mss philadelphia july         th jefferson presents his compliments to mr sullivan  thanks him for the perusal of the pamphlet he was so kind as to send him  he sees with great pleasure every testimony to the principles of pure republicanism and every effort to preserve untouched that partition of the sovereignty which our excellent constitution has made between the general  particular governments he is firmly persuaded that it is by giving due tone to the latter that the former will be preserved in vigour also the constitution having foreseen its incompetency to all the objects of government  therefore confined it to those specially described when it shall become incompetent  0  to these also instead of flying to monarchy or that semblance of tranquillity which it is the nature of slavery to hold forth the true remedy would be a subdivision as mr sullivan observes but it is hoped that by a due poise  partition of powers between the general  particular governments we have found the secret of extending the benign blessings of republicanism over still greater tracts of country than we possess and that a subdivision may be avoided by ages if not for ever thomas jefferson august  0th      philadelphia henry knox to the secretary of war henry knox j mss philadelphia august  0th      dear sir —i have now the honor to return you the petition of mr moultrie on behalf of the south carolina yazoo company without noticing that some of the highest functions of sovereignty are assumed in the very papers which he annexes as his justification i am of opinion that government should firmly maintain this ground that the indians have a right to the occupation of their lands independent of the states within whose chartered lines they happen to be that until they cede them by treaty or other transaction equivalent to a treaty no act of a state can give a right to such lands that neither under the present constitution nor the antient confederation had any state or person a right to treat with the indians without the consent of the general government that that  0  consent has never been given to any treaty for the cession of the lands in question that the government is determined to exert all its energy for the patronage and protection of the rights of the indians and the preservation of peace between the united states and them and that if any settlements are made on lands not ceded by them without the previous consent of the united states the government will think itself bound not only to declare to the indians that such settlements are without the authority or protection of the united states but to remove them also by the public force it is in compliance with your request my dear sir that i submit these ideas to you to whom it belongs to give place to them or such others as your better judgment shall prefer in answer to mr moultrie

remarkable events have taken place he would convey to you the official information of general scotts success against the indians a second party somewhat stronger is now gone against them nearly the whole of the states have now returned their census i send you the result which as far as founded on actual returns is written in black ink  the numbers not actually returned yet pretty well known are written in red ink making a very small allowance for omissions we are upwards of four millions  we know in fact that the omissions have been very great—our crop of wheat is very abundant  of the best quality ever known there has been an extraordinary drought prevailing most to the north of this the crop of hay here is short  calamitously so further north we have lately had the most copious rains which will recover the indian corn  tobacco a spirit of gambling in the public paper has lately seized too many of our citizens commerce manufactures the arts  agriculture will suffer from it if not checked many are ruined by it but i fear that ruin will be no more a correction in this case than in common gaming we cannot immediately foresee how it will terminate  0  colo ternant is arrived here as minister plenipotentiary from france—i shall soon be able to send you another newspaper written in a contrary spirit to that of fenno freneau is come here to set up a national gazette to be published twice a week and on whig principles the two papers will shew you both sides of our politics being about to set out for virginia in a few days it will probably be two months before i shall

      dear sir —tho the incessant drudgery of my office puts it out of my power to write letters of mere correspondence yet i do not permit them to suspend the offices of friendship where these may affect the interests of my friends you have in the funds of virginia in loan office certificates reduced to specie value £ 0    –     and in final settlement £  –  these are of the description allowed by the general government to be transferred to their funds if subscribed to them before the last day of next month if so transferred four ninths of them would now sell for about     the pound or would bear an interest of   per cent regularly two ninths would bear an interest of   per cent paid regularly  sell for     the pound the other three ninths will bear an interest of   per cent after about   years hence   0  would now sell for     the pound i wrote to mr burnell to know if any orders were given him on this subject  he answers me in the negative supposing that this has proceeded from your being unable at such a distance to judge of the expediency of transferring the debt from the state to the general government i have taken the liberty this day to advise him to do it because if not done before the last day of next month it can never be done afterwards observe that since congress had said it would assume all these debts where the parties should chuse it the states have repealed their provision for paiment  the moment the time is out for transferring them their value will sink to nothing almost tho i advise mr burnell to transfer them to the funds of the united states so as to secure them yet i advise him also to let them lie there  not to sell them till orders from england because i do not foresee any loss from waiting a while for orders i would certainly advise powers to be given to him to sell the   per cents when he finds a favorable occasion i believe they may rise to    the pound which will be making them nearly as much sterling as they are currency this might enable a remittance immediately to your creditors of about  00£ it might be well to authorize him also to do as to the   per cents  the deferred part what occurrences shall render expedient it is impossible to foresee what may happen  therefore power had better be given where there may be a full reliance in the discretion of the person be so good as to present my respects to mrs paradise  0

0 was received july    answered july   i send you a copy of the answer which will read now like an old almanac but it will shew you i am incapable of neglecting any thing which comes from you the measures therein spoken of as in contemplation for the purpose of bringing gr brit to reason vanished in reference of the subject to me to report on our commerce and navigation generally to the next session of congress i have little hope that the result will be any thing more than to turn the left cheek to him who has smitten the right we have to encounter not only the prejudices in favor of england but those against the eastern states whose ships in the opinion of some will over run our land i have been sorry to see that your state has been overjealous of the measures proposed  0  on this subject  which really tend to relieve them from the effects of british broils i wish you may be able to convert mr barnwell because you think him worth converting whether you do or not your opinion of him will make me solicitous for his acquaintance because i love the good  respect freedom of opinion what do you think of this scrip company ships are lying idle at the wharfs buildings are stopped capitals withdrawn from commerce manufactures arts  agriculture to be employed in gambling and the tide of public prosperity almost unparalelled in any country is arrested in its course and suppressed by the rage of getting rich in a day no mortal can tell where this will stop for the spirit of gaming when once it has seized a subject is incurable the taylor who has made thousands in one day tho he has lost them the next can never again be content with the slow  moderate earnings of his needle nothing can exceed the public felicity if our papers are to be believed because our papers are under the orders of the scripmen i imagine however we shall shortly hear that all the cash has quitted the extremities of the nation  accumulated here that produce  property fall to half price there  the same things rise to double price here that the cash accumulated  stagnated here as soon as the bank paper gets out will find its vent into foreign countries and instead of this solid medium which we might have kept for nothing we shall have a paper one for the use of which we are to pay these gamesters    per cent per annum as they say would to god yourself genl pinkney maj pinkney  0  would come forward and aid us with your efforts you are all known respected wished for but you refuse yourselves to every thing what is to become of us my dear friend if the vine  the figtree withdraw  leave us to the bramble  thorn you will have heard before this reaches you of the peril into which the french revolution is brought by the flight of their king—such are the fruits of that form of government which heaps importance on idiots and of which the tories of the present day are trying to preach into our favour i still hope the french revolution will issue happily i feel that the permanence of our own leans in some degree on that and that a failure there would be a powerful argument to prove that there must be a failure here we have been told that a british minister would be sent out to us this summer i suspect this depends on the event of peace or war in the latter case they will probably send one but they have no serious view of treating or fulfilling treaties adieu my

almanac it contained no body wishes more than i do to see such proofs as you   0 exhibit that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men and that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in africa  america i can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body  mind to what it ought to be as fast as the imbecility of their present existence and other circumstances which cannot be neglected will admit i have taken the liberty of sending your almanac to monsieur de condorcet secretary of the academy of sciences at paris and member of the philanthropic society because i consider it as a document to which your whole colour had a right for their justification against the doubts which have been entertained of them i am with great esteem sir your most obedt humble servt thomas jefferson aug  0      philadelphia marquis de condorcet to the marquis de condorcet j mss philadelphia aug  0      dear sir —i am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor on the subject of the element of measure adopted by france candor obliges me to confess that it is not what i would have approved it is liable to the inexactitude of mensuration as to that part of the quadrant of the earth which is to be measured that is to say as to one tenth of the quadrant and as to the remaining nine tenths they are to be calculated on conjectural data presuming the     figure of the earth which has not yet been proved it is liable too to the objection that no nation but your own can come at it because yours is the only nation within which a meridian can be found of such extent crossing the   th degree  terminating at both ends in a level we may certainly say then that this measure is uncatholic and i would rather have seen you depart from catholicism in your religion than in your philosophy i am happy to be able to inform you that we have now in the united states a negro the son of a black man born in africa and of a black woman born in the united states who is a very respectable mathematician i procured him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the potowmac  in the intervals of his leisure while on that work he made an almanac for the next year which he sent me in his own hand writing  which i inclose to you i have seen very elegant solutions of geometrical problems by him add to this that he is a very worthy  respectable member of society he is a free man i shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition and not proceeding from any difference in the structure of the parts on which intellect depends i am looking ardently to the completion of the glorious work in which your country is engaged i view the general condition of europe as hanging on the success or failure of france having set such an example of philosophical arrangement within i hope     it will be extended without your limits also to your dependants and to your friends in every part of the earth present my affectionate respects to madame de condorcet and accept yourself assurances of the sentiments of esteem  attachment with which i have the honour to be dear sir your most obedt  most humble servt thomas jefferson aug  0      philadelphia joseph fenwick to the u s consul at bordeaux joseph fenwick j mss philadelphia aug  0      sir —the object of the present is principally to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of feb  0 mar        apr    and the cases of wine forwarded for the president  myself for your care of which be pleased to accept my thanks i hope you have drawn on mr short for the balance of     s due to you the difference of    s duty on tobo carried in french and american bottoms makes an extreme impression here notwithstanding the dispositions expressed by the national assembly to treat on a friendly footing i fear a retaliation will be thought indispensable which if equivalent to their duty on our vessels will have the appearance of hostility an additional tonnage of     0s the ton burthen on all french ships entering the ports of the u s would be but equivalent to an additional duty of    s the hogshead on all tobo carried in american ships into the ports of france i take for granted the national     assembly were surprised into the measure by persons whose avarice blinded them to the consequences  hope it will be repealed before our legislature shall be obliged to act on it such an attack on our carriage of our own productions  such a retaliation would illy prepare the minds of the two nations for a liberal treaty as wished for by the real friends of both i trouble you again in the affairs of my neighbor m de rieux whose letters i leave open for your perusal as they will explain their object together with the one addressed to yourself i must ask the favor of you to advise mr plumand de rieux of nantes as to the best mode of remitting the money hither as that will be much better known to you on the spot than to me at this distance thomas jefferson aug  0      philadelphia john adams to john adams j mss philadelphia aug  0      my dear sir —i received some time ago your favor of july    and was happy to find that you saw in its true point of view the way in which i had been drawn into the scene which must have been so disagreeable to you the importance which you still seem to allow to my note  the effect you suppose it to have had tho unintentional in me induce me to show you that it really had no effect paines pamphlet with my note was published here about the  d week in may not a word ever appeared in the public papers here on the subject for more than     a month and i am certain not a word on the subject would ever have been said had not a writer under the name of publicola at length undertaken to attack mr paines principles which were the principles of the citizens of the u s instantly a host of writers attacked publicola in support of those principles he had thought proper to misconstrue a figurative expression in my note  these writers so far noticed me as to place the expression in its true light but this was only an incidental skirmish preliminary to the general engagement and they would not have thought me worth naming had not he thought proper to bring me on the scene his antagonists very criminally in my opinion presumed you to be publicola and on that presumption hazarded a personal attack on you no person saw with more uneasiness than i did this unjustifiable assault and the more so when i saw it continued after the printer had declared you were not the author but you will perceive from all this my dear sir that my note contributed nothing to the production of these disagreeable pieces as long as paines pamphlet stood on its own feet  on my note it was unnoticed as soon as publicola attacked paine swarms appeared in his defence to publicola then  not in the least degree to my note this whole contest is to be ascribed  all its consequences you speak of the execrable paragraph in the connecticut papers this it is true appeared before publicola but it had no more relation to paines pamphlet and my note than to the alcoran i am satisfied the writer of it had never seen either for     when i passed through connecticut about the middle of june not a copy had ever been seen by anybody either in hartford or new haven nor probably in that whole state and that paragraph was so notoriously the reverse of the disinterestedness of character which you are known to possess by everybody who knows your name that i never heard a person speak of the paragraph but with an indignation in your behalf which did you entire justice this paragraph then certainly did not flow from my note any more than the publications which publicola produced indeed it was impossible that my note should occasion your name to be brought into question for so far from naming you i had not even in view any writing which i might suppose to be yours and the opinions i alluded to were principally those i had heard in common conversation from a sect aiming at the subversion of the present government to bring in their favorite form of a king lords  commons thus i hope my dear sir that you will see me to have been as innocent in effect as i was in intention i was brought before the public without my own consent  from the first moment of seeing the effort of the real aggressor in this business to keep me before the public i determined that nothing should induce me to put pen to paper in the controversy the business is now over  i hope its effects are over and that our friendship will never be suffered to be committed whatever use others may think proper to make of our names the event of the kings flight from paris  his     recapture will have struck you with its importance it appears i think that the nation is firm within and it only remains to see whether there will be any movement from without i confess i have not changed my confidence in the favourable issue of that revolution because it has always rested on my own ocular evidence of the unanimity of the nation  wisdom of the patriotic party in the national assembly the last advices render it probable that the emperor will recommence hostilities against the porte it remains to see whether england and prussia will take a part present me to mrs adams with all the affections i feel for her and be assured of those devoted to yourself by my dear sir your sincere friend  servt thomas jefferson sept        philadelphia jean baptiste ternant to the french

cannot mr mangnall at length tired out with his useless solicitations at this office to obtain redress from the court of spain for the loss of the doser cutter has laid the matter before congress  the senate have desired me to report thereon to them i am sorry to know nothing more of the subject than that letter after letter has been written to you thereon and that the office is in possession of nothing more than acknolegements of your receipt of some of them so long ago as aug      and still to add that your letter of jan         is the only one received of later date than may        you certainly will not wonder if the receipt of but one letter in two years  an half inspires a considerable degree of impatience i have learnt thro a circuitous channel that the court of madrid is at length disposed to yield to our right of navigating the missisipi i sincerely wish it may be the case and that this act of justice may be made known before the delay of it produces anything intemperate from our western inhabitants congress is now in session you will see in the papers herewith sent the several weighty matters     laid before them in the presidents speech the session will probably continue through the winter i shall sincerely rejoice to receive from you not only a satisfactory explanation of the reasons why we receive no letters but grounds to hope that it will be otherwise in future thomas jefferson november  th     philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states j mss philadelphia november  th      sir —i have duly considered the letter you were pleased to refer to me of the   th of august from his excellency governor pinckney to yourself together with the draught of one proposed to be written by him to the governor of florida claiming the redelivery of certain fugitives from justice who have been received in that country the inconveniences of such a receptacle for debtors and malefactors in the neighbourhood of the southern states are obvious and great and i wish the remedy were as certain and short as the letter seems to suppose the delivery of fugitives from one country to another as practised by several nations is in consequence of conventions settled between them defining precisely the cases wherein such deliveries shall take place i know that such conventions exist between france and spain france and sardinia france and germany france and the united netherlands between the several sovereigns constituting the germanic body and i believe very generally between coterminous states on the continent of europe england has no such convention   0 with any nation and their laws have given no such power to their executive to surrender fugitives of any description they are accordingly constantly refused and hence england has been the asylum of the paolis the la mottes the calonnes in short of the most atrocious offenders as well as the most innocent victims who have been able to get there the laws of the united states like those of england receive every fugitive and no authority has been given to our executives to deliver them up in the case of longechamp a subject of france a formal demand was made by the minister of france and was refused he had indeed committed an offence within the united states but he was not demanded as a criminal but as a subject the french government has shown great anxiety to have such a convention with the united states as might authorize them to demand their subjects coming here they got a clause in the consular convention signed by dr franklin and the count de vergennes giving their consuls a right to take and send back captains of vessels mariners and passengers congress saw the extent of the word passengers and refused to ratify the convention a new one was therefore formed omitting that word in fact however desirable it be that the perpetrators of crimes acknowledged to be such by all mankind should be delivered up to punishment yet it is extremely difficult to draw the line between those and acts rendered criminal by tyrannical laws only hence the first step always is a convention defining the cases where a surrender shall take place     if then the united states could not deliver up to governor quesada a fugitive from the laws of his government we cannot claim as a right the delivery of fugitives from us and it is worthy consideration whether the demand proposed to be made in governor pinckneys letter should it be complied with by the other party might not commit us disagreeably perhaps dishonorably in event for i do not think we can take for granted that the legislature of the united states will establish a convention for the mutual delivery of fugitives and without a reasonable certainty that they will i think we ought not to give governor quesada any grounds to expect that in a similar case we would redeliver fugitives from his government thomas jefferson nov        philadelphia george washington

on mangnall d s mss nov  0      the secretary of state to whom was referred by the senate of the united states the petition of john mangnall has had the same under consideration and thereupon makes the following report he finds that congress on the application of the petitioner resolved on the   th day of sep    0 that the profit of the capture of the doser cutter should be divided among the captors  that the honble mr jay their minister plenipotentiary at the court of madrid should be instructed to endeavor to obtain for the sd captors the benefit by their resolve of octob         that such instructions were accordingly sent by the committee for foreign affairs to mr jay who continued during his residence there to press the settlement of this claim under very varying prospects as to the result that after he came to the direction of the office for foreign affairs he continued to press the same subject through our chargé des affaires at madrid and it has been since resumed  urged in the strongest terms by the secretary of state that as yet no information is received of what has been done or is likely to be done that the circumstances of the country where this business has been transacted have rendered the transmission  receipt of letters at all times difficult  precarious  latterly in a remarkable degree     but still that there will be no remission of endeavors to obtain justice for the petitioner  his associates as to so much of the petition as prays that a pension may be allowed him until the adjustment of his claim it will rest with the wisdom of the senate to decide on its reasonableness the precedent will indeed be new  may bring on other applications in similar cases to which the irregular conduct of officers military  civil have given rise  will perpetually give rise but if they shall perceive that the measure is right the consequence that it will lead to repetitions in other cases equally right ought to be met  as to so much of the said petition as prays that the petitioner may be allowed a pension from the public until his claim shall be decided at the court of madrid the secretary of state observes that in times of war questions are continually arising on the legitimacy of capture on acts of piracy on acts of violence at sea and in times of peace on seizures for contraband regular  irregular which draw on discussions with foreign nations always of long continuance and often of results in which expedience rather than justice renders acquiescence adviseable that some such cases are now depending between the governments of the united states and of other countries that a great number of applications might be made for pensions on the same ground with the present both now and hereafter that it is not known that the claims are just till they are     heard and decided on and even when decided to be just the government from which it is due is alone responsible for the money and he is therefore of opinion that such a pension ought not to be granted thomas jefferson nov         james madison to james madison mad mss nov         in my report on hows case where i state that it should go to the president it will become a question with the house whether they shall refer it to the president themselves or give it back to the petitioner  let him so address it as he ought to have done at first i think the latter proper   because it is a case belonging purely to the executive   the legislature should never show itself in a matter with a foreign nation but where the case is very serious and they mean to commit the nation on its issue   because if they indulge individuals in handing through the legislature their applications to the executive all applicants will be glad to avail themselves of the weight of so powerful a solicitor similar attempts have been repeatedly made by individuals to get the president to hand in their petitions to the legislature which he has constantly refused it seems proper that every person should address himself directly to the department to which the constitution has allotted his case and that the proper answer to such from any other department is that it is not to us that the constitution has     assigned the transaction of this business i suggest these things to you that if they may appear to you to be right this kind of business may in the first instance be turned into its proper channel thomas jefferson nov         hugh williamson to hugh williamson j mss nov         dear sir —on considering the subject of the clause you wished to have introduced in the inclosed bill i found it more difficult than i had on first view imagined will you make the first trial against the patentee conclusive against all others who might be interested to contest his patent if you do he will always have a collusive suit brought against himself at once or will you give every one a right to bring actions separately if you do besides running him down with the expences  vexations of lawsuits you will be sure to find some jury in the long run who from motives of partiality or ignorance will find a verdict against him tho a hundred should have been before found in his favour i really believe that less evil will follow from leaving him to bring suits against those who invade his right if however you can get over the difficulty  will drop me a line i will try to prepare a clause tho i am sure you will put your own ideas into form better than any body else can     thomas jefferson nov         report on howe nov         the secretary of state to whom was referred by the house of representatives the petition of william howe praying satisfaction from the united states for a debt due to him in nova scotia and whereon judgment has been rendered against him contrary to existing treaties as he supposes with instructions to examine the same and report his opinions thereupon to the house has had the same under consideration and thereupon reports that if the facts be justly stated in the petition indemnification is to be sought from a foreign nation and therefore that the case is a proper one to be addressed to the president of the united states that when in that channel if it shall be found after advising with counsel at law that the verdict or judgment rendered in the said case is inconsistent with treaty it will become a proper subject of representation to the court of london and of indemnification from them to the party that to this interposition the petitioner will in that case be entitled but not to any reimbursement from the united states directly thomas jefferson nov         philadelphia william short to the chargé daffaires in france william short philadelphia nov         dear sir —    you mention that drost wishes the devices of our money to be sent to him   0 that he may engrave them there this cannot be done because not yet decided on the devices will be fixed by the law which shall establish the mint m de ternant tells me he has no instructions to propose to us the negotiation of a commercial treaty and that he does not expect any i wish it were possible to draw that negotiation to this place—in your letter of july    is the following paragraph it is published in the english newspapers that war is inevitable between the u s  spain  that preparations are making for it on both sides m de montmorin asked me how the business stood at present  seemed somewhat surprised at my telling him that i knew nothing later than what i had formerly mentioned to him—i have in more than one instance experienced the inconvenience of being without information in this it is disagreeable as it may have the appearance with m de montmorin of my having something to conceal from him which not being the case it would be wrong that he should be allowed to take up such an idea—i observed that i did not suppose there was any new circumstance as you had not informed me of it your observation was certainly just it would be an augean task for me to go through the london newspapers and formally contradict all their lies even those relating to america on our side there have been certainly no preparations for war against spain nor have i heard of any on their part but in the london newspapers as to the progress of the negotiation i know nothing of it but from you having never had a letter from mr carmichael on the subject     our best newspapers are sent you from my office with scrupulous exactness by every vessel sailing to havre or any other convenient port of france on these i rely for giving you information of all the facts possessed by the public and as to those not possessed by them i think there has not been a single instance of my leaving you uninformed of any of them which related to the matters under your charge in freneaus paper of the   st inst you will see a small essay on population  emigration which i think it would be well if the news writers of paris would translate  insert in their papers the sentiments are too just not to make impression some proceedings of the assembly of st domingo have lately taken place which it is necessary for me to state to you exactly that you may be able to do the same to m de montmorin when the insurrection of their negroes assumed a very threatening appearance the assembly sent a deputy here to ask assistance of military stores  provisions he addressed himself to m de ternant who the president being then in virginia as i was also applied to the secretaries of the treasury  war they furnished  000 stand of arms other military stores and placed  0000 dollars in the treasury subject to the order of m de ternant to be laid out in provisions or otherwise as he should think best he sent the arms  other military stores but the want of provisions did not seem so instantaneous as to render it necessary in his opinion to send any at that time before the vessel arrived in st domingo the assembly     further urged by the appearance of danger sent two deputies more with large demands viz  000 fusils  bayonets  000 mousquators  000 pistols  000 sabres   000 barrels of flour  00000 worth of indian meal rice peas  hay  a large quantity of plank c to repair the buildings destroyed they applied to m de ternant  then with his consent to me he  i having previously had a conversation on the subject they proposed to me   that we should supply those wants from the money we owed france or   for bills of exchange which they were authorized to draw on a particular fund in france or   that we would guarantee their bills in which case they could dispose of them to merchants  buy the necessaries themselves i convinced them the two latter alternatives were beyond the powers of the executive  the  st could only be done with the consent of the minister of france in the course of our conversation i expressed to them our sincere attachment to france  all its dominions  most especially to them who were our neighbors and whose interests had some common points of union with ours in matters of commerce that we wished therefore to render them every service they needed but that we could not do it in any way disagreeable to france that they must be sensible that m de ternant might apprehend that jealousy would be excited by their addressing themselves directly to foreign powers  therefore that a concert with him in their applications to us was essential the subject of independance  their views towards it having been stated in the public papers this led our conversation     to it  i must say they appeared as far from these views as any persons on earth i expressed to them freely my opinion that such an object was neither desirable on their part nor attainable that as to ourselves there was one case which would be peculiarly alarming to us to wit were there a danger of their falling under any other power that we concieved it to be strongly our interests that they should retain their connection with the mother country that we had a common interest with them in furnishing them the necessaries of life in exchange for sugar  coffee for our own consumption but that i thought we might rely on the justice of the mother country towards them for their obtaining this privilege and on the whole let them see that nothing was to be done but with the consent of the minister of france i am convinced myself that their views  their application to us are perfectly innocent however m de ternant  still more m de la forest are jealous the deputies on the other hand think that m de ternant is not sensible enough of their wants they delivered me sealed letters to the president  to congress that to the president contained only a picture of their distresses  application for relief that to congress i know no otherwise than thro the public papers the senate read it  sent it to the representatives who read it and have taken no other notice of it the line of conduct i pursue is to persuade these gentlemen to be contented with such moderate supplies from time to time as will keep them from real distress  to wait with patience for what would be a surplus till m de     ternant can receive instructions from france which he has reason to expect within a few weeks and i encourage the latter gentleman even to go beyond their absolute wants of the moment so far as to keep them in good humour he is accordingly proposing to lay out  0000 dollars for them for the present it would be ridiculous in the present case to talk about forms there are situations when form must be dispensed with a man attacked by assassins will call for help to those nearest him  will not think himself bound to silence till a magistrate may come to his aid it would be unwise in the highest degree that the colonists should be disgusted with either france or us for it might then be made to depend on the moderation of another power whether what appears a chimæra might not become a reality i have thought it necessary to go thus fully into this transaction  particularly as to the sentiments i have expressed to them that you may be enabled to place our proceedings in their true light our indian expeditions have proved successful as yet however they have not led to peace—mr hammond has lately arrived here as minister plenipotentiary from the court of london and we propose to name one to that court in

property of the american inhabitants withdraw all his armies garrisons and fleets from the said united states and from every post place and harbour within the same i need not observe to you that this article still remains in a state of inexecution nor recapitulate what on other occasions has past on this subject of all this i presume you are fully apprised we consider the friendly movement lately made by the court of london in sending a minister to reside with us as a favorable omen of its disposition to cultivate harmony and good will between the two nations and we are perfectly persuaded

the intentions of your court as to the execution of the article above quoted with respect to the commerce of the two countries we have supposed that we saw in several instances regulations on the part of your government which if reciprocally adopted would naturally injure the interests of both nations on this subject too i must beg the favor of you to say whether you are authorized to conclude or

i see no reason to doubt that operations of force must still be pursued i have therefore instructed the secretary at war to prepare for your information a statement of the transactions of his department material to this object these are now laid before you while they serve to shew that the plan which was adopted for employing the public force  wealth was such as promised reasonably a more

you     thomas jefferson december         opinion relative to certain lands on lake erie sold by the united states to pennsylvania december         the secretary of state to whom was referred by the president of the united states a letter from the governor of pennsylvania with the documents therein mentioned on the subject of certain lands on lake erie having had the same under consideration thereupon reports that congress by their resolution of june  th      directed the geographer general of the united states to ascertain the quantity of land belonging to the united states between pennsylvania and lake erie and authorized a sale thereof that a sale was accordingly made to the commonwealth of pennsylvania that congress by their resolution of september  th      relinquished to the said commonwealth all their right to the government and jurisdiction of the said tract of land but the right of soil was not transferred by the resolution that a survey of the said tract has been since made and the amount of the purchase money been settled between the comptrollers of the united states and of the said commonwealth and that the governor of pennsylvania declares in the said letter to the president of the united states that he is ready to close the transaction on behalf of the said commonwealth that there is no person at present authorized by law to convey to the said commonwealth the right of soil in the said tract of land     and the secretary of state is therefore of opinion that the said letter and documents should be laid before the legislature of the united states to make such provision by law for conveying the said right of soil as they in their wisdom shall think fit thomas jefferson dec         report on negotiation with spain  dec         the

catholic majesty apprized of your solicitude to have some arrangements made respecting our free navigation of the river mississippi and the use of a port thereon is ready to enter into a treaty thereon at madrid the secretary of state is of opinion that this overture should be attended to without delay and that the proposal of treating at madrid though not what might have been desired should yet be accepted and a commission plenipotentiary made out for the purpose that mr carmichael the present chargé des affaires of the united states at madrid from the local acquaintance which he must have acquired with persons and circumstances would be an useful and proper member of the commission but that it would be useful also to join with him some person     more particularly acquainted with the circumstances of the navigation to be treated of that the fund appropriated by the act providing the means of intercourse between the united states and foreign nations will insufficiently furnish the ordinary and regular demands on it and is consequently inadequate to the mission of an additional commissioner express from hence that therefore it will be advisable on this account as well as for the sake of despatch to constitute some one of the ministers of the united states in europe jointly with mr carmichael commissioners plenipotentiary for the special purpose of negotiating and concluding with any person or persons duly authorized by his catholic majesty a convention or treaty for the free navigation of the river mississippi by the citizens of the united states under such accommodations with respect to a port and other circumstances as may render the said navigation practicable useful and free from dispute saving to the president and senate their respective rights as to the ratification of the same and that the said negotiation be at madrid or such other place in spain as shall be desired by his catholic majesty thomas jefferson dec         philadelphia archibald stuart to archibald stuart j mss philadelphia dec         dear sir —i received duly your favor of octob    and should have answered it by the gentleman who delivered it but that he left town before i knew of it   0 that it is really important to provide a constitution for our state cannot be doubted as little can it be doubted that the ordinance called by that name has important defects but before we attempt it we should endeavor to be as certain as is practicable that in the attempt we should not make bad worse i have understood that mr henry has always been opposed to this undertaking and i confess that i consider his talents and influence such as that were it decided that we should call a convention for the purpose of amending i should fear he might induce that convention either to fix the thing as at present or change it for the worse would it not therefore be well that means should be adopted for coming at his ideas of the changes he would agree to  for communicating to him those which we should propose perhaps he might find ours not so distant from his but that some mutual sacrifices might bring them together i shall hazard my own ideas to you as hastily as my business obliges me i wish to preserve the line drawn by the federal constitution between the general  particular governments as it stands at present and to take every prudent means of preventing either from stepping over it tho the experiment has not yet had a long enough course to shew us from which quarter encroachments are most to be feared yet it is easy to foresee from the nature of things that the encroachments of the state governments will tend to an excess of liberty which will correct itself as in the late instance while those of the general government will tend to monarchy which will fortify     itself from day to day instead of working its own cure as all experience shews i would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than those attending too small a degree of it then it is important to strengthen the state governments and as this cannot be done by any change in the federal constitution for the preservation of that is all we need contend for it must be done by the states themselves erecting such barriers at the constitutional line as cannot be surmounted either by themselves or by the general government the only barrier in their power is a wise government a weak one will lose ground in every contest to obtain a wise  an able government i consider the following changes as important render the legislature a desirable station by lessening the number of representatives say to  00 and lengthening somewhat their term and proportion them equally among the electors adopt also a better mode of appointing senators render the executive a more desirable post to men of abilities by making it more independant of the legislature to wit let him be chosen by other electors for a longer time and ineligible for ever after responsibility is a tremendous engine in a free government let him feel the whole weight of it then by taking away the shelter of his executive council experience both ways has already established the superiority of this measure render the judiciary respectable by every possible means to wit firm tenure in office competent salaries and reduction of their numbers men of high learning and abilities are few in every country      by taking in those who are not so the able part of the body have their hands tied by the unable this branch of the government will have the weight of the conflict on their hands because they will be the last appeal of reason—these are my general ideas of amendments but preserving the ends i should be flexible  conciliatory as to the means you ask whether mr madison and myself could attend on a convention which should be called mr madisons engagements as a member of congress will probably be from october to march or april in every year mine are constant while i hold my office and

philadelphia george washignton to the president of the united states j mss philadelphia december         sir —as the conditions of our commerce with the french and british dominions are important and a moment seems to be approaching when it may be useful that both should be accurately understood i have thrown a representation of them into the form of a table shewing at one view how the principal articles interesting to our agriculture and navigation stand in the european and american dominions of these two powers as to so much of it as respects france i have cited under every article the law on which it depends which laws from      downwards are in my possession     port charges are so different according to the size of the vessel and the dexterity of the captain that an examination of a greater number of portbills might perhaps produce a different result i can only say that that expressed in the table is fairly drawn from such bills as i could readily get access to and that i have no reason to suppose it varies much from the truth nor on which side the variation would lie still i cannot make myself responsible for this article the authorities cited will vouch the rest       footing of the commerce of the united states with france  england  with the french and english amr colonies      the following articles being on an equal footing in both countries are thrown together

receipt of your favor of sep   and octob   together with the report of the executive proceedings in the south western government from march   to july    in answer to that part of yours of sept   on the subject of a seal for the use of that government i think it extremely proper  necessary  that one should be provided at public expense the opposition made by governor blount  yourself to all attempts by citizens of the u s to settle within the indian lines without authority from the general government is approved and should be continued there being a prospect that congress who have now the post office bill before them will establish a post from richmond to stanton  continue it there towards the s w government a good distance if not nearly to it our future correspondence will be more

des affaires of france while a direct communication was open between us the matter having been only suspended but not broken off since the departure of mr gardoqui and to express his pleasure also at the polite reception the president had given to his commissioners here  thomas jefferson jan         draft of presidents message on diplomatic nominations  j mss jan  –       gentlemen of the senate— your house has been pleased to communicate to me their resolutions purporting a decision by them that it is expedient from whence an implication arises that in their opinion they might have decided that no such appointments were expedient after mature consideration  consultation i am of opinion that the constitution has made the president the sole competent judge to what places circumstances render it expedient that ambassadors or other public ministers should be sent  of what grade they should be and that it has ascribed to the     senate no executive act but the single one of giving or withholding their consent to the person nominated i think it my duty therefore to protest  do protest against the validity of any resolutions of the senate asserting or implying any right in that house to exercise any executive authority but the single one before mentioned it is scarcely necessary to add that nothing herein is meant to question their right to concur in making treaties this being considered not as a branch of executive but of legislative powers placed by the constitution under peculiar modifications thomas jefferson jan        philadelphia thomas mann randolph to thomas

bill now before the legislature will place on the regular establishment as it directs a cross post from richmond to columbia charlottesville staunton and thence along that valley southwest and to the southwestern government  so on to kentuckey i urged strenuously to our representatives the impropriety of sending a post destined for the southwestern government  kentuckey by the way of charlottesville  staunton as it was palpable to me from my own knowlege of the country that it ought from columbia to pass up james river to lynchburg and by the peaks of otter  to have left charlottesville and staunton still to take care of     themselves they decided otherwise however which so far as my own interest is concerned is a convenience to me and so far as my neighbors  friends are benefited might by them be favorably imputed to me but i had rather withdraw my claim to their favor in this instance than found it in what i think would have been wrong—you will have heard that the representation bill is lost  might have been saved had r h lee been here at any moment during its dependance nothing more is yet done on the subject the measures to be taken for the defence of the western country are not yet brought forward half a dozen cherokees arrived here two days ago they have not yet explained their business—i thank you for your experiment on the peach tree it proves my speculation practicable as it shews that   acres of peach trees at    feet apart will furnish dead wood enough to supply a fireplace through the winter  may be kept up at the trouble of only planting about  0 peach stones a year suppose this extended to  0 fireplaces it comes to  0 acres of ground  000 trees and the replacing about  00 of them annually by planting so many stones if it be disposed at some little distance say in a circular annulus from  00 to  00 yards from the house it would render a cart almost useless—when i indulge myself in these speculations i feel with redoubled ardor my desire to return home to the pursuit of them  to the bosom of my family in whose love alone i live or wish to live  in that of my neighbors—but i must yet a little while bear up against my weariness

chairman of senate committee on nominations caleb strong philadelphia jan        sir —i am just now made to recollect a mistake in one of the answers i gave last night to the committee of the senate and which therefore i beg leave to correct  after calling to their minds the footing     on which mr morris had left matters at the court of london  informing them of what had passed between the british ministers here  myself i was asked whether this was all that had taken place whether there had been no other or further engagement i paused you may remember to recollect i knew nothing more had passed on the other side of the water because mr morriss powers there had been determined  i endeavoured to recollect whether anything else had passed with mr hammond  myself i answered that this was all  added in proof that i was sure nothing had passed between the president  mr hammond personally  so i might safely say this was all—it escaped me that there had been an informal agent here col beckwith  so informal that it was thought proper that i should never speak on business with him and that on a particular occasion the question having been asked whether if a british minister should be sent here we would send one in exchange it was said thro another channel that one would doubtless be sent having only been present when it was concluded to give this answer and not having been myself the person who communicated it nor having otherwise had any conversation with col beckwith on the subject it absolutely escaped my recollection at the moment the committee put the question and i now correct the error i committed in my answer with the same good faith with which i committed the error in the first moment permit me to ask the favor of you sir to communicate this to the other members of the committee and to consider     this as a part of the information i had the honor of giving the committee on the subject thomas jefferson january        philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states d s mss philadelphia january        sir —having been in conversation today with monsr payan one of the st domingo deputies i took occasion to inquire of him the footing on which our commerce there stands at present and particularly whether the colonial arret of      permitting a free importation of our flour till      was still in force he answered that that arret was revoked in france on the clamours of the merchants there and that a like permission to carry flour to the three usual ports and he thinks to bring away coffee and sugar was immediately renewed by the governor whether this has been regularly kept up by renewed arrets during the present troubles he cannot say but is sure that in practice it has never been discontinued and that not by contraband but openly and legally as is understood the public application to us to send flour there is a proof of it instead therefore of resting this permission on a colonial arret till      it should be rested on temporary arrets renewed from time to time as heretofore this correction of the notes i took the liberty of laying before you with the table containing a comparative view of our commerce with

getting to me since my receipt of it i have taken such opportunities as my business  acquaintance here would allow me to try whether i could obtain money for you on the ground explained in your letter either from the bank or any other persons the bank gives money in exchange only for merchants notes  on application to merchants i find that nothing will induce them to lend either their money or their credit to an individual in fact they strain both to their utmost limits for their own purposes the rage of gambling in the stocks of various descriptions is such and the profits sometimes made  therefore always hoped in that line are so far beyond any interest which an individual can give that all their money  credit is centered in their own views the bank has just now notified its proprietors that they may call for a dividend of  0 per cent on their capital for the last   months this makes a profit of    per cent per annum agriculture commerce  every thing useful must be

received information that the merchants and merchandize of the united states are subject in copenhagen and other ports of denmark to considerable extra duties from which they might probably be relieved by the presence of a consul there reports to the president of the united states that it would be expedient to name a consul to be resident in the port of copenhagen that he has not been able to find that there is any citizen of the united states residing there that there is a certain     hans rodolph saabye a danish subject and merchant of that place of good character of wealth and distinction and well qualified and disposed to act there for the united states who would probably accept of the commission of consul but that that of viceconsul hitherto given by the president to foreigners in ports where there was no proper american citizen would probably not be accepted because in this as in some other ports of europe usage has established it as a subordinate grade— and that he is therefore of opinion that the said hans rodolph saabye should be nominated consul of the united states of america for the port of copenhagen and such other places within the allegiance of his danish majesty as shall be nearer to the said port than to the residence of any other consul or viceconsul of the united states within the same allegiance thomas jefferson january   th

to indulge itself in expressions of the love i bear you and the delight with which i recall the various scenes through which we have passed together in our wanderings over the world these reveries alleviate the toils and inquietudes of my present situation and leave me always impressed with the desire of being at home once more and of     exchanging labor envy and malice for ease domestic occupation and domestic love and society where i may once more be happy with you with mr randolph and dear little anne with whom even socrates might ride on a stick without being ridiculous indeed it is with difficulty that my resolution will bear me through what yet lies between the present day and that which on mature consideration of all circumstances respecting myself and others my mind has determined to be the proper one for relinquishing my office though not very distant it is not near enough for my wishes the ardor of these however would be abated if i thought that on coming home i should be left alone on the contrary i hope that mr randolph will find a convenience in making only leisurely preparations for a settlement and that i shall be able to make you both happier than you have been at monticello and relieve you of désagrémens to which i have been sensible you were exposed without the power in myself to prevent it but by my own presence remember me affectionately to mr

 were all immediately sent into the senate to wit yourself for london mr g morris for paris mr short for the hague some members of the senate apprehending they had a right of determining on the expediency of foreign missions as well as on the persons named took that occasion to bring forward the discussion of that question by which the nominations were delayed two or three weeks i am happy to be able to assure you that not a single personal motive with respect to yourself entered into the objections to these appointments on the contrary i believe that your nomination gave general satisfaction your commission will be immediately made out but as the opportunities of conveyance at this season are precarious  you propose coming to this place i think it better to retain it as to the delay proposed in your letter it was to be expected indeed a winter passage from charleston to this place or across the atlantic is so disagreeable that if either that circumstance or the arrangement of your affairs should render it in the smallest degree eligible to you to remain at home until the temperate season comes on to stay till after the vernal equinox there will be no inconvenience to the public attending it on the contrary as we are just opening certain negotiations with the british minister here which have not yet assumed any determinate complexion a delay till that time will enable us to form some judgment of the issue they may take and to know exactly in what way your cooperation at the place of your destination may aid us on this and other accounts it

will receive herewith a letter from myself to monsr de montmorin closing your former mission your new commission letters of credence from the president for the states general and stadtholder sealed and copies of them open for your own satisfaction you will keep the cypher we have heretofore used your past experience in the same line renders it unnecessary for me to particularize your duties on closing your present or conducting your future mission harmony with our friends being our object you are sensible how much it will be promoted by   0 attention to the manner as well as the matter of your communications with the government of the united netherlands i feel myself particularly bound to recommend as the most important of your charges the patronage of our commerce and the extension of its privileges both in the united netherlands and their colonies but most especially the latter the allowance to a minister resident of the united states is   00 dollars a year for all his personal services and other expences a years salary for his outfit and a quarters salary for his return it is understood that the personal services and other expences here meant do not extend to the cost of gazettes and pamphlets transmitted to the secretary of states office to translating or printing necessary papers postage couriers and necessary aids to poor american sailors these additional charges therefore may be inserted in your accounts but no other of any description unless where they are expressly directed to be incurred the salary of your new grade being the same as of your former one and your services continued tho the scene of them is changed there will be no intermission of salary the new one beginning where the former ends and ending when you shall receive notice of your permission to return for the same reason there can be but one allowance of outfit and return the former to take place now the latter only on your final return the funds appropriated to the support of the foreign establishment do not admit the allowance of a secretary to a minister resident i have thought it best to     state these things to you minutely that you may be relieved from all doubt as to the matter of your accounts i will beg leave to add a most earnest request that on the  st day of july next and on the same day annually afterwards you make out your account to that day and send it by the first vessel and by duplicates in this i must be very urgent and particular because at the meeting of the ensuing congress always it is expected that i prepare for them a statement of the disbursements from this fund from july to june inclusive i shall give orders by the first opportunity to our bankers in amsterdam to answer your draughts for the allowances herein before mentioned recruiting them at the same time by an adequate remitment as i expect that by the time you receive this they will not have remaining on hand of this fund more than   or  000 dollars you shall receive from me from time to time the laws and journals of congress gazettes and other interesting papers for whatever information is in possession of the public i shall leave you generally to the gazettes and only undertake to communicate by letter such relative to the business of your mission as the gazetteers cannot give from you i shall ask once or twice a month regularly a communication of interesting occurrences in holland of the general affairs in europe and the regular transmission of the leyden gazette by every british packet in the way it now comes which proves to be very regular send also such other publications as may be important enough to be read by one who     can spare little time to read anything or which may contain matter proper to be turned to on interesting subjects and occasions the english packet is the most certain channel for such epistolatory communications as are not very secret and by those packets i would wish always to receive a letter from you by way of corrective to the farrago of news they generally bring intermediate letters secret communications gazettes and other printed papers had better come by private vessels from amsterdam which channel i shall use generally for my letters and always for gazettes and other printed papers the president has also joined you in a special and temporary commission with mr carmichael to repair to madrid and there negotiate certain matters respecting the navigation of the missisipi and other points of common interest between spain and us as some time will be necessary to make out the instructions and transcripts necessary in this business they can only be forwarded by some future occasion but they shall be soon forwarded as we wish not to lose a moment in advancing negotiations so essential to our peace for this reason i must urge you to repair to the hague at the earliest day the settlement of your affairs in paris will admit that your reception may be over and the idea of your being established there

satisfaction as also a cypher to be used on proper occasions in the correspondence between us to you it would be more than unnecessary for me to undertake a general delineation of the functions of the office to which you are appointed i shall therefore only express our desire that they be constantly exercised in that spirit of sincere friendship and attachment which we bear to the french nation and that in all transactions with the minister his good dispositions be conciliated by whatever in language or attentions may tend to that effect with respect to their government we are under no call to express opinions which might please or offend any party and therefore it will be best to avoid them on all occasions public or private could any circumstances require unavoidably such expressions they would naturally be in conformity with the sentiments of the great mass of our countrymen who having first in modern times taken the ground of government founded on the will of the     people cannot but be delighted on seeing so distinguished and so esteemed a nation arrive on the same ground and plant their standard by our side i feel myself particularly bound to recommend as the most important of your charges the patronage of our commerce and the extension of its privileges both in france and her colonies but most especially the latter our consuls in france are under general instructions to

pamphlets transmitted to the secretary of states office to translating or printing necessary papers postage couriers and necessary aids to poor american sailors these additional charges therefore may be inserted in your accounts but no other of any description unless where they are expressly directed to be incurred by an ancient rule of congress your salary will commence from the day you receive this letter if you be then at paris or from the day you set out for paris from any other place at which it may find you it ceases on receiving notice or permission to return     after which the additional quarters allowance takes place you are free to name your own private secretary who will receive from the public a salary of    0 dollars a year without allowance for any extras i have thought it best to state these things to you minutely that you may be relieved from all doubt as to the matter of your accounts i will beg leave to add a most earnest request that on the  st day of

his majesty would be ready to enter into treaty thereon directly with us whensoever we should send to madrid a proper  acceptable person authorized to treat on our part i laid the communication before the president of the united states i am authorized by him to assure you that our government has nothing more at heart than to meet the friendly advances of his catholic majesty with cordiality and to concur in such arrangements on the subject proposed as may tend best to secure peace and friendship between the two nations on a permanent footing the president has therefore with the approbation of the senate appointed mr short our present minister resident at the hague to proceed to madrid as a joint commissioner with mr carmichael with full powers to treat on the subject before mentioned and i have no doubt that these gentlemen will so conduct themselves as to give entire satisfaction mr shorts business at the hague will occasion a short delay of his departure from that place for madrid but

philadelphia jan         gentlemen —by your letter of yesterday evening in answer to mine of the morning i perceive that     don joseph jaudeness communication verbally had not been understood in the same way by him  myself how this has happened i cannot conceive monsr de jaudenes will do me the justice to recollect that when he had made the verbal communication to me i asked his permission to commit it to writing i did so read it to him corrected a phrase or two at his desire to render it exact to his expression read it to him again  he approved it i inclose you a verbal copy of it being the one dated dec   this i laid before the president  it was the basis of our subsequent proceedings on the   th of dec don joseph de jaudenes at the city tavern spoke to me again on the same subject when i came home in the evening i committed to writing the substance of what he had said as far as my memory enabled me i send you a copy under the date of dec    but for the exactness of this i cannot undertake with as much certainty as the first accordingly you will find my letter of yesterday morning strictly conformable to the note of the first communication thus much has been said for my own justification it remains now that the error be corrected and that i may set out again on sure ground i must ask the favor of you to give me in writing the communication intended to be made whatever it be you may be assured that our dispositions to preserve friendship  perfect understanding with his catholic majesty as well as to render the exercise of your functions here as pleasing to yourselves as possible will induce us to receive with great partiality the intimations of your court and to proceed on them   0 accordingly i shall suspend doing any thing more on this subject till

felt by mr morris the changes are made with a pencil only and can therefore be easily restored where disapproved  thomas jefferson january   th      philadelphia william short to william short j mss philadelphia january   th      the present will be very confidential and will go i do not know how as i can not take time to cypher it all what has lately occurred here will convince you that i have been right in not raising your expectations as to an appointment the president proposed at first the nomination of mr t pinckney to the court of london but would not name him till we could have an assurance from him that he would accept nor did he indicate what the other appointments would be till mr ps answer came then he nominated to the senate mr morris m p for     france pinckney m p for london and yourself m r for the hague the first of these appointments was so extremely unpopular and so little relished by several of the senate that every effort was used to negative it those whose personal objections to mr morris over weighed their deference to the president finding themselves in the minority joined with another small party who were against all foreign appointments and endeavored with them to put down the whole system rather than let this article pass this plan was defeated and mr morris passed by vote of    against    when your nomination came on it was consented to by    against    every man of the latter however rising and declaring as to yourself they had no personal objection but only meant by their vote to declare their opinion against keeping any person at the hague those who voted in the negative were not exactly the same in both cases when the biannual bill furnishing money for the support of the foreign establishments shall come on at the next session to be continued the same contest will arise again and i think it very possible that if the opponents of mr m can not remove him otherwise they will join again with those who are against the whole establishment and try to discontinue the whole if they fail in this i still see no security in their continuing the mission to the hague because to do this they must enlarge the fund from  0000 to  0000 the president afterward proceeded to join you to carmichael on a special mission to spain to which their was no opposition except from three gentlemen who     were against opening the mississippi i told the president that as i expected the hague mission would be discontinued after the next session i should advise you to ask permission to return he told me not to do this for that as carmichael had asked leave to return and he meant to give it as soon as he should get thro the business jointly confided to you and to appoint you his successor as minister resident therefore do in this what you chuse only inform me of your wishes that i may cooperate with them and taking into consideration the determination i have unalterably fixed for retiring from my office at the close of our first federal cycle which will be first of march      all this is confided sacredly to your secrecy being known to no living mortal but the president madison and yourself  thomas jefferson feb     plan of posts j mss feb      it is proposed that there shall be one post a week passing along the main post road from north to south at the rate of  00 miles a day all intermediate post  all cross posts to remain as at present unless it should be thought well to put the post towards kentuckey as far as practicable on the quick establishment let this road be divided into stages of    miles each as nearly as may be and let there be a postman to each stage for some stages from the seat of government  the great towns a light cart drawn     by two horses as used in europe will probably be found necessary after which we may expect a horse  portmenteau will suffice let the hours for post riding be from   oclock in the morning to    oclock at night which gives  0 hours allowing to every rider   hours to perform his stage of    miles if he rides at the rate of   miles an hour he will have near an hour for crossing ferries other delays  accidents—there may be a saving near the seat of government by sending the postman  his mail by the stages to baltimore  new york when that is performed by the stages in one day let every rider take a way bill from the postmaster of the stage he leaves expressing the day hour  minute of his departure and have entered on the same bill by the postmaster at the next stage the hour  minute of his arrival  let the waybill be returned by the same post to the postmaster general at the seat of government that delays may be traced by him whenever any circumstance shall call for it thomas jefferson february  d      philadelphia george hammond to the british minister george hammond j mss philadelphia february  d      sir —on the receipt of your letter of the   th of december i communicated it to the president of the united states and under the sanction of his authority the principal members of the executive department made it their duty to make known in conversations generally the explicit disclaimer in the name of     your court which you had been pleased to give us that the government of canada had supported or encouraged the hostilities of our indian neighbours in the western country your favor of january the  0th to the same purpose has been in like manner communicated to the president and i am authorized to assure you that he is duly sensible of this additional proof of the disposition of the court of london to confine the proceedings of their officers in our vicinage within the limits of friendship and good neighbourhood and that a conduct so friendly and just will furnish us a motive the more for those duties and good offices which neighbour nations owe each other you have seen too much sir of the conduct of the press in countries where it is free to consider the gazettes as evidence of the sentiments of any part of the government you have seen them bestow on the government itself in all its parts its full share of inculpation of the sentiments of our government on the subject of your letter i cannot give you better evidence than the statement of the causes of the indian war made by the secretary of war on the   th of the last month by order of the president and inserted in the public papers no interference on the part of your nation is therein stated among the causes of the war i am happy however in the hope that a due execution of the treaty will shortly silence those expressions of public feeling by removing their cause and i have the honor to be with great respect and esteem sir your most obedient  most humble servant     thomas jefferson february  th      philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states j mss philadelphia february  th      sir —the late appointment of a minister resident to the hague has brought under consideration the condition of mr dumas and the question whether he is or is not at present in the service of the u s mr dumas very early in the war was employed first by dr franklin afterwards by mr adams to transact the affairs of the u s in holland congress never passed any express vote of confirmation but they opened a direct correspondence with mr dumas sent him orders to be executed confirmed and augmented his salary made that augmentation retrospective directed him to take up his residence in their hotel at the hague and passed such other votes from time to time as established him de facto their agent at the hague on the change in the organization of our government in      no commission nor new appointment took place with respect to him tho it did in most other cases yet the correspondence with him from the office of foreign affairs has been continued and he has regularly received his salary a doubt has been suggested whether this be legal i have myself no doubt but that it is legal i consider the source of authority with us to be the nation—their will declared through its proper organ is valid till revoked by their will declared through its proper organ again also between            the proper organ for pronouncing their will whether legislative or executive was a congress formed in a particular manner     since      it is a congress formed in a different manner for laws and a president elected in a particular way for making appointments  doing other executive acts the laws and appointments of the antient congress were as valid  permanent in their nature as the laws of the new congress or appointments of the new executive these laws  appointments in both cases deriving equally their source from the will of the nation and when a question arises whether any particular law or appointment is still in force we are to examine not whether it was pronounced by the antient or present organ but whether it has been at any time revoked by the authority of the nation expressed by the organ competent at the time the nation by the act of their federal convention established some new principles  some new organizations of the government this was a valid declaration of their will and ipso facto revoked some laws before passed and discontinued some offices  officers before appointed wherever by this instrument an old office was suspended by a new one a new appointment became necessary but where the new constitution did not demolish an office either expressly or virtually nor the president remove the officer both the office and officer remained this was the case of several in many of them indeed an excess of caution dictated the superaddition of a new appointment but where there was no such superaddition as in the instance of mr dumas both the office and officer still remained for the will of the nation validly pronounced by the proper organ of the day had constituted him their agent and that     will has not through any of its successive organs revoked its appointment i think therefore there is no room to doubt its continuance and that the receipt of salary by him has been lawful however i would not wish to take on myself alone the decision of a question so important whether considered in a legal or constitutional view and therefore submit it to you sir whether it is not a proper question whereon to take the opinion of the attorney general another question then arises ought mr dumas to be discontinued i am of opinion he ought not   not at this time because mr shorts mission to madrid will occasion an immediate vacancy at the hague again and because by the time that will be over his appointment at the hague must be discontinued altogether unless congress should enlarge the foreign fund   not at any time because when after the peace mr dumass agency became of less importance congress under various views of his sacrifices  services manifested that their continuance of him was in consideration of these and of his advanced years  infirm state which render it impossible for him to launch into a new line of gaining a livelihood and they thought the continuance of moderate competence to him for moderate services was more honorable to the u s than to abandon him in the face of europe after  under such circumstances     thomas jefferson february  th      philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states j mss philadelphia february  th      sir —an account presented to me by mr john b cutting for expenditures incurred by him in liberating the seamen of the united states in british ports during the impressments which took place under that government in the year    0 obliges me to recall some former transactions to your mind you will be pleased to recollect the numerous instances of complaint or information to us about that time of the violences committed on our seafaring citizens in british ports by their pressgangs and officers and that not having even a consul there at that time it was thought fortunate that a private citizen who happened to be on the spot stept forward for their protection that it was obvious that these exertions on his part must be attended with expence and that a particular demand of £ 0 sterling for this purpose coming incidentally to my knowledge it was immediately remitted to mr cutting with a request to account for it in convenient time he now presents an account of all his expenditures in this business which i have the honor to communicate herewith according to this the oppression extends to a much greater number of our citizens  their relief is more costly than had been contemplated it will be necessary to lay the account before the legislature because the expenditures being of a description which had not occurred before no appropriation heretofore made would     authorize payment at the treasury because too the nature of the transactions may in some instances require justly that the ordinary rules of evidence which the auditor is bound to apply to ordinary cases should suffer relaxations which he probably will not think himself authorized to admit without the orders of the legislature the practice in great britain of impressing seamen whenever war is apprehended will fall more heavily on ours than on those of any other foreign nation on account of the sameness of language our minister at that court therefore will on these occasions be under the necessity of interfering for their protection in a way which will call for expence it is desireable that these expences should be reduced to certain rules as far as the nature of the case will admit and the sooner they are so reduced the better this may be done however on surer grounds after the government of great britain shall have entered with us into those arrangements on this particular subject which the seriousness of the case calls for on our part and its difficulty may admit on theirs this done it will be desirable that legislative rules be framed which may equally guide and justify the proceedings of our minister or other agent at that court and at the same time extend to our seafaring citizens the protection of which they have so much need mr cutting being on the spot will himself furnish the explanations and documents of his case either to the legislature or a committee of it or to the auditor as he shall be required   0 thomas jefferson mar        george washington to the president of the united states d s mss mar        th jefferson presents his respectful compliments to the president and returns him the letter of genl st clair he finds nothing in it about which he has any doubt except the following passage nor do i see from any information in my possession that your exertions were wanting for any preparatory measures previous to the action nor in the time of the action th j never had a statement of the matter himself from genl st clair in conversation but he has heard from those who have that it appears from his own account that he was so confident he should not meet an enemy that he did not take sufficient precautions to be advised of one previous to the action  his manner of conducting the action itself has been generally censured if these criticisms be founded the only question is whether the above expressions will be so understood as to be exposed to them th j does not pretend to judge of the facts and perhaps the expressions may bear another meaning      thomas jefferson mar       george washington report on matters of negotiation with spain  d s mss mar        the secretary of state having understood from communications with the commissioners of his catholic majesty subsequent to that which he reported to the president on the   d of december last that though they considered the navigation of the mississippi as the principal object of negociation between the two countries yet it was expected by their court that the conferences would extend to all the matters which were under negociation on the former occasion with mr gardoqui and particularly to some arrangements of commerce—is of opinion that to renew the conferences on this subject also since they desire it will be but friendly and respectful  can lead to nothing without our own consent and that to refuse it might obstruct the settlement of the questions of navigation and boundary and therefore reports to the president of the united states the following observations and instructions to the commissioners of the united states appointed to negociate     with the court of spain a treaty or convention relative to the navigation of the missisippi which observations and instructions he is of opinion should be laid before the senate of the united states and     their decision be desired whether they will advise and consent that a treaty be entered into by the commissioners of the united states with spain conformable thereto     after stating to our commissioners the foundation of our rights to navigate the missisippi  to hold our southern boundary at the   st degree of latitude and that each of these is to be a sine qua non it is proposed to add as follows on the former conferences on the navigation of     the missisippi spain choose to blend with it the subject of commerce and accordingly specific propositions thereon passed between the negociators her object then was to obtain our renunciation of the navigation and to hold out commercial arrangements perhaps as a lure to us perhaps however she might then  may now really set a value on commercial arrangements with us and may receive them as a consideration for accommodating us in the navigation or may wish for them to have the appearance of receiving a consideration commercial arrangements if acceptable in themselves will not be the less so if coupled with those relating to navigation  boundary we have only to take care that they be acceptable in themselves there are two principles which may be proposed as the basis of a commercial treaty  st that of     exchanging the privileges of native citizens or  d those of the most favoured nation  st with the nations holding important possessions in america we are ready to exchange the rights of native citizens provided they be extended through the whole possessions of both parties but the propositions of spain made on the former occasion a copy of which accompanies this were that we should give their merchants vessels and productions the privileges of native merchants vessels  productions thro the whole of our possessions and they give the same to ours only in spain  the canaries this is inadmissible because unequal and as we believe that spain is not ripe for an equal exchange on this basis we avoid proposing it  d though treaties which merely exchange the rights of the most favoured nations are not without all inconvenience yet they have their conveniences also it is an important one that they leave each party free to make what internal regulations they please and to give what preferences they find expedient to native merchants vessels  productions and as we already have treaties on this basis with france holland sweden  prussia the two former of which are perpetual it will be but small additional embarrassment to extend it to spain—on the contrary we are sensible it is right to place that nation on the most favoured footing whether we have a treaty with them or not  it can do us no harm to secure by treaty a reciprocation of the right of the four treaties before mentioned either the french or the prussian might be taken as a model     but it would be useless to propose the prussian because we have already supposed that spain would never consent to those articles which give to each party access to all the dominions of the other and without this equivalent we would not agree to tie our own hands so materially in war as would be done by the   d article which renounces the right of fitting out privateers or of capturing merchant vessels the french treaty therefore is proposed as the model in this however the following changes are to be made we should be admitted to all the dominions of spain to which any other foreign nation is or may be admitted— art   being an exemption from a particular duty in france will of course be omitted as inapplicable to spain— art   to be omitted as unnecessary with morocco and inefficacious  little honorable with any of the barbary powers but it may furnish occasion to sound spain on the project of a convention of the powers at war with the barbary states to keep up by rotation a constant cruise of a given force on their coasts till they shall be compelled to renounce forever and against all nations their predatory practices perhaps the infidelities of the algerines to their treaty of peace with spain tho the latter does not chuse to break openly may induce her to subsidize us to cruise against them with a given force— art     0 concerning fisheries to be omitted as inapplicable     art    the first paragraph of this article respecting the droit daubaine to be omitted that law being supposed peculiar to france art    giving asylum in the ports of either to the armed vessels of the other with the prizes taken from the enemies of that other must be qualified as it is in the   th article of the prussian treaty as the stipulation in the latter part of the article that no shelter or refuge shall be given in the ports of the one to such as shall have made prize on the subjects of the other of the parties would forbid us in case of a war between france  spain to give shelter in our ports to prizes made by the latter on the former while the first part of the article would oblige us to shelter those made by the former on the latter a very dangerous covenant and which ought never to be repeated in any other instance art    consent should be received at all the ports at which the vessels of either party may be received art  0 concerning free ports in europe  america free ports in the spanish possessions in america  particularly at the havanna are more to be desired than expected it can therefore only be recommended to the best endeavours of the commissioners to obtain them it will be something to obtain for our vessels flour c admission to those ports during their pleasure in like manner if they could be prevailed on to reestablish our right of cutting log wood in the bay of campeachy on the footing on which it stood before the treaty of      it would be desireable and not endanger to us any     contest with the english who by the revolution treaty are restrained to the south eastern parts of yucatan art    the act of ratification on our part may require a twelvemonth from the date of the treaty as the senate meets regularly but once a year and to return it to madrid for exchange may require four months more the treaty must not exceed years duration except the clauses relating to boundary  the navigation of the missisippi —which must be perpetual  final indeed these two subjects had better be in a separate instrument there might have been mentioned a third species of arrangement that of making special agreements on every special subject of commerce and of settling a tariff to be paid on each side on every particular article but this would require in our commissioners a very minute knowledge of our commerce as it is impossible to foresee every proposition of this kind which might be brought into discussion and to prepare them for it by information  instruction from hence our commerce too is as yet rather in a course of experiment and the channels in which it will ultimately flow are not sufficiently known to enable us to provide for it by special agreement nor have the exigencies of our new government as yet so far developed themselves as that we can know to what degree we may or must have recourse to commerce for the purposes of revenue no common consideration therefore ought to induce us as yet to arrangements of this kind perhaps nothing should  00 do it with any nation short of the privileges of natives in all their possessions foreign and domestic it were to be wished indeed that some positively favourable stipulations respecting our grain flour  fish could be obtained even on our giving reciprocal advantages to some of the commodities of spain say her wines  brandies but  st if we quit the ground of the most favoured nation as to certain articles for our convenience spain may insist on doing the same for other articles for her convenience and thus our commissioners will get themselves on the ground of a treaty of detail for which they will not be prepared  d if we grant favour to the wines  brandies of spain then portugal  france will demand the same and in order to create an equivalent portugal may lay a duty on our fish  grain and france a prohibition on our whale oil the removal of which will be proposed as an equivalent thus much however as to grain  flour may be attempted there has not long since been a considerable duty laid on them in spain this was while a treaty on the subject of commerce was pending between us and spain as that court considers the matter it is not generally thought right to change the state of things pending a treaty concerning them on this consideration and on the motive of cultivating our friendship perhaps the commissioners may induce them to restore this commodity to the footing on which it was on opening the conferences with mr gardoqui on the   th day of july      if spain says do the same by your tonnage  0  on our vessels the answer may be that our foreign tonnage affects spain very little and other nations very much whereas the duty on flour in spain affects us very much and other nations very little consequently there would be no equality in reciprocal relinquishment as there had been none in the reciprocal innovation and spain by insisting on this would in fact only be aiding the interests of her rival nations to whom we should be forced to extend the same indulgence at the time of opening the conferences too we had as yet not erected any system our government itself being not yet erected innovation then was unavoidable on our part if it be innovation to establish a system we did it on fair  general ground on ground favorable to spain but they had a system and therefore innovation was avoidable on their part thomas jefferson mar  0      philadelphia gouverneur morris to the minister to france gouverneur morris philadelphia mar  0      dear sir —my letter of jan    put under cover to mr johnson in london  sent by a passenger in the british packet of february will have conveyed to you your appointment as min plen to the u s at the court of france by the pennsylvania capt harding bound to havre

motte you will also receive a letter from the president to the king of france in answer to his announcing the acceptance of the constitution which came to hand only a week ago a copy of this letter is sent for your own use you will be pleased to deliver the sealed one to the minister i presume according to the antient etiquette of the court accompanying it with the assurances of friendship which the occasion may permit you to express and which are cordially felt by the president  the great body of our nation we wish no occasion to be omitted of impressing the national assembly with this truth we had expected ere this that in consequence of the recommendation of their predecessors some overtures would have been made to us on the subject of a treaty of commerce an authentic copy of the recommendation was delivered but nothing said about carrying it into effect perhaps they expect that we should declare our readiness to meet them on the ground of treaty if they do we have no hesitation to declare it in the mean time if the present communications produce any sensation perhaps it may furnish a good occasion to endeavour to have matters replaced in statu quo by repealing the late innovations as to our ships tobo  whale oil it is right that things should be on their antient footing at opening the treaty—m ternant has applied here for  00000 dollars for the succour of the french colonies the secretary of the treasury has reason to believe that the late loan at antwerp has paid up all our arrearages to france both of principal  interest  consequently that  0  there is no part of our debt exigible at this time however the legislature having authorized the president to proceed in borrowing to pay off the residue provided it can be done to the advantage of the u s it is thought the law will be satisfied with avoiding loss to the u s this has obliged the secretary of the treasury to require some conditions which may remove from us that loss which we encountered from an unfavorable exchange to pay what was exigible and transfer it to france as to payments not exigible these shall be fully detailed to you when settled in the meantime the money will be furnished as far as it can be done indeed our wishes are cordial for the reestablishment of peace  commerce in those colonies and to give such proofs of our good faith both to them  the mother country as to suppress all that jealousy which might oppose itself to the free exchange of our mutual productions so essential to the prosperity of those colonies and to the preservation of our agricultural interest this is our true interest  our true object and we have no reason to conceal views so justifiable tho the expression of them may require that the occasions be proper  the terms chosen with delicacy—the gazettes will inform you of the proceedings of congress the laws passed  proposed  generally speaking of all public transactions you will perceive that the indian war calls for sensible exertions it would have been a trifle had we only avowed enemies to contend with the british court have disavowed all aid to the indians whatever may have been their orders in that direction the indians  0  are fully  notoriously supplied by their agents with everything necessary to carry on the war—time will shew how all this is to end—besides the laws journals  newspapers before mentioned

will induce him to come here if necessary   the few that refuse to come will lend their money or give credit for goods this necessary for a short time only we can soon do without this class of brit capitalists thomas jefferson march         philadelphia archibald stuart to archibald stuart  philadelphia march         dear sir —your favor was recd lately it gave me pleasure to hear you were well and that yr lady was so likewise as i presume to be the case from the chearful style in which it was expressed the fate of the bill to which you allude has not even yet been  0  decided the ground of the opposition has been founded on the discovery that the ratio of  0000 gave smaller fractions to the southern than to the eastern states and to prevent this a variety of propositions have been made among which is the following now depending to supply the ratio of  0000 to the aggregate population of the union not that of the individual states which will give   0 members  then apportion those members among the several states by as many different ratios as there are states or to the population of each state giving them one for every  0000 as far as it will go making      then distribute the remaining   members among those states having the highest fractions of which five will be given to the states east of this the bill was once lost by the adherence of the two houses and is now depending before the house of rep upon an amendment to this effect from the senate which passed by a majority of one vote only the effect of this principle must be deemed a very pernicious one and in my opinion subversion of that contained in the constitution which in the  rd paragraph of the  nd sect  st article founds the representation on the population of each state in terms as explicit as it could well have been done besides it takes the fractions of some states to supply the deficiency of others  thus makes the people of georgia the instrument of giving a member to n hampshire what will be the fate of the bill is altogether incertain on our part the principle will never be yielded for when such obvious encroachments are made on the plain meaning of the constitution  0  the bond of union ceases to be the equal measure of justice to all its parts on theirs a very persevering firmness is likewise observed they appear to me to play a hazardous game the government secures them many important blessings all those which it gives to us  many more and yet with these they seem not to be satisfied an act has passed for raising upon the regular establishment for the war  000 additional troops and a corps of  00 more making in the whole about five thousand men to this i was opposed from a conviction they were useless and that    or   00 woods men wod soon end the war and at a trifling expence we had once carried a proposition to this effect by   vote in the senate—but one of the members in favor of it afterwards shifted his ground and established the regular force the foreign arrangements you have seen in the publick papers incident to these only one circumstance has perhaps not reached you the opposition to that of govr morris upon the following principles   his general character being such that we would not confide in it   his known attachment to monarchy  contempt of republican government   d his present employment abroad being a news vender of back lands  certificates we took the yaes and naes on his appointment     voted against it this is submitted to yr discretion the militia bill is still depending i hope a bill will be past but that is questionable anything is preferable to nothing as it takes away one of the arguments for a standing army i shall not be able to attend the court this term as i fear congress will not adjourn till the last  0  of april my brother will take charge of my business as he is just commencing tis probable he will want assistance may i request of you to give him every aid  countenance in your power his

serve as instructions for you these expressing minutely the sense of our government  what they wish to have done it is unnecessary for me to do more here than desire you to pursue these objects unremittingly and endeavor to bring them to an issue in the course of the ensuing summer it is desirable that you should keep an exact journal of what shall pass between yourselves  the court or their negotiator  communicate it from time to time to me that your progress  prospects may be known you will be the best judges whether to send your letters by lisbon cadiz or what other route but we shall be anxious to hear from you as often as possible if no safe conveyance occurs from madrid to lisbon and your matter should be of importance sufficient to justify the expence a courier must be sent but

will be permitted to come away at that precise epoch so you need have no delicacy on that subject if you choose to remain there in your present grade i become more and more satisfied that the legislature will refuse the money for continuing any diplomatic character at the hague i hope you will consider success in the object you go on as the most important one of your life that you will meditate the matter day and night and make yourself thoroughly master of it in every possible form they may force you to discuss it a former letter has apprised you of my private intentions at the close of the present federal cycle my successor and his dispositions are equally unknown the administration may change then in other of its parts it is essential that this business be completed before any idea of these things get abroad otherwise spain may delay in hopes of a change of counsels here it will be a great comfort to leave this business safely and amicably settled which has so long and immediately threatened our peace gardoqui will probably be the negotiator on their part no attentions should be spared towards him or the count florida blanca let what will be said or done preserve your sang froid immovably and to every obstacle oppose patience perseverance and soothing language pardon my sermonizing it proceeds from the interest i feel in this business and in your success it will be     well that you examine with the most minute attention all the circumstances which may enable you to judge and communicate to us whether the situation of spain admits her to go to war the failure of some stock gamblers and some other circumstances have brought the public paper low the   per cents have fallen from    to     –  and bank stock from     or   0 to    or    within two or three weeks this nefarious business is becoming more and more the public detestation and cannot fail when the knowledge of it shall be sufficiently extended to tumble its authors headlong from their heights money is leaving the remoter parts of the union and flowing to this place to purchase paper and here a paper medium supplying its place it is shipped off in exchange for luxuries the value of property is necessarily falling in the places left bare of money in virginia for instance property has fallen    per cent in the last twelve months i wish to god you had some person who could dispose of your paper at a judicious moment for you and invest it in good lands i would do anything my duty would permit but were i to advise your agent who is himself a stock dealer to sell out yours at this or that moment it would be used as a signal to guide speculations there can never be a fear but that the paper which represents the public debt will be ever sacredly good the public faith is bound for this and no change of system will ever be permitted to touch this but no other paper stands on ground equally sure i am glad therefore that yours is all of this kind     some bishop of spain who was for some time in mexico found there copies of cortezs correspondence and on his return to spain published them i have made many efforts to get this book but in vain i must beg you to procure it for me while there it is not many years since it was published i am with constant and sincere attachment dear sir your affectionate friend and servant thomas jefferson mar        george washington report on negotiation with spain  j mss mar         the appointment of mr carmichael  mr short as commissioners to negociate with the court of spain a treaty or convention relative to the navigation of the missisipi  which perhaps may be extended to other interests rendering it necessary that the subjects to be treated of should be developed  the conditions of arrangement explained the secretary of state reports to the president of the united states the following observations on the subjects of negociation between the u s of america  the court of spain to be communicated by way of instruction to the commissioners     of the u s appointed as before mentioned to manage that negociation these subjects are i boundary ii the navigation of the missisipi iii commerce i as to boundary that between georgia and florida is the only one which will need any explanation—spain sets up the claim to possessions within the state of georgia founded on her having rescued them by force from the british during the late war the following view of that subject seems to admit no reply the several states now composing the u s of america were from their first establishment separate  distinct societies dependant on no other society of men whatever they continued at the head of their respective governments the executive magistrate who presided over the one they had left      thereby secured in effect a constant amity with that nation in this stage of their government their several boundaries were fixed  particularly the southern boundary of georgia the only one now in question was established at the   st degree of latitude from the apalachicola westwardly  the western boundary originally the pacific ocean was by the treaty of paris reduced to the middle of the missisipi the part which our chief magistrate took in a war waged against us by the nation among whom he resided obliged us to discontinue him  to name one within every state in the course of this war we were joined by france as an ally  by spain  holland as associates having a common enemy each sought that common enemy wherever they could find him france on our invitation landed a large army within our territories continued it with us two years  aided us in recovering sundry places from the possession of the enemy but she did not pretend to keep possession of the places rescued spain entered into the remote western part of our territory dislodged the common enemy from several posts they held therein to the annoyance of spain  perhaps thought it necessary to remain in some of them as the only means of preventing their return we in like manner dislodged them from several posts in the same western territory to wit vincennes cahokia kaskaskia c rescued the inhabitants  retained constantly afterwards both them  the territory under our possession  government at the conclusion of the war great britain on the  0th of nov      by treaty     acknowleged our independance  our boundary to wit the missisipi to the west  the completion of the   st degree c to the south in her treaty with spain concluded seven weeks afterwards to wit jan  0      she ceded to her the two floridas which had been defined in the proclamation of      and minorca  by the  th article of the treaty spain agreed to restore without compensation all the territories conquered by her  not included in the treaty either under the head of cessions or restitutions that is to say all except minorca  the floridas according to this stipulation spain was expressly bound to have delivered up the possession she had taken within the limits of georgia to great britain if they were conquests on great britain who was to deliver them over to the u s or rather she should have delivered them to the u s themselves as standing quoad hoc in the place of gr britain and she was bound by natural right to deliver them to the same u s on a much stronger ground as the real and only proprietors of those places which she had taken possession of in a moment of danger without having had any cause of war with the u s to whom they belonged  without having declared any but on the contrary conducting herself in other respects as a friend  associate vattel l       it is an established principle that conquest gives only an inchoate right which does not become perfect till confirmed by the treaty of peace  by a renunciation or abandonment by the former proprietor had g britain been that former proprietor     she was so far from confirming to spain the right to the territory of georgia invaded by spain that she expressly relinquished to the u s any right that might remain in her  afterwards completed that relinquishment by procuring  consolidating with it the agreement of spain herself to restore such territory without compensation—it is still more palpable that a war existing between two nations as spain  gr britain could give to neither the right to seize  appropriate the territory of a third which is even neutral much less which is an associate in the war as the u s were with spain see on this subject grotius l   c   §    puffend l   c   §       vattel l   §         on the conclusion of the general peace the u s lost no time in requiring from spain an evacuation of their territory this has been hitherto delayed by means which we need not explain to that court but which have been equally contrary to our right  to our consent should spain pretend as has been intimated that there was a secret article of treaty between the u s and gr britain agreeing if at the close of the war the latter should retain the floridas that then the southern boundary of georgia should be the completion of the   d degree of north latitude the commissioners may safely deny all knolege of the fact  refuse conference on any such postulatum or should they find it necessary to enter into argument on the subject they will of course do it hypothetically and in that way may justly say on the part of the u s suppose that the u s exhausted     by a bloody  expensive war with g britain might have been willing to have purchased peace by relinquishing under a particular contingency a small part of their territory it does not follow that the same u s recruited  better organised must relinquish the same territory to spain without striking a blow the u s too have irrevocably put it out of their power to do it by a new constitution which guarantees every state against the invasion of its territory a disastrous war indeed might by necessity supercede this stipulation as necessity is above all law  oblige them to abandon a part of a state but nothing short of this can justify or obtain such an abandonment the southern limits of georgia depend chiefly on   the charter of carolina to the lords proprietors in      extending southwardly to the river matheo now called st johns supposed in the charter to be in lat   ° and  0 west in a direct line as far as the south sea see the charter in    mémoires de lamerique       on

postlethwayte voce british america   on the treaties between the u s and gr britain of nov  0       sep      repeating  confirming these antient boundaries there was an intermediate transaction to wit a convention concluded at the prado in      whereby it was agreed that ministers plenipotentiary should be immediately appointed by spain  gr britain for settling the limits of florida  carolina the convention is to be found in the collections of treaties but the proceedings of the plenipotentiaries are unknown here qu if it was on that occasion that the southern boundary of carolina was transferred from the latitude of matheo or st johns river further north to the st marys or was it the proclamation of      which first removed this boundary if the commissioners can procure in spain a copy of whatever was agreed on in consequence of the convention of the prado it is a desireable statepaper here to this demonstration of our rights may be added the explicit declaration of the court of spain that she would accede to them this took place in conversations  correspondence thereon between mr jay m p for the u s at the court of madrid the marquis de la fayette  the count de florida blanca monsr de la fayette in his letter of feb         to the count de florida blanca states the result of their conversations on limits in these words with respect to limits his catholic majesty has adopted those that are determined by the preliminaries     of the  0th of nov between the u s  the court of london—the ct de florida blanca in his answer of feb    to m de la fayette says altho it is his majestys intentions to abide for the present by the limits established by the treaty of the  0th of nov      between the english  the americans the king intends to inform himself particularly whether it can be in any ways inconvenient or prejudicial to settle that affair amicably with the u s and m de la fayette in his letter of the same day to mr jay wherein he had inserted the preceding says on receiving the answer of the count de florida blanca to wit his answer beforementioned to m de la fayette i desired an explanation respecting the addition that relates to the limits i was answered that it was a fixed principle to abide by the limits established by the treaty between the english  the americans that his remark related only to more unimportant details which he wished to receive from the spanish commandants which would be amicably regulated  would by no means oppose the general principle i asked him before the ambassador of france m de montmorin whether he would give me his word of honor for it he assured me he would  that i might engage it to the u s see the report sent herewith ii the navigation of the missisipi our right to navigate that river from its source to where our southern boundary strikes it is not questioned it is from that point downwards only that the exclusive navigation is claimed by spain     that is to say where she holds the country on both sides to wit louisiana on the west  florida on the east our right to participate in the navigation of that part of the river also is to be considered under   the treaty of paris of        the revolution treaty of         the law of nature and nations   the war of     –     was carried on jointly by gr britain  the    colonies now the u s of america against france  spain at the peace which was negociated by our common magistrate a right was secured to the subject of gr britain the common designation of all those under his government to navigate the missisipi in its whole breadth  length from its source to the sea  expressly that part which is between the island of new orleans  the right bank of that river as well as the passage both in  out of its mouth  that the vessels should not be stopped visited or subjected to the payment of any duty whatsoever these are the words of the treaty article vii florida was at the same time ceded by spain  its extent westwardly was fixed to the lakes pontchartrain  maurepas  the river missisipi  spain received soon after from france a cession of the island of new orleans  all the country she held westward of the missisipi subject of course to our right of navigating between that country and the island previously granted to us by france this right was not parcelled out to us in severalty that is to say to each the exclusive navigation of so much     of the river as was adjacent to our several shores in which way it would have been useless to all but it was placed on that footing on which alone it could be worth anything to wit as a right to all to navigate the whole length of the river in common the import of the terms  the reason of the thing prove it was a right of common in the whole  not a several right to each of a particular part to which may be added the evidence of the stipulation itself that we should navigate between new orleans  the western bank which being adjacent to none of our states could be held by us only as a right of common—such was the nature of our right to navigate the missisipi as far as established by the treaty of paris   in the course of the revolutionwar in which the thirteen colonies spain  france were opposed to great britain spain took possession of several posts held by the british in florida it is unnecessary to enquire whether the possession of half a dozen posts scattered thro a country of seven or eight hundred miles extent could be considered as the possession  conquest of that country if it was it gave still but an inchoate right as was before explained which could not be perfected but by the relinquishment of the former possessor at the close of the war but certainly it could not be considered as a conquest of the river even against gr britain since the possession of the shores to wit of the island of new orleans on the one side  louisiana on the other having undergone no change the right in the water would remain the same if considered only in     its relation to them  if considered as a distinct right independant of the shores then no naval victories obtained by spain over gr britain in the course of the war gave her the colour of conquest over any water which the british fleet could enter still less can she be considered as having conquered the river as against the u s with whom she was not at war we had a common right of navigation in the part of the river between florida the island of new orleans  the western bank  nothing which passed between spain  gr britain either during the war or at its conclusion could lessen that right accordingly at the treaty of nov      gr britain confirmed the rights of the u s to the navigation of the river from its source to its mouth  in jan      compleated the right of spain to the territory of florida by an absolute relinquishment of all her rights in it this relinquishment could not include the navigation held by the u s in their own right because this right existed in themselves only  was not in gr britain if it added anything to the rights of spain respecting the river between the eastern  western banks it could only be that portion of right which gr britain had retained to herself in the treaty with the u s held seven weeks before to wit a right of using it in common with the u s so that as by the treaty of      the u s had obtained a common right of navigating the whole river from its source to its mouth so by the treaty of      that common right was confirmed to them by the only power who could pretend claims against them founded on the state     of war nor has that common right been transferred to spain by either conquest or cession but our right is built on ground still broader  more unquestionable to wit   on the law of nature  nations if we appeal to this as we feel it written in the heart of man what sentiment is written in deeper characters than that the ocean is free to all men  the rivers to all their inhabitants is there a man savage or civilized unbiassed by habit who does not feel  attest this truth accordingly in all tracts of country united under the same political society we find this natural right universally acknoleged  protected by laying the navigable rivers open to all their inhabitants when their rivers enter the limits of another society if the right of the upper inhabitants to descend the stream is in any case obstructed it is an act of force by a stronger society against a weaker condemned by the judgment of mankind the late case of antwerp and the scheld was a striking proof of a general union of sentiment on this point as it is believed that amsterdam had scarcely an advocate out of holland and even there its pretensions were advocated on the ground of treaties  not of natural right the commissioners would do well to examine thoroughly what was written on this occasion—the commissioners will be able perhaps to find either in the practice or the pretensions of spain as to the douro tagus  guadiana some acnolegements of this principle on the part of that nation—this sentiment of right in favor of the upper inhabitants     must become stronger in the proportion which their extent of country bears to the lower the u s hold  00000 square miles of habitable territory on the missisipi  its branches  this river and its branches affords many thousands of miles of navigable waters penetrating this territory in all its parts the inhabitable grounds of spain below our boundary  bordering on the river which alone can pretend any fear of being incommoded by our use of the river are not the thousandth part of that extent this vast portion of the territory of the u s has no other outlet for its productions  these productions are of the bulkiest kind and in truth their passage down the river may not only be innocent as to the spanish subjects on the river but cannot fail to enrich them far beyond their present condition the real interests then of all the inhabitants upper  lower concur in fact with their rights if we appeal to the law of nature  nations as expressed by writers on the subject it is agreed by them that were the river where it passes between florida  louisiana the exclusive right of spain still an innocent passage along it is a natural right in those inhabiting its borders above it would indeed be what those writers call an imperfect right because the modification of its exercise depends in considerable degree on the conveniency of the nation thro which they are to pass but it is still a right as real as any other right however well defined  were it to be refused or to be so shackled by regulations not necessary for the peace or safety of its inhabitants as to render its use impracticable to     us it would then be an injury of which we should be entitled to demand redress the right of the upper inhabitants to use this navigation is the counterpart to that of those possessing the shores below  founded on the same natural relations with the soil  water  the line on which their rights meet is to be advanced or withdrawn so as to equalize the inconveniencies resulting to each party from the exercise of the right by the other this estimate is to be fairly made with a mutual disposition to make equal sacrifices  the numbers on each side are to have their due weight in the estimate spain holds so very small a tract of habitable land on either side below our boundary that it may in fact be considered as a streight of the sea for tho it is  0 leagues from our boundary to the mouth of the river yet it is only here  there in spots  slips that the land rises above the level of the water in times of inundation there are then  ever must be so few inhabitants on her part of the river that the freest use of its navigation may be admitted to us without their annoyance for authorities on this subject see grot ch    c   §          c   §        puffend l   c   §         wolffs inst §   0         vattel l   §     l   §     to     it is essential to the interests of both parties that the navigation of the river be free to both on the footing on which it was defined by the treaty of paris viz thro its whole breadth the channel of the missisipi is remarkably winding crossing  recrossing perpetually from one side to the other     of the general bed of the river within the elbows thus made by the channel there is generally an eddy setting upwards and it is by taking advantage of these eddies  constantly crossing from one to another of them that boats are enabled to ascend the river without this right the whole river would be impracticable both to the americans  spaniards  it is a principle that the right to a thing gives a right to the means without which it could not be used that is to say that the means follow their end thus a right to navigate a river draws to it a right to moor vessels to its shores to land on them in cases of distress or for other necessary purposes c this principle is founded in natural reasons is evidenced by the common sense of mankind and declared by the writers before quoted see grot l   c   §    puffend l   c   §   vattel l   §     the roman law which like other municipal laws placed the navigation of their rivers on the footing of nature as to their own citizens by declaring them public flumina publica sunt pax est populi romani inst   t   §   declared also that the right to the use of the shores was incident to that of the water ib §         the laws of every country probably do the same this     must have been so understood between france  gr britain at the treaty of paris when a right was ceded to british subjects to navigate the whole river  expressly that part between the island of new orleans  the western bank without stipulating a word about the use of the shores tho both of them belonged to france  were to belong immediately to spain had not the use of the shores been considered as incident to that of the water it would have been expressly stipulated since its necessity was too obvious to have escaped either party accordingly all british subjects used the shores habitually for the purposes necessary to the navigation of the river and when a spanish governor undertook at one time to forbid this  even cut loose the vessels fastening to the shores a british frigate went immediately moored itself to the shore opposite the town of new orleans  set out guards with orders to fire on such as might attempt to disturb her moorings the governor acquiesced the right was constantly exercised afterwards  no interruption ever offered this incidental right extends even beyond the shores when circumstances render it necessary to the exercise of the principal right as in the case of a vessel damaged where the mere shore would not be a safe deposit for her cargo till she could be repaired she may remove it into safe ground off the river the roman law shall be quoted here too because it gives a good idea both of the extent  the limitations of this right inst l   t   §  riparum quoque usus publicus est ut volunt jura gentium   0 sicut et ipsius fluminis usus publicus est itaque et navigium ad ripas appellere et funes de arboribus ibi natis

to guide the navigators the establishment of these at joint expence  under joint regulations may be     the subject of a future convention in the meantime both should be free to have their own  refuse those of the other both as to use  expence very peculiar circumstances attending the river missisipi require that the incidental right of accomodation on the shore which needs only occasional exercise on other rivers should be habitual  constant on this sea vessels cannot navigate that river nor the river vessels go to sea the navigation would be useless then without an entrepot where these vessels might safely deposit their own cargoes  take those left by the others  where warehouses  keepers might be constantly established for the safeguard of the cargoes it is admitted indeed that the incidental right thus extended into the territory of the bordering inhabitants is liable to stricter modifications in proportion as it interferes with their territorial right but the inconveniences of both parties are still to have their weight  reason  moderation on both sides are to draw the lines between them as to this we count much on the liberality of spain on her concurrence in opinion with us that it is for the interest of both parties to remove completely this germ of discord from between us  draw our friendship as close as circumstances proclaim that it should be  on the considerations which make it palpable that a convenient spot placed under our exclusive occupation  exempted from the jurisdiction  police of their government is far more likely to preserve peace than a mere freeport where eternal altercations would keep us in eternal ill humour with each other     the policy of this measure  indeed of a much larger concession having been formerly sketched in a paper of july       0 sent to the commissioners severally they are now referred to that if this be agreed to the manner of fixing on that extra territorial spot becomes highly interesting the most desireable to us would be a permission to send commissioners to chuse such spot below the town of new orleans as they should find most convenient if this be refused it would be better now to fix on the spot our information is that the whole country below the town  for  0 miles above it on the western shore is low marshy  subject to such deep inundation for many miles from the rivers that if capable of being reclaimed at all by banking it would still never afford an entrepot sufficiently safe that on the eastern side the only lands below the town not subject to inundation are at the detour aux anglois or english turn the highest part of which is that whereon the fort ste marie formerly stood even this is said to have been raised by art  to be very little above the inundations this spot then is what we would fix on if obliged now to decide with from one to as many square miles of the circumjacent lands as can be obtained  comprehending expressly the shores above  below the site of the fort as far as possible—but as to the spot itself the limits  even whether it shall be extra territorial or only a free port  what regulations it shall be laid under the convenience of that government is entitled to so much respect      attention on our part that the arrangement must be left to the management of the commissioners who will doubtless use their best efforts to obtain all they can for us the worst footing on which the determination of the ground could be placed would be a reference to joint commissioners because their disagreement a very probable nay a certain event would undo the whole convention  leave us exactly where we now are unless indeed they will engage to us in case of such disagreement the highest grounds at the detour aux anglois of convenient extent including the landings  harbour thereto adjacent this would ensure us that ground unless better could be found  mutually preferred  close the delay of right under which we have so long laboured for peace sake it will probably be urged because it was urged on the former occasion that if spain grants to us the right of navigating the missisipi other nations will become entitled to it by virtue of treaties giving them the rights of the most favored nations two answers may be given to this   when those treaties were made no nations could be under contemplation but those then existing or those at most who might exist under similar circumstances america did not then exist as a nation  the circumstances of her position  commerce are so totally dissimiliar to everything then known that the treaties of that day were not adapted to any such being they would better fit even china than america because as a manufacturing nation     china resembles europe more when we sollicited france to admit our whale oils into her ports tho she had excluded all foreign whale oils her minister made the objection now under consideration  the foregoing answer was given it was found to be solid  the whale oils of the u s are in consequence admitted tho those of portugal  the hanse towns  of all other nations are excluded again when france  england were negociating their late treaty of commerce the great dissimilitude of our commerce which furnishes raw materials to employ the industry of others in exchange for articles whereon industry has been exhausted from the commerce of the european nations which furnished things ready wrought only was suggested to the attention of both negotiators  that they should keep their nations free to make particular arrangements with ours by communicating to each other only the rights of the most favored european nation each was separately sensible of the importance of the distinction  as soon as it was proposed by the one it was acceded to by the other  the word european was inserted in their treaty it may fairly be considered then as the rational and received interpretation of the diplomatic term gentis amicissimæ that it has not in view a nation unknown in many cases at the time of using the term  so dissimilar in all cases as to furnish no ground of just reclamation to any other nation   but the decisive answer is that spain does not grant us the navigation of the river we have an     inherent right to it  she may repel the demand of any other nation by candidly stating her act to have been what in truth it is a recognition only  not a grant if spain apprehends that other nations may claim access to our ports in the missisipi under their treaties with us giving them a right to come  trade in all our ports tho we would not chuse to insist on express stipulation against them yet we shall think ourselves justified to acquiesce in fact under any regulations spain may from time to time establish against their admission should spain renew another objection which she relied much on before that the english at the revolution treaty could not cede to us what spain had taken from them by conquest  what of course they did not possess themselves the preceding observations furnish sufficient matter for refutation to conclude the subjects of boundary  navigation each of the following conditions is to be considered by the commissioners as a sine qua non   that our southern boundary remains established at the completion of    degrees of latitude on the missisipi  so on to the ocean as has been before described  our western one along the middle of the channel of the missisipi however that channel may vary as it is constantly varying  that spain cease to occupy or to exercise jurisdiction in any part northward or eastward of these boundaries   that our right be acknolged of navigating the missisipi in its whole breadth  length from     its source to the sea as established by the treaty of        that neither vessels cargoes or the persons on board be stopped visited or subjected to the payment of any duty whatsoever or if a visit must be permitted that it be under such restrictions as to produce the least possible inconvenience but it should be altogether avoided if possible as the parent of perpetual broils   that such conveniences be allowed us ashore as may render our right of navigation practicable  under such regulations as may bonâ fide respect the preservation of peace  order alone  may not have in object to embarras our navigation or raise a revenue on it while the substance of this article is made a sine quâ non the modifications of it are left altogether to the discretion  management of the commissioners we might add as a fifth sine quâ non that no phrase should be admitted in the treaty which would express or imply that we take the navigation of the missisipi as a grant from spain but however disagreeable it would be to subscribe to such a sentiment yet were the conclusion of a treaty to hang on that single objection it would be expedient to waive it  to meet at a future day the consequences of any resumption they may pretend to make rather than at present those of a separation without coming to any agreement we know not whether spain has it in idea to ask a compensation for the ascertainment of our right   in the first place she cannot in reason ask a     compensation for yielding what we have a right to that is to say the navigation of the river  the conveniences incident to it of natural right   in the second place we have a claim on spain for indemnification for nine years exclusion from that navigation  a reimbursement of the heavy duties not less for the most part than    per cent on extravagant valuations levied on the commodities she has permitted to pass to n orleans the relinquishment of this will be no unworthy equivalent for any accomodations she may indulge us with beyond the line of our strict right and this claim is to be brought into view in proper time  manner merely to be abandoned in consideration of such accomodations—we have nothing else to give in exchange for as to territory we have neither the right nor the disposition to alienate an inch of what belongs to any member of our union such a proposition therefore is totally inadmissible  not to be treated of for a moment iii on the former conferences on the navigation of the missisipi spain chose to blend with it the subject of commerce  accordingly specific propositions thereon passed between the negociators her object then was to obtain our renunciation of the navigation  to hold out commercial arrangements perhaps as a lure to us perhaps however she might then  may now really set a value on commercial arrangements with us  may receive them as a consideration for accomodating us in the navigation or may wish for them to have the appearance of receiving a consideration     commercial arrangements if acceptable in themselves will not be the less so if coupled with those relating to navigation  boundary we have only to take care that they be acceptable in themselves there are two principles which may be proposed as the basis of a commercial treaty   that of exchanging the privileges of native citizens or   those of the most favored nation   with the nations holding important possessions in america we are ready to exchange the rights of native citizens provided they be extended thro the whole possessions of both parties but the propositions of spain made on the former occasion a copy of which accompanies this were that we should give their merchants vessels  productions the privilege of native merchants vessels  productions thro the whole of our possessions  they give the same to ours only in spain  the canaries this is inadmissible because unequal and as we believe that spain is not ripe for an equal exchange on this basis we avoid proposing it   tho treaties which merely exchange the rights of the most favored nations are not without all inconveniences yet they have their conveniences also it is an important one that they leave each party free to make what internal regulations they please  to give what preferences they find expedient to native merchants vessels  productions and as we already have treaties on this basis with france holland sweden  prussia the two former of which are perpetual it will be but small additional embarrassment to extend it to spain on the contrary     we are sensible it is right to place that nation on the most favored footing whether we have a treaty with them or not  it can do us no harm to secure by treaty a reciprocation of the right of the four treaties before mentioned either the french or the prussian might be taken as a model but it would be useless to propose the prussians because we have already supposed that spain would never consent to those articles which give to each party access to all the dominions of the other and without this equivalent we would not agree to tie our own hands so materially in war as would be done by the   d article which renounces the right of fitting out privateers or of capturing merchant vessels—the french treaty therefore is proposed as the model in this however the following changes are to be made we should be admitted to all the dominions of spain to which any other foreign nation is or may be admitted art   being an exception from a particular duty in france will of course be omitted as inapplicable to spain art   to be omitted as unnecessary with morocco  inefficacious  little honorable with any of the barbary powers but it may furnish occasion to sound spain on the project of a convention of the powers at war with the barbary states to keep up by rotation a constant cruize of a given force on their coasts till they shall be compelled to renounce for ever and against all nations their predatory practices perhaps the infidelities of the algerines to their treaty of peace with spain tho the   0 latter does not chuse to break openly may induce her to subsidize us to cruize against them with a given force art     0 concerning fisheries to be omitted as inapplicable art    the first paragraph of this article respecting the droit daubaine to be omitted that law being supposed peculiar to france art    giving asylum in the ports of either to the armed vessels of the other with the prizes taken from the enemies of that other must be qualified as it is in the   th art of the prussian treaty as the stipulation in the latter part of the article that no shelter or refuge shall be given in the ports of the one to such as shall have made prize on the subjects of the other of the parties would forbide us in case of a war between france  spain to give shelter in our ports to prizes made by the latter on the former while the first part of the article would oblige us to shelter those made by the former on the latter a very dangerous convenant  which ought never to be repeated in any other instance art    consuls should be received at all the ports at which the vessels of either party may be received art  0 concerning free ports in europe  america free ports in the spanish possessions in america  particularly at the havanna san domingo in the island of that name and st john of porto rico are more to be desired than expected it can therefore only be recommended to the best endeavors of the commissioners to obtain them it     will be something to obtain for our vessels flour c admission to those ports during their pleasure in like manner if they could be prevailed on to establish our right of cutting logwood in the bay of campeachy on the footing on which it stood before the treaty of      it would be desireable and not endanger to us any contest with the english who by the revolution treaty are restrained to the south eastern parts of yucatan art    the act of ratification on our part may require a twelvemonth from the date of the treaty as the senate meets regularly but once a year  to return it to madrid for exchange may require four months more it would be better indeed if spain would send her ratification to be exchanged by her representative here the treaty must not exceed    or    years duration except the clauses relating to boundary  the navigation of the missipi which must be perpetual  final indeed these two subjects had better be in a separate instrument there might have been mentioned a third species of arrangement that of making special agreements on every special subject of commerce  of settling a tariff of duty to be paid on each side on every particular article but this would require for our commissioners a very minute knowledge of our commerce as it is impossible to foresee every proposition of this kind which might be brought into discussion  to prepare them for it by information  instruction from hence our commerce too is as yet rather in a course of experiment  the channels     in which it will ultimately flow are not sufficiently known to enable us to provide for it by special agreement nor have the exigencies of our new government as yet so far developed themselves as that we can tell to what degree we may or must have recourse to commerce for the purposes of revenue no common consideration therefore ought to induce us as yet to arrangements of this kind perhaps nothing should do it with any nation short of the privileges of natives in all their possessions foreign  domestic it were to be wished indeed that some positively favorable stipulations respecting our grain flour  fish could be obtained even on our giving reciprocal advantages to some other commodities of spain say her wines and brandies but   if we quit the ground of the most favored nation as to certain articles for our convenience spain may insist on doing the same for other articles for her convenience  thus our commissioners will get themselves on the ground of a treaty of detail for which they will not be prepared   if we grant favor to the wines  brandies of spain then portugal  france will demand the same  in order to create an equivalent portugal may lay a duty on our fish  grain  france a prohibition on our whale oils the removal of which will be proposed as an equivalent thus much however as to grain and flour may be attempted there has not long since been a considerable duty laid on them in spain this was while a treaty on the subject of commerce was     pending between us  spain as that court considers the matter it is not generally thought right to change the state of things pending a treaty concerning them on this consideration  on the motive of cultivating our friendship perhaps the commissioners may induce them to restore this commodity to the footing on which it was on opening the conferences with mr gardoqui on the   th day of july     —if spain says do the same by your tonnage on our vessels the answer may be that our foreign tonnage affects spain very little  other nations very much whereas the duty on flour in spain affects us very much  other nations very little consequently there would be no equality in reciprocal relinquishment as there had been none in the reciprocal innovation  spain by insisting on this would in fact only be aiding the interests of her rival nations to whom we should be forced to extend the same indulgence at the time of opening the conferences too we had as yet not erected any system our government itself being not yet erected innovation then was unavoidable on our part if it be innovation to establish a system we did it on fair  general grounds on ground favorable to spain but they had a system  therefore innovation was avoidable on their part it is known to the commissioners that we found it expedient to ask the interposition of france lately to bring on this settlement of our boundary  the navigation of the missisipi how far that interposition has contributed to produce it is uncertain but we have reason to believe that her further     interference would not produce an agreeable effect on spain the commissioners therefore are to avoid all further communications on the subject with the ministers of france giving to them such explanations as may preserve their good dispositions but if ultimately they shall find themselves unable to bring spain to agreement on the subject of navigation  boundary the interposition of france as a mutual friend  the guarantee of our limits is then to be asked in whatever light spain may chuse to consider it should the negociations on the subject of the navigation  boundary assume at any time an unhopeful aspect it may be proper that spain should be given to understand that if they are discontinued without coming to an agreement the government of the u s cannot be responsible for the longer forbearance of their western inhabitants at the same time the abandonment of the negociation should be so managed as that without engaging us to a further suspension of the exercise of our rights we may not be committed to resume them in the instant the present turbid situation of europe cannot leave us long without a safe occasion of resuming our territory  navigation  of carving for ourselves those conveniences on the shores which may facilitate  protect the latter effectually  permanently we had a right to expect that pending a negociation all things would have remained in statu quo  that spain would not have proceeded to possess herself of other parts of our territory but she has lately taken  fortified a new post at the walnut     hills above the mouth of the yazoo river  far above the   st degree this garrison ought to have been instantly dislodged but for our for wish to be in friendship with spain  our confidence in her assurances to abide by the limits established in our treaty with england complaints of this unfriendly  uncandid procedure may be brought forward or not as the commissioners shall see expedient thomas jefferson mar        george washington report on convention with spain  j mss mar         heads of consideration on the establishment of conventions between the united states and their neighbors for the mutual delivery of fugitives from justice has a nation a right to punish a person who has not offended itself writers on the law of nature agree that it has not that on the contrary exiles and fugitives are     to them as other strangers and have a right of residence unless their presence would be noxious e g infectious persons one writer extends the exception to atrocious criminals too imminently dangerous to society namely to pirates murderers and incendiaries vattel l   §     the punishment of piracy being provided for by our law need not be so by convention murder agreed that this is one of the extreme crimes justifying a denial of habitation arrest and redelivery it should be carefully restrained by definition to homicide of malice prepense and not of the nature of treason incendiaries or those guilty of arson this crime so rare as not to call for extraordinary provision by a convention the only rightful subject then of arrest and delivery of which we have need is murder ought we to wish to strain the natural right of arresting and redelivering fugitives to other cases     the punishment of all real crimes is certainly desirable as a security to society the security is greater in proportion as the chances of avoiding punishment are less but does the fugitive from his country avoid punishment he incurs exile not voluntary but under a moral necessity as strong as physical exile in some countries has been the highest punishment allowed by the laws to most minds it is next to death to many beyond it the fugitive indeed is not of the latter he must estimate it some what less than death it may be said that to some as foreigners it is no punishment arson these cases are few laws are to be made for the mass of cases the object of a convention then in other cases would be that the fugitive might not avoid the difference between exile and the legal punishment of the case now in what cases would this difference be so important as to over weigh even the simple inconvenience of multiplying compacts  st treason this when real merits the highest punishment but most codes extend their definitions of treason to acts not really against ones country they do not distinguish between acts against the government and acts against the oppressions of the government     the latter are virtues yet have furnished more victims to the executioner than the former because real treasons are rare oppressions frequent the unsuccessful struggles against tyranny have been the chief martyrs of treason laws in all countries reformation of government with our neighbors as much wanting now as reformation of religion is or ever was anywhere we should not wish then to give up to the executioner the patriot who fails and flees to us treasons then taking the simulated with the real are sufficiently punished by exile   crimes against property the punishment in most countries immensely disproportionate to the crime in england and probably in canada to steal a hare is death the  st offence to steal above the value of   d death the  d offence all excess of punishment is a crime to remit a fugitive to excessive punishment is to be accessory to the crime ought we to wish for the obligation or the right to do it better on the whole to consider these crimes as sufficiently punished by the exile there is one crime however against property pressed by its consequences into more particular notice to wit forgery whether of coin or paper and whether paper of public or private obligation     but the fugitive for forgery is punished by exile and confiscation of the property he leaves to which add by convention a civil action against the property he carries or acquires to the amount of the special damage done by his forgery the carrying away of the property of another may also be reasonably made to found a civil action a convention then may include forgery and the carrying away the property of others under the head of   flight from debts to remit the fugitive in this case would be to remit him in every case for in the present state of things it is next to impossible not to owe something but i see neither injustice nor inconvenience in permitting the fugitive to be sued in our courts the laws of some countries punishing the unfortunate debtor by perpetual imprisonment he is right to liberate himself by flight and it would be wrong to reimprison him in the country to which he flies let all process therefore be confined to his property murder not amounting to treason being the only case in which the fugitive is to be delivered on what evidence and by whom shall he be delivered in this country let any justice of the supreme court of the united states or their judge of the district where the fugitive is found use the same proceedings as for a murder committed on the high seas until the finding of the true bill by the grand jury but   0 evidence on oath from the country demanding him though in writing and ex parte should have the same effect as if delivered orally at the examination a true bill being found by the grand jury let the officer in whose custody the fugitive is deliver him to the person charged

states and provinces shall be reciprocally open for the demand and recovery of debts due to any person inhabiting the one from any person fled therefrom and found in the other in like manner as they are open to their own citizens likewise for the recovery of the property or the value thereof carried away from any person inhabiting the one by any person fled therefrom     and found in the other

original mesne or final be for the form sake directed against his person if the time between the flight and the commencement of the action exceed not years it shall be counted but as one day under any

is a relief to be withdrawn from the torment of the scenes amidst which we are spectators of the heats and tumults of conflicting parties we cannot help participating of their feelings i     should envy you the tranquil occupations of your situation were it not that i value your happiness more than my own but i too shall have my turn the ensuing year will be the longest of my life and the last of such hateful labors the next we will sow our cabbages together maria is well having changed my day of writing from sunday to thursday or friday she will oftener miss writing as not being with me at the time i believe you knew otchakitz the indian who lived with the marquis de lafayette he came here lately with some deputies from his nation and died here of pleurisy i was at his funeral yesterday he was buried standing up according to their manner i think it will still be a month before your neighbor mrs monroe will leave us she will probably do it with more pleasure than heretofore as i think she begins to tire of the town and feel a relish for scenes of more tranquillity kiss dear anne for her aunt and twice for her grandpapa give my best affections to mr randolph and accept yourself all

 years out of the practice of the law and my mind too constantly occupied in a different line to permit my keeping up my law reading those subjects are now too little familiar to me to venture a law opinion on     the question discussed in the charge you were so kind as to send me i am much pleased with the mention therein made that the people are happy under the general government that it is calculated to produce general happiness when administered in its true republican spirit i am thoroughly persuaded i hope too that your admonitions against encroachments on the indian lands will have a beneficial effect the u s find an indian war too serious a thing to risk incurring one merely to gratify a few intruders with settlements which are to cost the other inhabitants of the u s a thousand times their value in taxes for carrying on the war they produce i am satisfied it will ever be preferred to send an armed force and make war against the intruders as being more just  less expensive a

by me nov    and after being laid before you was answered dec   the part of the answer respecting his leave from you to come to philadelphia was in these words the president does not conceive that the constitution has given him any     controul over the proceedings of the judges and therefore considers that his permission or refusal of absence from your district would be merely rogatory with respect to the escort for the judges on their circuits you will be pleased to determine whether the good of the service will permit them to have one from the military or whether that part of the letter shall be laid before the legislature to make regular provision for an escort that part of the letter respecting jails must as i apprehend be laid before the legislature the complaint against capt armstrong in the letter of jan    coming formally from a judge will require notice a civil prosecution in the courts of the territory appears to me most proper perhaps a formal instruction to the governor as commander in chief to put his officers on their guard against any resistance to civil process might have the effect of preventing future disputes i shall have the honor of waiting on you

blackwell philadelphia apr        sir —mr remsen having now decided definitively to resign his office of chiefclerk i have considered     with all the impartiality in my power the different grounds on which yourself  mr taylor stand in competition for the succession i understand that he was appointed about a month before you and that you came into actual service about a month before him these circumstances place you so equally that i cannot derive from them any ground of preference yet obliged to decide one way or the other i find in a comparison of your conditions a circumstance of considerable equity in his favor he is a married man with a family yourself single there can be no doubt but that  00 dollars place a single man as much at his ease as  00 to a married one on this single circumstance then i have thought myself bound to appoint mr taylor chiefclerk and i beg you to be assured that it is the only motive which has decided in my mind that it has given me more pain to make the decision than to you to learn it having had every reason to be entirely satisfied as well with your conduct as with his since i have been in the office  being with real esteem sir your friend  servt thomas jefferson apr        philadelphia william barton to william barton j mss philadelphia apr        sir —i did not sooner answer your favor of the   th because i have had reason till now to doubt whether mr remsen was decided to resign his office of chiefclerk with me in the mean time too i found there would be real difficulties from the other     clerks the senior of whom thought himself entitled to succeed  the juniors to approach so much nearer to the succession and that if cut off from this prospect i should lose them all this would be to me an irreparable loss because the two seniors have been very long in the office are perfectly intimate with all the papers  proceedings for years back to all of which i am an utter stranger  to which consequently they serve me as an index i had mentioned this difficulty to mr rittenhouse  further that i thought you would not entertain a moments wish for the office if you knew that it offers nothing but one continued scene of drudgery in copying papers  close attendance from morning till night i could not myself conceive you could submit to such an uninteresting  unimproving labour and therefore can only hope now that conceiving myself bound in justice to give it to the present senior clerk some other occasion may occur more worthy of you  towards which i may be of some use to you being with real esteem sir your

and gives him from time to time the most poignant mortification the subjects are such as would require a great deal of time to understand  do justice by them and not having that time to bestow on them

april        philadelphia to the governor of south carolina j mss philadelphia april        sir —your letter of jan   to the president of the u s having been referred to me i have given the subject of it as mature consideration as i am able two neighboring and free governments with laws equally mild  just would find no difficulty in forming a convention for the interchange of fugitive criminals nor would two neighboring despotic governments with laws of equal severity the latter wish that no door should be open to their subjects flying from the oppression of their laws the fact is that most of the governments on the continent of europe have such conventions but england the only free one till lately has never yet consented either to enter into a convention for this purpose or to give up a fugitive the difficulty between a   0 free government and despotic one is indeed great i have the honor to inclose to your excellency a sketch of the considerations which occurred to me on the subject  which i laid before the president he has in consequence instructed me to prepare a project of a convention to be proposed to the court of madrid which i have accordingly done  now inclose a copy of it i wish it may appear to you satisfactory against property we may hope it would be effectual whilst it leaves a door open to life  liberty except in a single unquestionable case messrs carmichael  short will be instructed to make this one of the subjects of their negotiation with the court of spain thomas jefferson hamilton randolph april        opinion on the bill apportioning representation  j mss april        the constitution has declared that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers that the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every  0000 but each state shall have at least one representative and until such enumeration shall be made the state of new hampshire shall be entitled to choose   massachusetts   c the bill for apportioning representatives among     the several states without explaining any principle at all which may show its conformity with the constitution to guide future apportionments says that new hampshire shall have   members massachusetts    c we are therefore to find by experiment what has been the principle of the bill to do which it is proper to state the federal or representable numbers of each state and the numbers allotted to them by the bill they are as follows—   members vermont                  new hampshire                 massachusetts                rhode island                  connecticut                 new york                new jersey                 pennsylvania         0      delaware                  maryland                 virginia      0         kentucky         0        north carolina                south carolina     0           georgia       0           —————— ———            0 it happens that this representation whether tried as between great and small states or as between north and south yields in the present instance a tolerably just result and consequently could not be objected to on that ground if it were obtained by the process prescribed in the constitution but     if obtained by any process out of that it becomes arbitrary and inadmissible the  st member of the clause of the constitution above cited is express that representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers that is to say they shall be apportioned by some common ratio—for proportion and ratio are equivalent words and in the definition of proportion among numbers that they have a ratio common to all or in other words a common divisor now trial will show that there is no common ratio or divisor which applied to the numbers of each state will give to them the number of representatives allotted in this bill for trying the several ratios of     0          the allottments would be as follows—          0                the bill vermont                                     new hampshire                                     massachusetts                               rhode island                                     connecticut                                     new york                        0      new jersey                                     pennsylvania                               delaware                                     maryland                                     virginia              0                kentucky                                     north carolina                        0      south carolina                                     georgia                                      ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ———           0   0   0    0     then the bill reverses the constitutional precept because by it representatives are not apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers it will be said that though for taxes there may always be found a divisor which will apportion them among the states according to numbers exactly without leaving any remainder yet for representatives there can be no such common ratio or divisor which applied to the several numbers will divide them exactly without a remainder or fraction i answer then that taxes must be divided exactly and representatives as nearly as the nearest ratio will admit and the fractions must be neglected because the constitution calls absolutely that there be an apportionment or common ratio and if any fractions result from the operation it has left them unprovided for in fact it could not but foresee that such fractions would result and it meant to submit to them it knew they would be in favor of one part of the union at one time and of another at another so as in the end to balance occasional irregularities but instead of such a single common ratio or uniform divisor as prescribed by the constitution the bill has applied two ratios at least to the different states to wit that of  00   to the seven following rhode island new york pennsylvania maryland virginia kentucky and georgia and that of     0 to the eight others namely vermont new hampshire massachusetts connecticut new jersey delaware north carolina and south carolina     as follows— rhode island         divided by  00   gives   new york        divided by  00   gives    pennsylvania      0 divided by  00   gives    maryland        divided by  00   gives   virginia   0    divided by  00   gives    kentucky      0  divided by  00   gives   georgia    0    divided by  00   gives   vermont         divided by     0 gives   new hampshire        divided by     0 gives   massachusetts        divided by     0 gives    connecticut        divided by     0 gives   new jersey        divided by     0 gives   delaware         divided by     0 gives   north carolina        divided by     0 gives    south carolina  0     divided by     0 gives   and if two ratios be applied then fifteen may and the distribution become arbitrary instead of being apportioned to numbers another member of the clause of the constitution which has been cited says the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every  0000 but each state shall have at least one representative this last phrase proves that it had no contemplation that all fractions or numbers below the common ratio were to be unrepresented and it provides especially that in the case of a state whose whole number shall be below the common ratio one representative shall be given to it this is the single instance where it allows representation to any smaller number than the common ratio and by providing especially for it in this shews it was understood that without special provision the smaller number would in this case be involved     in the general principle the first phrase of the above citations that the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every  0000 is violated by this bill which has given to eight states a number exceeding one for every  0000 to wit one for every     0 in answer to this it is said that this phrase may mean either the  0000 in each state or the  0000 in the whole union and that in the latter case it serves only to find the amount of the whole representation which in the present state of population is   0 members suppose the phrase might bear both meanings which will common sense apply to it which did the universal understanding of our country apply to it which did the senate and representatives apply to it during the pendency of the first bill and even till an advanced stage of this second bill when an ingenious gentleman found out the doctrine of fractions a doctrine so difficult and inobvious as to be rejected at first sight by the very persons who afterwards became its most zealous advocates the phrase stands in the midst of a number of others every one of which relates to states in their separate capacity will not plain common sense then understand it like the rest of its context to relate to states in their separate capacities but if the phrase of one for  0000 is only meant to give the aggregate of representatives and not at all to influence their apportionment among the states then the   0 being once found in order to apportion them we must recur to the former rule     which does it according to the numbers of the respective states and we must take the nearest common divisor as the ratio of distribution that is to say that divisor which applied to every state gives to them such numbers as added together come nearest to   0 this nearest common ratio will be found to be   0   and will distribute     of the   0 members leaving only a single residuary one it will be found too to place       fractional numbers in the eight northernmost states and  0     in the seven southernmost the following table shows it    ratio     0     fraction  vermont                           new hampshire                          massachusetts

leaves but one residuary member and adopting a distant one     which leaves eight is merely to take a member from new york and pennsylvania each and give them to vermont and new hampshire but it will be said this is giving more than one for  0000 true but has it not been just said that the one for  0000 is prescribed only to fix the aggregate number and that we are not to mind it when we come to apportion them among the states that for this we must recur to the former rule which distributes them according to the numbers in each state besides does not the bill itself apportion among seven of the states by the ratio of     0 which is much more than one for  0000 where a phrase is susceptible of two meanings we ought certainly to adopt that which will bring upon us the fewest inconveniences let us weigh those resulting from both constructions from that giving to each state a member for every  0000 in that state results the single inconvenience that there may be large portions unrepresented but it being a mere hazard on which state this will fall hazard will equalize it in the long run from the others result exactly the same inconvenience a thousand cases may be imagined to prove it take one suppose eight of the states had   000 inhabitants each and the other seven       each that is to say each one less than each of the others the aggregate would be        and the number of representatives at one for  0000 of the aggregate would be    then after giving one member to each state distribute the seven residuary members among the seven highest fractions and though the     difference of population be only an unit the representation would be the double    fractions  st     000       000  d     000       000  d     000       000  th     000       000  th     000

            th                    —————— ——              here a single inhabitant the more would count as  0000 nor is the case imaginable only it will resemble the real one whenever the fractions happen to be pretty equal through the whole states the numbers of our census happen by accident to give the fractions all very small or very great so as to produce the strongest case of inequality that could possibly have occurred and which may never occur again the probability is that the fractions will generally descend gradually from       to   the inconvenience then of large unrepresented fractions attends both constructions and while the most obvious construction is liable to no other that of the bill incurs many and grievous ones       if you permit the large fraction in one state to choose a representative for one of the small fractions in another state you take from the latter its election which constitutes real representation and substitute a virtual representation of the disfranchised fractions and the tendency of the doctrine of virtual representation has been too well discussed and appreciated by reasoning and resistance on a former great occasion to need development now   the bill does not say that it has given the residuary representatives to the greatest fraction though in fact it has done so it seems to have avoided establishing that into a rule lest it might not suit on another occasion perhaps it may be found the next time more convenient to distribute them among the smaller states at another time among the larger states at other times according to any other crotchet which ingenuity may invent and the combinations of the day give strength to carry or they may do it arbitrarily by open bargains and cabal in short this construction introduces into congress a scramble or a vendue for the surplus members it generates waste of time hot blood and may at some time when the passions are high extend a disagreement between the two houses to the perpetual loss of the thing as happens now in the pennsylvania assembly whereas the other construction reduces the apportionment always to an arithmetical operation about which no two men can ever possibly differ   it leaves in full force the violation of the precept which declares that representatives shall be   0 apportioned among the states according to their numbers i e by some common ratio viewing this bill either as a violation of the constitution or as giving an inconvenient exposition of its words is it a case wherein the president ought to interpose his negative i think it is   the nonuser of his negative begins already to excite a belief that no president will ever venture to use it and has consequently begotten a desire to raise up barriers in the state legislatures against congress throwing off the control of the constitution   it can never be used more pleasingly to the public than in the protection of the constitution   no invasions of the constitution are fundamentally so dangerous as the tricks played on their own numbers apportionment and other circumstances respecting themselves and affecting their legal qualifications to legislate for the union   the majorities by which this bill has been passed to wit of one in the senate and two in the representatives show how divided the opinions were there   the whole of both houses admit the constitution will bear the other exposition whereas the minorities in both deny it will bear that of the bill   the application of any one ratio is intelligible to the people and will therefore be approved whereas the complex operations of this bill may never be comprehended by them and though they may acquiesce they cannot approve what they do not understand     thomas jefferson april        draft of presidents message vetoing apportionment bill j mss april        gentlemen of the h of representatives —i have maturely considered the bill passed by the two houses for and i return it to your house wherein it originated with the following objections   the constitution has prescribed that representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective members and there is no one proportion or division which applied to the respective numbers of the states will yield the number and allotment of representatives proposed by the bill   the constitution has also provided that the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand which restriction is by the contract  by fair and obvious construction to be applied to the separate  respective numbers of the states and the bill has allotted to eight of the states more than one for thirty thousand thomas jefferson apr        philadelphia david humphreys to the u s minister to

be none that you had not thought of making any yourself for that tho you did not like the appointment yet you knew the difficulty of finding one which would be without objections i take for granted this weighed with the president because he had said he would not appoint one in whom he could foresee any material opposition the only persons in the nomination who were then mentioned were wayne

forbidding the admission of foreign vessels into any ports of the british dominions with goods or commodities of the growth production or manufacture of america the effect of this appears to me so extensive as to induce a doubt whether i understand rightly the determination to inforce it which you justify and to oblige me to ask of you whether we are to consider it as so far a revocation of the proclamation of your government regulating the commerce between the two countries and that hence forth no articles of the growth production or manufacture of the united states are to be received in

the ways  means of raising money to pay this army a further assumption of state debts has been proposed by the secretary of the treasury which has been rejected by a small majority but the chickens of the treasury have so many contrivances  are so indefatigable within doors  without that we all fear they will get it in some way or other as the doctrine is that a public debt is a public blessing so they think a perpetual one is a perpetual blessing  therefore wish to make it so large that we can never pay it off i must ask the favor of you to send the bonds taken at my sale to mr eppes who will deliver them to hanson and take a proper receipt so as to clear me of the paiments of july next  july twelve month i imagine mr randolph may be going to richmond soon in which case he can take charge

a communication from mr hammond minister plenipotentiary of his britannic majesty covering a clause of a statute of that country relative to its commerce with this and notifying a determination to carry it into execution henceforward conceiving that the determination announced could not be really meant as extensively as the words import i asked and received an explanation from the minister as expressed in the letter  answer herein inclosed and on consideration of all circumstances i cannot but confide in the opinion expressed by him that its sole object is to exclude foreign vessels from the islands of jersey  guernsey the want of proportion between the motives expressed  the measure its magnitude  consequences total silence as to the proclamation on which the intercourse between the two countries has hitherto hung  of which in this broad sense it would be a revocation  the recent manifestations of the disposition of that government to concur with this in mutual offices of     friendship  good will support his construction the minister moreover assured me verbally that he would immediately write to his court for an explanation  in the meantime is of opinion that the usual intercourse of commerce between the two countries jersey  guernsey excepted need not be suspended thomas jefferson april         philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes j mss philadelphia april         dear sir —i duly received your favor of the   th with the pamphlet it inclosed for which be pleased to accept my thanks on accepting the office i am in i knew i was to set myself up as a butt of reproach not only for my own errors but for the errors of those who would undertake to judge me—it was the objection which longest delayed my acquiescence in the presidents appointment i have therefore to console myself that obloquy has begun upon me so late as to spare me a longer interval of satisfaction than expected  that however ardently my retirement to my own home  my own affairs may be wished for by others as the author sais there is no one of them who feels the wish once where i do a thousand times the pamphlet was written  printed here its author has given so many points where by to try him that he cannot be mistaken by one who will attend to all his opinions  who knows the characters here i learn with real concern the calamities which are fallen on new york  which must fall on this place also no man of reflection who had ever attended     to the south sea bubble in england or that of law in france and who applied the lessons of the past to the present time could fail to foresee the issue tho he might not calculate the moment at which it would happen the evidences of the public debt are solid  sacred i presume there is not a man in the u s who would not part with his last shilling to pay them but all that stuff called scrip of whatever description was folly or roguery and under a resemblance to genuine public paper it buoyed itself up to a par with that—it has given a severe lesson yet such is the public gullability in the hands of cunning  unprincipled men that it is doomed by nature to receive these lessons once in an age at least happy if they now come about  get back into the tract of plain unsophisticated common sense which they ought never to have been decoyed from it was reported here last night that there had been a collection of people round the place of duers confinement of so threatening an appearance as to call out the governor  militia  to be fired on by them and that several of them were killed i hope it is not true

clarksons conduct gives me great pleasure my first wish is that the labourers may be well treated the second that they may enable me to have that treatment continued by making as much as will admit it the man who can effect both objects is rarely to be found i wish you would take occasion to express to him the satisfaction i receive from this communication if it would not be too much trouble for you to inform me how much wheat rye  corn constitutes the growing crop in albemarle i shall be obliged to you i am glad to hear that clark was about getting his tobacco down at length our paper bubble is burst the failure of duer in new york soon brought on others  these still more like nine pins knocking one another down till at that place the bankruptcy is become general every man concerned in paper being broke and most of the tradesmen  farmers who had been laying down money having been tempted by these speculators to lend it to them at an interest of from   to   pr cent a month have lost the whole it is computed there is a dead loss at new york of about   millions of dollars which is reckoned the value of all the buildings of the city so that if the whole town had been burnt to the ground it would have been just the measure of the present calamity supposing goods to have been saved in boston     the dead loss is about a million of dollars the crisis here was the day before yesterday which was a great day for payments the effect will not be public in two or three days more it is conjectured that their loss will be about equal to that of boston in the mean time buildings  other improvements are suspended workmen turned adrift country produce not to be sold at any price because even substantial merchants who never medelled with paper cannot tell how many of their debtors have medelled  may fail consequently they are afraid to make any new money arrangements till they shall know how they stand as much of the demand from virginia  especially for wheat  indeed tobacco is from this place i imagine the stagnation of purchases  trouble of prices will reach you immediately notwithstanding the magnitude of this calamity every newspaper almost is silent on it freneaus excepted in whom you will see it mentioned give my love to my dear martha  accept assurances of sincere esteem from dear sir yours affectionately thomas jefferson apr         philadelphia william short to william short j mss philadelphia apr         dear sir —in my private letter of mar    i gave you notice that i should lodge subsequent ones perhaps at bordeaux after which i know no prospect of writing to you again till you leave spain with any hope of your getting the letter i mentioned to you the failure of some of the primary speculators in new york the crash has been     tremendous  far beyond our expectation at that time the dead loss at new york has been equal to the value of all the buildings of the city say between      millions of dollars boston has lost about a million this place something less paper of the debt of the u s is scarcely at par bank stock is at    per cent—it was once upwards of  00 per cent—what a loss you would have suffered if we had laid out your paper for bankstock the losses on this occasion would support a war such as we now have on hand five or six years thus you will see that the calamity has been greater in proportion than that of the south sea in england or law in france tho it would have been improper for me to have given at any time an opinion on the subject of stocks to mr brown or any man dealing in them yet i have been unable to refrain from interposing for you on the present occasion i found that your stock stood so as not to charge donald and co i know brown to be a good man but to have dealt in paper i did not know how far he was engaged i knew that good men might sometimes avail themselves of the property of others in their power to help themselves out of a present difficulty in an honest but delusive confidence that they will be able to repay that the best men  those whose transactions stand all in an advantageous form may fail by the failure of others under the impulse therefore of the general panic i ventured to enter a caveat in the treasury office against permitting the transfer of any stock standing in your name or in any other for your use this was on the   th of     april i knew your stock had not been transferred before mar    and that from that time to this mr brown had not been in virginia so as to give me a reasonable confidence that it had not been transferred between the  st    th inst if so it is safe but it would be still safer invested in ned carters lands at   dollars the acre at which price i believe they could be bought if you think so  will send some authority i am

0 dozen bottles of m dorsais best still champagne for the president having no acknolgement of these letters i begin to fear they have miscarried if they have come to hand since dec  0 i hope you will have executed the commissions before your departure for spain we expect mr pinkney here everyday on his way to england where he will probably be by the beginning of july congress will rise in about ten days adieu my dear sir p s—not knowing how long you may remain in spain nor when i can get another letter to you i am to desire that your public letters of the ensuing fall  winter may not be

philadelphia apr         dear sir —my last letter to you was of the  0th of march the preceding one of jan    had conveyed to you your appointment as minister plenipotentiary to the court of france the present will i hope find you there i now inclose you the correspondence between the secretary of the treasury  minister of france on the subject of the monies furnished to the distresses of their colonies you will perceive that the minister chose to leave the adjustment of the terms to be settled at paris between yourself and the kings ministers this you will therefore be pleased to do on this principle that we wish to avoid any loss by the mode of payment but would not chuse to make a gain which should throw loss on them but the letters of the secretary of the treasury will sufficiently explain the desire of the government  be a sufficient guide to you—i now inclose you the act passed by congress for facilitating the execution of the consular convention with france in a bill which has passed the h of representatives for raising monies for the support of the indian war while the duties on every other species of wine are raised from one to three fourths more than they were the best wines of france will pay little more than the worst of any other country to wit between      cents a bottle and where this exceeds  0 per cent on their cost they will pay but the  0 per cent i consider this     latter provision as likely to introduce in abundance the cheaper wines of france and the more so as the tax on ardent spirits is considerably raised i hope that these manifestations of friendly dispositions towards that country will induce them to repeal the very obnoxious laws respecting our commerce which were passed by the preceding national assembly the present session of congress will pass over without any other notice of them than the friendly preferences before mentioned but if these should not produce a retaliation of good on their part a retaliation of evil must follow on ours it will be impossible to defer longer than the next session of congress some counterregulations for the protection of our navigation  commerce i must entreat you therefore to avail yourself of every occasion of friendly remonstrance on this subject if they wish an equal  cordial treaty with us we are ready to enter into it we would wish that this could be the scene of negotiation from considerations suggested by the nature of our government which will readily occur to you congress will rise on this day sennight—i inclose you a letter from mrs greene who asks your aid in getting her son forwarded by the diligence to london on his way to america the letter will explain to you the mode  the means and the parentage and genius of the young gentleman will ensure your aid to him as this goes by the french packet i send no newspapers laws or other articles of that kind the postage of which would be high     thomas jefferson may         philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states j mss philadelphia may         dear sir —the day after your departure i received from a mr green a merchant now at n york through a third person the following communication that he had had very late advices from spain by way of the spanish islands to this effect that war with france was inevitable that troops were marching from all quarters of the kingdom to the frontiers  that  0 sail of the line had been commissioned this was permitted to be mentioned to me but for particular reasons to no other person i suppose the particular reasons were some mercantile speculation founded on the intelligence perhaps it may be to buy up all our flour we have london news from the  st of april and nothing of this is mentioned i have a letter from colo humphreys of march    which says nothing of it i am in hopes therefore the only effect will be to get us a good price for our flour or fish this being our look out while the success of the speculation is that of the adventurer—you will recollect that we had learned the death of the emperor of morocco after a battle in which he was victorious the brother opposed to him it seems was killed in the same action and the one muley islema who had been so long in the sanctuary is proclaimed emperor he was the best character of the three and is likely to be peaceable this information is from colo humphreys the queen of portugal is still in the same state wyllys does not pronounce her curable tho he says there is nothing which indicates the contrary he     has removed from her all her former physicians mr madison has favored me with some corrections for my letter to mr h  it is now in the hands of the attorney general and shall then be submitted to colo hamilton i find that these examinations will retard the delivery of it considerably however delay is preferable to error mr pinckney is engaged in going over such papers of my office as may put him in possession of whatever has passed between us  the court he is going to i have  00 olive trees and some caper plants arrived here from marseilles which i am sending on to charleston where mr pinckney tells me they have already that number living of those i had before sent them i have the honor to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect  attachment dear sir your most obedt  most humble servt thomas jefferson may         philadelphia george washington to the president of the united states j mss philadelphia may         dear sir —i have determined to make the subject of a letter what for some time past has been a subject of inquietude to my mind without having found a good occasion of disburthening itself to you in conversation during the busy scenes which occupied you here perhaps too you may be able in your present situation or on the road to give it more time  reflection than you could do here at any moment when you first mentioned to me your purpose     of retiring from the government tho i felt all the magnitude of the event i was in a considerable degree silent i knew that to such a mind as yours persuasion was idle  impertinent that before forming your decision you had weighed all the reasons for  against the measure had made up your mind on full view of them  that there could be little hope of changing the result pursuing my reflections too i knew we were some day to try to walk alone and if the essay should be made while you should be alive  looking on we should derive confidence from that circumstance  resource if it failed the public mind too was calm  confident and therefore in a favorable state for making the experiment had no change of circumstances intervened i should not with any hope of success have now ventured to propose to you a change of purpose but the public mind is no longer confident and serene and that from causes in which you are in no ways personally mixed tho these causes have been hackneyed in the public papers in detail it may not be amiss in order to calculate the effect they are capable of producing to take a view of them in the mass giving to each the form real or imaginary under which they have been presented  it has been urged then that a public debt greater than we can possibly pay before other causes of adding new debt to it will occur has been artificially created by adding together the whole amount of     the debtor  creditor sides of accounts instead of taking only their balances which could have been paid off in a short time that this accumulation of debt has taken for ever out of our power those easy sources of revenue which applied to the ordinary necessities and exigencies of government would have answered them habitually and covered us from habitual murmurings against taxes  taxgatherers reserving extraordinary calls for those extraordinary occasions which would animate the people to meet them that though the calls for money have been no greater than we must generally expect for the same or equivalent exigencies yet we are already obliged to strain the impost till it produces clamour and will produce evasion  war on our own citizens to collect it and even to resort to an excise law of odious character with the people partial in its operation unproductive unless enforced by arbitrary  vexatious means and committing the authority of the government in parts where resistance is most probable  coercion least practicable they cite propositions in congress and suspect other projects on foot still to increase the mass of debt they say that by borrowing at ⅔ of the interest we might have paid off the principal in ⅔ of the time but that from this we are precluded by its being made irredeemable but in small portions  long terms that this irredeemable quality was given it for the avowed purpose of inviting its transfer to foreign countries they predict that this transfer of the principal when compleated will occasion an exportation of   millions   0 of dollars annually for the interest a drain of coin of which as there has been no example no calculation can be made of its consequences that the banishment of our coin will be compleated by the creation of  0 millions of paper money in the form of bank bills now issuing into circulation they think the  0 or    percent annual profit paid to the lenders of this paper medium taken out of the pockets of the people who would have had without interest the coin it is banishing that all the capital employed in paper speculation is barren  useless producing like that on a gaming table no accession to itself and is withdrawn from commerce  agriculture where it would have produced addition to the common mass that it nourishes in our citizens habits of vice and idleness instead of industry  morality that it has furnished effectual means of corrupting such a portion of the legislature as turns the balance between the honest voters which ever way it is directed that this corrupt squadron deciding the voice of the legislature have manifested their dispositions to get rid of the limitations imposed by the constitution on the general legislature limitations on the faith of which the states acceded to that instrument that the ultimate object of all this is to prepare the way for a change from the present republican form of government to that of a monarchy of which the english constitution is to be the model that this was contemplated in the convention is no secret because its partisans have made none of it to effect it then was impracticable but they are still eager after their     object and are predisposing every thing for its ultimate attainment so many of them have got into the legislature that aided by the corrupt squadron of paper dealers who are at their devotion they make a majority in both houses the republican party who wish to preserve the government in its present form are fewer in number they are fewer even when joined by the two three or half dozen antifederalists who tho they dare not avow it are still opposed to any general government but being less so to a republican than a monarchical one they naturally join those whom they think pursuing the lesser evil of all the mischiefs objected to the system of measures before mentioned none is so afflicting and fatal to every honest hope as the corruption of the legislature as it was the earliest of these measures it became the instrument for producing the rest  will be the instrument for producing in future a king lords  commons or whatever else those who direct it may chuse withdrawn such a distance from the eye of their constituents and these so dispersed as to be inaccessible to public information  particularly to that of the conduct of their own representatives they will form the most corrupt government on earth if the means of their corruption be not prevented the only hope of safety hangs now on the numerous representation which is to come forward the ensuing year some of the new members will probably be either in principle or interest with the present majority but it is expected that the great mass will form an     accession to the republican party they will not be able to undo all which the two preceding legislatures  especially the first have done public faith  right will oppose this but some parts of the system may be rightfully reformed a liberation from the rest unremittingly pursued as fast as right will permit  the door shut in future against similar commitments of the nation should the next legislature take this course it will draw upon them the whole monarchical  paper interest but the latter i think will not go all lengths with the former because creditors will never of their own accord fly off entirely from their debtors therefore this is the alternative least likely to produce convulsion but should the majority of the new members be still in the same principles with the present  shew that we have nothing to expect but a continuance of the same practices it is not easy to conjecture what would be the result nor what means would be resorted to for correction of the evil true wisdom would direct that they should be temperate  peaceable but the division of sentiment  interest happens unfortunately to be so geographical that no mortal can say that what is most wise  temperate would prevail against what is most easy  obvious i can scarcely contemplate a more incalculable evil than the breaking of the union into two or more parts yet when we review the mass which opposed the original coalescence when we consider that it lay chiefly in the southern quarter that the legislature have availed themselves of no occasion of allaying it but on the contrary whenever northern      southern prejudices have come into conflict the latter have been sacrificed  the former soothed that the owners of the debt are in the southern  the holders of it in the northern division that the antifederal champions are now strengthened in argument by the fulfilment of their predictions that this has been brought about by the monarchical federalists themselves who having been for the new government merely as a stepping stone to monarchy have themselves adopted the very constructions of the constitution of which when advocating its acceptance before the tribunal of the people they declared it insusceptible that the republican federalists who espoused the same government for its intrinsic merits are disarmed of their weapons that which they denied as prophecy being now become true history who can be sure that these things may not proselyte the small number which was wanting to place the majority on the other side and this is the event at which i tremble  to prevent which i consider your continuance at the head of affairs as of the last importance the confidence of the whole union is centred in you your being at the helm will be more than an answer to every argument which can be used to alarm  lead the people in any quarter into violence or secession north  south will hang together if they have you to hang on and if the first correction of a numerous representation should fail in its effect your presence will give time for trying others not inconsistent with the union  peace of the states i am perfectly aware of the oppression under     which your present office lays your mind  of the ardor with which you pant for retirement to domestic life but there is sometimes an eminence of character on which society have such peculiar claims as to controul the predelection of the individual for a particular walk of happiness  restrain him to that alone arising from the present  future benedictions of mankind this seems to be your condition  the law imposed on you by providence in forming your character  fashioning the events on which it was to operate and it is to motives like these  not to personal anxieties of mine or others who have no right to call on you for sacrifices that i appeal from your former determination  urge a revisal of it on the ground of change in the aspect of things should an honest majority result from the new  enlarged representation should those acquiesce whose principles or interest they may controul your wishes for retirement would be gratified with less danger as soon as that shall be manifest without awaiting the completion of the second period of four years one or two sessions will determine the crisis and i cannot but hope that you can resolve to add one or two more to the many years you have already sacrificed to the good of mankind the fear of suspicion that any selfish motive of continuance in office may enter into this sollicitation on my part obliges me to declare that no such motive exists it is a thing of mere indifference to the public whether i retain or relinquish my purpose of closing my tour with the first periodical renovation of the government i know my own measure     too well to suppose that my services contribute any thing to the public confidence or the public utility multitudes can fill the office in which you have been pleased to place me as much to their advantage  satisfaction i therefore have no motive to consult but my own inclination which is bent irresistibly on the tranquil enjoyment of my family my farm  my books i should repose among them it is true in far greater security if i were to know that you remained at the watch and i hope it will be so to the inducements urged from a view of our domestic affairs i will add a bare mention of what indeed need only be mentioned that weighty motives for your continuance are to be found in our foreign affairs i think it probable that both the spanish  english negotiations if not completed before your purpose is known will be suspended from the moment it is known  that the latter nation will then use double diligence in fomenting the indian war—with my wishes for the future i shall at the same time express my gratitude for the past at least my portion in it  beg

inattention to the difference between generations succeeding each other at fixed epochs and generations renewed daily and hourly it is true that in the former case the generation when at    years of age may contract a debt for    years because a majority of them will live so long but a generation consisting of all ages  which legislates by all its members above the age of    years cannot contract for so long a time because their majority will be dead much sooner buffon gives us a table of       deaths stating the ages at which they happened to draw from these the result i have occasion for i

note th jefferson had a conference yesterday with mr madison on the subject recommended by the president he has the honor of inclosing him some considerations thereon in all of which he believes mr madison concurred he has sketched the heads only as the presidents mind will readily furnish the development of each he will wait on the president at one oclock on some other business and then and at all other times be ready to enter more into the details of any part of the subject the president may chuse july       0 the complete series of documents relating to this episode are given in mr worthington c fords the united states and spain in    0 brooklyn    0   among the jefferson mss is a single sheet containing what is evidently the first or rough draft of this paper as it varies in several respects it is included here for purposes of comparison heads of consideration on the conduct we are to observe in the war between spain and gr britain and particularly should the latter attempt the conquest of louisiana and the floridas the danger to us shd g b possess herself of louisiana and the floridas beyond the missi a territory equal to half ours she would reduce our cismissi possessions because n orleans will draw to it the dependence of all those waters by her language laws religion manners govnt commerce capitals by the markets she can offer them in the gulph of mexico she would then have a territory the double of ours she would take away the markets of the atlantic states by furnishing the same articles cheaper tobo rice indigo bread lumber fur she would encircle us completely her possessions forming a line on our land boards her fleets on our sea board instead of two neighbors balancing each other we should have one with ye strength of both would the prevention of this be worth a war consider our abilities to make a war our operations would be by land only how many men would it need to employ—their cost our resources by taxation and credit equal to this weigh the evil of this new accumulation of debt against the loss of market and eternal danger and expence of such a neighbor but no need to take a part as yet we may choose our own time for that delay gives us many chances to avoid it altogether they may not single out that object they may fail in it france and spain may recover it the difference between prevention and retaking overbaled by benefits of delay enables us to be better prepared to stipulate with spain and france advantages for our assistance suppose these our ultimate views what is to be done at this time   as to spain if she be as sensible as we are that she cannot save louisiana and the floridas might she not prefer their independce to their subjectn to gr br can we not take advantage of ct destaings proposn to communicate thro the court of france our ideas on this subject and our readiness to join them in guarantee this might save us from a war if gr br respects our weight in a war if she does not it would place the war on popular ground   as to england say to b that as to a treaty of commerce we hd never desired it but on terms of perfect reciprocity that therefore we never thought to give any price for it but itself that we had wished for it to avoid giving mutual bonds to the commerce of both nations but that we have the measures in our own power which may save us from loss that as to the alliance they propose it would involve us against france and spain and considered even in a moral view no price could repay such an abandonmt of character that we are truly disposed to remain strictly neutral tho we must confess yt we shd view in a very serious light attempts to extend themselves along our frontier and destroy all balance in our neighborhood the latter sentiment it might be advantageous to express because if there be any difference of opn in her councils whether to bend their force agt north or south america and certainly there is room for difference and if these operations be nearly balanced the possibility of drawing an enemy the more on themselves might determine the balance   at a later period upon reviewing this opinion the following note was appended by jefferson unless with the consent or default of the other contracting party it may well be doubted too and perhaps denied that the treaty power can control a law the question here proposed was then of the first impression subsequent investigations have proved that the contrary position is the more general truth   see infra page       in the jefferson mss is a first draft of this which varies enough from the above to make comparison interesting it is as follows thomas jefferson   august    0 mr carmichael heads of consideration on the navigation of the mississippi for mr carmichael   august    0 we have a right to the navign of the missi   by nature   by treaty it is necessary to us more than half the territory of the u s is on the waters of that river  00000 of their citizens are seated on them these have no other outlet for their tobo rice corn hemp lumber housetimber shiptimber etc we have hitherto borne the indecision of spain because we wish peace because our western citizens have had vent at home for their productions a surplus of production begins now to demand foreign markets whenever they shall say we cannot we will not be longer shut up the u s will soon be reduced to the following dilemma     to force them to acquiescence      to separate from them rather than take part in a war against spain      or to preserve them in our union by joining them in the war  the  st is neither in our principles nor our power   a multitude of reasons decide against the  d one only shall be spoken out the nation that gives up half its territory rather than engage in a just war to preserve it will not keep the other half long   the third is the only alternative we must necessarily adopt how are we to obtain that navigation a by force i acting separately that we can effect this with certainty and promptitude all circumstances decide obj we cannot retain n orleans for instance were we to take it ans a moderate force may be so secured so as to hold out till succoured our succours can be prompt and effectual suppose after taking it we withdraw our force if spain retakes it by an expedition we can recover it by a counterexpedn and so as often as the case shall happen their expeditions will be slow expensive and lead to catastrophe ours sudden economical and a check can have no consequences we should associate the country to our union the inhabitants wish this they are not disposed to be of the spanish government it is idle in spain to suppose our western habitants will submit to their govmt they could be quiet but a short time under a govmt so repugnant to their feelings were they to come under it for present purposes it wd be with a view to throw it off soon should they remain they would communicate a spirit of independence to those with whom they should be mixed ii acting in conjunction with gr br with a view to partition the floridas includg n orleans would be assigned to us louisiana or all the country on the westn waters of ye missi to them we confess that such an alliance is not what we would wish because it may eventually lead us into embarrassing situations as to our best friend and put the power of two nbors into ye hands of one ld lansdowne has declared he gave the floridas to spain rather than to the u s as a bone of discord with the h of bourbon and of reunion with gr br connollys attempt as well as other facts proves they keep it in view b by negociation i what must spain do of necessity the conduct of spain has proved the occlusion of the missi is system with her if she opens it now it will be because forced by imperious circumstances she will consequently shut it again when these circumstances cease treaty will be no obstacle irregularities real and pretended in our navigators will furnish colour enough perpetual broils and finally war will ensue prudence and even necessity imposes on us the law of settling the matter now finally and not by halves with experience of the past and prospect of the future it wd be imbecility in us to accept ye naked navigation with that we must have what will secure its continuance that is a port near the mouth to receive our vessels and protect the navigation but even this will not secure the floridas and louisiana against gr brit if we are neutral she will wrest those possessions from spain the inhabitants french english scotch americans would prefer engld to spain ii what then had spain better do of choice cede to us all territory on our side the mississippi on condition that we guarantee all her possns on the western waters of that river she agreeing further to subsidize us if the guarantee brings us into war should gr br possess herself of the floridas and louisiana her governing principles are conquest colonization commerce monopoly she will establish powerful colonies in them these can be poured into the gulph of mexico for any sudden enterprise there or invade mexico their next neighbor by land whilst a fleet cooperates along shore and cuts off relief and proceed successively from colony to colony with respect to us if gr br establishes herself on our whole land board our lot will be bloody and eternal war or indissoluble confederacy which ought we to choose what will be the lot of the span colonies in the jaws of such a confederacy what will secure the ocean against monopoly safer for spain that we should be her neighbor than england conquest not in our principles inconsistent with our govmt not our interest to cross the mississippi for ages and will never be our interest to remain united with those who do intermediate chances save the trouble of calculating so far forward consequences of this cession and guarantee     every subject of difference will be removed from between spain and the u s      our interest wll be strongly engaged in her retaining her american possessions      spain will be quieted as to louisiana and her territories west of that      she may employ her whole force in defence of her islands and southern possessions      if we preserve our neutrality it will be a very partial one to her      if we are forced into the war it will be as we wish on the side of the h of bourbon      our privateers will commit formidable depredn on ye brit trade and occupy much of their force      by witholdg supplies of provision as well as by concurring in expedns ye brit islds will be in imminent danger      their expences of precaution both for their continental and insular possns will be so augmented as to give a hope of running their credit down  in fine for a narrow strip of barren detached and expensive country spain secures the rest of her territory and makes an ally where she might have a dangerous enemy   washington had written jefferson washington august       0 thomas jefferson united states august       0 provided the dispute between great britain and spain should come to the decision of arms from a variety of circumstances individually unimportant and inconclusive but very much the reverse when compared and combined there is no doubt in my mind that new orleans and the spanish posts above it on the mississippi will be among the first attempts of the former and that the reduction of them will be undertaken by a combined operation from detroit the consequences of having so formidable and enterprizing a people as the british on both our flanks and rear with their navy in front as they respect our western settlements which may be seduced thereby as they regard the security of the union and its commerce with the west indies are too obvious to need enumeration what then should be the answer of the executive of the united states to lord dorchester in case he should apply for permission to march troops through the territory of the said states from detroit to the mississippi what notice ought to be taken of the measure if it should be undertaken without leave which is the most probable proceeding of the two the opinion of the secretary of state is requested in writing upon the above statements   probably a reference to a new constitution for virginia   patrick henry   in websters essays boston    0 a section had been devoted to

this paper i will thank you to return by the bearer when you shall have perused it as it is yet to be translated  communicated to the president it is evident that this matter will become serious  tho i am pointedly against admitting the french construction of the treaty yet i think it essential to work up some favour which may ensure the continuance of the good dispositions they have towards us a nation which takes one third of our tobacco more than half our fish oil  two thirds of our fish say one half of the amount of these great staples and a great deal of rice  from whom we take nothing in return but hard money to carry directly over and pour into the coffers of their enemies such a customer i say deserves some menagemens i would thank you sincerely to suggest any thing better than i had thought of i am dear sir yours affectionately  respectfully see two very interesting letters of hamilton on this report in hamiltons works federal edition iv         the editor mr lodge adds two footnotes to them stating this refers undoubtedly to our treaty with france what the precise exemption was which was sought is not clear although indicated in this and the next letter there is no evidence that this intended report was ever made at least it is not found in jeffersons works nor in those of washington although the precise point involved is lost the general purport of this and the preceding letter is clear jefferson was considering whether to recommend some treaty construction favorable to france hamilton civilly disagreed on being consulted and the matter appears to have been dropped jefferson also consulted madison concerning this writing him thomas jefferson jan      madison jan      i intended to have called last night  left with you the enclosed draught of a lre to otto but it was so cold i could not give up my hack i received yours soon after i came home of the two constructions i observe you lean more to the  d and i more to the  st on account of the consequences to which the  d may be pursued—my first idea was to write this lre to otto and previously communicate it to the president  he perhaps to the senate but i have concluded to throw it into the form of a report to the president to be submitted to the senate this will permit me to speak without reserve to admit the force of  d construction  to enforce the proposition i suggest in the close by showing what valuable branches of our commerce hang on the will of the french nation i shall see you at dinner  be glad to exchange further thought on the subject which is an important one

for an equitable allowance for the circumstance of depreciation  both the draft and hamiltons reply are misdated august      in hamiltons writings   a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the united states is particularly urged by the important considerations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt that if timely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity

sketch of such a message as he thinks might accompany the statement from the secretary at war that an estimate of the next years operations should accompany it but he thinks it a proper occasion to bring forward the preparations for the next year and that it forms the safest ground for making the present communication   from senate executive journal i      see pages     and     for a correction

was probably prepared in consequence of the senate resolution of dec  0      resolved that the senate do not possess evidence sufficient to convince them that it will be for the interest of the united states to appoint ministers plenipotentiary to reside permanently at foreign courts the contest led to an interview between a senate committee and jefferson see i     after which the senate rescinded

his respects to the president of the u s and subjoins what he supposes might form a proper introduction to the statement prepared by the secretary at war the occasion is so new that however short the letter proposed he has no doubt it will need correction both as to the matter  manner washington submitted the draft to hamilton who commented as follows mr hamilton presents his respects to the president  submits the following alterations in the letter— instead of i shall be glad to say it is my desire or it appears advisable that you prepare c instead of when our constituents c say when the community are called upon for considerable exertions to relieve a part which is suffering under the hand of an enemy it is desirable to manifest that due pains have been taken by those entrusted with the administration of their affairs to avoid the evil it is a doubt whether our constituents be a proper phrase to be used by the president in addressing a subordinate officer a written copy of the paper d s mss has all these changes embodied written in pencil in washingtons handwriting   see ante pp           this refers to washingtons private letter to morris of jan         printed in fords writings of washington xii      italic in cipher translation   the above is verbatim as nearly as i can recollect the diction of a note i wrote to the president this morning  i forgot to take a copy of it before it went out of my hands but i think there will be found scarcely a word of difference except perhaps in the quotation the substance of which alone can be answered for t j   this is the copy submitted to the president the perfected paper being printed under march         jefferson submitted a rough draft of this to hamilton for suggestion previously to sending it to the president some time before march   and hamilton made the following notes upon it on which jefferson commented as indicated   notes by a hamilton on t js report of instructions for the commissioners to treat at madrid the general tenor of the report appears solid  proper the following observations however on hasty perusal occur    answers by th j    page  d is it to put our resolution on the true or the best footing to say that the circumstances which obliged us to discontinue our foreign magistrate brought upon us the war did not the war previously exist  bring on the discontinuance was it not rather the cause than the effect    the report is amended in conformity with this observation    is it accurate to say that france aided us in capturing the whole army of the enemy does this not imply that there was no other enemy army in the country though there were in fact two others one in new york another in s carolina this last is a mere criticism as to the occurrences of expression the sense is clear enough    the capture of the army struck out    page    are naval victories the essential mean of conquest of a water as seems to be implied is not the conquest of a water an incident to that territory if this idea is not sound that combined with it is namely that in no event could spain be considered as having conquered the river against the u s with whom she not only had no war but was an associate    no conquest of the territory was made to it of the islands of n orleans on the one side or louisiana on the other as both had belonged to spain before the war therefore no change in the right to the water as incident to the territory this circumstance however is inserted in the report to make the reasoning the clearer    page    may it not be inferred from what is said here that though the u s would not wish to insert or express stipulation against other nations yet they may be prevailed on to do it would such a stipulation be consistent with the right which gr britain reserved to herself in the treaty with us if the inference alluded to is intended to be excluded will it not be advisable to vary the term of expression so as to render the intention more unequivocal    the word chuse substituted for wish however england could hold that right of commerce in the water only as incident to florida which she then held when she conveyed florida to spain the incident passed by the same conveyance and she can never have a claim against us or a stipulation the benefit of which she had conveyed to another    page    are there conclusive reasons to make it a sine qua non that no phrase shall be admitted which shall express or imply a grant could the negociation with propriety be broken off on such a point is it not rather one to be endeavored to be avoided than the avoiding of it to be made a sine qua non    report altered in conformity to this    page    is it true that the u s have no right to alienate an inch of the territory in question except in the case of necessity intimated in another place or will it be useful to avow the denial of such a right it is apprehended that the doctrine which restricts the alienation of territory to cases of extreme necessity is applicable rather to peopled territory than to waste  uninhabited districts positions restraining the right of the u states to accomodate to exigencies which may arise ought ever to be advanced with great caution    the power to alienate the unpeopled territories of any state is not among the enumerated powers given by the constitution to the general government  if we may go out of that instrument  acomodate to exigencies which may arise by alienating the unpeopled territory of a state we may accomodate ourselves a little more by alienating that which is peopled  still a little more by selling the people themselves a shade or two more in the degree of exigency is all that will be requisite and of that degree we shall ourselves be the judges—however may it not be hoped that these questions are forever laid to rest by the   th amendment once made a part of the constitution declaring expressly that the powers not delegated to the u s by the constitution are reserved to the states respectively and if the general government has no power to alienate the territory of a state it is too irresistable an argument to deny ourselves the use of it on the present occasion    page    is it true that the stipulation with france respecting the reception of prises is exclusive  incommunicable it is doubtless so as against france but why is it so as against other nations it is however a stipulation very inconvenient  even dangerous to the u s  one which ought by all means to be excluded    it is certainly impossible for any nation to have stipulation of this kind  extent with two others at the same time however he can judge if the report is made more correct  conformable to the words of the french treaty    will it not be necessary to add an instruction that the usual stipulation respecting the ratification of the treaty of the u s be varied so as to be adapted to the participation of the senate    it seems sufficient to stipulate that the treaty shall be ratified without saying by what body or by what individuals it is to be an instruction however is inserted to allow    months for the exchange of ratifions    last page the words nor in assentive to their rights have a pencil line drawn thro them tis certainly best to obliterate them the less commitment the better    this had been decided before  in addition hamilton wrote on the same sheets the following note omitted in both editions of hamiltons writings though a treaty of commerce like that contemplated in the report ought not to be rejected if desired by spain  coupled with a satisfactory adjustment of the boundary  navigation yet ought not something more to be attempted if it were only to give satisfaction to other parts of the union some positive favourable stipulations respecting our grain flour  fish even in the european dominions of spain would be of great consequence  would justify reciprocal advantages to some of her commodities say wines  brandies to this jefferson replied by letter as follows thomas jefferson mar        george washington mar        th jefferson will be glad if the secretary of the treasury will state the specific proposition he would have made to spain on the subject of our fish grain  flour to wit what he would ask  what propose as an equivalent the following considerations will of course occur to him  st if we quit the ground of the most favored nation as to certain articles for our convenience spain may insist on doing the same for other articles for her convenience and i apprehend that our commissioners might soon be out of their depth in the details of commerce  nd if we grant favor to the wines of spain portugal  france will demand the same  may create the equivalent the former by laying duties on our fish  grain the latter by a prohibition of our whale oils the removal of which will be proposed as the equivalent   from the original in the virginia historical society   cf with heads of consideration ante pp  0     and with the first state of this paper on page     the prominence given in this edition to all papers concerning the moot question with spain is due to the immense importance it had in a national sense by its influence upon the whole tide of western development by its being the true unifying influence throughout the south which gave the democratic party its enduring support from that quarter and finally by its personal bearing on jeffersons political career the question had been from its very origin sectional being in truth the only one which drew a distinct line of cleavage between north and south in the period between      and      jefferson in his alienation of northern sentiment by his attitude towards the capital the bank and general financial policy of the government had lost all apparent support from that section of the country and in the south patrick henry jeffersons greatest political foe had constituted himself the champion of the almost united southern and western demand for the freedom of the river certain to end the political career of any aspirant to national office as jays practically had been who should show any lukewarmness in pressing the claim of the right of americans to the free use of that river only by realizing the importance of this matter veiled as it was in the actual party conflicts of the day is it possible to understand the constant recurrence of the question till triumphantly ended by the purchase of louisiana   mr short is desired to purchase this book at amsterdam or paris as he may not find it at madrid  when it shall have answered the

having had under consideration the expediency  extent of a convention with spain to be established with respect to fugitives from the united states to their adjoining provinces or from those provinces to the united states reports to the president of the united states the inclosed analytical view of the motives  principles which should govern such a convention and the project of a convention adapted thereto which he is of opinion should be forwarded to messrs carmichael  short with powers to treat  conclude thereon to this washington replied george washington mar         thomas jefferson mar         the president of the united states has attentively considered the project of a convention with the spanish which was submitted to him by the secretary of state and informs the secretary that the same meets with his approbation the president however thinks it proper to observe that in perusing the beforementioned project some doubts arose in his mind as to the expediency of two points mentioned therein—the one relative to instituting a civil instead of a criminal process against forgers who generally if not always are possessed of little property the other respecting the unlimited time in which a person may be liable to an action by expressing these queries the president would not be understood as objecting to the points touched upon he only wishes to draw the secretarys further attention to them and if he upon reconsideration think it right for them to stand upon the present footing the president acquiesces therein   this is the completed project of the foregoing paper and was sent to the u s commissioners to spain with the following letter thomas jefferson april         philadelphia hamilton philadelphia april         gentlemen —my letter of mar    conveyed to you full powers for treating with spain on the subjects therein expressed since that our attention has been drawn to the case of fugitive debtors  criminals whereon it is always well that coterminous states should understand one another as far as their ideas on the rightful powers of government can be made to go together where they separate the cases may be left unprovided for the inclosed paper approved by the president will explain to you how far we can go in an agreement with spain for her territories bordering on us and the plan of a convention is there stated you are desired to propose the matter to that court and establish with them so much of it as they approve filling up the blank for the manner of the demand by us  compliance by them in such a way as their laws  the organization of their government may require but recollect that they bound on us between two  three thousand miles and consequently that they should authorize a delivery by some description of officers to be found on every inhabited part of their border we have thought it best to agree specially the manner of proceeding in our country on a demand of theirs because the convention will in that way execute itself without the necessity of a new law for the purpose your general powers being comprehensive enough to take in this subject no new ones are issued   from s n randolphs domestic
